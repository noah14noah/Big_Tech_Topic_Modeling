According to the Bureau, it continues to build its #8216;digital intelligence expertise#8217; and #8216;active enforcement in the digital economy#8217; is now one of its primary focuses. The Bureau is also currently working on 37 digital economy related cases. Some key highlights of the Bureau's recent speech are discussed below. Price Claims and Drip Pricing. </p><p>In her speech, the Deputy Commissioner emphasized that false and misleading price claims, including drip-pricing, remains a top priority for the Bureau. As in past cases, the key drip-pricing issue for the Bureau remains where the full price of a product is not adequately disclosed upfront to consumers (i.e., consumers are charged additional fees that are not disclosed upfront, such as at a later stage in an online check-out process). In this area, the Bureau has commenced enforcement over the past several years in relation to online airfares and other online product price claims, including car rental prices and event ticket prices (see, for example: Ticketmaster Entities Agree to $4 Million Penalty to Settle Drip Pricing Advertising Case[4], $1.25 Million Settlement in Car Rental Drip Pricing Case[5] and Ontario to Mandate #8216;All-In#8217; Prices For Travel Advertising, Reflects Larger Regulatory Push For Upfront Pricing[6]). Online Consumer Reviews and Influencer Marketing. Also top current enforcement priorities for the Bureau are false or misleading online consumer reviews and influencer marketing. In this respect, the Bureau recently sent letters to close to 100 brands and marketing agencies advising them to comply with the Competition Act and also issued new influencer marketing guidelines (see: Influencer Advertising: Competition Act Compliance Now a Material Concern For Brands and Agencies[7] and Influencer Advertising: Competition Bureau Increases Pressure on Brands and Agencies to Comply with the Competition Act[8]). While ensuring that adequate disclosures are made for influencer marketing[9] is quite fact-specific and can be nuanced depending on the medium and platform, the key issue that continues to be flagged by the Bureau and international agencies is that any material connection (e.g., money, commissions or free products provide by the brand to an influencer) must be accurately and clearly disclosed. This area also includes astroturfing (i.e., false or misleading online reviews, reviews by people that have never used a product, etc.). In this respect, the Bureau notes that it has #8216;noticed an increase in organized efforts by companies to fraudulently boost their own ratings or lower the ratings of their competitors.#8217; Misleading Privacy Protection Claims The Bureau also indicates that it is also looking at potential violations of the Competition Act where the use of personal information is not adequately disclosed to consumers. In this respect, media have recently reported that the Bureau has commenced an investigation into three Canadian political parties for allegedly failing to fully divulge the scope and range of personal information collected from Canadians or how it is used (see Competition Bureau Investigates Novel Case Involving Political Parties' Collection and Use of Personal Information[10]). While the Bureau has not publicly announced whether it will seek penalties in this matter, which was initiated by a six-resident complaint filed by the Centre for Digital Rights, it states in its recent remarks that #8216;when firms make false or misleading statements about the type of data they collect, why they collect it, and how they will use, maintain and erase it, we will take action.#8217; Like international enforcement agencies, adequate disclosure of the use of personal information is also a concern for the Bureau in relation to major social media platforms. OSP (Ordinary Selling Price Claims) Finally, the Bureau indicates that the ordinary selling price[11] (OSP) area, which is related to false and misleading price claims, remains an ongoing priority. The Bureau has typically commenced one or two major cases in this area a year, with a $4.5 million penalty agreed to in a case involving Hudson's Bay in May 2019 (see: Competition Bureau Enforces #8216;Sale#8217; Sections of Competition Act, Brings Case Against Hudson's Bay[12]). Other OSP cases in the past have involved pricing claims for craft supplies (Michaels), sporting goods (Forzani), online retail (Amazon), tires (Sears) and retail clothing (Suzy Shier), among other types of products. Implications Based on the Bureau's digital marketing related remarks, as well recent enforcement and advocacy efforts, it is important for brands engaged in digital marketing to review their practices for compliance with the misleading advertising[13] and other relevant provisions of the Competition Act and Bureau guidance. ____________________ SERVICES AND CONTACT I am a Toronto competition and advertising lawyer offering business and individual clients efficient and strategic advice in relation to competition/antitrust, advertising, Internet and new media law and contest law.

These digital intermediaries will save us time by purchasing grocery items, transferring bank accounts, and subscribing to cable. The literature has only begun to hint at the paradigm shift needed to navigate the legal risks and rewards of this coming era of automated commerce. This Article begins to fill that gap by surveying legal battles related to contract exit, data access, and deception that will determine the extent to which automated assistants are able to help consumers to search and switch, potentially bringing tremendous societal benefits. Whereas observers have largely focused on protecting consumers and sellers from digital intermediaries' market power, sellers like Amazon, Comcast, and Wells Fargo can also harm consumers by obstructing automated assistants. Advancing consumer welfare in the automated era requires not just consumer protection, but digital intermediary protection.</p><p>The Article also shows the unpredictable side of eliminating switching costs. If digital assistants become pervasive, they could gain the ability to rapidly direct millions of consumers to new purchases whenever a lower price or new innovation becomes available. Significantly accelerated consumer switching--what I call hyperswitching--does not inevitably harm society. But in the extreme it could make some large markets more volatile, raising unemployment costs or financial stability concerns as more firms fail. This new kind of disruption could pose challenges for commercial and banking regulators akin to those familiar to securities regulators, who deploy idiosyncratic tools such as a pause button for the stock market. Even if sellers prevent extreme hyperswitching, managers may strategically prepare for hyperswitching with economically costly behavior such as hoarding liquid assets or forming conglomerates to provide insurance against a sudden exodus of customers. The transaction-cost-focused literature has missed macro-level drawbacks.</p><p>The regulatory architecture reflects these scholarly gaps. One set of agencies regulates automated assistants for consumer protection and antitrust violations but does not go beyond those microeconomic inquiries. Nor do they prioritize strengthening digital intermediaries. Regulators with more macroeconomic missions lack jurisdiction over automated assistants. The intellectual framework and regulatory architecture should expand to encompass both the upsides and downsides of digital consumer sovereignty.</p><p>TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION I.

Adding More Macro to Trade Regulation CONCLUSION</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>The world's largest companies, including Apple, Google, and Microsoft, are racing to develop artificially intelligent butlers (AIs). They aim to allow consumers to outsource the tasks of opening a new bank account, locating cheaper laundry detergent, and finding the highest quality groceries. (1) By way of illustration, a consumer might at any moment receive a phone alert from her AI. The subsequent conversation could unfold as follows:</p><p>SIRI. As part of my regular monitoring of your spending, I have located an opportunity to save money on your phone bill and on your grocery bill each month. Would you like to hear more?</p><p>CONSUMER Tell me about the phone bill.</p><p>SIRI. Based on your monthly data usage and the performance of the networks where you spend most of your time, you can receive comparable service through Sprint at $140 less per year. Let me know if you want to hear more. Or, if you would like me to switch your account, place your thumbprint on the phone.</p><p>The imminent technological possibility that machines could take over most of the consumer's purchase process calls for a reexamination of the framework for market intervention. This Article expands on the literature beginning that undertaking in three main ways. The first is to show the broader legal reforms and intellectual shifts that would help AIs to reduce transaction costs. (2) Today, even when competing products are available at the click of a button, shoppers regularly fail to locate the best deal. (3) People simply may not want to spend the time clicking on various sites and calculating the differences. Sellers also make shopping more difficult by burying the lowest price option in the second page of search results, where few look, or by hiding costs through fees or add-on products, such as expensive printer ink. (4) The recent scholarship on digital intermediaries has largely focused on preventing technology firms from adding harm--which they might do by directly manipulating users or indirectly exercising market power over sellers. (5) Consumer harms from sellers' behavior toward AIs have received less attention. (6) But consumers are also harmed when, for instance, sellers deceive the AI into giving bad advice to the consumer or prevent AIs from having full access to market data. Counterintuitively, consumer welfare may depend on even powerful technology companies benefitting from the types of laws traditionally deployed to protect consumers.</p><p>Part of the challenge in seeing the need for such policies may be a limited sense of the potential magnitude of efficiency gains. (7) Before Ronald Coase's contributions to law and economics, models assumed an absence of transaction costs. (8) The modern high-transaction-cost paradigm results from generations of Nobel Prize-winning work by Coase and others showing that real-world markets instead face high transaction costs that impede switching, including from information asymmetries and behavioral biases. (9) Those intellectual contributions have made models more accurate but have also normalized high transaction costs because it has proven difficult to improve markets meaningfully as long as consumers still play an active role. (10) Through that lens, an observer would see the opportunity for significant market improvements but would not be surprised by markets with minimal searching and switching. With an alternative baseline of automated markets, minimal searching and switching should prompt inquiry into potential AI barriers. In other words, the intellectual framework for automated commerce should recognize that through AI protection laws, real markets can move closer to those in discarded pre-Coasian models.</p><p>The Article's second contribution is to expand upon the downsides associated with AIs, and with hyperswitching in particular. Once they take hold, AIs could potentially constitute a new form of disruption by collapsing firms more quickly, reaching a larger portion of the economy, and extending uncertainty longer. Assume, for instance, that the above digital advice to switch cell phone carriers was given by Apple's Siri, which operates about 54% of mobile operating systems. (11) If a quarter of Siri's customers were to switch cell phone carriers upon locating savings, this would amount to a mass exodus of customers from several large Fortune 500 companies, such as Verizon and AT&amp;T. But the cell phone carrier benefitting from that advice could lose in the next round of advice. Mass departures are more likely if the AI market follows that of other highly concentrated digital markets such as smartphones, in which Apple and Google together provide 99% of mobile operating systems. (12)</p><p>To be clear, extreme hyperswitching may never occur in many industries. Besides the possibility that entrenched firms will strive to prevent it, markets also have some inherent limits, such as capacity constraints on sellers' ability to service large numbers of new customers on short notice. (13) But given the stakes, as AIs gain influence, other companies like Citibank, AT&amp;T, and Clorox may need to prepare strategically for the possibility of hyperswitching--and some have already begun to do so. (14) Predictable moves include forming conglomerates to diversify revenues; hoarding cash or other liquid assets to provide insurance in case revenues drop; and colluding with other firms on price so that AIs have little basis to redirect consumers. Those changes are important to consider because they implicate policy decisions, and they could significantly lessen the efficiency gains that motivate regulators and scholars to design laws empowering digital intermediaries. (15) Thus, even if hyperswitching never arrives, large companies' fears of it could reshape industrial organization, capital markets, and the economy.</p><p>Another set of downsides relates to the volatility that could result if extreme hyperswitching materializes. Numerous scholars have concluded that financial technology innovation poses a threat to economic stability. (16) That literature has extensively analyzed automated stock trading but has yet to explore the related risks of consumer AIs in any sustained manner. (17) Yet byproducts of consumer financial activity, like stock market volatility, have contributed to the nation's largest financial crises. By many accounts, mortgages (and the financial instruments derived from them) triggered the Great Recession. (18) Also, \"[b]ank runs are the Achilles' heel of banking,\" (19) and as the Great Depression loomed, customers panicked that their money would disappear, causing them to try to withdraw their funds. (20) AIs create the possibility of a new type of bank run--one that is technologically coordinated rather than driven by panic--if they were to direct millions of consumers to switch banks in pursuit of higher interest rates or a better smartphone interface.</p><p>Outside of finance, business failures can signal beneficial competition. If business distress is widespread enough, however, hyperswitching could produce sizeable costs, such as unemployment expenditures. Additionally, taxpayers have spent billions of dollars bailing out distressed industries, such as automobile manufacturers. (21) Although the merits of such bailouts can be debated, since the Great Recession scholars have increasingly concluded that events in the real economy have a stronger link to financial crises than was previously understood. The costs of government expenditures on industry volatility, and the risks of broader crises, are currentiy omitted from policy analyses of AIs.</p><p>None of this should be taken to predict any particular sequence of events or to estimate the magnitude of hyperswitching. The task of financial stability regulators and scholars is not necessarily to predict the next crisis, or even to make the case that any trigger is likely to cause a crisis. Although there is little doubt that \"there will be another crisis,\" (22) it is impossible to know beforehand the chance that any particular innovation will serve as the trigger, and many identified risks will never materialize. (23) Instead, the task is to improve risk monitoring, which includes minimizing theoretical blind spots. The brightest scholars and most revered financial regulators have too often resisted close examination of new triggers that (inevitably) appeared unlikely and unfamiliar until they caused a crisis. (24) Hyperswitching shares sufficient characteristics with past crises to, at least, merit consideration in a regulatory framework necessarily invested in identifying speculative threats to financial stability. (25)</p><p>This discussion of downsides reveals a paradox: regulatory failures to help automate markets could have unintended stability benefits. If so, one response could simply be to do nothing and thereby allow sellers and misguided laws to stifle AIs. Although that path forward cannot be ruled out as the best option, it also has risks. Without legal reforms, AIs would be more dependent on working with sellers, which would facilitate the cooptation of potential consumer allies into agents for rent maximization. In the alternative, the absence of a deliberate and informed AI policy enables AIs to shape the law to their preference. In theory, by helping people make better decisions, AIs bring markets closer to \"perfect competition,\" an influential law and economics concept that motivates many laws. (26) When policymakers have acted deliberately based on those models, they have supported digital intermediaries, such as by seeking the disclosure of machine-readable data from both private entities and public agencies. (27) Moreover, several of the ten richest U.S. companies also have the motivation and capabilities to lobby for pro-AI policies. (28) Thus, policymakers are unlikely to prevent AIs' ascendancy simply by ignoring them because AI developers can make a strong intellectual and political case for their importance. Instead, it makes sense from both a theoretical and practical standpoint to develop more accurate models for understanding the direction in which powerful forces are moving markets. If nonaction is to be the policy choice, it should be deliberate and informed.</p><p>The Article's final contribution is to show that the regulatory framework could be updated for a more comprehensive treatment of automated commerce. Coase's objects of analysis, like the objects of many who succeeded him, were largely microeconomic and largely in the real economy, such as the appropriate location of a factory or the function of individual cattle and crop markets. (29) Those concerns have largely remained intellectually disconnected from the more macroeconomic and institutional downsides identified in this Article, such as contributors to recessions, managerial decisions about corporate finance, the speed of market intermediaries, and the volatility of firm failures--issues that are more the purview of financial regulation. (30) Financial regulation and its macroeconomic concerns have long stood separated from other areas of legal scholarship, (31) while law and economics has mostly focused on microeconomic topics. (32)</p><p>The regulatory framework reflects this academic separation. The primary regulator of AIs and the real economy, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is charged with consumer protection and antitrust but does not have a macroeconomic stability or significant financial regulation mandate. (33) Unlike trade regulators, financial regulators pay great attention to the speed of the stock market and the asset structure of firms, due in part to the belief that when one large bank fails, \"the world's financial system can collapse like a row of dominoes.\" (34) The oversight of AIs is, in short, hindered by regulatory and analytic paradigms that have yet to adjust to modern markets that are far more technologically and financially intermediated than at the time of Coase. (35)</p><p>The Article is structured as follows. Part I provides an overview of AIs and distinguishes between marketplace AIs such as Amazon, which double as sellers of consumer products, and informer AIs such as Google, which may solely provide information. Part II considers how firms might prevent AIs from taking hold and the laws that can block that behavior. A range of behavior by incumbents--including colluding on prices, excluding AIs from crucial data, and making it more difficult for consumers to exit--might undermine consumer switching.</p><p>Part III then discusses the possibility that AIs, when widely adopted, might produce significant macroeconomic costs and risks. The inquiry looks at both the financial economy and the real economy, drawing on historical turbulence of the Great Depression, the Great Recession, stock market flash crashes, and the high-profile bankruptcies in brick-and-mortar retail. Part IV concludes by considering the implications. Market analyses should assume that welfare-enhancing hyperswitching is possible and use slow switching as a signal of possible barriers to more efficient markets. Greater accuracy could also be obtained by factoring in the costs from either hyperswitching volatility or the inefficient managerial moves that such a possibility will cause. From a policy perspective, there is a need to bring more micro, real-economy factors into financial regulators' systemic risk analyses. There is a corresponding benefit from bringing more macro and financial factors into trade regulators' transactional analyses. Specific tools, such as prudential stress tests of hyperswitching disruption, regulatory monitoring of AIs, and a stock-market style pause button for AI mass advice are also considered. A more complete diagnosis of AI commerce points to concrete reforms of the regulatory state that could safeguard an economy increasingly steered by automated processes.</p><p>I. AN OVERVIEW OF AUTOMATED COMMERCE MARKET DYNAMICS</p><p>The market foundations are in place for AIs to take over significant portions of consumer switching. Scholars predict that soon AIs will \"us[e] data to predict consumers' preferences, choosing the products or services to purchase, negotiating and executing the transaction, and even automatically forming coalitions of buyers to secure optimal terms and conditions. Human decisionmaking could be completely bypassed.\" (36) Already, internet intermediaries' convenience has proved alluring, despite shortcomings. Millions of Americans shop online through Amazon despite the fact that they could save money by combing through other websites' options or visiting stores in person. (37) Paypal holds over $13 billion in customers' accounts, including in the money-transfer app Venmo, despite the fact that those deposits would not be insured if Paypal were to fail. (38) People are delegating ever more personal tasks to algorithms, such as finding the best driving path (39) and deciding which Facebook post to view. (40) Robo-advisers are investing billions of dollars on behalf of consumers through automated trading. (41)</p><p>This Part provides a taxonomy of the two basic types of AIs--informers, like Google, and marketplaces, like Amazon. Both categories will generally be marked by a common set of traits: continual searching, delegated automation, network effects, and scientific personalization.</p><p>A. The AI Business Model</p><p>Given that data is now one of the most valuable assets in the world, AIs could make money solely by collecting, analyzing, and selling the data they collect from transactions. There are two main models likely to unfold: the informer model of Google, Microsoft, and Apple, and the seller-adviser model of Amazon. The key difference is that Google, Apple, and Microsoft do not sell most end goods or services apart from some core subset of technology products. To be clear, Google, Apple, and Microsoft are not completely neutral parties. European antitrust officials have ruled, for instance, that Google crushed direct competitors--other information websites--by essentially erasing them from search results. (42) Classification as an informer does not mean that an AI is completely neutral and unbiased in the information it provides, nor that it will always serve consumers' best interests.</p><p>But Google does not earn a cut of the price paid when a consumer ultimately purchases a product after using a Google search, and it does not receive direct payment for placing certain search results above others (unless clearly marked as advertisements). Google can earn considerable revenues solely through collecting data and selling advertisements. Additionally, many consumers will continue to make decisions for some product categories. (43) For those remaining human-driven purchases, which will inevitably amount to a substantial portion of the economy, Google's AI will be able to use a model analogous to its search: return the AI's recommended short list of product options and then include a clearly marked \"advertisement\" product listing alongside. Concerns will arise about informers skewing seemingly objective digital advice to favor advertisers. (44) But informers could deploy a business model that does not immediately benefit from prioritizing one seller over another or from influencing the consumer to pay a higher price (45)</p><p>Amazon, in contrast, is more of a marketplace in that it has taken steps to sell an array of goods and services to consumers. It can also earn money from data, like Google. But unlike Google, it gets a cut of the consumer's ultimate purchase on items sold by third parties and all of the purchase price on its own goods. As a result, it has a direct monetary incentive to ensure that the consumer pays a higher price, especially on the products it owns and the services it provides. (46) It also has an incentive to direct consumers away from products sold outside the Amazon marketplace, such as those exclusively sold at Walmart or independent manufacturers. Google is far more disinterested than Amazon, from a direct revenue perspective, as to whether consumers go to Walmart, Amazon, or some other seller to purchase a given item or service.</p><p>Both models have competitive advantages. Amazon may undermine informer AIs by refusing to sell its goods to them or using laws to block access to its prices. (47) But AIs' success will depend on being seen as neutral, which favors informers. It is possible that one of these models will win out or that both will operate in substantial coexistence.</p><p>B. Common Features</p><p>AIs will continuously monitor for better deals, autonomously spend on behalf of consumers, widely leverage network effects, and scientifically tailor advice. An AI's success in pursuing these features will help determine its ultimate market share, societal benefits, and need for regulation.</p><p>Continuous help. AIs will offer the option of monitoring market developments continuously. Some digital intermediaries today provide a version of this service. Google Flights, for instance, offers to \"track prices\" for a specific itinerary, sending emails when prices drop. (48) Eventually, AI customers should be able to choose whether to enable a similar feature for many other categories of spending. The AI then will look for new products and market developments nonstop. The customer will be able to decide how often to receive alerts. This feature can save consumers considerable time searching, as it would otherwise be necessary to regularly check thousands of sites to find the best option.</p><p>Delegated automation. Even if consumers know there are better market options, they may not switch due to the burden of decisionmaking or the time it takes to change their behavior--such as opening and closing accounts. (49) For many transactions, AIs will enable consumers to delegate the ultimate decision and switching to the assistant. This delegation makes it more likely that they will benefit from the market's best offerings.</p><p>For a large portion of consumers, convenience is one of the most important factors in shopping, and consumers are willing to rely on automated transactions to advance convenience. Automated renewals have long existed for subscriptions, a practice that has moved from print magazines to various online services, such as Netflix and Apple Music. (50) Physical-goods subscriptions are also proliferating, led by Amazon's \"Subscribe &amp; Save\" service, which sends a set quantity of household goods at regular intervals. (51) Such services are a growing part of Amazon's sales, and other companies are rolling out similar functions. (52)</p><p>A key part of this feature will be the ability to open and close new accounts. Online companies like BillFixers and JustOnePay already offer similar account management services, including handling excess fees, payments, new account openings, and cancellations. (53) Those services, however, still rely on human help. (54) The next step will be for the AI to take over the entire purchase process on an ongoing basis in categories where the consumer delegates authority, such as keeping the food supply stocked. The AI will decide where to buy the products, evaluate their price and quality, and update the consumer along the way or give preapproval notifications if preferred. As the \"tectonic plates underpinning the business world [shift] from the transactional economy to the subscription economy,\" (55) consumers will become more accustomed to being less actively involved in more of their expenditures.</p><p>Network effects. In most digital markets, the more people use a product, the more valuable it becomes--a dynamic known as a network effect. (56) Facebook, for instance, is far less attractive if almost nobody you know uses it, but once your friends and family participate, the site has much more to offer. In a weaker kind of network effect, shopping assistants will benefit from having more people using them. More people will provide more data to analyze and will hone predictions. It will also increase the algorithm's ability to identify similar consumer patterns in subsets of its customers, thereby providing better advice. (57)</p><p>Network effects will shape AIs' development in important ways. The AI landscape is likely to mimic other digital markets' extremely high concentration, in which as few as two or three companies capture the bulk of the market. Google drives 89% of internet searches, Facebook reaches 95% of young internet users through its various products, Amazon has 75% of book sales, and Microsoft and Apple supply 95% of desktop operating systems. (58)</p><p>This expected AI concentration could, in theory, be market specific. A number of digital intermediaries currently focus on a specific market, such as travel or finance. (59) It is possible that an AI dominating finance, such as NerdWallet or Mint, could be different from an AI capturing the market for retail goods and other products.</p><p>A more likely possibility is that a small number of AIs will reach crossmarket dominance. As Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote recently, describing a cross-market model, \"Your phone should proactively bring up the right documents, schedule and map your meetings, let people know if you are late, suggest responses to messages, handle your payments and expenses, etc.\" (60)</p><p>Moreover, the big technology companies already have a head start that would be difficult for smaller companies to overcome. Hundreds of millions of iPhones have Apple's AI, Siri, which is regularly used for basic tasks like setting appointments or reminders. (61) Amazon's Alexa can already order pizza or an Uber by voice command. (62) These and other AIs are already sitting on troves of data relevant to consumer spending. Due to network and winner-take-all market advantages that this data will provide, the convenience of dealing with a single AI, and the ease with which large tech companies can make acquisitions of any startup competitors, it would not be surprising if two or three of the existing big tech companies ultimately direct the future of automated commerce.</p><p>Scientific personalization. After consumers voluntarily provide AIs with passwords to their various online accounts, and after serving a given consumer for long enough, AIs can access extensive personal data, including past transactions, web searches, and social networks. Many consumers will also consciously help the assistants improve by providing input, whether through a five-star rating system or spoken reactions like, \"Siri, next time I buy hand soap remind me to choose one that has moisturizer.\"</p><p>With these rich personal data points, the assistant will then scan millions of other customers' purchases and reviews, including those available online, which would take too long for a human to peruse. The extensive personal data will enable the AI to prioritize the reviews and habits of consumers with similar profiles. Already, many companies successfully use similar tools to heavily customize recommendations. Facebook leverages extensive knowledge about our networks and prior clicks to display news tailored to our interests. (63) Services such as Pandora and Netflix receive subscribers' input and use it to make future recommendations. (64)</p><p>The AI will also learn over time through experience by training on the vast data repositories of consumers' personal transactional histories. (65) For instance, machines might analyze only the first five years of a consumer's purchases in a ten-year database to predict what happened in the last five years. If a given prediction is incorrect, it can be adjusted and tried again millions of times, until the algorithm learns the predictors of changed behavior for that consumer.</p><p>The AI can then test such algorithms on small subsets of their millions of consumers, who become regular participants in real-world experiments. Moving forward, consumers would be able to benefit not only from their own past mistakes remembered by their AI but also from those of other consumers with similar tastes. (66) People have always looked to others for ideas on what to buy and how to find the best deals, and AIs make it possible to leverage millions of consumers rather than two or three friends.</p><p>Shopping assistants thereby combine the wisdom of crowds, the power of information technology, and the precision of scientific methods into an iterative learning process. As a senior Google executive described it, the company's algorithms \"should know what you want and tell it to you before you ask the question.\" (67) Once an AI becomes capable of saving people time and money, in addition to knowing what they want to buy better than the individual, it could gain enough broad appeal to drive large portions of annual national consumer spending.</p><p>II. THE UPSIDES OF AI PROTECTION</p><p>Laws will influence the extent to which consumers delegate spending to AIs and how much that delegation improves consumer welfare. Since the consumer-related literature has focused on the regulation of digital intermediaries, this Part considers how the law can support AIs in the face of resistance from current product market leaders. (68) Such AI protection, which can be situated within the dominant paradigm for market regulation, will also influence whether the informer AI business model exemplified by Google wins out over the marketplace model of Amazon.</p><p>A. The Theory Supporting Digitally Perfected Competition</p><p>From a policy perspective, AIs' appeal lies in their potential to reduce barriers to perfect competition. In so doing, they could save consumers considerable time and money, as well as boost the economy. Because the transactional efficiency gains would be enormous, it would make sense for policymakers to support laws that strengthen AIs. (69)</p><p>1. The Policy Push Toward Perfect Competition</p><p>Few ideas have had greater influence on the law than Coase's observations about transaction costs. Transaction costs lack a universally supported definition, but I use them here to refer to the time and resources needed to find and execute a purchase. (70) As a simple example, consumers spend both time and money just to visit grocery stores to learn which products and prices are available.</p><p>In the 1960s, Coase pointed out what is now broadly understood to be correct, that pervasively adopted analytic models were flawed because they assumed zero transaction costs. (71) In the real world, transaction costs are substantial. (72) Moreover, he argued that this mistaken assumption of no transaction costs had led to incorrect legal analysis. (73) Since this revelation, generations of scholars have emphasized the lowering of transaction costs as the highest priority in designing legal rules. (74) Removing transaction costs benefits society by increasing efficiency. (75)</p><p>The Coasian paradigm shift forms part of a larger series of law and economics developments. An assumption of zero transaction costs is one of the features of perfect competition, an early theoretical market structure that has heavily influenced economic modeling. (76) By adopting laws that reduce transaction costs, policymakers move real-world markets closer to the hypothetical model of perfect competition. Neoclassical economists believed that perfect competition was better for consumers, because they pay the lowest prices and benefit from maximal choice among attractive products, and better for society, due to improved economic welfare from market efficiency. (77)</p><p>Subsequent work illustrated and expanded the extent of the gap between real markets and perfect competition. Perfect competition also assumed that markets supplied sufficient information for consumers to make effective decisions. George Akerlof, among others, challenged this assumption by pointing out that in the used-car market buyers know that lemons exist, but many are unable to tell which cars are the lemons due to information asymmetries. (78) Consequently, the market fails to adequately reward those who sell higher-quality cars, making buyers and sellers worse off. (79) These developments contributed strong law and economics support for the view that regulation may be warranted when \"imperfect information has produced noncompetitive prices and terms.\" (80)</p><p>Behavioral economics research challenged a different longstanding assumption: rationality. Traditional law and economics theory assumed that consumers make rational decisions, roughly meaning decisions that advance consumers' interests given the options available. In recent decades, building upon the work of psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, researchers have shown that people instead make systematic errors. (81) In one influential experiment that implicates switching, Kahneman and Tversky created a laboratory setting with zero transaction costs and randomly assigned participants to have either mugs or money with which they could purchase mugs. (82) Whether the participants started with the mug had a heavy influence on the price at which they were willing to transact. Whereas the Coase theorem would have predicted that about 50% of the participants would trade, only 10% did so. (83) While the precise reasons for people's actions are often unclear and behavioral economics is still developing, (84) psychologists have begun to show how people tend to estimate poorly, have excess confidence in their decisions, and face difficulties processing even basic numerical decisions. (85) These diverse human decisionmaking shortcomings can prevent transactions that would not only be in those decisionmakers' best interests but could also increase efficiency. A range of scholars have, as a result, offered the law as a means to lessen the harms from irrationality. (86)</p><p>2. AIs as Agents of Perfect Competition</p><p>Although the prospect of moving toward perfect competition has animated policy reform for decades, the results have been disappointing. Despite prices and products available at the click of a button in the information age, the evidence suggests that \"[c]onsumers often fail to choose the best price because they search too little, become confused comparing prices, and/or show excessive inertia through too little switching away from past choices or default options.\" (87) Although information technologies lowered some types of transaction costs and information asymmetries, (88) there is little evidence that these pro-consumer innovations have kept up with firms' ability to strategically profit from exploiting switching costs, information asymmetries, and decision biases. (89) As a result, even if the decision not to search may be rational for any given consumer, consumers often pay considerably more than they would if markets were closer to perfect competition. Various studies have estimated that consequently consumers pay 8% more on cell phones, (90) almost 40% more on credit cards, (91) and 22% more even on basic goods such as aspirin. (92)</p><p>Part of the problem is that it still takes considerable quantitative skills and time to visit various websites, locate the right product at each website, and create mathematical equations to compare complex pricing packages. (93) Amazon does not allow users to sort by the price per unit, instead requiring people to look through hundreds of items to find the best unit price. (94) One study found that in highly commodified electronic parts markets in which alternative prices were a click away, consumers paid 6-9% higher prices because sellers were able to make product comparison difficult by including longer descriptions and requiring extra clicks to determine shipping fees. (95) Companies have also continued to find ways to hide costs, such as airlines charging for carry-on luggage or manufacturers lowering the price of a printer while charging more for ink cartridges. (96) By making it more difficult to compare the overall price, such as the lifetime cost of purchasing a given printer, sellers are able to make consumers less attuned to the full price they pay. (97) Overall, the time and energy needed to find the best deal still discourage comparison and switching even in the information age.</p><p>Legal interventions aimed at providing people with the information they need, or behaviorally nudging them toward better decisions, have often failed. (98) This is at least partly because consumers tend not to use this new information or respond to this behavioral nudge as policymakers might expect. (99) Legislators are also reluctant to intervene in ways that reduce choice, out of concern that doing so would infringe on consumers' liberty interests. (100)</p><p>Given the failure of past technological and policy interventions, why would AIs be any different? It is by no means certain that they will be. But as I argue below, the law has held back digital intermediaries' ability to help consumers. Thus, with the right legal framework in place, AIs could very well adapt to fast-moving sales strategies at a speed that bureaucrats or lawmakers cannot. Additionally, by allowing the consumer to opt out of most of the decisionmaking and transaction processes, AIs could remove many of the barriers left in place by prior generations of digital intermediaries.</p><p>To see further why significant AI benefits are a theoretical possibility, it helps to understand more about how AIs would interact with some key current barriers to perfect competition. A diligent consumer might look at five products on average before making a purchase, but AIs could look at thousands. Unlike the consumer, the AI would easily factor in a reasonable estimate of future costs of the ink cartridges, durability, and repair expenses, drawing on data from millions of other consumers who have made printer and ink purchases in the past to provide this consumer with a sophisticated, full comparison of different printers over the course of a consumer's life. A manufacturer whose products have consistently proven more expensive despite a lower initial printer purchase price would see sales plummet once the AIs came to that conclusion. The possibility of losing future sales could then deter such practices.</p><p>AIs could help even with traditionally sticky products. Getting a mortgage quote and applying for a credit card have historically meant filling out large volumes of paperwork. More than two-thirds of credit card applications are denied, which discourages applications. (101) These time investments for uncertain results help explain why consumers often take out credit cards with an initial offer of a low teaser rate, intending to switch later but ultimately staying put even when they could save considerably by moving to a credit card with lower rates and fees. (102) The burden of research, application, and analysis helps explain why almost half of prospective home buyers get only one mortgage quote and why most are slow to refinance, potentially costing them tens of thousands of dollars in higher rates. (103) Due to various fees for early termination and installation, the costs of switching Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can be in the hundreds of dollars, not to mention the considerable time that would need to be spent to switch. (104)</p><p>Market-specific digital intermediaries like Credit Karma have stated their intention to use their knowledge of an individual consumer's credit score, income, and other information to predict with close to 100% accuracy whether a credit card company or lender will accept a given application. (105) As Quicken Loans put it in a recent Super Bowl ad, the company seeks to do for loans what \"the Internet did for buying music and plane tickets and shoes ... PUSH BUTTON GET MORTGAGE.\" (106)</p><p>Perhaps most important of all is that AIs can remove the need for consumers to do anything other than say \"yes.\" Research suggests that a small amount of time needed to transfer an account can serve as an unexpectedly high barrier for consumer switching even when the consumer may have a strong preference for a different product. (107) By all but removing the need to think or act, AIs will raise consumer protection questions to ensure that the consumer is not being misled by the intermediary. (108) Assuming the downsides are managed, however, the consumer welfare and efficiency advances are potentially enormous. (109) The dominant legal paradigm today--which prioritizes reducing transaction costs--would, in theory, support legal reforms that make those AI advances possible.</p><p>B. Legal and Market Battlegrounds</p><p>The law of automated commerce is relatively new, evolving, and under-theorized. It is uncertain the extent to which the intellectual framework supporting AIs will translate into real-world policies. Early signs have been mixed, with key U.S. policymakers showing support for AIs but advancing the law more slowly than their counterparts in other countries. (110) The laws governing four types of business behavior will have especially great influence on AIs' ability to reduce transaction costs: data access, customer exit, obfuscation, and collusion.</p><p>1. Data Obstruction</p><p>Access to data is crucial for AIs to help consumers shop, but sellers can block digital intermediaries from obtaining data. The law can help in different ways, depending on whether the data in question is general (product-specific) or personal (customer-specific).</p><p>Product information. Counterintuitively in the information age, businesses can block access to market information that exists openly on the web, such as Amazon's or airlines' prices. To give up-to-date advice, AIs would need to monitor price and product changes on various websites, a process called scraping. (111) Online sellers have used the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and other laws to forbid third parties from digitally collecting such information. (112) Autoslash, for instance, is a third-party service that reportedly helped lower rental car prices by about 25% by alerting customers when prices were lowered. (113) Two of the leading rental car agencies, Enterprise and Avis, concluded that the service was harmful to their business and refused to let Autoslash show their car availability. (114) The information is freely available on the web, but without approval, Autoslash--a small startup--risks getting sued by large corporations.</p><p>The laws used to block access to information were not intended to do so. Instead, lawmakers adopted the CFAA, for example, to deter website hackers. (115) As a result, the use of such laws to deter AIs rests on shaky legal and intellectual grounds. (116) Some of the more recent cases suggest that courts are becoming more skeptical of companies, such as Ticketmaster, Oracle, and LinkedIn, which are blocking third-party access that might help consumers. (117)</p><p>Additionally, large companies won the early, prominent data-restriction cases mostly against resource-deprived startups, like eBay's victory against the now-defunct Bidder's Edge. (118) If a larger company desired data access, the result could be different. Amazon reportedly regularly scrapes competitors' prices without court challenge. (119) It is possible that more deep-pocketed informer AIs could overcome the remaining shaky legal barriers to data access.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the law is not AIs' last option. Consumer participation may provide an avenue outside the legal process to obtain data. Millions of consumers send real-time prices to GasBuddy, which then helps drivers across the nation know which nearby gas station offers the best deal. (120) Microsoft, Apple, or Google could require users to share purchase information as it passes through phones or computers as an alternative means of AI access.</p><p>Despite these possible technology- and market-driven developments, AIs' surest path to data independence would be through courts refusing to continue to allow misappropriated laws to block access and through legislatures passing new laws to promote access. Pre-digital era disclosures are common. For instance, many states have laws requiring stores such as Target and Walmart to post price per unit on the shelves to make it easier to compare differently sized items. (121) Laws compelling sellers to provide data to AIs would advance related goals of facilitating price and product comparison.</p><p>Personal data. Customer-specific data will be crucial to tailoring advice and will drive consumers to give AIs access to online accounts. For instance, millions of customers at Citibank, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase have given AI financial assistants like NerdWallet their passwords so that automated bots can log in and collect bank transaction records. (122) Banks responded by adapting their account systems to block the bots. (123) Airlines similarly denied online account entry to startups that wanted to help consumers manage their airline rewards programs. (124) The companies cited privacy concerns, or accidental blocking due to internal systems updates, (125) but those explanations must be viewed with some skepticism because the intermediaries pose a competitive threat.</p><p>Scholars have identified the need to address this personal data inaccessibility without regard to automated commerce. In response to consumers' difficulty in selecting the best cell phone plan available, Professors Bar-Gill and Stone suggest that cell phone carriers be required to give consumers their usage data in spreadsheet form so that third parties could advise on the plan of best fit. (126) The United States has mostly declined to compel businesses to share personal account data with third parties when consumers request such access. Congress tasked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with studying whether to compel banks to provide such information, but the CFPB decided not to do so. (127) It instead issued voluntary \"principles\" for sharing such data. (128) Those guidelines could exert soft influence, but they leave banks with great leeway to thwart intermediary access.</p><p>Other countries have taken a more active role in providing consumer intermediaries with personal account access. In the United Kingdom, some grocery stores give consumers access to their spending habits from rewards program databases. (129) Europe recently passed sweeping privacy legislation, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), that requires companies across the economy to share such information with consumers when asked. (130) Personal and general information laws may prove determinative of AIs' ability to help consumers by making it less likely that informer AIs either lose out to marketplace AIs like Amazon or are coopted by sellers to gain data access.</p><p>2. Exit Prevention</p><p>Companies might also undermine AIs by making it harder for AIs to automate consumers' departure to another company. Common past mechanisms for discouraging exit include contractual termination fees, obstinate customer service, and rewards programs. (131) In their early years, industry leaders such as Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Sprint locked consumers into multiyear contracts by imposing penalty clauses of $99 to $200 for exiting early. (132) AIs in such an industry could still dominate the choices made whenever contracts expire or a new consumer enters. But high termination fees can deter otherwise rational switching out of bad contracts--if the market fails to provide alternatives to those high fees. (133)</p><p>Companies have leveraged customer service to inflate the time and energy needed to cancel. Subscription-based services, including gym memberships and internet access, sometimes require customers to show up in person, wait on the phone for hours, or plead with an insistent employee to be able to cancel. (134) Comcast, one of the most notorious practitioners of this approach, went so far as to refuse to let a man cancel his subscription through four calls after his house had burnt down. (135)</p><p>Customer service barriers are challenging for AIs. It is likely that AIs will be able to make the phone call and wait on hold, thereby minimizing the amount of time the consumer needs to spend in exiting. But as long as a human is required to invest time to exit, such as through a contractual requirement, sellers would still be able to greatly hinder Al-driven exit, since \"research in behavioral economics indicates that even very small switching costs may prevent customers from switching.\" (136)</p><p>Rewards programs also lock consumers in, with over 2.5 billion individual program memberships existing in 2012. (137) They raise the costs of comparing various products with multidimensional rewards programs. Scholars have concluded that these practices exploit decision biases to \"hurt consumers and reduce social welfare.\" (138) The law is unlikely to restrict rewards programs, but with data access the AI should be able to analyze which credit card rewards program will ultimately save consumers the most money--the one with the $100 annual fee but a generous cash-back program, or the one without an annual fee but that offers frequent flyer miles that can be redeemed for airline tickets. To the extent consumers irrationally stay in a current account because they believe the rewards program is more valuable than it is, AIs may make rewards programs less sticky by helping consumers easily determine which program is truly in their best interests.</p><p>The law has intervened in various ways to promote customer exit. Courts have struck down excessive cell phone termination fees, and the Federal Communications Commission ultimately passed a rule to crack down on such practices. (139) At the state level, the New York Attorney General fined America Online, an ISP, $1.25 million for making it hard to switch \"by either making the cancellation process so painful for the customers that they could not bear to continue, or by simply ignoring their requests.\" (140) California requires an online cancellation option for any consumer who accepts an automatic or continuous service offer online. (141) Comcast now allows customers to cancel online nationwide. (142)</p><p>Thus, seller blocking of exit faces an uphill battle. But it may still be possible, at least in some industries and jurisdictions, for companies to insist contractually that only a human being can cancel. The legal system has yet to finish adapting customer-exit doctrine to automated commerce.</p><p>3. Obfuscation</p><p>Many sellers will presumably adopt misperception tactics against AIs similar to those they deploy for consumers. Instead of manipulating the human brain, they will seek to manipulate AI algorithms. Sellers may, for instance, rely on subtle changes in name or product across time or stores. If manufacturers were to use different names or valueless design changes for essentially the same products at Walmart and Target, it would be harder for the AI to know which store has the best deal. (143) Another related technique would be to continually introduce new product lines that reflect little if any improvement but create the perception that previous versions are now inferior. (144) Continual updates would lessen AIs' ability to use data on prior product lines to advise consumers.</p><p>It is unclear how well these strategies will work in markets with consumers relying on AI. To benefit consumers, the AIs need only improve upon consumers' ability to compare. They need not perfect the comparison process. Many consumers might outsource purchases even to confused AIs if the AIs are less confused than the consumer would be when faced with the same set of choices. The more that businesses make their products difficult to compare, the more consumers may realize they need help from AIs. In other words, business efforts to cause AI misperception by making the marketplace more confusing may accelerate consumers' reliance on AIs.</p><p>Additionally, AIs may become widespread even if they do not help consumers pay lower prices or find better products. They might instead become popular because of the convenience they provide. Or they might themselves benefit from consumers' mistaken perceptions that the AIs gave better advice. In that sense, AIs can engage in a digital version of the \"seduction by contract\" that has allowed credit card and mortgage companies to charge higher prices through complex choice architecture. (145) Choosing the right AI, and understanding its full implications, can be analogized to choosing the right mortgage or other complex product--thus allowing opportunities for overestimating the benefits to the consumer. (146) Therefore, sellers' obfuscation tactics alone will not necessarily block AI adoption, because such obfuscation will make it (1) easier for AIs to convince consumers that they need help, (2) more likely that consumers need help, and (3) more difficult for the consumer to tell whether the AIs' advice is, in fact, helpful.</p><p>Market forces aside, policymakers have generally sought to improve consumer clarity. Behavioral research spawned a multitude of policies aimed at nudging consumers to make better choices, but those policies have often been unsuccessful because sellers adjust practices quickly and consumers may not use disclosed information as intended. (147) Unlike with consumers, however, the tech companies that offer AIs will be better suited to identify the practices that are aimed at undermining AIs and articulating how they need policymakers to respond. With AIs as the target for disclosures and large tech companies as partners in identifying sellers' latest obfuscation strategies, the law may have a better chance at reducing obfuscation.</p><p>4. Collusion</p><p>Scholars have explored the antitrust implications of two or three AIs controlling the market, with the concern being that AIs might abuse their dominance. (148) Scholars have paid less attention to sellers colluding to prevent AIs from functioning. More specifically, by colluding to limit choice, sellers can impede AIs' ability to help consumers. (149) If all prices for paper towels are the same, for instance, AIs have less of a basis for recommending one product over another. Several factors would influence whether such an arrangement might come to pass.</p><p>First, more concentrated industries facilitate collusion, and industries are overall becoming far more concentrated, with over 75% experiencing an increase in concentration over the past twenty years. (150) The types of industries potentially susceptible to digital switching--banking, telecommunications, and retail--are increasingly dominated by a few large companies. (151) Second, when it is hard to start a company in a given industry, existing players can collude with less fear that a new entrant will break up their arrangement. Entry barriers have risen in diverse industries for multiple reasons, including greater market consolidation (152) and the technological investments required to compete. (153) Third, the growing use of algorithms by sellers has created new mechanisms for collusion. While the Department of Justice has prosecuted coconspirators who intentionally used algorithms to fix the price of posters sold on Amazon, (154) self learning algorithms instructed to set prices at the most profitable level could on their own deduce that collusion with competitors yields the highest profits. (155) The algorithms may do so indirectly, such as by fixing their price on an external variable that coincides with competitors' prices. (156)</p><p>Scholars have proposed updates to address new forms of sellers' algorithmic collusion. (157) But competition law has been slow to adjust to the digital era. (158) Besides the general inertia of the law, antitrust authorities are particularly reluctant to intervene in new industries out of a fear of harming innovation. (159) Those consumer-focused reforms may prove more important if sellers become extra motivated to collude out of a desire to undermine AIs. Given that AIs will closely track market prices and would arguably be harmed by seller price collusion, it is worth considering more closely how to bring AIs into the antitrust framework--not just as the targets of enforcement but as potential informants and plaintiffs.</p><p>C. Summary</p><p>Established businesses may impede AIs' benefits to consumers through a number of strategic moves. It is also possible that AIs take hold of markets solely out of consumers' desire for convenience and without actually benefitting consumers in other ways or moving markets toward the basic economic model of perfect competition. But with the right legal framework in place, AIs could significantly reduce transaction costs by eliminating searching and switching costs in some contexts. Most of the business responses discussed above are, by traditional economic accounts, inefficient: reducing information available, blocking exit, restraining competition, and engaging in wasteful product differentiation. (160) Because these activities are inefficient, the intellectual paradigm that dominates regulatory policy would support deterring as many of them as possible--assuming a viable intervention existed. (161) But even arguably the most powerful and motivated consumer protection agency, the CFPB, failed to act consistent with an intermediary protection paradigm when tasked by Congress with making a decision on the matter. In short, while the law is entirely unsettled, influential political and intellectual forces could enable AIs to bring massive reductions in transaction costs to many markets, and thereby tremendous gains to society. Those beneficial results and the path to them become clearer through a lens of AI protection.</p><p>III. THE RISKS OF HYPERSWITCHING</p><p>We often decide that an outcome is extremely unlikely or impossible, because we are unable to imagine any chain of events that could cause it to occur. The defect, often, is in our imagination.</p><p>--Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (162)</p><p>The discussion so far has addressed the underappreciated intellectual and legal shifts that would improve AIs' ability to become widely adopted. This Part turns to the downsides of AIs once they are adopted. The literature has focused on the concerns that dominant digital intermediaries might exercise monopoly power or threaten consumer protection--harms addressed by more micro-level governance of AIs. But a broader set of costs and risks, many of which require a more macro-level perspective, could result from how AIs transform the structure of markets and businesses. The goal of this discussion is neither to predict the future nor to estimate the likelihood and extent of automated consumer switching. Instead, the goal is to illuminate a set of underappreciated dynamics in the coming automation of markets. (163)</p><p>A. Hyperswitching as a New Form of Disruption</p><p>To understand why AIs might lead to unfamiliar downsides, it is instructive to consider how AIs will introduce new types of change into markets. Assume that a large portion of consumer spending is either heavily influenced by, or directly outsourced to, AIs. Assume also that almost all customers use Google and Apple AIs, (164) mirroring the markets for cell phone operating systems and matching scholars' predictions that such digital intermediaries will be highly concentrated. (165) One of the potential results is that AIs would have the ability to cause hyperswitching, that is the exit of consumers from existing sellers in a significantly faster manner than had happened in a pre-AI world.</p><p>For instance, sixty million users might receive an AI alert on their phones that a new bank is now paying a higher interest rate, with the AI offering to transfer the users' funds from their current bank to the new one. Or the next time anyone purchases a blender, the AI might reveal that one company has significantly higher satisfaction from users for the same cost. The banks holding existing funds could within a few weeks see millions of customers withdraw funds. Major manufacturers of blenders could see sales plummet.</p><p>AIs might suddenly advise a large number of consumers to move to a new purchaser for three main reasons. The first is a better price. Competitors could always try to match price decreases, and many sellers' first response would be to give up any current supracompetitive markups, thus driving down profits. Once a given market reaches something close to marginal cost pricing, however, any seller with a higher cost structure should prove unable to follow the price cuts for long without going out of business. Many industries have divergent cost structures, (166) meaning that a move to marginal cost pricing could still result in price-driven switching.</p><p>A second potential driver of customer flight is a more appealing product. Prominent examples of broadly attractive product innovations include Netflix offering streaming video or cell phones replacing landlines. Innovation can, however, come in small increments and subtler changes, such as creating a battery that lasts longer.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that an AI might have some self-interest in directing consumers to a new product. When two leading travel search engines, Orbitz and Expedia, delisted American Airlines from online searches over a dispute about increased commissions, the airline lost the equivalent of over $100 million annually and quickly caved to the search engines' demands to pay higher commissions. (167) Self-interested AI advice would run the risk of undermining users' trust, but cannot be ruled out. (168)</p><p>In theory, for these and other reasons, AIs might cause hyperswitching. Since the stakes are high, the looming threat of hyperswitching alone could change markets and industrial organization. At least one large bank has already begun emphasizing rewards programs to prevent hyperswitching. (169)</p><p>Past disruptions and industry turmoil have not generally been seen as economically problematic, and indeed are fairly common. The airline and auto industries have, for instance, witnessed the bankruptcies of several of their largest companies during short timespans. (170) The disruption most similar to AI advisers was the development of electronic commerce. Due partly to online competition from the likes of Amazon and Netflix, the retail industry has witnessed considerable institutional failures. (171) Several once-ubiquitous national retailers folded in the 1990s and 2000s, including Circuit City in electronics, Borders in books, and Blockbuster in video rental. (172) In 2017 alone, Toys \"R\" Us, Radio Shack, and Payless Shoes filed for bankruptcy. (173)</p><p>If the lack of concern about such past disruption is well-founded, it is necessary to consider how a shift to automated markets would differ from prior industry disruption. Several main differences are worth noting.</p><p>1. Lasting Disruption</p><p>The familiar disruptive innovation model, exemplified by internet retail, involved sellers deploying a new technology to lure customers away from existing firms. (174) Amazon and Netflix needed to take customers away from established retailers to earn revenues and deliver their core services--selling goods or renting videos. (175)</p><p>In contrast, replacement of existing sellers or manufacturers is not a necessary part of the AI business plan. Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri can leave all manufacturers and sellers of paper towels in place, for instance, while still inserting themselves into every U.S. transaction for paper towels. Indeed, in theory, if Google and Siri are the two dominant AIs, they could leave Amazon intact as a thriving online marketplace if they simply direct customers to purchase from Amazon whenever it offers the best option for a given end product.</p><p>Amazon may or may not be able to block Google and Apple AIs from knowing its paper towel prices or completing a transaction on Amazon. The outcome of that battle depends on legal, technological, and market issues that have yet to be resolved. (176) But for the present purpose of exploring the law and economics analysis of innovation, it suffices to recognize that AIs can layer onto an existing marketplace, and thereby help sellers with better prices or products disrupt that marketplace.</p><p>The nature of the AI disruption is thus fundamentally different from prominent previous disruptions. Past disruptions have typically involved taking market share from previously dominant firms and then leaving a stable set of players intact who control the once-disruptive technology. With AIs, holding a market leadership position would become far less certain on an ongoing basis, in part because AI advisers could rapidly redirect large portions of the market toward that newly preferable business based on small variations in price, product, or other advantages. Currently, small price advantages might not be sizeable enough to be noticed by most consumers, given information asymmetries and decisionmaking limitations. (177) Even if consumers today noticed, high switching costs may deter them from acting. (178) In a hyperswitching market, the leading firms' market shares could become regularly volatile, leaving them in a state of continual vulnerability as AIs transform small competitive advantages into major disruptions.</p><p>2. Faster Disruption</p><p>By speeding up the rate of customer switching, AIs could produce a high-speed version of the basic model for perfect competition used by generations of economists. In that model, when a firm offers a better product, consumers flock to the product. Other firms are forced to adapt their products by innovating in some way or dropping their prices. If they cannot, they go out of business.</p><p>Large increases in the speed of customer switching are easier to imagine if an AI were to capture 60% to 80% of the market share, in accordance with market dynamics and the shares of leaders in many digital services. (179) But a higher customer churn and synced advice are possible even if the AI industry were highly fragmented. If a new bank account pays higher rates than all others, presumably even ten competent and independent AIs would respond by sending their rate-focused consumers to that new bank. The bank offering the new and better account surely would not want to hide its benefits from the AIs. Already, different companies' price-setting algorithms have demonstrated an ability to sync by using the same (or an interconnected) external reference point. In one instance, the price of a book, The Making of a Fly by Peter Lawrence, ballooned on Amazon from a few dollars to over twenty-three million dollars because each of two sellers of the item had algorithmically set its price in relation to the other. (180)</p><p>For hyperswitching to accelerate disruption, large numbers of consumers must receive similar advice--if not all of them directed to the same product, then at least to different products at a new seller or group of sellers. That assumption requires examination given the modern trend toward firms personalizing products. Would advice given necessarily be the same to millions of users? The answer will likely differ by type of product. (181) But algorithms have for years openly used the purchases of similarly situated consumers to make recommendations, with Amazon telling shoppers, \"Customers who bought this item also bought ...,\" (182) On a subtler level, a recent Facebook experiment showed how social networks' algorithmic decisions can influence feelings--producing \"massive-scale emotional contagion.\" (183)</p><p>If AIs were to give similar shopping assistance to a substantial portion of a given market, hyperswitching could cause firms to fail at a faster rate than prior industry disruptions. The retail industry transformation as a result of e-commerce occurred in a relatively gradual manner for individual companies. Borders's and Blockbuster's difficulties, for instance, occurred over more than a decade. During this time, the companies launched their own online services and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy (reorganization) before resorting to Chapter 7 (liquidation). (184) The decline also was incremental in the sense that different retailers closed at different times and often began by closing some subset of stores each year. The cumulative job losses were substantial, but the economy absorbed the turmoil of any given retailer failing in a more isolated manner. (185) Creditors and investors could also adjust and limit their exposure as firms slowly lost customers. (186)</p><p>In contrast, in the face of hyperswitching, firms might lose large portions of their consumers not over the course of many years but over the course of months, weeks, or even days. To be clear, any given market's transition to faster switching would happen gradually, as consumers slowly adopted AIs. (187) But once a critical mass of consumers were following AI advice in a given industry, without changes to the basic capital structure that most firms adopt today, firms could rapidly become unable to pay their bills and struggle to stay in business. (188) Insolvency will be even more likely if AIs succeed in driving prices closer to marginal cost, as would be expected if they remove existing sources of overcharge from switching hassles, information asymmetries, and behavioral limitations. (189)</p><p>Some consumer product markets could thereby become more like stocks, in the sense of being subject to sudden sizeable market swings. (190) Of course, unlike with stocks, some firms gaining sales might struggle to accommodate too large an influx of customers on shorter notice. (191) But AIs would be expected to accelerate switching, and the possibility cannot be ruled out that they will do so to an extreme that causes firms to fail far more rapidly than in prior disruptions.</p><p>3. Larger-Scale Disruption</p><p>Precisely which industries will be vulnerable is difficult to know in advance, but clearly not all markets would be equally subject to hyperswitching. Several major categories of consumer expenditures are inherently more resistant to hyperswitching, regardless of how incumbents respond to the competitive threat. For example, the time and energy needed to move apartments likely insulates rental expenditures--about $600 billion--from drastic increases in switching. (192) Similarly, much of the $2.27 trillion in private sector healthcare expenditures is less likely to be subject to hyperswitching anytime soon, due to institutional barriers such as insurer limits on which doctors a patient can choose and employer limits on sponsored insurance plans. (193)</p><p>Broadly speaking, consumers are more likely to delegate spending to AIs for more fungible and less branded products. But fungibility is a nuanced and dynamic concept. (194) Financial services, paper, rice, and internet access are each highly fungible in the sense that the basic product is not particularly differentiated. If the download speeds for two companies are comparable and sufficient to stream movies and conduct video calls, a user is unlikely to be able to distinguish between two ISPs other than on price. (195)</p><p>With respect to brands, AIs are unlikely to sway consumers away from emotional attachments. But even within branded industries, some portion of the market will likely view the product as somewhat fungible. Some people care little about who cuts their hair or which manufacturer makes their jeans and socks. Others are greatly attached to a particular stylist or logo.</p><p>Further complicating the matter is that consumers often infer product quality from brands, and do so poorly. People pay over 50% more for Energizer batteries that in laboratory tests last only as long as obscure brands. (196) The typical consumer will spend three times as much for Bayer headache relief than the chemically identical store brand, even though pharmacists and healthcare professionals buy the latter for themselves. (197) Electronic commerce has already created \"markets ... with less consumer loyalty to a specific firm, perhaps due to better access to information or the reduction of other search costs.\" (198) AIs should further erode loyalty and profit in many categories by more comprehensively identifying which brands actually convey meaningful quality differences.</p><p>The discussion of brands illustrates how AIs' disruption can reach a broader array of firms, not only horizontally across industries but also vertically within a given industry. The consumer goods industry, for instance, can be divided vertically into the retailers that sell products and the manufacturers that produce them. The first generation of disruptive e-commerce companies, like Amazon, mostly lured customers away from retailers to purchase the same basic products as before. (199) AIs could do more of the same, significantly lowering online and offline retailers' profits on a sustained basis by making it easier to compare prices within and across stores. (200) Where AIs differ is in their greater potential to destabilize manufacturers, like Bayer and Energizer, by helping consumers to see that a better option is available.</p><p>Reaching manufacturing, rather than just retail, would mean AIs would have a much larger impact on the retail-goods economy. Most of the large-firm profit in the consumer sector is not in the resale of others' products but in manufacturing. Many of the retailers that folded were large and nationwide, but in 1990--before email was popular--Blockbuster and Circuit City were outside the top 100 most profitable companies in the United States. (201) More numerous in the list of the largest companies by value were manufacturers--led by Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. (202) Those companies made the transition to e-commerce, as they now simply sell their products through new online channels. (203) Additionally, some of manufacturers' profits have gradually shifted to the largest retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, which earn a considerable and increasing portion of their profits from manufacturing their own products. (204)</p><p>In terms of revenues, financial services account for roughly 7% of GDP, or $679.7 billion. (205) Retail goods, telecommunications, travel, and other potentially switchable services constitute another five trillion dollars. (206) It is also possible that trillions of dollars in business expenditures could become automated, particularly the portion controlled by small businesses. (207) AIs could destabilize on a scale unlike anything seen before.</p><p>The conclusion that AIs bring about a new kind of disruption does not, by itself, mean that AIs pose a problem. For now, the main point is that AIs have the potential to create a significantly more enduring, faster, and larger scale disruption than anything seen before. These differences make past lessons and models less relevant.</p><p>Among the considerations omitted from current analyses of automated commerce, the rest of this Part focuses on two main categories: large-scale inefficiencies and market volatility. It also explores some of the competitor responses, market adjustments, and laws that could limit hyperswitching, even in an economy driven by AIs.</p><p>B. Managerial Responses</p><p>Many plausible responses by sellers to AIs would lead to costs overlooked in current discussions. These theoretical costs would not necessarily increase inefficiency. But if they materialize, they would at least mean that automated commerce would prove less efficient than expected, even if hyperswitching made those markets appear closer to the basic model of perfect competition. Several of these costs are briefly examined here.</p><p>1. Capitalization</p><p>Market uncertainty causes real firms to \"hoard cash and cut debt to hedge against future shocks, further reducing investment and hiring.\" (208) Reasons for creating these asset buffers include the anticipation of creditors freezing them out or of sudden market shifts. (209) Increasing cash or other liquid assets would be a potentially effective defense against hyperswitching because it would enable firms to cover their day-to-day expenses for an extended period while revenues declined, thus buying time to develop new revenue-generating or cost-cutting strategies. A related alternative would be to purchase some kind of financial instrument, such as insurance, that essentially serves the same purpose of providing access to funds in the face of sudden customer exodus.</p><p>Since 2000, real economy firms have begun storing funds at unprecedented levels, with Google able to buy American Express outright and General Motors holding liquid assets equivalent to half of its overall worth. (210) Many companies surely hold excess liquidity out of a desire to purchase upstart competitors or make strategic investments. Observers have also posited that a substantial portion of this asset accumulation comes out of caution in the face of competitive threats. (211) In a hyperswitching economy, holding greater reserves or having better access to emergency funding might become even more of a competitive advantage, since reserves could defend against or fund more destructive price wars that drive less well-capitalized competitors out of business. (212)</p><p>Purchasing instability insurance or hoarding liquid assets may be a rational strategy for the firm and its executives who want to keep their jobs in the face of hyperswitching. But hoarding assets can be harmful to the economy. The more capital a firm is simply saving, the less capital is being put to productive use. Depending on the macroeconomic context, a widespread hoarding increase by firms in response to hyperswitching could be a meaningful drag on the economy. (213)</p><p>2. Conglomeration</p><p>Another possible business response to AI disruption would be for firms to diversify their operations. As an example of one company holding a diversified portfolio, General Electric grew beyond its original power generation activities into areas such as healthcare, media, and finance. (214) The leading explanations for why businesses diversify are to gain strategic advantage and to manage risk. (215)</p><p>Diversification could be particularly effective in defending against hyperswitching. A firm that sells paper towels would be less likely to fail in the face of paper towel hyperswitching if that firm had many different products--such as food and mattresses. For conglomeration to provide insurance against AI disruption, competitors' product improvements must occur at different times across the conglomerate's product portfolio. The more the products are different, the more likely any disruptions would occur at different times. Conglomeration would provide additional insulation from hyperswitching if some of the firm's products had less susceptibility to AI disruption, such as due to brand loyalty. (216)</p><p>If AIs lead to such conglomeration, it could increase business costs. Excess corporate diversification is \"widely believed to be inefficient,\" (217) although the reasons for that consensus are diverse and the support for it far from decisive. Some have found that research and development expenditures and overall innovation are lower in conglomerates, but the evidence is more suggestive than conclusive. (218)</p><p>Perhaps the clearest explanation for why conglomeration would be inefficient is the lack of specialization and increased managerial costs of running a sprawling organization whose lines of business have limited synergies. It is worth noting that the particular type of conglomeration sought in response to AIs may be even more inefficient than other types of conglomeration, in that hyperswitching firms would (a) pursue conglomeration for defensive rather than revenue-growing reasons and (b) emphasize product differences to lessen the chance of multiple products facing similar customer flight. Both motives would decrease a company's specialization more than diversification undertaken for growth and synergies in related product categories.</p><p>The strategy of diversification may make economic sense for the firm while still imposing significant costs on the economy if many managers correctly believed diversification was necessary to survive, and if the hypotheses about diversification being inefficient are correct. An efficient market in the era of AIs may thus involve higher costs from conglomeration alongside lower transaction costs due to consumer automation. If so, the standard policy analysis focused on transaction costs would omit a potentially significant variable, since it does not consider conglomeration.</p><p>3. Consolidation and Collusion</p><p>Part II discussed how collusion offers incumbents a way to block AIs from taking hold, because if all sellers offer the same price, the AIs become less helpful to consumers. (219) The incentive to collude persists once AIs dominate a market. Indeed, the incentive to collude would presumably be even greater in extreme hyperswitching markets, because price coordination would prevent an imminent threat--the potentially devastating sudden mass departure of customers--rather than a more speculative rise of AIs.</p><p>The protection that collusion affords from hyperswitching could distort markets by giving firms heightened incentives to merge. This added incentive comes from the greater ease of collusion in concentrated industries. (220) As the incentives to collude rise, the incentives to consolidate an industry would also rise.</p><p>Moreover, firms might more easily acquire competitors in AI markets: once it became clear that a seller was vulnerable to lost revenues from hyperswitching, that seller's market value would drop, making it a cheaper target. AIs thus might accelerate industry consolidation, which can undermine competition in light of antitrust regulators' difficulty in identifying harmful mergers. (221) Any increase in collusion or anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions resulting from hyperswitching would need to be added to the costs of AIs. (222)</p><p>C. Market Volatility</p><p>Some types of market volatility can impose costs on the economy, which means that incorporating those costs makes economic models of future markets more accurate. This Section considers the potential instability implications of automated markets. The inquiry begins with finance because much of our regulatory conception of harmful instability comes from financial crises, which have been a regular and destructive part of the U.S. economy since its inception. (223) The insights into systemic risk from finance will prove instructive as the discussion turns to AIs in other industries. Indeed, as the discussion will show, even if hyperswitching never causes a crisis, it could still cause volatility costs worthy of attention.</p><p>To be clear, an Al-driven future financial crisis might appear today to be highly unlikely. But the same would have been true for the major crises of the last 150 years--the Great Depression, the Great Recession, and the Flash Crash--if their particular triggers were analyzed even a few years in advance. (224) These crises each had new triggers, and as even the CEO of the largest U.S. bank recognizes, \"The trigger to the next crisis will not be the same as the trigger to the last one--but there will be another crisis.\" (225) The discussion in this Section is animated by a recognition that a key task of financial regulation is to move \"unknown risks\" to \"known risks,\" (226) and that observers have in the past often missed the possibility of known market changes triggering financial crises. The purpose is thus to broaden the currently narrow set of theoretical factors weighed in developing regulatory policy as commercial transactions become more automated--and in many regards more like finance.</p><p>1. The Structure of Past Financial Instability</p><p>Financial stability predictions are informed by a risk factor analysis, drawing on historical experience. (227) Even decades after a crisis, experts often disagree about the precise triggers and how much they mattered. But three major features of past financial crises have particular relevance to AIs: (1) a massive flight from large financial institutions, (2) product innovation, and (3) a link between finance and the real economy. (228) All these features were apparent in the most recent crisis, the Great Recession, and some of them contributed to the Great Depression and the \"Flash Crash\" of 2010.</p><p>(a) The Great Depression. Between 1929 and 1932, the value of stocks listed in the New York Stock Exchange dropped by 83%, and the United States plunged into a devastating depression that left a quarter of the workforce unemployed. (229) The Great Depression witnessed the \"classic example of systemic risk,\" the bank run. (230) Millions of people panicked about the safety of their money held by banks, which caused them to withdraw deposits. (231)</p><p>These withdrawals triggered a chain reaction of bank failures. (232) A sudden, unexpected mass departure of business from a bank is immediately problematic because banks normally only have a small amount of liquid reserves on hand, historically less than 5% of what they owe to customers. (233) Banks invest the rest to earn revenue, such as by making loans. If too many customers seek to withdraw money the bank does not have, the bank may fail. (234) Bank runs in the Great Depression illustrate the danger of contagion, a consistent theme in major financial crises. Contagion can be defined as \"an indiscriminate run by short-term creditors of financial institutions that can render otherwise solvent institutions insolvent.\" (235)</p><p>Another contributor to the Great Depression was money scarcity resulting from both bank runs and the stock market crash. People refused to lend, invest, or deposit because they trusted neither banks nor businesses in the real economy to stay afloat. (236) Since so much of the business world depends on access to funding, this hesitation deprived society of a vital resource, deepening and extending the economic harm. (237)</p><p>(b) The Great Recession. The financial crisis of the late 2000s, also known as the Great Recession, \"crushed the real economy and cost countless people their jobs, homes, and businesses.\" (238) Real estate played a similar role in this episode to bank runs and stock speculation in the Great Depression. (239) Over the several years leading up to the crisis, millions of Americans bought houses that they could ultimately only afford as long as real estate prices continued to rise. (240) When real estate prices dropped, homeowners began to default in record numbers, and individual banks proceeded to lose tens of billions of dollars in mortgage-related financial instruments. (241)</p><p>By 2008, the typical large bank owed money to many different institutional customers, including other banks and hedge funds. (242) As it became clear that large investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers would suffer considerable losses as a result of toxic mortgage securities, hedge funds and other large institutions began withdrawing billions of dollars from those banks to avoid the risk of losing their money if the banks failed. (243) Investors also became concerned that banks would fail and bring down investment funds with them. Investors thus began to pull out their money from a diverse set of institutions, leading not only to a stock market crash but a freeze in the supply of credit. (244) A massive government bailout likely prevented a depression, but the collective losses were substantial. (245)</p><p>Product innovations laid the foundations for the subprime mortgage meltdown and its subsequent effect on the financial system. Subprime loans often involved payment schemes that started at a reasonable rate and then after a few years ballooned to a level that the borrower could not afford. (246) Additionally, financial institutions transformed the mortgages into diverse financial products by dividing up their payment streams and repackaging them into various new forms of securities. As U.S. Comptroller of the Currency John Hawke described it in 2004, \"Derivatives trading, hedging, securitization, credit scoring, and structured finance, which are all routine parts of banking today, were exotic or nonexistent 30 years ago.\" (247) These new products, which originated in consumer spending, increased systemic risk. (248)</p><p>(c) Flash Crashes. Technological innovations over the past several decades have increasingly contributed to stock market crashes. (249) Automated trading has accelerated in recent years, fueled by algorithms that buy and sell stocks or other securities in a billionth of a second, without any human involvement. (250) These algorithms, also called robo-investors, can scan news re leases and make trades in a split second, before a human could begin to read. (251)</p><p>The most dramatic technology-driven stock market swing came in May 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,000 points in a few minutes, wiping away almost a trillion dollars in value. (252) Perhaps more alarming, it was not clear for months that the cause was the interplay of large investment funds' trading algorithms. (253) The spark was a single firm that had made the highly unusual decision to sell off a large position--$4.1 billion in futures contracts--as fast as possible. (254) Even a few years earlier, that selloff would have taken hours if not days to complete, but in 2010 it was executed in minutes. (255) As the selloff began and triggered a drop in the price of the futures contracts, other robo-investors saw opportunity and bought. (256) Because the selloff was larger than expected, however, the price kept dropping, which caused a computerized panic in which the algorithms believed they were taking on too much risk and sought to sell. (257) That massive selloff, through tens of thousands of moves within minutes, created a downward spiral of stock prices that became known as the Flash Crash. (258)</p><p>One key feature of the Flash Crash was the increase in systemic risk due to the interplay of many different firms' algorithms, each of which shared some basic decisionmaking criteria. (259) It was only when an automatic five-second pause was imposed that the trading began to stabilize. (260) Numerous other flash crashes, including one that led the Nasdaq to suspend trading for three hours, have occurred in recent years, and by some accounts crisis has been averted only through interventions. (261) Flash crashes illustrate how the convergence of finance, technology, and fragmented actors can increase systemic risk, leaving regulators lost as to how to respond. (262)</p><p>Despite variation in and debates about the causes of financial instability, several basic observations can be distilled from these three historical examples. Financial institutions risk failing if they rely on volatile resources to remain solvent. The failure of large financial institutions can cause a domino effect that takes down the economy. Furthermore, markets--rather than merely institutions--play a key role in systemic risk. (263)</p><p>More concretely, history shows the dangers of regulators missing how microeconomic developments can trigger macroeconomic crises. Financial regulators failed to foresee microeconomic consumer behavioral dynamics that could cause large shifts in financial markets, such as panicked withdrawals of funds even from solvent banks and problematic mortgages. Financial regulators also failed to monitor nonfinancial changes such as real estate prices and algorithms used in trading.</p><p>2. Financial Product Instability</p><p>This account of past financial instability is relevant to AIs because they are a microeconomic, consumer-level, technological development originating outside of finance with the potential to shift a large amount of funds within the financial system. AIs promise to expand access to a consumer financial innovation--automated advice on everyday transactions--in a manner analogous to how innovative mortgages and their derivatives became far more widely available leading up to the Great Recession. (264) Before the latest wave of digital intermediaries, financial advice was limited to a higher-income portion of the population that could afford it. (265) AIs aim to extend that financial advice to anyone with internet access. (266) The innovation of automated advice is layered onto an array of end product fintech innovations for borrowing, holding, and transferring money. (267) Moreover, unlike twenty years ago, consumers today can widely open, use, and close financial accounts online. (268)</p><p>Widespread automated advice, along with the new possibility of opening and closing accounts online, provide the foundations for AIs to produce mass withdrawals of funds from large financial institutions like those seen in the Great Depression and Great Recession. The motivation for the withdrawal of funds would be different--in a hyperswitching context, more informed and rational customers could exit in pursuit of product features, such as higher interest rates, rather than the fear that their bank could collapse. But the effect could be similar, since banks today still have only a small portion of liquid assets on hand to pay depositor demands. Regulators have not needed to worry about such sudden withdrawals because since the Great Depression, retail deposits have been marked by an absence of switching, thanks in part to the federal government's guarantee on deposits. (269)</p><p>The scale of potential bank withdrawals is relevant to systemic risk. Consumers and small businesses--the prime customers for AI advisers--account for 46% of banks' profits. (270) For some of the largest banks, like Citigroup, well over 60% of revenues come from consumer banking and credit cards--sectors that could be subject to digital switching. (271) Thus, a large portion of big banks' profits, not to mention funds that they have lent out that may not be immediately available, are at risk of flight.</p><p>The more difficult question is what portion of those deposits AIs might drive elsewhere in a short amount of time. Some consumers would presumably not delegate to AIs the ability to change bank accounts. Also, banks are attempting to make their services sticky through automated payments and reward programs. But unlike many other products and services, money is more fungible and thus more difficult for any financial institution to personalize. People might have different preferences with respect to whether they receive higher interest rates rather than lower monthly fees. But given the basic fungibility of credit, a subset of financial institutions--whether fintechs or recent entrants into retail banking such as Goldman Sachs--could attract large portions of the market if they have lower cost structures or other competitive advantages, such as innovative apps or higher yields earned by investing deposits.</p><p>Although such scenarios are unlikely and unpredictable, so are the scenarios that financial regulators routinely analyze to prevent crises. The Federal Reserve regularly conducts stress tests, or modeling exercises of doomsday scenarios, as part of systemic risk regulation. These tests provide another perspective on the relevance of hyperswitching. A recent test indicated that the largest U.S. banks are sound because during a prolonged recession they would lose on the order of $526 billion in revenues over several years. (272) That figure is considerably less than the $4.7 trillion dollars in annual revenues that Goldman Sachs estimated are vulnerable to financial technology challengers--known as fintechs--stealing clients by offering more innovative products and mobile banking services. (273)</p><p>Moreover, the Fed stress test typically assumes that large banks essentially retain their basic consumer market shares, meaning that they regain prior revenue levels as the economy recovers. (274) The tests do not simulate the sudden loss of many customers who may never return. If hyperswitching hit a single large bank particularly hard, rather than being generally distributed across the industry as in the Federal Reserve's stress tests, (275) investors and creditors would be expected to withdraw funds and raise the bank's cost of capital. (276) Broader liquidity constraints could follow. The loss of direct customers and concern by other financial actors could collapse one or more systemically important financial institutions, threatening the financial system through a consumer algorithmic contagion not currently factored into stress tests that are intended to model speculative and dangerous future scenarios. (277)</p><p>3. Real Economy Turbulence</p><p>What might be the implications of extreme hyperswitching in the real economy? A risk analysis of large firm failures leading to harmful turbulence is a familiar part of the financial regulatory framework but absent from market regulatory analyses of the real economy. (278) As demonstrated by the case of retail disruption in the face of e-commerce, the real economy can undergo widespread firm failures and upheaval without prompting crises. It is nonetheless worth examining hyperswitching's volatility implications even in markets outside finance, given that AIs are disruptive in new, far-reaching ways that intersect with past crises and recent scholarship.</p><p>Although an increase in firm failures can signal robust competition that brings social benefits, the turnover can bring social costs. As a concrete example, the government spends hundreds of billions of dollars as a result of unemployment. (279) If hyperswitching causes more rapid business failures, any additional equilibrium unemployment costs would add currently overlooked inefficiencies. (280)</p><p>Bailouts are another governmental expenditure that could result from real markets in turmoil. Most recently, starting in 2008, Congress extended a bailout package of about $80 billion to General Motors (GM) and Chrysler, two of the \"big three\" U.S. automakers. (281) Economist Jeffrey Sachs supported the automakers' requests for a bailout in front of Congress by testifying, \"Lehman Brothers triggered the biggest worldwide crisis in generations. Don't do it again with this industry.\" (282) Despite failing to prevent reorganization bankruptcy, the bailout may have shielded the economy from greater volatility. GM and Chrysler successfully emerged from bankruptcy as profitable businesses, which some scholars believe prevented greater economic harm. (283) Regardless of the merits of Sachs's crisis argument, the fact that a combination of political and intellectual forces can bring about a large taxpayer bailout for the real economy means that extreme hyperswitching could lead to costly bailouts. Again, these theoretical costs--along with any from hoarding liquid assets, conglomeration, collusion, and other sources--do not necessarily outweigh the theoretical benefits of lowering transaction costs. But they are potentially sizeable enough to factor into the cost-benefit analysis of pro-AI policies.</p><p>Might there be legitimate financial stability implications of real economy firms failing due to Al-driven demand volatility? Recent research has given greater reason to believe that the real economy implicates financial instability. Before the Great Recession, local real estate market prices were viewed as sufficiently uncorrelated to minimize the risk of a national housing bubble, and mortgage markets were not seen as subject to contagion. (284) The crisis revealed that various financial innovations linked these markets in destabilizing ways, prompting scholars to undertake broader studies of the interplay between the real economy and economic downturns. For instance, economists have found that uncertainty in the real economy can drive economic downturns. (285) Investors and creditors may respond to real economy uncertainty by freezing up the flow of money available to real economy firms out of concern that it is too difficult to know which will fail. (286)</p><p>If hyperswitching created an inability to predict future profit per sale and total sales in some markets, (287) it could create uncertainty about which real firms would fail. Real economy hyperswitching is not tied to financial markets in the same way that housing is--through mortgages. But most large firms are intricately linked to financial markets through various loans and securities. Just as investors were overly optimistic about the houses underlying mortgage-backed securities leading up to the Great Recession, many believe that excess optimism fuels investors' high valuations of the stock market today. (288) Stocks are securities whose underlying asset is a business, analogous to how mortgage-backed securities are based on houses.</p><p>A sudden dissipation of large amounts of firms' revenues due to hyperswitching could prompt a loss of investor confidence. If that loss of confidence spread widely enough across capital markets, it would lead to a credit freeze, or reluctance to lend money, which has had destructive effects on the economy and exacerbated past economic downturns. (289) As a theoretical matter, a hyperswitching economy could cause instability and a drop in the value of firms in ways analogous to how the fall of housing prices and surprising unpredictability of payments on mortgages destabilized financial markets in the Great Recession.</p><p>Hyperswitching in the real economy has other similarities to past financial crisis triggers. The acceleration of purchase decisions is one. By way of illustration, between 2000 and the Flash Crash of 2010, the average length of time that stocks were held fell from eight months to under a minute. (290) Unlike stocks, most goods and services in the real economy cannot practically shift in microseconds. But large companies with a steady stream of purchases nationwide could within seconds see their sales fall drastically. More to the point, once markets learned of a pending hyperswitch going against a given company, that company's valuation could instantly plummet. By speeding up the pace of commerce, AIs may directionally transform the real economy in ways similar to how algorithmic trading has already altered stock markets: by injecting extra volatility and decreasing the amount of time that regulators have to respond.</p><p>AIs also make real product markets more like financial markets by increasing the chances of \"herd behavior.\" (291) Bank runs and stock market panics have exhibited asset withdrawal contagion, in which the acts of some subset of the population heavily influence those of many others. (292) AIs can more closely link consumer choices by, for instance, passing a deal discovered by one consumer on to millions of others. (293)</p><p>A key consideration in gauging the instability risks of real economy hyperswitching is the potential scale. The larger the pool of volatile assets in the economy, the greater the potential risks of a crisis. (294) As noted above, trillions of dollars annually are potentially vulnerable to some level of hyperswitching--amounts that exceed annual real estate expenditures. (295) Which of these markets will reach a level of problematic volatility, rather than beneficial turbulence, is unknowable at this point. Given the many ways that markets will respond, and the heterogeneity of markets, the chances of some kind of a real economy-wide AI contagion sparking a crisis should be assumed to be extremely low--as should be assumed for an Al-driven bank run.</p><p>But highly unlikely risks animate economic stability regulation. Accordingly, scholars have produced a chorus of generalized warnings since 2008 that the financial system has become far more dangerous, akin to a tinderbox in danger of being lit. (296) They point to the increased risk from faster financial transactions, steady financial complexification from innovation, growing potential for financial contagion, and greater interconnectedness among financial institutions. (297) Those discussions seldom mention specific triggers, and when they do they hem more closely to recent crises by, for instance, focusing on the expansion of automated financial trading or new types of mortgage securitization. As a result, the literature rarely challenges deeply embedded assumptions on market activities thought to be safe, such as bank accounts or everyday consumer spending. That literature nonetheless provides the foundations for understanding why hyperswitching, if it were to materialize, could provide a spark to a precariously interconnected financial system that has left regulators behind.</p><p>Unlike more micro-oriented consumer protection and antitrust regulation, financial stability regulation cannot wait for a clear problem before beginning preparation. Most specific forecasts will be wrong, and the correct ones will almost always appear wrong in advance. Nearly all experts, if asked in 1920 about the likelihood of widespread bank runs, or in 2005 about the likelihood of a mortgage crisis, would have dismissed any such concerns as speculative--and indeed, some did. (298) Despite great uncertainty about how it will unfold, the concept of hyperswitching merits attention in instability conversations because it sits at the intersection of real-world market developments, broad scholarly warnings, and historical crisis lessons.</p><p>D. Limits to Hyperswitching</p><p>Interspersed throughout this Part and Part II have been a number of obstacles that might prevent hyperswitching from ever occurring. Sellers have many tools to prevent hyperswitching or mitigate its effects. Some of these tools are potentially procompetitive, such as product customization, which could bring consumers better products but makes it less likely that a large portion of the market will receive the same advice at the same time to leave a given seller. Other tools are more clearly anticompetitive, such as all sellers colluding to set a common price above marginal cost or blocking data access through misguided laws. Many responses would simply add to the overall cost of doing business, such as forming conglomerates or purchasing disruption insurance.</p><p>Additionally, markets have inherent limits on the magnitude of hyperswitching. Any one company favored by the AI might, for instance, have a difficult time accommodating a sudden large increase in customers. An inability to ramp up manufacturing fast enough could mean turning away many potential customers, who might then stay with incumbents. Some service industries would also be particularly difficult to ramp up, since airlines would be slow to acquire new airport gate access and restaurants can only seat so many people during the dinner rush. Sellers might respond to that scarcity by increasing short-term prices, which could lower demand.</p><p>Just as these obstacles to hyperswitching are numerous, so are the many ways that AIs and markets might respond to them. Even in an industry with highly customized products, a single, large company could offer the full array of customized choices and thus rapidly capture the market due to a lower cost structure or better customer service as determined by the AI. (299) Moreover, consumers may rely more on AIs as deciding among a larger number of customized products becomes increasingly difficult and time intensive. Thus, sellers may be limited in their ability to hold on to customers through customization--and may accelerate the influence of AIs by doing so.</p><p>As for sellers' ability to accommodate sudden influxes of customers, challengers will seek new ways to increase their capacities quickly. Most industries are shifting to a rapid order fulfillment model. (300) The rise of automation and part-time, on-demand workers is making it more feasible for a company to fulfill large increases in demand, since the company can obtain the modular labor that competitors no longer need. (301) Incumbents could reverse that labor trend by, for example, locking suppliers or workers into longer term contracts to limit challengers' ability to ramp up capacity. But those moves risk increasing costs overall and could accelerate the incumbent's collapse by making it more difficult to match Al-driven drops in customers with decreases in costs.</p><p>Additionally, the seller might digitally provide the AI with the number of new customers that can be accommodated over a specific period of time, such as 10 million new customers every quarter, as capacity is ramped up. At that point, hyperswitching would become a race between the challenger's speed at growing capacity and the incumbent's speed at convincing the AI to change its advice. In the meantime, however, capital markets will be assessing the likely winners of that race, and investors' judgement could be swift and devastating for the loser.</p><p>E. Summary</p><p>Space constraints do not allow for a full treatment of these and the many other market dynamics that will influence the development of hyperswitching and result in changes to demand curves and capital markets. But the discussion above began to sketch a set of relevant factors. These include the level of concentration among AIs, consumers' reliance on AIs for making decisions, the AIs' ability to execute the switch from one seller to another, the fungibility of sellers' products, the variation in cost structure among businesses, and the feasibility of quickly ramping up manufacturing or services. As more of these are present in a given product market, AIs' will have greater power to direct a large number of consumers toward new businesses.</p><p>If extreme hyperswitching occurs, a separate set of factors will determine the extent of its downsides. The threat of hyperswitching could impose nonsalient costs on the economy if businesses respond by holding more liquid assets, forming inefficient conglomerates, pursuing excess mergers, colluding, or closing often enough to increase unemployment expenditures. The chances of hyperswitching encouraging a crisis or recession would be influenced by the size of the revenue stream that companies might lose, the speed of that loss, the links with the financial system, and the level of investor and creditor panic.</p><p>To reiterate, hyperswitching is not inherently problematic. The benefits are more concrete than the downsides. And even if major downsides materialize, the economic magnitude of the benefits may still outweigh them. But analysis of AIs is not a simple binary question of good or bad. From a policy perspective, the best path forward may be to embrace hyperswitching, but with an eye toward monitoring risks and minimizing costs. For that to happen, it is not enough to simply assume that markets will take care of the problem--the responses will be too dynamic on both sides to rest assured of any particular outcome. As a result, analytic models and the regulatory architecture should be updated to minimize automated commerce blind spots--tasks taken up in the next Part.</p><p>IV. IMPLICATIONS</p><p>The great uncertainty surrounding AIs' future means that little can be said with great confidence about the need for any particular intervention today. It is nonetheless clear that the law and economics paradigm requires expansion to include the full set of factors relevant to developing policy. Even with a more comprehensive view of the downsides, policies strengthening AI informers, such as legislation granting data access and preserving exit, appear promising. It is also clear that the regulatory architecture is in need of adjustments, as the current disconnect between macro- and micro-focused authority will weaken oversight of automated markets.</p><p>A. Shifting the Paradigm for Consumer Switching</p><p>To prescribe market interventions correctly, it is necessary to recognize the full benefits and costs of adopting any particular policy. The current paradigm makes it harder to identify interventions that may increase the benefits and decrease the costs of automated markets.</p><p>1. Recognizing the Upsides of Automated Switching</p><p>We should expect powerful consumer-enhancing AIs to exist. The technological capabilities are arriving for AIs to guide us through shopping like they already do for driving and to execute the transaction should we wish. There is also widespread embrace of the idea that the law should reduce transaction costs, and law and economics scholars have sometimes referred in passing to the possibility that the previous generation of digital intermediaries can help. (302) The intellectual and real-world foundations are thus in place for a shift toward embracing a pro-AI paradigm.</p><p>Despite these foundations, strong intellectual currents run counter to AIs. Besides general concerns about the influence of big technology firms, decades of influential scholars--including Coase, Danny Kahneman, and Amos Tversky--exposed the law and economics paradigm as greatly underestimating various transaction costs in the real world. More recently, legal scholars have persuasively demonstrated the persistent failures of mandated disclosures and other behavioral law and economics interventions. (303) Against the backdrop of these important intellectual contributions, the idea of eliminating significant categories of transaction costs is arguably now a fanciful and outdated concept--akin to discredited paradigms such as the Ptolemaic placement of the Earth as the center of the universe. (304)</p><p>As paradigm shifts often do, the recognition of transaction costs as a core aspect of markets may have gone too far. Ironically, as scholars have over decades gradually adopted the more realistic high-transaction cost assumption, technological developments have made it more relevant to study the absence of some categories of transaction costs. What may be needed to understand the potential impact of broad pro-AI policies is a model close to those used before Coase--albeit updated for the many economic insights since then.</p><p>These refinements would need to be incorporated into formal, product-specific, and in-depth modeling of hypothetical market interventions. Part II indicated several categories of promising laws. The most immediately appealing of these to explore are laws that ensure AIs can access the general product- and customer-specific data they need to help consumers. Sellers' current use of the law to freeze the flow of readily available data runs counter to the longstanding consensus in law and economics that good legal interventions should generally remove market information asymmetries, not create them. (305) Sellers have managed to keep transaction costs high in part by blocking intermediaries' access to such information. A straightforward first step would be for judges to end the current practice of allowing sellers--such as large banks, rental car companies, and Amazon--to misappropriate laws, such as the CFAA to block digital intermediaries from accessing data freely available online. (306)</p><p>Laws mandating that sellers release product data, such as machine-readable pricing, also appear to offer benefits. Such laws are unnecessary for many online sellers that already post such information online. But it is cost-prohibitive for digital intermediaries to collect price and product information from brick-and-mortar sellers.</p><p>There is some empirical evidence that law and economics theory applied to digital intermediaries can produce meaningful real-world results. Several years ago, I drew on basic concepts of market imperfections to make the case for regulation requiring large retailers to make information available in digital form. (307) Although the argument was at the time theoretical and lacked real-world evidence, Israel passed such a law requiring grocery stores to make price data digitally available. A recent study found that prices dropped as more consumers used comparison websites powered by that data, with the law ultimately saving shoppers 4% to 5% on average. (308) Given those findings, and the theoretical foundations, it is worth at least experimenting with information access laws in the United States.</p><p>The final category of data access laws needed for AIs relate to personal account data. Europe passed such laws on the basis of a consumer right to that access. (309) But scholars have proposed similar laws based on law and economics analyses. (310) Assuming these laws would not discourage otherwise valuable information collection, U.S. lawmakers and regulators should consider taking similar action. Some consumer protection agencies, such as the CFPB, have the ability to pass relevant rules in their regulated industries but have yet to act. (311) Despite embracing the role of digital intermediaries, regulators have remained more focused on regulating consumer businesses than supporting consumer intermediaries.</p><p>Another set of high-stakes laws involves customer exit. Economic theory provides support for preserving AIs' ability to cancel accounts if a consumer has delegated such authority. This inference flows from the importance of exit in markets. (312) Nationwide legislation like that in California, requiring an online cancellation for services allowing online subscription, also seems sensible. (313)</p><p>More important than any particular proposal is updating the intellectual framework so that observers are more likely to identify market problems that AIs could solve. If the default assumption is that high switching costs are inevitable even after \"significant\" reductions, then evidence of current high transaction costs is nothing surprising--and nothing that should prompt reform: it would be expected that consumers remain tied to Amazon for ordering products online and rarely switch bank accounts.</p><p>On the other hand, if the default assumption is instead, as it should be, that virtual assistants could considerably lower switching costs, regulators would view minimal switching from Amazon or Citibank as worthy of attention. That reaction would prompt them to analyze more closely the dynamics that inhibit switching. While the lack of switching could be due to benign factors such as affection for the brand, the analysis could identify the set of court challenges, anticompetitive practices, and technological barriers that firms deploy to thwart or capture digital intermediaries.</p><p>Ultimately, policymakers that take AIs seriously would be animated by a set of top-level inquiries: Why is there no service that allows people to compare prices across online and brick-and-mortar retailers--a kind of Google Maps for shopping that would tell us how we can save the most money and spend the least amount of time? Why are digital intermediaries unable to close accounts on our behalf if we so choose? More importantly, what policies will move us toward such services?</p><p>Pro-AI policies would be difficult and complex, requiring a host of other laws overseeing AIs--including antitrust and consumer protection. But the current default assumptions about markets obscure awareness of overlooked anticompetitive dynamics that merit analysis and intervention.</p><p>2. Recognizing the Full Downsides of Automated Commerce</p><p>The previous Section's emphasis on the full upsides of AIs is relevant to reforms that would bring more immediate societal benefits. This Section's discussion is more relevant to future stages of automated markets, the seeds of which are being planted today. The animating concern here is that dispersed legal actors might promote pro-AI policies to an extreme or that powerful firms such as Amazon might technologically build automated markets that suit their interests, without policymakers understanding the full costs and risks. Algorithms' ability to speed up consumer decisionmaking is, for instance, correctly viewed as their \"most basic advantage.\" (314) But it is also important to recognize the potential for that speed to create risks of market volatility and to prompt inefficient managerial responses. Even if pro-AI policies are still warranted, the failure to factor the downsides into any policy analyses makes it less likely reforms will include safeguards such as mechanisms for monitoring market volatility.</p><p>How necessary is it to consider the downsides given the unpredictability of how automated commerce will develop and the many ways that markets might mitigate hyperswitching? Oddly, this is one area where policy incompetence could bring unintended benefits. There are many reasons why the law may inadvertently prevent extremes of automated commerce. Lobbying efforts by sellers or gridlock in Congress could help prevent pro-AI policies, or at least policies that would help AIs to act in consumers' best interests. Although such a policy \"failure\" (from the typical transaction cost perspective) may reduce consumer welfare in the short term, it would have an unintended upside of lessening the risks associated with hyperswitching. AIs coopted by the leading sellers would, after all, be less likely to shake up the industry by recommending that consumers move to an innovating start-up seller.</p><p>A problem with this unintentional insurance is that it is unreliable. The stability of the financial system should not rest on the expectation that policymakers will be too ineffective to take action in accordance with the existing paradigm emphasizing competition. Google, Apple, and other informer AIs may win over politicians and consumers.</p><p>Thus, AIs will arrive, in one form or another, even without deliberate government policies. It is preferable to inform those developments with an expanded law and economics framework for perfect competition. The hypothetical gains from extreme consumer sovereignty must be weighed against the broader costs of the seller behavior that will seek to undermine it. (315) The concept of hyperswitching should be added to models as a theoretical outcome of a policy trajectory toward perfect competition in the automated era.</p><p>B. Redesigning the Regulatory Structure</p><p>Regulators have an important role to play in managing the benefits and costs related to digital market acceleration. Across the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush presidencies, it was widely assumed that banks would manage their excess risks because they would be the ones to suffer from any collapse. (316) After the financial crisis of 2008, however, that reasoning was widely recognized as flawed. Former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, previously viewed as \"Superman\" and god-like for his market intervention abilities, (317) admitted in 2008, \"Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity (myself especially) are in a state of shocked disbelief.\" (318)</p><p>The regulatory framework currently depends greatly on AIs' self-interest to determine the trajectory they will follow. Governance of AIs mostly rests with the FTC and (in consumer finance) with the CFPB. (319) Those agencies have a more micro-level focus on markets and individual transactions, but no stability mission. (320) Banking regulators do not have jurisdiction over AIs, but they do have jurisdiction over relevant issues such as the capital structure of firms and macroeconomic conditions. (321) As a result, no regulator is well situated to either understand or manage AIs' broader implications. Adjustments to both trade and bank regulators are needed as AIs blur micro and macro boundaries.</p><p>1. Adding More Micro to Financial Regulation</p><p>Bank regulators and scholars have begun to intensely study and warn of the systemic risks posed by technologies. (322) Regulators are also aware of history's painful lessons that \"extraordinary fluctuations have to be expected and guarded against.\" (323) However, they have paid little attention to the systemic risks of AIs outside of automated trading and robo-investment advisers. Since this inattention partially reflects an outdated regulatory structure, understanding the causes of the inattention helps indicate ways to address it.</p><p>Explanations for the lack of awareness. Financial regulators' inattention to AIs is a problem, and one reminiscent of past inability to identify crisis triggers. Prudential regulators such as the FDIC and Federal Reserve are charged with duties aimed at preventing a financial crisis, such as keeping large banks from failing, but they are not expected to predict the precise nature and timing of a crisis. (324) They have an impossible task of preparing for the unknowable. But prudential regulators have some tools to mitigate the impact of digital switching--tools that function most effectively when risks are identified in advance. For instance, prudential regulators can require banks to increase their capital on hand. (325) To best deploy those preventive measures or develop new tools, regulators must spot the risk beforehand, even if that simply means lightly monitoring its development.</p><p>There are three main explanations for the lack of prudential regulatory attention to AIs. One is that prudential regulators operate in the Coasian paradigm of assuming high transaction costs. Retail businesses--such as consumer banking accounts and credit cards--are typically among banks' most steadily profitable, \"safe and boring\" businesses that help balance out riskier commercial activities. (326) The federal government's promise to reimburse depositors up to $250,000 in the case of bank failure, through FDIC insurance, makes panicky bank runs of the traditional sense unimaginable. (327) Thus, banking regulators have had little direct reason to become concerned about the speed of customer switching in consumer finance.</p><p>Unlike prudential regulators, the SEC pays attention to the speed of retail-level transactions. The SEC governs stock market trading, which is not officially consumer finance. (328) The SEC initially lauded the advent of automated trading, until a series of flash crashes raised alarms. (329) The agency has since adjusted, and the New York Stock Exchange has paused trading to give authorities and private parties the time to course correct. (330) Unlike the SEC, the banking regulators have not had the same recent experiences in credit card and bank account markets. An inference can thus be made that financial regulators--banking and otherwise--have generally embraced technological advances that speed up transactions and reduce transaction costs, until a crisis demonstrated otherwise. (331)</p><p>A second explanation for prudential regulators' omission of digital switching lies in the disconnect between financial and nonfinancial markets. As mentioned above, the interplay between nonfinancial markets, such as real estate, and financial institutions has contributed to past crises. (332) Scholars have observed that post-crisis regulations have not gone far enough in recognizing the connection between mortgages and real estate. (333) If even that direct reflection of an immediately preceding crisis failed to sufficiently broaden regulators' nonfinancial lens, other areas outside finance like AIs would presumably face an even higher likelihood of inattention.</p><p>Third, prudential regulators pay insufficient attention to consumer transactions. This has long been the case and is a major reason why the CFPB exists. Before the financial crisis of 2008, prudential regulators also led analysis of consumer protection. But they were seen as having failed in that mission, focusing too much on preventing bank failures and not enough on consumer issues such as subprime loans. (334) The creation of the CFPB addressed the inattention to consumer protection but also institutionally separated the regulatory state's consumer-level expertise from bank-stability expertise. (335)</p><p>Finally, bank regulators lack the ability to collect information from AIs. The CFPB's authorizing statute sets it up to potentially collect nonpublic information from AIs giving consumer financial advice, but the CFPB does not have a larger systemic risk mission. (336) Consequently, regulators charged with stability are currently mostly limited to publicly available information to understand AIs' stability implications. This runs counter to financial regulation's foundational principle of obtaining information that the public does not have in order to guard against risks that private actors cannot sufficiently police. (337)</p><p>Institutional reforms to gain better understanding. The most straightforward organizational vehicle for rectifying the conceptual and jurisdictional gaps would be the Federal Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which Congress created at the same time as the CFPB. (338) FSOC has broad monitoring capabilities and is charged with identifying \"potential emerging threats to the financial stability of the United States.\" (339) FSOC could use its authority to study the development of AIs.</p><p>One advantage to FSOC monitoring of AIs is that it operates through existing financial regulators, the heads of which are voting members of FSOC. (340) Those members include the CFPB and bank regulators, which analyze financial institutions' capital structure and the implications of macroeconomic downturns. The collective expertise of the council thus bridges some of the problematic expertise silos that may impede broad understanding of AIs. (341)</p><p>FSOC monitoring of AIs has limits, however. Since the CFPB only has the ability to collect information related to financial advice, any AI that does not provide such advice would be off limits. Additionally, the CFPB could only access financially related information, and in theory only information related to consumer protection. Thus, as long as the AI were helping its customers with its advice, the agency would have limited ability to obtain data relevant to broader stability concerns. Nor could the CFPB collect information from an AI that did not provide financial advice, or from the part of the AI's business that dealt with nonfinancial considerations.</p><p>To address those regulatory information limits, it may at some point make sense for some regulator with a broader stability mandate to have the authority to collect relevant information even from nonfinancial AIs. Such authority would ensure the financial regulatory structure did not have a blind spot regarding AIs. The case for such a reform is less compelling until AIs begin to take hold of more consumer spending. The risk with waiting to pursue such authority, however, is that reforms may take too long at that point.</p><p>The stress test provides another tool for bringing AI awareness into the existing financial regulatory structure. Prudential regulators routinely conduct such tests, but at the time of this Article's writing had yet to model AI-driven disruptions. (342) Financial regulators could immediately fill that gap by making the internal policy decision to begin occasionally estimating the effect of hyperswitching when modeling doomsday scenarios.</p><p>Institutional reforms for taking action. Even with perfect regulatory information, the harder question is what should be done with any regulatory knowledge indicating that AIs pose risks. FSOC does not itself enforce or write laws but instead relies on its members to act. None of the members of the council have clear rulemaking or enforcement powers over AIs outside finance. (343)</p><p>Nor is the path to taking action clear within consumer finance. The regulators with a stability mandate lack jurisdiction over virtual financial assistants that might redirect consumers. The CFPB has some rulemaking and enforcement authority over AIs giving consumer financial advice, but only for consumer protection goals--not to lessen stability risks. Thus, regulators are largely limited to exercising their authority to require large financial institutions to increase liquid reserves.</p><p>Depending on how AIs evolve, regulators may need more than this. One example would be to give regulators a slow-down mechanism, or pause button, if advice given to tens of millions of consumers were to begin to destabilize the economy--something like the SEC's ability to halt trading on stock exchanges. (344) Or AIs might be required to build a slowdown mechanism into their recommendations under certain conditions. Even if these particular devices are not the answer, they demonstrate the kind of stopgap measures that could be adapted to AI oversight. It would be necessary, of course, to constrain the use of such tools to extreme circumstances. The NYSE's pause feature has been used rarely, giving some comfort that such awesome power in the hands of regulators can be used judiciously. (345)</p><p>2. Adding More Macro to Trade Regulation</p><p>Although the main trade regulator, the FTC, would have reason to adopt more accurate economic models for automated markets, structural changes to the agency are not justified solely on what is known about automated markets. Unlike financial regulators, trade regulators are not tasked with identifying and managing improbable future risks to the economy. Nor are they necessarily expected to protect AIs, outside of antitrust concerns, although an argument could be made that they should do so. (346) This Section nonetheless considers what eventual trade regulatory architecture might be needed in an era of automated markets.</p><p>One way to conceptualize the impact of automated markets is that they may eventually make some real economy markets more like financial markets, in the sense of moving massive revenues around suddenly. Real firms may also become more like financial firms in their behavior and risk profile. One clear example of this financialization is firms' holding of large cash reserves, or other liquid assets, to guard against risk. (347) Federal regulation has for over a century required banks to have such liquid resources on hand to weather depositor defaults or recessions. Another example of potential convergence would be trade firms' diversification of product lines to prevent failure. Although trade firms may utilize diversification in other ways, the more they seek to diversify their core products sold due to trade volatility, the more their business model begins to approach that of financial firms, such as fund managers' diversification of portfolios to manage risk. (348)</p><p>The legal institutions for the real economy, such as bankruptcy law, are not set up for the type of challenges faced in finance. (349) The FTC has mostly consumer protection and antitrust authority. (350) Unlike bank regulators, the FTC does not (1) seek to ensure economic stability; (2) regularly collect nonpublic information about regulated firms' internally risky behavior; (351) or (3) consider whether the firms it regulates have adequate capital reserves to withstand market turmoil, or related devices such as \"living wills\" to unwind smoothly in the case of failure so as to minimize the chance of requiring a taxpayer bailout. (352)</p><p>If real firms become more like financial institutions in terms of their economic-stability implications, financial regulation may offer a blueprint for reform. The FTC could adopt some version of these various tools--stress tests, monitoring, capital requirements, and so on--albeit scaled down due to the lesser risks posed by real economy firms. For instance, if mandatory capital requirements were seen as necessary for real firms to guard against stability, regulators could conduct some kind of stress test analysis for crucial sectors of the real economy, akin to those conducted for big banks. The actual levels of capital required would presumably be significantly lower for real firms, and most would presumably not require any as long as their failure would have limited repercussions.</p><p>Since each of these oversight mechanisms is a routine part of the financial regulatory framework but foreign to the trade regulatory framework, an alternative to expanding the FTC's tools would be to expand the jurisdiction of financial regulators to cover nonfinancial firms. Greater coordination across trade and financial regulators is needed, in any case, because the real economy and financial economy are increasingly intertwined in influencing stability. (353) Expanding prudential regulators' authority to cover AIs for stability purposes and macroeconomic efficiency analyses may provide a superior regulatory option in the face of extreme hyperswitching.</p><p>The choice between financial and trade regulators should consider whether AIs ultimately advise on both financial and nonfinancial matters, as would be more likely, or are compartmentalized. Assuming companies' AIs, such as Siri and Alexa, did become trusted advisers for all consumer transactions, it may make sense for financial regulators to lead any stability-related oversight of such companies. After all, the lead regulator would need to understand the implications of financial recommendations for large banks. Once financial regulators were conducting some kind of AI monitoring for stability, known as an \"examination\" in banking, it would be ideal not to have multiple regulators duplicating the difficult task of understanding complex algorithms and multiplying the burden to businesses of explaining those algorithms and handing over information.</p><p>Another consideration would be how to coordinate diverse regulators' activities related to AIs. Again, the most plausible existing body is FSOC. FSOC's composition could be expanded to provide more of a link between financial stability and the real economy. Currently, FSOC's nine regulatory members consist only of financial regulators. (354) A trade regulator, most sensibly the FTC, could be added.</p><p>FSOC is ultimately an unsatisfying coordinator for AI oversight, however, since it is so focused on stability and finance. Ideally, a single entity would both promote pro-AI policies and manage AI risks. I have previously proposed a technology meta-regulator for reasons outside of automated commerce, including consumer protection and antitrust governance, but a technology meta-agency could perform a broader risk-regulation mission--in addition to governing the host of privacy, information access, and other threats that scholars have identified. (355) Even before any inflection point arrives justifying regulatory restructuring, regulators would ideally leverage existing authority, and an expanded analytic framework, to begin studying the issue so as to lay the knowledge foundations for high-stakes decisions to come.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Expanding the intellectual paradigm to consider the possibility of hyperswitching would continue an ongoing law and economics project. The Coase theorem, information economics, and behavioral economics helped develop more accurate models for designing the legal system in light of how markets actually work. (356) In at least one regard, however, automated commerce reverses the narrative. Embedded in these past paradigmatic refinements was a (correct) criticism that models had unrealistically assumed some feature of perfect competition. (357)</p><p>This Article has shown that the opposite assumption may make more sense in some contexts. Markets will remain imperfect in some ways, such as the number of competitors, but it is becoming more realistic to assume markets can move closer to the perfect-competition economic model through minimal switching costs. Once that possibility is recognized, it becomes instructive to understand why high transaction costs nonetheless persist and to recognize the full societal gains and losses that would result from laws that help automate consumer transactions.</p><p>A decision on whether the law should influence AIs' trajectory has already been made. Some laws have unintentionally held AIs back, thereby preventing both theoretical market volatility and more tangible large-scale social welfare gains. More recent laws aimed at helping consumers, such as those mandating online cancellation options, may unintentionally benefit AIs.</p><p>The important question moving forward is whether the law of automated switching will continue to develop in a piecemeal manner. A long-term regulatory vision should begin with deliberately pro-AI legal reforms, such as mandating data access and preserving automated contractual exit. If commercial markets become more like stock markets, it will be important to monitor a broader set of costs and risks. Regulatory tools may also converge, with hyperswitching possibly making an SEC-style stock market pause function and the Federal Reserve's bank stress tests relevant outside of finance. Regardless, bridging the current intellectual silos separating micro from macro concerns, and the financial from the real economy, will better situate the regulatory framework to design a comprehensive law of automated markets.</p><p>Rory Van Loo, Associate Professor of Law, Boston University School of Law; Affiliated Fellow, Yale Law School Information Society Project.

L. REV. 1623 (2017) (detailing power asymmetries). As electronic commerce was emerging, some observers were enthusiastic about frictionless commerce and digital agents such as \"infomediaries.\" While that literature is insightful and relevant, it largely dealt with a prior generation of digital intermediaries that would provide the information to consumers, rather than the focus of this Article--automated assistants that can take over the entire purchase process. See, e.g., Eric Goldman, A Coasean Analysis of Marketing, 2006 WIS. L. REV. 1151, 1156, 1199 (summarizing early proposals for infomediaries and seeing promise in emerging technologies that would ensure the marketing that reached people matched their preferences).</p><p>(6.) The main exception is awareness of the need for legal reforms to provide digital intermediaries with data access. See, e.g., Rory Van Loo, Helping Buyers Beware: The Need for Supervision of Big Retail, 163 U. PA. L. REV. 1311, 1345-47 (2015) (proposing legal rules requiring big retailers to disclose product data).

Additionally, it provides the closest mechanism to a stock exchange pause button for the real economy, as filing a bankruptcy petition begins an automatic stay that halts creditor claims. Bankruptcy law does not, however, provide a means to prevent consumers from switching. Nor does it have the speed and flexibility required in the event of markets facing a systemic risk trigger.

I was laid off in January, after nearly a decade in my newsroom. The Huffington Post had hired me in 2010 to write what Arianna Huffington called the 'flesh and blood' stories of the recession\u2014people losing their jobs, plunging underwater on their mortgages, hocking their wedding rings to put food on the table. My first beat was economic suffering. I didn't understand at the time that journalism was staring down its own Great Recession. </p><p>We at HuffPost knew the cuts were coming. They'd been the subject of happy-hour chats for weeks. Verizon, our parent company, haddeclared our website essentially worthless[1]in late 2018 and directed staff reductions across the board. Even so, my own layoff came as a shock.As a senior politics reporter for the site who represented it on cable news every weekend, my job had felt like an integral part of my identity. In a brief, surreal phone call, my boss told me she'd had to make some tough choices and that my job had been eliminated. I had five hours to clean off my desk, turn in my laptop, phone, and badge, and say goodbye to the newsroom that had been a second home to me for nearly a decade. A sympathetic colleague handed me a miniature bottle of red wine and a plastic cup. In the days that followed, what was harder than losing my job was having to watch the whole industry start to crumble along with it. BuzzFeedlaid off 15 percent of its staff[2]the day after Verizon eliminated my job at HuffPost;Vice layoffs[3]came soon after. Gannett, the largest newspaper publisher in the country,cut 400 jobs[4]from local papers. In April,more job cuts[5]hit the ClevelandPlain Dealer, which has shrunk to less than a tenth of its former size over the past few years, leaving just 33 journalists to cover a metro area of two million people. Last week, the New OrleansTimes-Picayunewasfolded into a competitor[6], ending a 182-year run, with most of the staff let go. Tom Feran, a 66-year-old reporter at the paper who heroically volunteered to be laid off to save the job of a younger staffer, aptlydescribed[7]the feeling as that of 'a cartoon character running off a cliff into space and then looking down and noticing I'm not standing on solid ground anymore. Or like the end of 'She's So Heavy,' by the Beatles, which just suddenly ends.' I have never paid much attention to the financial side of journalism. But since being laid off, I've made it my mission to understand the existential threat news publishers are facing from Big Tech. Companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google are using their tech muscle to monetize news for their own profit, but at the expense of the newswriters. Google and Facebookdominate the digital ad market[8], consuming more than 60 percent of all revenue. Apple is leveraging its iPhone and Mac users to roll out its own news subscription product, Apple News+. Sadly, this product undercuts the subscriptions sold by existing publishers while Appletakes 50 percent of the revenue[9]. Google is also planning a policy change that would severely undermine news gathering. The company isreportedly considering restricting third-party cookies[10]in its Chrome web browser, which it could announce as soon as its annual conference on May 7. Cookies are the largely unseen infrastructure on which the online marketplace runs. Cookies allow websites that provide free content to also collect anonymized data on users' interests, giving advertisers critical information about the market for their products. This value exchangeis necessary to support nearly every site on the internet, but it is the lifeblood of digital journalism.An online advertisement without a third-party cookie sells for just 2 percent of the cost of the same ad with the cookie. Google will likely frame its policy change in terms of online privacy\u2014a real and important concern for Americans.But if Google restricts or eliminates third-party cookies on Chrome, the collection of user data for profit won't go away.Tech giants will continuebuilding dossiers[11]on every American who uses the internet.The move would simply force publishers to use Google as a middleman for advertising sales, giving Google a cut of the ad revenue that would otherwise go to hiring journalists. Tech companies are well aware of their negative impact on journalism andhave pledged $600 million[12]toward efforts to support it. But this is a drop in the bucket compared to the damage they have caused. $600 million is a small price to pay to ensure publishers become more reliant on the data Google and Facebook harvest from users across their multiple platforms. It would be far more helpful for them to facilitate a flow of digital advertising dollars back to the publishers who hire the journalists and create the content, instead of tweaking their policies in ways that make it even harder for a digital news site to sell an ad. A robust and well-funded news media is vital to a healthy democracy. The public should be aware of Big Tech's death grip on publishers, particularly as Google weighs a potentially devastating policy change that few people understand. And more broadly, lawmakers in Congress on both sides of the aisle should be discussing legislative solutions to regulate or break up the tech giants and restore fairness to the digital ad market. It's uncomfortable for journalists to talk or write about ourselves, or to elevate an issue that's in our own self-interest. We're taught not to be the story. But as the president attacks us with dangerous rhetoric, and tech monopolies siphon off our revenue streams, it's never been more necessary for us to link arms to fight for the health and future of our industry. One or two companies should not have the power to cripple the free press in the United States.

While many industries have embraced digital disruption, the healthcare industry has yet to experience the improvements in outcomes, access, and cost-effectiveness long promised by the digital revolution. Healthcare lags behind other industries in part because of the regulatory environment, which tends to slow progress as health authorities strive to minimize adverse outcomes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Developing effective digital medicine tools is an intensive and challenging process that requires the interdisciplinary efforts of a wide range of experts, from engineers and ethicists to payers and providers. Many of the challenges are compounded by the multidisciplinary nature of this field. The advancement of digital medicine stalls when constituent experts speak different languages and have different standards, experiences, and expectations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What Is the Goal of This Primer?</p><p>We believe that effective communication is essential for turning scientific discoveries into commercial products. Having unclear definitions and inconsistent terminology hinders our abilities to evaluate scientific evidence and, ultimately, develop successful medical products.</p><p>Our goals with this primer are to:</p><p>1 Promote effective collaboration among different stakeholders by providing a common framework of language and ideas within which to collaborate</p><p>2 Support the advancement of measurement in digital medicine by clarifying core concepts and terms</p><p>To achieve these goals, we synthesize the basics of clinical medicine, medical research, regulation, and ethics into an accessible and digestible form and, by clarifying core concepts and terms, we aim to drive the field forward.</p><p>This primer focuses specifically on measurement in digital medicine, a foundational component underpinning the decentralization and democratization of clinical care and clinical trials using digital tools. We will also attempt to explicate relationships between digital measurement in research and digital measurement in clinical care. Though these are interrelated concepts, and much technology moves fluidly between research and care, we have chosen the focus on research as this seems to be a logical sequence. The ability to demonstrate reliability and meaningfulness for clinical trials, whether clinic based or otherwise, will ultimately translate into clinical use. Although the research space is fragmented, it is far more cohesive and unitary than clinical care, and we believe that effecting changes in practice across the research domain in a timely manner is a feasible goal, which will benefit patient care both through the translation of new technology and the creation and approval of novel treatments. While our treatment of clinical care may seem sparse, we do attempt to cover a breadth of applicable examples.</p><p>This piece is the first in a planned series of primers that will address all aspects of digital medicine. Collectively, the primers will provide a comprehensive introductory resource to digital medicine, equipping all professionals working in the field with the knowledge and language they need to advance the practice of digital medicine and, in turn, patient care.</p><p>Who Will This Primer Help?</p><p>Technology experts, including software engineers, designers, data scientists, security researchers, and product managers who want to deepen their healthcare knowledge.</p><p>Academic researchers and industry sponsors of clinical trials, both of whom need to facilitate internal discussions across teams (e.g., data science teams working with protocol designers in the translational medicine teams).</p><p>Clinicians, who will be increasingly exposed to digital medicine in their practice.</p><p>Patients, who we believe will drive more of their own care as the practice of medicine becomes more personalized and consumer-oriented.</p><p>How Should You Use This Primer?</p><p>In this primer, we use bolded words to indicate important terms or phrases for the field. Where possible, we reference existing definitions. Where we found conflicting definitions, we propose a revised definition. We hope that standardizing terminology will help unify and advance the field. We also recognize that these definitions will evolve over time.</p><p>We have organized the primer into three parts:</p><p>Part I is an overview of digital medicine, focusing on the software and algorithms that are being used to measure individuals\u2019 health and intervene to improve their condition.</p><p>Part II is designed for readers newer to the ethical, legal/regulatory and social implications (ELSI) associated with health research and healthcare. We provide an overview of \u201cclinical research\u201d versus routine \u201cclinical care\u201d and the considerations as a product goes to market.</p><p>Part III introduces terms that classify types of digital measurements, such as digital biomarkers and electronic clinical outcome assessments. It also describes how to think through developing a digital measure for use in a clinical trial setting versus clinical care \u2013 and important considerations to ensure the measures are trustworthy, such as the concepts of verification and validation.</p><p>Borrowing from the success of our colleagues in cancer immunotherapy, and research in emergency medicine, we have distilled key clinical ontologies and frameworks into cartoon illustrations [1, 2]. We intentionally published this primer in an open-access journal because it is our hope that readers borrow liberally from this work, both using the concepts and illustrations for internal and external presentations and to spark discussions.</p><p>What Does Success Look Like?</p><p>As leaders in our field have stated before us, if we are successful in \u201caccelerating the advancement of digital medicine, then soon, we will just be calling it \u2018medicine\u2019 [3].\u201d</p><p>We share the same vision for the future.</p><p>Part I: An Overview of Digital Medicine \u2013 Measurements and Interventions</p><p>What Is Digital Medicine?</p><p>Digital medicine describes a field, concerned with the use of technologies as tools for measurement, and intervention in the service of human health [4]. Digital medicine products are driven by high-quality hardware and software products that support health research and the practice of medicine broadly, including treatment, recovery, disease prevention, and health promotion for individuals and across populations (Fig.\u00a01).</p><p>Fig.\u00a01.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Digital medicine overview. Digital medicine uses software and algorithmically driven products to measure or intervene to improve human health.</p><p>Digital medicine products can be used independently or in concert with pharmaceuticals, biologics, devices, or other products to optimize patient care and health outcomes. Digital medicine empowers patients and healthcare providers with intelligent and accessible tools to address a wide range of conditions through high-quality, safe, and effective measurements and data-driven interventions. Digital products are also used in health research to develop knowledge of the fundamental determinants of health and illness by examining the biological, environmental and lifestyle factors. Digital technologies are increasingly used in observational and interventional research applied to prevention and treatment of disease as well as health promotion.</p><p>As a discipline, digital medicine encapsulates both broad professional expertise and responsibilities concerning the use of these digital tools. Digital medicine focuses on evidence generation to support the use of these technologies. Measurement products include digital biomarkers (e.g., using a voice biomarker to track change in tremor for a Parkinson\u2019s patient), electronic clinical outcome assessments (e.g., an electronic patient-reported outcome survey), and tools that measure adherence and safety (e.g., a wearable sensor that tracks falls and smart mirrors for passive monitoring in the home) [5]. Digital measurement products are the focus on this primer.</p><p>Intervention products include digital therapeutics and connectedimplantables (e.g., an insulin pump). Digital therapeutics deliver evidence-based therapeutic interventions to patients that are driven by high-quality software programs to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease. They are used independently or in concert with medications, devices, or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes [6]. Notably, digital intervention products are not the primary focus on this primer, although a companion primer on intervention products is planned for future publication.</p><p>Combination products both measure and intervene. For example, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for diabetics share patient data automatically with their doctor\u2019s office using a companion app. The level of human involvement may vary in the cycle between measurement and intervention \u2013 say, when a doctor diagnoses an abnormal heart condition from an electrocardiogram (EKG) reading off a smartphone. Over time, this cycle may become more closed-loop, with less need for human intervention in response to routine changes. More recently, the development of the \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d has combined the CGM with an insulin pump and a computer-controlled algorithm that allows the system to automatically adjust the delivery of insulin to reduce high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and minimize the incidence of low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) [7].</p><p>How Does Digital Medicine Differ from \u201cDigital Wellness\u201d and \u201cDigital Health\u201d?</p><p>Similar to the way in which \u201cwellness\u201d products differ from those used in medicine, \u201cdigital wellness\u201d differs from digital medicine. We use \u201cdigital wellness\u201d to describe products that consumers use to measure physical activity or sleep quality \u2013 things that might influence their personal well-being. Digital wellness products may include apps or wearable sensors (e.g., Fitbit, Oura ring). Digital wellness products are intended to be consumer-facing rather than used in clinical care as these products often lack evidence necessary to support the medical use of the information they produce.</p><p>There are times when it may be appropriate to use \u201cwellness\u201d or \u201cconsumer-grade\u201d tools for measurement in clinical research. For example, using an accelerometer manufactured for the consumer market to measure physical activity among research participants enrolled in a clinical trial is common. However, this would require a body of evidence to support this use (see Part III on verification and validation), meaning that high-quality consumer tools can be digital medicine tools as long as they have a reasonable level of evidence behind the measurements instance.</p><p>Digital medicine product manufacturers commit to undergo rigorous randomized, controlled clinical studies for their products. Unlike digital products that measure the less well defined concept of wellness, digital medicine products demonstrate success in clinical trials [8]. In this primer, we outline digital products that measure and intervene in all areas of the practice of medicine, extending to and including behavioral health, public health, and population health management.</p><p>We have decided not to use the term \u201cdigital health\u201d in this primer. While it is one of the buzziest catchphrases in the industry today, it has been so broadly used and misinterpreted that it has no real meaning. Instead, we use digital medicine as the term to describe evidence-based digital products that measure and intervene, including those intended for health promotion and disease prevention. Digital medicine products are evidence-based tools that support health research and the practice of medicine. Digital medicine describes this broad, evidence-based field and does not refer to the narrow use of the term \u201cmedicine,\u201d which is sometimes interpreted as the drug (\u201cmedicine\u201d) that is administered to the patient.</p><p>Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence \u2013 Oh My!</p><p>The recent explosion of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, driven in large part by the availability of massive datasets and inexpensive computation, has played an important role in enabling digital medicine products [9]. Whereas traditional health measures represent a snapshot in time \u2013 a lab value, a diagnostic image, a blood pressure reading, or a note in a medical record \u2013 connected digital devices offer a longitudinal and highly personalized window into human health.</p><p>A key component of these systems is the transformation of raw physiological or environmental signals into health indicators that can be used to monitor and predict aspects of health and disease. These data (e.g., from a sensor) are processed, transformed and used to build computational models whose output represent the health indicators of interest. Computational approaches range from simple statistical models like linear regression, to signal processing methods like the Fourier transform, to time series analysis like additive regression models, or machine learning methods like support vector machines or convolutional neural networks.</p><p>For example, an algorithm is required to transform the raw data from a 3-axis accelerometer into the more widely usable health indicator of step counts. There are a variety of different approaches to this task, yielding a variety of different performance characteristics [10]. Importantly, the more examples of real-world walking that the algorithm has access to \u2013 by people of different shapes and sizes, under different conditions \u2013 the greater the opportunity to improve the accuracy of the model.</p><p>How Are Digital Measurements in Medicine Being Used Today?</p><p>Some digital measurements are already well-established in routine clinical care, like using ambulatory EKG monitoring to detect arrhythmias in cardiac patients [11]. Similarly, remotely monitoring patients with implanted heart devices allows doctors to better follow their cardiac patients, detecting abnormal heart rhythms and problems with the device sooner.</p><p>Digital measures are also used in clinical research to better monitor patients and more efficiently assess safety and efficacy. For example, in-hospital ambulatory cardiac monitoring has existed for many years, enabling real-time monitoring of EKG signals. Similarly, portable EKG technologies have also existed, these recorded signals for later analysis. The digital medicine solutions for cardiac monitoring include non-obtrusive patch-based cardiac monitors that may be worn for days at a time, while ambulatory, and remote from the hospital while sending real time signals.</p><p>Across therapeutic areas and technologies, digital medicine solutions can solve weaknesses of existing solutions, and can come to market with more patient-friendly packages.</p><p>Examples of Digital Measures in Clinical Care</p><p>Recovery, performance, and treatment selection: In patients recovering from orthopedic surgery, app-enabled wearable sensors are increasingly being used during rehabilitation. Digital measurements, such as range of motion and step count, allow remote monitoring of a patient\u2019s progress. More sophisticated measurements can monitor in real-time if a patient is doing their rehab exercises.</p><p>Real-time safety monitoring: Digital fall detection systems allow for of elderly and frail populations. Such monitoring often relies on either wearable sensors, cameras, motion sensors, microphones, and/or floor sensors.</p><p>Treatment adherence: One of the thorniest problems in routine clinical care can now be measured under limited circumstances via an ingestible sensor embedded in a medication that, when it interacts with stomach acid, transmits to a patch sensor worn over the abdomen, monitoring when a pill was taken. Abilify MyCite is the only drug combined with a digital ingestion tracking system to be approved in the US [12]. Other innovations, like \u201csmart packs,\u201d integrate sensors into the packaging of medicines to record when the drug was administered and deliver automatic reminders to take a medication.</p><p>Multimodal data integration: By combining remotely captured data into EMRs, personal health records, patient portals, and clinical data repositories, innovators hope to improve clinical decision-making and support data-driven medicine [13].</p><p>Examples of Digital Measures in Clinical Research</p><p>Data collected from remote sensors could be used as a novel endpoint for hard-to-measure conditions like Parkinson\u2019s [14, 15].</p><p>Digital measures are being used to assess medication adherence in clinical trials using smart blister packages for investigational drugs.</p><p>Continuous digital measures may allow for the detection of safety events that would otherwise go unrecorded. For example, a wearable cardiac monitor can help reveal arrhythmia in research participants during trials of stimulant use in people with ADHD.</p><p>Digital measures may enable more objective and precise screening for inclusion/exclusion in a clinical trial. This could expand the pool of eligible research participants, increase diversity of a trial population, and decrease attrition between evaluation and enrollment by returning information to researchers faster.</p><p>Digital measures may inform better decisions about whether to progress a drug from early phase trials to later, larger, and more costly trials. These are known as \u201cgo/no go\u201d decisions. Digital measures may be particularly important to inform these decisions where current measures are subjective and/or where there is a high failure rate. For example, in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, digital cognitive assessments that afford more sensitive and frequent monitoring, but are not endorsed by health authorities yet, could enable better decision-making about which treatments to advance to the next phase of clinical development (Box 1) [16].</p><p>Articles reviewing current and prospective wearable technologies and their progress toward clinical application and the use of medical technology in the home provide additional examples of measurement in digital medicine for readers [11, 18].</p><p>In summary, the field of digital medicine applies the same rigor to the selection, development, or use of digital technology for measurement and intervention that is applied to other areas of medicine.</p><p>[Image omitted. See PDF.] </p><p>Part II: Security, Ethical, Legal, and Regulatory Considerations when Adopting Digital Medicine in Research and Care</p><p>In this section, we outline security, ethical, legal, and regulatory considerations when adopting digital medicine technologies in clinical research and routine care (Fig.\u00a02).</p><p>Fig.\u00a02.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>The clinical landscape. The healthcare landscape can be broadly split into premarket clinical research and postmarket clinical care.</p><p>Where Does Digital Medicine Fit in within Clinical Research and Care?</p><p>Clinical care is familiar to most readers from their own experiences with doctors, hospitals and other parts of the healthcare system. Its primary purpose has historically been to address health problems, and has long been grounded in the interaction between a patient and a healthcare provider. There has been varying progression of healthcare activities toward preventative care and maintenance of wellness. With the introduction of connected technologies, there have also been attempts to move healthcare activities into the home decreasing the need for face-to-face interactions with providers. Clinical care activities include a wide range of diagnostic and treatment processes and procedures such as:</p><p>Real-time monitoring such as the use of continuous blood glucose sensors</p><p>Tools for medical adherence such as smart apps and pill dispensaries</p><p>Physical rehabilitation tools such as digital activity trackers.</p><p>Clinical research may include some of the same activities as clinical care, but the primary purpose of clinical research is to develop a better understanding of factors influencing health and illness in people. The federal regulations define research as a \u201csystematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge\u201d [19]. When a person (e.g., patient or healthy individual) volunteers to enroll in clinical research, they are called a research participant. There are rules and guidance that must be followed when conducting clinical research to make sure that research participants are protected from undue risks of harm. Clinical research comes in two broad subsets:</p><p>In interventional studies, participants receive some form of treatment, education or support (Box 2). Clinical trials are a subset of interventional studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p><p>In non-interventional studies, participants do not receive an intervention. Non-interventional studies include observational, exploratory, survey, case-control, cohort, and correlational studies. Computational studies that use existing data sources to build predictive models fall into this category.</p><p>[Image omitted. See PDF.] Digital Measurement in Clinical Care: Outside the Clinic Walls</p><p>Like any other medical tool, at-home monitoring technologies need to prove their worth. Developers, working with researchers and other experts, must demonstrate that these tools produce clinically meaningful information that leads to clinically meaningful improvements in care, processes, and outcomes.</p><p>Digital measurement in medicine will not replace clinics or clinicians entirely, nor would we want them to. The delivery of clinical care such as intravenous drugs or surgery, and the value that patients place in their relationship with their provider, cannot be replaced by digital tools. Nonetheless, when used appropriately, digital measurements can improve care by giving clinicians more complete information. Also, transferring some practices out of the clinic and into patients\u2019 regular lives, for example passively measuring sleep quality with wearables instead of requiring overnight stays in clinics, can enhance access to care and reduce cost.</p><p>Continuous at-home monitoring also raises a new set of practical issues: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Who will monitor the data? Who will be responsible for acting on it if it indicates a need for action? How will providers be compensated for these tasks?</emphasis> Although organizations like Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) have made inroads in addressing the first two questions, the field will need to address these issues and adopt consensus solutions for these tools to be truly integrated into clinical care [20].</p><p>A defining moment for any medical product, whether drug or device, is when the product goes to market. From this perspective, the industry splits into \u201cpremarket\u201d research activities, drug and device development in the life sciences and biotech, and \u201cpostmarket\u201d commercial activities, where the products are used in clinical applications like in the hospital. Often, government regulators like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP) are the gatekeepers between what is considered research (premarket) and what is part of standard of care and commercial activities (postmarket).</p><p>National governments are responsible for establishing national medicines and medical device standards and regulatory authorities that determine what claims product manufacturers can make when they go to market in that country [21]. As of 2015, 121 of the 194 members of the World Health Organization had a national regulatory authority responsible for implementing and enforcing product regulations specific to medical devices [22]. For example, in the United States, the FDA serves this function. Across the Atlantic, this oversight is provided by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and in Japan, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency (PMDA).</p><p>Regulatory Considerations</p><p>There are countless articles and books that discuss regulatory considerations associated with medical product development. We will keep this section brief and provide key concepts and frameworks to consider.</p><p>It is essential to understand that regulatory agencies like the FDA regulate medical products (like drugs and diagnostic devices) but not the practice of medical care. Structurally, the FDA has six centers, with three most relevant to digital medicine developers:</p><p>1 Center For Drug Evaluation and Research History (CDER)</p><p>2 Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)</p><p>3 Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) [23].</p><p>Drugs and Biologics</p><p>Clinical trials for drug and biologic development are organized across phases (Fig.\u00a03), and the results of these trials are reported to CDER or CBER, respectively.</p><p>Fig.\u00a03.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>The phases of clinical trial research. Clinical trials pass through a series of phases as the trial sponsor gains more evidence around the investigational drug or biologic. Preclinical studies are often conducted in cell and animal models (e.g., on mice), and then are slowly expanded into humans. First in healthy humans in small numbers to test safety, and then to larger sets of humans who have the condition in question to test both safety and efficacy.</p><p>Preclinical studies test the drug in vitro (test tube or cell culture) and in vivo (animal) models.</p><p>Phase 0 started as an informal stage designation that companies used to describe non-drug studies that are exploratory to prepare for the upcoming or ongoing drug research. At this phase, methods of measurement, or specialized techniques may be tested without the risks associated with administering an investigational medicine. In 2006, this phase was formalized by FDA guidance to include studies that use tiny doses of a drug (&lt;1% of expected therapeutic dose) in healthy volunteers to determine if the chemical properties of the drug warrant further development [24].</p><p>Phase I \u201cfirst in human\u201d trials test the drugs in healthy human participants. The goal of this phase is to assess the safety and tolerability of the drug by starting with low doses on a small number of healthy people (e.g., &lt;15 participants) and progressively increasing the doses toward the expected effective concentration. Safety is monitored and measured in all subsequent phases as well. These studies are often conducted in highly controlled and specialized inpatient clinics.</p><p>Phase II trials enroll larger groups of patients with the medical condition of interest, and begin to test for efficacy, while attempting to establish dose and frequency schedules for the final drug product.</p><p>Phase III is most often the \u201cpivotal\u201d stage of testing in which definitive evidence of efficacy and safety must be developed in multiple large trials. The endpoints of these trials ultimately serve as the evidence for the label claims that regulatory agencies allow pharmaceutical companies to use when marketing a drug.</p><p>Phase IV trials, also known as observational or postmarketing surveillance are a hybrid of research and clinical care. In these trials, the drug is already licensed for use and is being prescribed to patients. The purpose of Phase IV trials is to monitor the effects of these new therapies in order to identify and evaluate previously unreported adverse reactions. Phase IV trials allow sponsors (biopharma and device manufacturers) to see how the product is performing in the \u201creal world.\u201d These trials also provide an opportunity to test the therapy in new demographics and find new markets, often resulting in label expansion, where the sponsor can make claims that the drug works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use (Box 3).</p><p>Novel digital tools are being adopted at different rates in different stages of clinical trials, most likely because different trial stages are associated with different levels of risk to the sponsor. Phase III is an unlikely place to see novel measurements of any kind, as disrupting a large complex trial and risking the primary endpoint(s) could be expensive and harmful to the development process. Whereas, implementing exploratory efficacy measures in a small, early stage safety trial may be inexpensive and introduce minimal risk to the primary endpoint(s). Sponsors are now deploying digital tools in Phase I, II, and III trials as digital measurements need to be relatively consistent in early stages of trials to develop the necessary evidence both for internal decision making and regulatory approval.</p><p>The regulatory terms that describe tools, methods, materials, or measures that can potentially facilitate the medical product\u2019s development are drug development tools (DDT) or medical device development tools (MDDT) (\u201ctools\u201d are different from \u201cdevices\u201d at the FDA, which we will discuss later) [25, 26]. The FDA has also released a request for comments on Prescription Drug-Use-Related Software (PDURS) for software that is developed for use with prescription drugs (including biological drug products), which may include but is not limited to tracking drug ingestion, calculating the appropriate dose, sending reminders to take the drug, or providing information on how to use a drug [27].</p><p>There are also combination products, which contain both a drug and software that meets the definition of a device because of its function [28]. For example, Abilify MyCite, which is a drug-leg, drug-device combination product comprised of aripiprazole tablets embedded with a software-based ingestible event marker intended to track drug ingestion. Patients can opt to share these data with their healthcare providers or caregivers [27].</p><p>[Image omitted. See PDF.] </p><p>Medical Devices</p><p>Similar to the approval process in FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), medical devices in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) go through a process for clearance or approval. However, in the case of medical devices, regulators generally pay more attention to technical and design aspects of the product when considering the safety of medical devices \u2013 and particularly those that operate non-invasively may have more predictable effects than introducing a novel chemical to the body. All novel drugs are considered dangerous until proven otherwise, but medical device studies can be adjudicated as posing non-significant risk based on design criteria [29].</p><p>CDRH is often the point of contact for digital medicine developers who are building software-as-a-medical device (SaMD) products [30]. Although in other sections of this primer, we have used bold to indicate a key phrase, we will break tradition for this one term and use quotes around \u201cdevice,\u201d because a \u201cdevice\u201d is a Term of Art at the FDA, which means that it has a precise and specialized meaning. CDRH is responsible for regulating \u201cdevices\u201d but not tools. As such, we limit our use of the term \u201cdevice\u201d in this primer to be consistent with the FDA\u2019s definition for a \u201cmedical device\u201d (See \u201cChanges to Existing Medical Software Policies Resulting from Section 3060 of 21st Century Cures Act\u201d) [31, 32].</p><p>For the US market, it is important to distinguish that the FDA does not regulate what the product actually does, but rather what an organization claims the product does.</p><p>For instance, let us say Product A and Product B are exactly the same mobile sensor technology, i.e. the same hardware, firmware, and software/algorithm that produce a measurement. If Product A states that the intended use of this measurement is for a wellness purpose, it likely is not regulated. If Product B says the intended use of this measurement is to make a diagnosis, then it would be considered a \u201cdevice\u201d and regulated by the FDA. This means that the exact same product can be developed and marketed either as a \u201cdevice\u201d (and thus, regulated) or not a \u201cdevice\u201d (and unregulated) simply through a change of words, and no change in hardware or code. For example, at the time of this publication, a Fitbit is not regulated by the FDA as it does not claim to serve a medical purpose. Therefore, a Fitbit is considered to be a digital measurement tool or a mobile sensor technology but, not a \u201cdevice.\u201d</p><p>Put another way: asking \u201cis my digital product a medical device?\u201d is not the most useful question. A better question would be about the intended use of the product (i.e., is the organization making a medical device claim?). Generally, answering this question is not easy, which is why many software manufacturers will spend millions of dollars on regulatory consultants. The FDA has an open-door policy where it encourages organizations to come early and often during product development. This is why it is good practice to initiate the conversation about regulatory designation of the product early. A good starting point is with FDA\u2019s Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) [33].</p><p>As tools develop multiple functions (e.g., can measure step count, and heart rate, and tremor and can be tailored to specific populations), these digital measurement technologies may be used for either medical product development or commercial clinical care activities [34]. Whether the software is a \u201cdevice\u201d is ultimately determined by a regulatory body and likely will depend upon the software\u2019s intended functions.</p><p>Medical devices can presumptively be classified by risk profile, currently defined by the FDA as Class I, II, or III in order of increasing risk; Class I devices require little safety testing. Today, around 50% of medical devices fall under this category, and 95% of these are exempt from the regulatory process [35, 36].</p><p>Devices that perform a similar function to an existing device on the market (a predicate) can be approved simply by demonstrating that it is at least as effective and no more dangerous than the existing device. This pathway is called 510(k) clearance. As devices increase in risk \u2013 meaning they have the potential to cause harm either by a malfunctioning or by providing bad information \u2013 there becomes more of a burden on the manufacturer to demonstrate safety and efficacy both from a technical perspective and in controlled human trials.</p><p>Of note, many medical device companies, including digital medicine developers, will bypass Class I and strive to get their devices categorized as at least Class II, because this category is generally the lowest risk class that is also covered by insurance, enabling greater access. Notably, Apple\u2019s first FDA-cleared product, an ECG over-the-counter (OTC) (e.g., non-prescription) app, was categorized as Class II [37].</p><p>Class III devices pose a high risk to the patient and/or user (e.g., they sustain or support life, are implanted, or present potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury). These types of devices represent around 10% of devices regulated by CDRH [36]. Implantable pacemakers and breast implants are examples of Class III devices.</p><p>Historically, the focus of CDRH relied heavily on a concept called a \u201cpredicate,\u201d which is a legally marketed device (e.g., already on the market) to which a new device would claim equivalence. Whether or not a proposed device has a predicate impacts the regulatory pathway the device can use. For instance, a \u201cde novo\u201d classification does not need to have an existing device on the market to compare to.</p><p>Notably, in the fall of 2018, the FDA made a sweeping announcement that it is evaluating a rehaul to de-emphasize its predicate process and while this is probably a positive move to better treat patients, it will take some years to move away from the current system [38].</p><p>Many people do not realize that there is also a difference between FDA-approved and FDA-cleared. \u201cApproved\u201d indicates that the device successfully completed an FDA Premarket Approval (PMA), which evaluates the safety and effectiveness of Class III high-risk products. \u201cCleared\u201d indicates that the device successfully completed a 510(k) pathway, which are for lower risk-level products (Table 1).</p><p>Table 1.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Regulatory pathways for device development</p><p>It is a herculean task to comb through existing FDA \u201cguidances with digital health content\u201d [39]. A good starting point includes the guidances on General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices, Mobile Medical Applications (MMA), Software as a Medical Device(SaMD), and Clinical and Patient Decision Support (CDS and PDS) Software [40-43]. The FDA has been taking a forward-looking stance on how to handle digital products, including machine learning and algorithms, and streamline the regulatory process.</p><p>For instance, the agency is piloting a Software Precertification (Pre-Cert) Program with companies like Apple, Fitbit, and Samsung participating [44]. This program would allow software manufacturers a more streamlined review process, making it easier to release new software versions to market if the organization is precertified. The Pre-Cert program draws heavily on the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) definitions and categories for software-as-a-medical device (SaMD) [45]. SaMDs (e.g., software-only products like apps and algorithms decoupled from a hardware component) may be subject to more flexible regulations than software-in-a-medical device (SiMD) (e.g., traditional software contained within a pacemaker).</p><p>The 21st Century Cures Act (Cure\u2019s Act), signed into law on December 13, 2016, amended the definition of \u201cdevice\u201d in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to exclude certain software functions, including some described in many existing guidance documents. FDA has been assessing how to revise its guidances to represent current thinking on this topic. There has been a recent trend to allow more digital products to go straight to market. For instance, the Cure\u2019s Act made clearer distinctions as to what is considered a regulated medical device, versus a wellness product or a digital technology that is not a \u201cdevice\u201d (e.g., an electronic health record, EHR) [46]. The distinction between those digital products/technologies that are considered medical devices, and those that are not, is a hazy one.</p><p>Determining the nature of a digital product is especially challenging because the FDA has other mechanisms like enforcement discretion where the FDA may determine that the product is a \u201cdevice,\u201d but chooses to not regulate it [47]. As these decisions are continuously evolving, some helpful resources to navigate the area include the FTC Mobile Health Apps Interactive Tooland the FDA Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) [48, 33]. There are also papers that draw a comparison of European and US approval processes (e.g., mapping the EU CE Mark to the FDA framework) [49].</p><p>In Europe, a working group led by NHS England has developed \u201cEvidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies\u201d to make it easier for innovators and regulators to define what \u201cgood\u201d looks like within digital medicine [50]. There are many groups across the world working towards a more streamlined vision. The Digital Medicine Society is developing a resource on their website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dimesociety.org\">www.dimesociety.org</url>) to keep track of the different standards, papers, and frameworks [4].</p><p>Although regulatory authorities have the final say as to whether the digital product is a medical \u201cdevice,\u201d the organization that develops and markets the product can make many choices that influence the likelihood of being classified as a medical device. For example, organizations choose what claims to make about the product, how much evidence to gather to support those claims, and which markets to enter (and subsequently, which regulatory bodies to be regulated by).</p><p>The downstream consequences of these decisions include who can access the product, under what circumstances and for what reasons, and who is likely to pay for such access. Talking with the appropriate regulatory authority early and often is important during the product development process; it will minimize surprises and develop a forward-thinking regulatory strategy.</p><p>Put simply: CDRH is primarily concerned with whether a digital medicine tool, including both hardware and software, is safe to use and accurate for measuring what it claims to measure. If the manufacturer of that system does not claim it has a medical use (e.g., diagnostic, monitoring), they will not be regulated by CDRH. Agencies that evaluate new medicines, like CDER and CBER, care about whether the observation being made by a digital tool (concept of interest) is valid for the way it is being used in regulated research (context of use).</p><p>Table 2 is a \u201ccheat-sheet\u201d of the primary pathways to market through CDRH for a software product.</p><p>Table 2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>\u201cIf my software product is regulated by the FDA, how do I bring it to market?\u201d</p><p>Ethical Considerations</p><p>As more digital tools are deployed in health research and care settings, new questions emerge about how to use them responsibly and ethically. In this section, we introduce a few terms and describe:</p><p>1 Ethical principles and how we are collectively responsible for shaping ethical practices in digital medicine.</p><p>2 Regulatory review processes in place to protect research participants.</p><p>3 Tips and resources for doing research with digital medicine technologies.</p><p>Ethical Principles and Our Responsibilities</p><p>Anyone developing and/or testing a digital tool for use in disease prevention and treatment should be aware of the regulatory requirement to obtain Institutional Review Board(IRB) approval prospectively when involving people as research participants. The development of the IRB peer review process stemmed from egregious acts whereby researchers disregarded the rights and welfare of research participants. One example is known as the \u201cTuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male\u201d which was an observational study of the natural progression of syphilis initiated by the Public Health Services in 1932. At that time, there was no treatment for syphilis; however, after penicillin was developed, the study participants were not treated and the study continued for nearly 40 years. The National Research Act was passed in 1974 which involved creating a National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research with a goal of preventing future atrocities. It was this commission that required the formation of IRBs and also wrote the Belmont Report. The Belmont Report, which was published in 1979, describes three guiding principles of ethical biomedical and behavioral research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. In addition to the Belmont Report, federal regulations were introduced for research participant protections and adopted by several federal agencies and institutes. The regulations speak to basic protections in subpart A, now known as the Common Rule, as well as additional protections for vulnerable populations.</p><p>Here, we describe the ethical principles and follow with the how the regulations and Common Rule are implemented in practice. The three core principles of biomedical ethics described in the Belmont Report are at the core of research ethics and should be carefully considered during the study design phase and ethics review process [51].</p><p>Respect for Persons</p><p>This principle is demonstrated through the informed consent process, which occurs when a person is given the information needed to make a sound decision about whether to volunteer to willingly participate. How this information is conveyed is important because volunteering to be a research participant is different from, say, accepting terms of service (ToS) to access an app, or signing a consent form to obtain medical care. In the latter, a person will not be able to access the app if they do not accept the ToS nor will they receive medical care if they do not sign the medical consent form. Consent to participate in research is a choice that an individual can only make if presented with information in a setting conducive to good decision making. There can be no coercive actions (e.g., high incentive payments, free services) that may compromise an individual\u2019s ability to volunteer. The informed consent process involves more than signing a form to document voluntary participation \u2013 it is the first of what may be many interactions between a participant and the research team and is part of developing a trusted relationship.</p><p>Another important consideration is a person\u2019s technological literacy. For informed consent to be meaningful, participants will need to be \u201ctech-literate\u201d enough to understand the specifics of how their data will be obtained and used. Likewise, concerns about privacy are often raised when discussing the passive and ubiquitous nature of the tools used in digital medicine. Attitudes and preferences also vary across generations, with older adults preferring more privacy control compared to teens and young adults [52].</p><p>All these concerns suggest a need to better educate prospective participants \u2013 and yet, integrating these concepts into the consent process is not easy. Moving forward, this charge will require a commitment from the medical community to provide accessible public-facing educational modules. For example, one way to improve tech literacy might be to include a brief animation describing the difference between de-identification and anonymity when describing data sharing practices, or an illustration of what it means to store data in a cloud. A participant may also think that if the study team has access to their health data in real-time, 24/7, then that means someone is paying attention to them (which may not be the case). Clarifying these concepts is important and how best to do this will require experts in instructional design who can deliver creative educational content.</p><p>Beneficence</p><p>Beneficence is where an evaluation of probability and magnitude of potential harms are weighed against the possible benefits to a participant, the people they represent, and society. Determining risk of harm is a somewhat subjective process, yet worth breaking down. We need to consider potential sources of harm and try to quantify the likelihood of something going wrong as well as the consequences. For instance, if a technology collects and then transmits a study participant\u2019s location data to a publicly accessible or non-secure website, the likelihood of a loss of privacy is 100% for all users \u2013 yet the consequences will vary. For most people, these will be negligible, but for domestic abuse survivors or undocumented migrants, consequences might be severe. Thus, the same hazard presents a low risk for most, but high risk for some important others. Thinking about how to safeguard data and manage data sharing protocols is an important consideration when applying the principle of beneficence and one that researchers, IRBs and research participants need to think about carefully. When using third party commercial apps or measurement tools, it is critical that ToS and End User License Agreements (EULAs) be reviewed to ensure they do not introduce unnecessary risks to the end user be it a research participant or patient.</p><p>Other factors specific to risk assessment include the type of potential harm (e.g., physical, psychological, economic, social) as well as the duration and severity of harm to research participants. Research is inherently risky because we are learning something that is not yet known. Research participants are often told about risks as an odds ratio. For example, in studies that include a test for maximum oxygen uptake, participants are required to exercise to exhaustion. There is a 1 in 12,000 chance that a healthy individual doing this study will have a cardiac event that may lead to death. Because of this particular risk of harm, the research team can mitigate risk by having access to personnel and equipment used to treat a cardiac event. Having this information, an individual can decide whether they want to take that chance or not.</p><p>Within the domain of beneficence is the need for the digital measurement tools to be valid and reliable (see Part III). There is no potential benefit of knowledge gain if the study is poorly designed and the tools are not trustworthy. The old adage \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d (GIGO) is a serious concern and one that must be addressed by doing the appropriate studies early to ensure the products, regardless of whether there is a medical claim, are safe and produce useful data.</p><p>Justice</p><p>This principle focuses on the fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of research and recruitment protocols that are inclusive of those most likely to benefit from knowledge gained. With digital tools, we have the opportunity to reach a more diverse audience, including those in communities where health disparities are most prevalent. To do that requires that we design technologies that are accessible and, in some cases culturally tailored. With that in mind, including end users in the development process who represent a wide cross-section of our society is one way we can be responsive to the principle of justice.</p><p>For example, in a study designed to increase physical activity in refugee women, the researcher decided to use a wrist worn accelerometer to assess daily movement. The participants were given the sensor and shown how to use it. One week later, the researcher returned to gather the measurement tools and found that no data had been collected. Turns out a wrist-worn mobile technology was culturally unacceptable and drew unwanted attention to the women, so they did not wear it [53]. This story sheds light on the fact that while digital tools should improve access to health research and health care, they can also perpetuate disparities and prevent access if not well designed and deployed.</p><p>When Is an IRB/REB Needed?</p><p>Because of past harms associated with research involving human participants, there is an expectation, and in many cases, a regulatory requirement that an ethics committee review will take place in advance of the research commencing. In research supported by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or under FDA oversight, this review process is carried out by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) that is registered with the federal Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) [54]. These regulations were initiated in 1974 as part of the National Research Act.</p><p>The involvement of an IRB in behavioral and biomedical research is common globally, though often by other names, such as a research ethics board (REB) or \u201cresearch ethics committee.\u201d In the US, an IRB is required to have a minimum of five people, including scientists, non-scientists and someone who is unaffiliated with the organization. An IRB can be a part of the organization conducting the research (i.e., medical center or university), or operate as an independent fee-for-service entity.</p><p>The IRB is responsible for reviewing research that involves human participants to evaluate the probability and magnitude of potential harms to research participants and weigh these risks against the potential benefits of knowledge to be gained. The IRB also reviews the proposed research to make sure that participants selected to participate represent those most likely to benefit from its results. Moreover, the IRB wants to make sure that people who are invited to participate in research have a good understanding of the study purpose and what they will be asked to do. This process of sharing study information with a prospective participant is called informed consent and is a central tenet of biomedical research.</p><p>Federal regulations and accepted ethical principles are in place to guide the conduct of \u201cresearch\u201d so that the science is rigorous and the participants are protected. In any research, an important step is to determine if people involved in the testing phase are considered to be human participants in the research. The federal regulations include definitions for what qualifies as \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201chuman subject\u201d and addresses the responsibilities of the organization and research team.</p><p>Rather than go into detail here, we suggest that you contact the IRB affiliated with your organization to discuss the process for getting approval to test a product on humans. The IRB review and approval is usually needed if the activity is considered to be research and, the people involved with testing meet the definition of a human subject (e.g., clinical or non-clinical research). This is true regardless of whether the product is seeking FDA clearance or approval.</p><p>IRB Review Criteria and Pathways</p><p>Depending on the risk level (e.g., minimal or greater than minimal risk of harm) and type (e.g., psychological, physical, economic), there are three review pathways:</p><p>Exempt from the Common Rule</p><p>The exempt classification is appropriate if the study procedures pose no more than a minimal risk of harm (e.g., observation of public activities, survey of adults, analysis of existing data). The concept of minimal risk is defined in the federal regulations and means that the risk to a participant, whether it be physical or psychological, is no greater than what they encounter in normal daily life [19]. When a study is exempt, it means that the Common Rule does not apply to the research. Normally, the IRB makes the decision about whether a study meets the criteria for exemption.</p><p>Expedited Review</p><p>To qualify for an expedited review, the study procedures may not exceed minimal risk of harm and must align with one of the criteria described in the regulations [55]. For example, if the research involves collection of biosamples, noninvasive clinical testing (e.g., sensory acuity, moderate exercise by healthy volunteers), or examination of existing data like EHRs, it may be eligible for an expedited review. However, studies that are designed to carry out safety and efficacy testing of a medical device are probably not eligible for an expedited review and will be reviewed by a convened gathering of IRB members. The only difference between an Expedited and Convened Committee review is the number of people involved. An Expedited review can be conducted by a subset of the IRB membership which is usually the IRB chair and one other member.</p><p>Convened Committee</p><p>Any study that does not qualify for Exempt or Expedited review is evaluated by a convened group of IRB members. For research covered by the Common Rule, documentation of informed consent is required; however, sometimes that requirement can be waived.</p><p>Once the type of review is known, an IRB application is developed by the research team that includes a detailed research protocol and a draft of the informed consent document. The protocol will briefly describe the scientific literature that the study is building from, as well as the study aims, procedures, participant inclusion criteria, risks, benefits, risk management, data management, investigator qualifications, and informed consent details. The IRB will review this protocol application to evaluate whether the risks are appropriate in relation to the potential contribution to science and benefits to people like those who participate in the study.</p><p>Application of Ethical Principles</p><p>Researchers have applied these principles and relied on IRBs to help shape ethical research practices for nearly half a century. However, as digital products are increasingly used in health research and clinical care, all relevant stakeholders have a collective responsibility to think proactively about how to conduct digital health research ethically and responsibly. While IRB approval is an important step in the process for identifying and mitigating risk in studies, it is truly the responsibility of developers, researchers, and clinicians to be a part of the ethical decision-making process. Simply stated, we cannot outsource ethics and hope for the best.</p><p>Digital Medicine Ethics Resources</p><p>Of course, these regulations and ethical principles are sometimes difficult to put into practice. Because the use of digital methods is relatively new, accessing resources at the protocol development phase is important. Over the past few years, several initiatives have begun to address the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of emerging technologies. A few focus specifically on AI broadly (e.g., autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, city planning, future of work). AI initiatives presently underway (e.g., AI Now, A-100) are well-funded and global collaborative programs. Others addressing digital medicine technologies more specifically include the Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) initiative, MobileELSI research project, Sage Bionetworks and the CTTI, which are described below.</p><p>The CORE initiative, launched in 2015 at UC San Diego, is a learning \u201cethics\u201d commons developed to support the digital medicine research community, including researchers and IRBs. The CORE features a Q&amp;A Forum and a Resource Library with over 100 IRB-approved protocols and consent snippets that have been shared by 700+ members of the CORE Network. All resources are tagged for ease of access. For example, you can search the library to find protocols that have used a digital tool in clinical research involving Latino middle-schoolers or breast cancer survivors (see Fig.\u00a04).</p><p>Fig.\u00a04.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Screenshot from the Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) Q&amp;A Forum.</p><p>In addition, the CORE is creating checklists to assist the community in proactive decision making. One checklist was inspired by a psychiatrist who had recommended to a patient that he use a mobile app to help with managing his daily patterns and mood. Upon closer inspection of the app\u2019s ToS and privacy policy, the clinician realized she was inadvertently putting her patient at increased risk because the app was sharing their personal information with third parties. The checklist prompts researchers to think about ethics, privacy, risks and benefits, access and usability, and data management (see <url normalizedValue=\"http://thecore.ucsd.edu/dmchecklist/\">http://thecore.ucsd.edu/dmchecklist/</url>) (Table 3) [56].</p><p>Table 3.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Excerpt from the Digital Health/Medicine Decision Making Checklist</p><p>The MobileELSI project is led by investigators from Sage Bionetworks and the University of Louisville with a goal of understanding the scope of unregulated mobile health research to inform the development of a governance model. The increase in public access to technology has led to everyday citizens becoming involved self-experimentation, a form of \u201cCitizen Science,\u201d which is largely unregulated as it falls outside of traditional regulatory requirements. In addition, technology companies are increasingly involved in biomedical research. Neither are obligated to apply the federal regulations to protect research participants unless, of course, they are developing an FDA-covered product or are conducting federally funded research. The MobileELSI project will develop recommendations to guide the conduct of unregulated digital medicine research.</p><p>Sage Bionetworks and its governance team have led the charge in creating accessible informed consent templates for use on smartphone that enable digital medicine research. For example, the \u201cElements of Informed Consent\u201d toolkit (Fig.\u00a05) is available to researchers to help them think through developing an effective informed consent process on a mobile device [57].</p><p>Fig.\u00a05.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Screenshot from Sage Bionetwork\u2019s \u201cElements of Informed Consent\u201d toolkit.</p><p>Another source for guidance is the CTTI. CTTI has developed recommendations, resources, and practical solutions to facilitate responsible practices in mobile clinical trials [58].</p><p>Ethics when an IRB Review Is Not Required</p><p>When research involves retrospective analysis of existing data or prospective observation, testing or experimenting with people to generate \u201cgeneralizable\u201d knowledge, an IRB review is needed. Generalizable typically means that the results will be shared through peer-reviewed publication or presentations. The need for an IRB review is relatively clear in the world of premarket clinical trials, but the lines defining human research in the postmarket, commercial world have been less obvious. Some instances of A/B testing may be considered human subject research, depending on whether an organization intends to share knowledge broadly or use it internally to improve their product or service. For example, Facebook found itself in hot water in 2014 after testing different versions of its Newsfeed with users to study emotional contagion. Had the results been kept internal to Facebook for product improvement, it would have flown under the radar for needing an IRB consult. However, they published the study results to share knowledge produced with the public.</p><p>Sharing knowledge is believed by research ethicists and the scientific community to be a responsibility to society \u2013 which is certainly a good thing. In this case, though, many users were outraged about being involved in research that they did not consent to. In effect, more than 800,000 Facebook users had become inadvertent research participants [59, 60].</p><p>The takeaway message here is that ToS and EULAs are not a substitute for informed consent [61]. People want the right to opt-in to being involved in biomedical research, and that is a clear call for respecting the ethical principle of \u201crespect for persons.\u201d Yet, when we are doing work that is technically not research, what is our ethical obligation? In software development, the way user data has been treated has an emerging history of malfeasance. This practice is likely due to the lack of universally agreed upon guidelines and standards. We strongly recommend that those involved in the developing digital medicine field adopt ethical principles to guide responsible practice when guidelines are lacking.</p><p>In response to the lack of guidelines and exploitation of consumer data, new regulations have emerged that speak to consent and privacy concerns. The General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) was passed by the EU parliament in 2016 and took effect April 2018. The GDPR was designed to harmonize EU privacy laws, protect EU citizens\u2019 data privacy, and change how organizations, regardless of where they are located, process and manage EU citizen data. An important change that the GDPR introduced was the need for companies to obtain explicit informed consent separate from a ToS or EULA. This shift from consumers being helpless data subjects to empowered actors in the digital data economy is moving to the US. In 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which, when implemented in 2020, gives consumers control over their data and requires that companies like Facebook and Google explain what data they collect, what they do with it, and who it is shared with [62].</p><p>Prioritizing Data Rights and Governance</p><p>New digital tools, such as digital biomarkers, can capture an unprecedented amount of information about users, including fine-grained behavioral and physiological states. Many of these tools are non-invasive and collect data passively, which is certainly more convenient but also runs the risk that people do not understand how much of their digital footprint is being collected or shared [63]. Recently granted patents include a shopping cart that monitors your heart rate and Alexa\u2019s new ability to apparently diagnose your cough [64]. Data collected from such technologies could be used by a doctor to make a clinical decision or by an insurer to approve or deny a claim [63]. Society needs to decide how to create systems that will deliver real benefits while protecting citizen privacy and safety [65].</p><p>For example, there is a lot of excitement in the healthcare community to use these tools in postmarket monitoring, or surveillance, to track metrics like safety monitoring and efficacy. Although many of these surveillance techniques in healthcare are still early, security researchers in the tech world are understandably cautious. Put simply: personalized medicine holds great promise for humanity, but it is not possible to have personalized medicine without some amount of \u201csurveillance\u201d \u2013 indeed, they go hand in hand. Now that de-identification gets more difficult with the vast amount of data generated for an individual, it is critical to understand who, what, and when does an entity get access to our data [66]. Health insurers and data brokers have been vacuuming up personal details on individuals, to create predictions on health costs based on race, marital status, whether you pay your bills on time or even buy plus-size clothing [67]. Similar data has been used to create \u201chealth risk scores\u201d for the opioid crisis, determining who gets access to what types of care [68]. The biases in these types of algorithms have been well documented, exacerbating health disparities \u2013 and yet our society lacks clear regulatory interventions or punishment for misuse [69, 70].</p><p>We have all heard about the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT). What is coming next is the \u201cInternet of Bodies\u201d (IoB) \u2013 a network of smart devices that are attached to or inside our bodies, as defined by Prof. Andrea Matwyshyn [71]. Most of the digital tools we have discussed in this primer fit within the IoB paradigm. Matwyshyn argues that using the human body as a technology platform raises a number of legal and policy questions that regulators and judges need to prepare for.</p><p>Our healthcare system has strong protections for how to store and share a patient\u2019s biological specimens, such as a blood or genomic sample \u2013 but what about our digital specimens? With the increase in biometric surveillance from these tools, data rights and governance, who gets access to what data and when becomes critical [65].</p><p>EULAs and ToS, which gain consent one time upon sign-up, are not sufficient as a method to actually inform a person about how their health data \u2013 in the form of a digital specimen \u2013 will be protected. Our society needs better social contracts with tech platforms that have accessible and meaningful informed consent processes baked into the product itself and can be tailored to adapt as user preferences change over time (Fig.\u00a06).</p><p>Fig.\u00a06.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Digital specimens and social contracts. Our healthcare system has strong protections for a patients\u2019 biological specimens, such as a blood sample, but what about our \u201cdigital specimens\u201d? With the increase in biometric surveillance from these tools, data rights and governance \u2013 who gets access to what data and when \u2013 becomes critical.</p><p>As the field of digital medicine advances, and indeed as medicine as a whole advances a process for creation and promotion of policies, we need standards to ensure that people are protected from known and unknown harms due to myriad computational and human factors, including both failures of knowledge and failures of intent on the part of developers.</p><p>Security and Compliance Considerations</p><p>Any organization that works with personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI) and direct access to patients is at a high risk for cyber threats. Today with the rise of connected products, even a few vulnerable lines of code can have a profound impact on human life. Healthcare has seen a proliferation of vulnerabilities, particularly in connected technologies, many of which are life-critical: Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s insulin pumps, St. Jude Medical\u2019s implantable cardiac devices, and the WannaCry ransomware attack, which infected 200,000 computers, many part of critical hospital infrastructure, across 150 countries [72-74]. Vulnerabilities in connected technologies can be exposed by either black hat or white hat hackers. Black hat refers to a style of breaking into networks for personal or financial gain, often illegally without the owner\u2019s permission. White hat hackers, or security researchers, perform a style of ethical hacking on mission-critical networks and will employ the policies of coordinated disclosure to the network owner if vulnerabilities are found [75].</p><p>A number of organizations have created protocols to prioritize risk levels of known vulnerabilities. For instance, MITRE, a nonprofit that operates research and development centers sponsored by the federal government, created the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, to identify and catalog vulnerabilities in software or firmware into a free \u201cdictionary\u201d for organizations to improve their security [76]. Major agencies that are addressing healthcare cybersecurity include National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which has published a number of well-documented methodologies on how to quantitatively and qualitatively assess cyber risks, and the FDA, which has released a number of both premarket and postmarket guidances on cyber security best practices.</p><p>Researchers and developers should not count on others to implement critical basic protections, but have knowledge of their organizations policies and important contacts, such as the chief information security officer (CISO). For those embarking on this journey, check out \u201cA Cybersecurity Primer for Translational Research\u201d [77]. Newcomers to the field often confuse the concepts of complianceand security. From the Cybersecurity Primer, \u201cSecurity is the application of protections and management of risk posed by cyber threats. Compliance is typically a top-down mandate based on federal guidelines or law, whereas security is often managed bottom-up and is decentralized in most organizations\u201d [77]. Compliance typically relates to documentation (e.g., for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA), whereas security relates to how the technologies are updated, assessed, and used [77].</p><p>Most modern software is not written completely from scratch and includes common, off-the-shelf (COTS) components, modules, and libraries from both open-source and commercial teams. A tool to help manage potential vulnerabilities is called a \u201csoftware bill of materials\u201d (SBOM), which is analogous to an ingredients list on food packaging and contains all the components in a given piece of software. The FDA has been investing more time and guidance around sharing SBOMs in both pre- and postmarket settings, and so have medical device makers like Philips and Siemens, and healthcare providers like NY Presbyterian and the Mayo Clinic [78-80].</p><p>As monitoring and surveillance tools become mainstream, it is critical to have secure and ethical checks and balances. For example, upon graduation from medical school, soon-to-be physicians take the Hippocratic Oath, a symbolic promise to provide care in the best interest of patients. As connected tools increasingly augment clinicians, a critical question emerges: should the manufacturers and adopters of these connected technologies be governed by the symbolic spirit of the Hippocratic Oath? [81].</p><p>Inspired by the traditional Hippocratic Oath, a number of security researchers from I Am The Cavalry, a grassroots organization with ties to DEF CON, an underground hacking conference, drafted \u201cThe Hippocratic Oath for Connected Medical Devices\u201d (HOCMD) [82]. The Oath outlines a number of security and ethical principles, including \u201csecure by design\u201d and \u201cresilience and containment\u201d [81].</p><p>While the FDA has not called out the HOCMD by name, in the 3 years since the Oath was published, the FDA has incorporated elements from the five principles across the pre- and postmarket cybersecurity guidelines [83, 84]. The FDA has supported further collaboration between security researchers and connected device manufacturers through the agency-led #WeHeartHackers initiative, which launched in early 2019 [85].</p><p>Many government agencies support initiatives to improve security for medical connected technologies and healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs). For instance, Health and Human Services (HHS), sponsors the Healthcare and Public Health Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) joint Cybersecurity Working Group (CWG). The mission of the HSCC CWG is to collaborate with the HHS and other federal agencies by crafting and promoting the adoption of recommendations and guidance for policy, regulatory and market-driven strategies to facilitate collective mitigation of cybersecurity threats to the sector that affect patient safety, security, and privacy, and consequently, national confidence in the healthcare system [86].</p><p>In summary, as advances in technology enable digital tools to gather ever larger amounts of high-resolution personal health information, core principles of medical and research ethics must be integrated at every step, beginning in the design phase. Methods common to the consumer technology industry for obtaining agreement to corporate ToS, including privacy policies, are not sufficient or appropriate for obtaining informed consent from users, be they patients receiving care or participants in health research. The field of Digital Medicine must develop innovative ways of ensuring that the values of respect, privacy and trust are not lost in the pursuit of better data.</p><p>Part III: Categorizing Types of Digital Measurements</p><p>Are Digital Measures the Same Thing as \u201cDigital Biomarkers\u201d?</p><p>In some cases, yes. But not always. Determining the best term boils down to what you are measuring and for what purpose. Although we worked hard to minimize jargon in this paper, this section will have more technical terms because we strive to use the same language that regulators use to categorize types of measurements, and we want to arm developers with the right language and frameworks to work with regulatory bodies.</p><p>The FDA and NIH came together in 2016 to create the BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) glossary resource to help clarify terms in this confusing space [87]. BEST defines an outcome as any \u201cmeasurable characteristic\u2026 that is influenced or affected by an individual\u2019s baseline state or an intervention as in a clinical trial or other exposure.\u201d</p><p>Let us start by reviewing differences between biomarkers and clinical outcomes (Box 4). The purpose of medicine is to improve health and reduce the risk of an early death. Outcomes are essential measures to determine whether the practice of medicine is working. Outcomes can be clinical outcomes or biomarkers.</p><p>A clinical outcome\u201cdescribes or reflects how an individual feels, functions or survives\u201d [87]. For example, \u201caverage gait speed\u201d for walking bouts greater than a certain number of steps measured over multiple days outside the clinic may be a direct measure of mobility, which is one component of physical functioning.</p><p>A biomarker, on the other hand, is \u201ca defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions\u201d [87]. For example, a biomarker could be measuring hemoglobin A1c in diabetics to determine an individual\u2019s average blood sugar level over the past several months. For biomarkers, think \u201csigns,\u201d not \u201csymptoms,\u201d which are more likely a clinical outcome. Most of the time, biomarker measures are not the things that are necessarily meaningful to patients \u2013 but the measurements might be accurate representations, predictors, or monitors of underlying biology and disease.</p><p>In many circumstances, meaningful clinical outcomes such as survival or the occurrence a cardiovascular event may occur so infrequently that they are difficult or unethical to study directly. Biomarkers provide researchers interim evidence about the safety and efficacy of interventions while more definitive clinical data is collected. In some cases, it may be preferable to use established biomarkers as surrogate endpoints to reduce the risk of harm to patients [88]. Though biomarkers have intrinsic characteristics, they also have contextual ones. Depending on how a biomarker is used, it could have a relationship to a number of other medical concepts as shown in Table 4(Fig.\u00a07) [87].</p><p>Table 4.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Biomarker examples</p><p>Fig.\u00a07.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>The BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) Framework. In 2016, the FDA and NIH collaborated to draft \u201cBiomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools (BEST),\u201d which contains a description of seven types of biomarkers. All of these biomarkers could be measured using digital tools, which results in a digital biomarker.</p><p>Although traditionally most biomarkers fall into the modalities of molecular, fluid or imaging categories, more digital biomarkers are being developed [89]. A digital biomarker could be any of the seven BEST biomarker types [89]. The term digital refers to the method of collection as using sensors and computational tools, generally across multiple layers (e.g., a full stack) of hardware and software [90] (Fig.\u00a08). </p><p>Fig.\u00a08.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Clinical outcome assessment. Clinical outcome assessments (COAs) are the instruments used to measure clinical outcomes. The FDA recognizes four types: ClinRO, ObsRO, PRO, and PerfO. If digitized, they are considered electronic clinical outcome assessments (eCOA).</p><p>[Image omitted. See PDF.] Clinical outcome assessments (COAs) are the instruments used to measure clinical outcomes, and include the instructions to participants, scoring models, and protocols for administration.</p><p>There are currently four recognized types of COAs (Table 5) [91].</p><p>Table 5.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Clinical outcome assessment examples</p><p>The industry generally makes a distinction between a digitally collected COA and a non-digital one (e.g., a paper questionnaire) by putting an \u201ce\u201d for \u201celectronic\u201d in front of the acronym (e.g., PRO to ePRO, COA to eCOA). Interestingly, though, the lines between technology-based assessments and questionnaires have become blurry. If a wearable monitored your sleep overnight and then in the morning asks when you went to bed \u2013 was that evidence from a sensor or a questionnaire? As technologies continue to advance, there is increasing discussion around where digital measurement tools fit within this framework.</p><p>What if some of the human raters in the COA examples above were replaced with technology? For example, a medically informed algorithm that processes movement data from a wearable to rate ataxia.</p><p>The possibility of a fifth COA to describe digital clinical outcome assessments, and specifically those measurements made using technology, was proposed during a summer 2018 Public Workshop at the FDA, though no firm next step was defined [92].</p><p>Making human assessments digital takes far more work than translating a paper questionnaire into an app and putting an \u201ce\u201d in front of the tool (e.g., PRO to ePRO). eCOAs have unique properties that offer new ways to measure outcomes. What matters is whether the concept being measured is directly meaningful to patients.</p><p>Take for example, multiple sclerosis (MS). \u201cAbility to go about my daily activities\u201d is a meaningful aspect of health to MS patients.</p><p>A PRO (or even ePRO!) could measure a person\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living through a self-reported survey. Self-reported measures require the person to reflect on and assess their own ability, leading to data that are meaningful to that individual, but potentially fraught with person-to-person variability, and subject to recall bias.</p><p>A PerfO might measure the amount of time it takes a person to walk 25 yards. This is easy to measure and may be correlated with the capacity to perform typical daily activities. This approach has the benefit of not relying on patient recall, but it is an imperfect measure of the real outcome of interest \u2013 ability to perform daily living tasks in a natural environment.</p><p>A multimodal product may continuously and passively assess total daily activity (mins), average daily walking speed (m/s), and number of sit-stand transitions per day (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis>). This is a much, much closer approximation of the meaningful aspect of health than the PerfO or even the \u201cePerfO,\u201d but is not accompanied by the bias and subjectivity of the PRO or ePRO.</p><p>We can also combine multimodal data from sensors, questionnaires, and other clinical data (e.g., lab test, genomic tests) to create composite measures or \u201ccomplex biomarkers\u201d[91]. A composite measure consists of several individual measures that are combined to reach a single interpretive readout. For example, you could use sensor, keyboard, voice and speech data from a smartphone to construct a composite measure for cognition, and augment that measure over time with genetic data to make it more multimodal [93] (Fig.\u00a09).</p><p>Fig.\u00a09.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Human participation. Connected technologies can collect physiological and behavioral data. Some do so passively via sensors, while others (like sleep tracker surveys) may be more active in nature. Some are a hybrid where they will track some metrics algorithmically and then ask for confirmation.</p><p>Over time, a useful distinction between metric types will be whether the measurement required action by a human intermediary to gather the data. At the passive end of the spectrum, human participation is minimal, and sensors simply capture data as individuals engage in daily activities like eating and sleeping. At the active end of the spectrum, more action by the intermediary is required. This could include a patient entering information into an electronic sleep diary or performing a task like a cognitive test. Hybrids of these two measures that use multimodal assessments and combine active and passive measures will also be valuable. An example is using actigraphy to passively measure when an individual fell asleep, coupled with an ePRO asking the individual to self-report the time.</p><p>To summarize, depending on the context in which the measurements are made and the data are interpreted, digital measures likely fit into many of the existing categories for medical measurements (as biomarkers, clinical outcomes, etc.). In addition, technological advancement will present opportunities for new categories.</p><p>Why Is Measurement Important in a Clinical Trial?</p><p>The goal of any trial is to determine both the safety and efficacy of a new medical product. Measures within the trial process must demonstrate the product\u2019s safety and efficacy to regulators before it is allowed to be labeled and marketed for use by patients.</p><p>However, measurement in clinical trials does not only inform regulatory decision making. Early in the development of a new drug or novel medical device, a company will make business decisions about whether to advance their new product for further testing. Early intelligence is extremely valuable to biopharma companies, which face a USD 2 million revenue opportunity per day the drug is on the market (or not) [59]. Digital measures allow for the collection of data outside of the clinic, providing a more continuous stream of data points on whether the drug or device is working or not.</p><p>Additionally, measurement data from clinical trials informs reimbursement decisions, which impacts the value of the market. In countries like the US that depend on third-party (e.g., non-government) payers, insurance companies need evidence to decide <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">whether</emphasis> to reimburse the manufacturer for their approved product and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">at what price</emphasis>. In countries with a single-payer system, often the decision about pricing coincides with the regulatory approvals process.</p><p>Trial success is not correlated with number of measures. It is much more important to select the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">right</emphasis> measures \u2013 those that are the most informative regarding the product\u2019s safety and efficacy \u2013 rather than the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">most</emphasis> measures. In fact, medical product manufacturers, regulators, patients, and ethics review boards all worry about burdening participants with excessive tasks, activities, and technologies. The ability of a measure to effectively and accurately operate in the wild (e.g., out of a patient\u2019s home and across many geographies and languages) is also a concern. Medical product manufacturers are often reticent to assume even more risk \u2013 not just in their new product, but also in a novel measure \u2013 without a substantial body of evidence.</p><p>Decisions regarding the inclusion of digital measurement tools in clinical trials are complex, affect many stakeholders, and require extensive consideration of factors related to the clinical implications of the measure itself, along with considering the operational aspects of the measure and the potential effects on the trial design and on the participants (Fig.\u00a010).</p><p>Fig.\u00a010.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Fit-for-purpose digital measure decision tree. Decisions about what to measure in a clinical trial are rooted in the research question being posed. Whether a fit-for-purpose digital measure exists to help to answer that question depends on both clinical and operational considerations that involve many stakeholders.</p><p>How Can Digital Measurement Change Clinical Trials?</p><p>Traditional clinical trials collect snippets of data when a participant visits the study site and represent a tiny snapshot of patients\u2019 lived experience with a disease or condition\u200a. Yet researchers, industry sponsors, and regulators rely on this limited information to make life-or-death decisions and multibillion dollar investments.\u200a</p><p>Digital measurements will convert that snapshot into a movie with the ability to collect near continuous data outside the physical confines of the clinical environment, such as in a person\u2019s home, using connected products, including smartphones, wearables, implantables, and ingestible devices and sensors. Digital tools enable new forms of research like decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), which are conducted outside of the clinic to capture data about a study participant in their day to day life (Fig.\u00a011).</p><p>Fig.\u00a011.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Decentralized clinical trials. There are two components to consider to determine the level of decentralization in a clinical trial: whether the data are captured at a site or near the patient (e.g., location), and how the data are captured (e.g., manually or digitally).</p><p>DCTs have a number of potential benefits, including faster participant recruitment, improved participant retention in the trial, greater control and conveniences for participants, increased diversity (e.g., because it is easier to enroll in the first place), and trial results that are more generalizable [94, 95].</p><p>DCTs offer a way to make better informed decisions about the efficacy of new therapies. More sensitive, objective measures from digital technologies coupled with a greater density of information\u200a \u2013 \u200acontinuously sampling multiple times a day, not just one a quarter\u200a \u2013 \u200awill help the industry fail faster and win more efficiently.</p><p>Two features of data collection determine how \u201cdecentralized\u201d a clinical trial is [96]:</p><p>1 Where are data collected? (i.e., how dependent is the trial on a \u201csite,\u201d such as a clinic or hospital center?)</p><p>In traditional clinical trials, drugs, devices and therapies are administered in a clinic or research hospital. In newer direct-to-patient or remote trials, participant data is collected in the home or in the study participant\u2019s natural environment.</p><p>2 How are the data collected? (i.e., does collection require an intermediary like a study team or phlebotomist?)</p><p>In the past, most data were collected <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">via an intermediary</emphasis>\u200a \u2013 someone from the team would record information in a custom software system and/or case report form. As digital tools advance, we can collect more endpoint-supporting data at home via digital surveys and sensors, and study teams can \u201cvisit\u201d patients at home via telemedicine conference calls. This means that more of the data is participant-generated and collected \u201cvirtually,\u201d without an intermediary.</p><p>Putting these words into context, a doctor who remote teleconferences into a patient would be conducting a \u201cremote trial,\u201d but they might collect the data manually through a survey, so the study would not be considered a \u201cvirtual trial.\u201d In contrast, a study team might collect all the data passively from a smartwatch in a clinic, and this study would be \u201cvirtual trial\u201d from a data collection perspective, but not a \u201cremote trial\u201d because the patient is in a centralized location.</p><p>Notably, the industry has not yet settled on language around these types of trials, which is not unexpected. As a new field emerges, so does a new vocabulary. Historically, some researchers, primarily behavioral scientists, have referred to this style as a community-based clinical trial (CBCT) as a clinic may not be involved in the intervention being tested [97]. The FDA has been using the term DCT more often in the past few years to describe trials taking place at home or in the community [98].</p><p>What Is Real-World Data?</p><p>Real-world is a word we have so far avoided in this primer and is important to define as it is often misused. The regulatory definition of real-world data is the data collected outside of a traditional clinical study, such as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) [99]. These data sources include EHRs, claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, patient-generated data including in home-use settings, and data gathered from other sources that can inform on health status, such as mobile technologies [99].</p><p>Real-world evidence is the evidence derived from real-world data [100]. In the context of a traditional RCT, if study participants contribute to some measurements at home, such as pain measurement via ePRO or step count from a wearable sensor, many often mistakenly believe this would constitute \u201creal world data.\u201d However, these measures would not constitute real-world data because the participants have been preselected for study entry by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a given trial\u200a. They therefore do not represent the overall population in a certain indication. Therefore, when working with clinical research, it is important to focus on the benefits of health-related data collected in natural settings\u200a\u2013 which may not be classified as \u201creal world\u201d by a strict regulatory definition.</p><p>Verification and Validation: How Do I Assure Myself and Others that My Digital Measurement Tool Generates Good, Trustworthy Data? (Fig.\u00a012)</p><p>Once you have arrived at a construct to measure and you have some ideas about the way a digital tool could be used to measure it, there are a number of ways to assure yourself and others that the tool generates high quality, meaningful, and trustworthy data. Verification and validation (V&amp;V) are terms that are probably familiar to you if you come from an engineering or product development background. They apply to digital medicine, too.</p><p>Fig.\u00a012.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Image omitted. See PDF.]</emphasis></p><p>Verification and validation. Verification and validation are two processes that, together, indicate whether a digital measurement tool is fit-for-purpose.</p><p>Verification is the assessment of sensor accuracy (which describes the agreement between the measurement made by a single sensor vs. a ground truth), precision (which describes the agreement between multiple measurements made by a single sensor back-to-back), consistency (which describes the agreement between multiple measurements made by a single sensor over longer time periods), and/or uniformity which describes the agreement across measurements made by multiple sensors simultaneously). A sensor that is accurate, precise, consistent, and uniform will \u201cgive the right answer every time.\u201d By undertaking verification assessments, the investigator can also be assured that the relevant firmware/software that generates processed data is also accurate, precise, consistent, and uniform [101]. Verification answers the question: \u201cdid I make the tool right\u201d? Verification is an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">engineering assessment</emphasis>, and is entirely separate from data collection on human subjects.</p><p>Validation is the process of ensuring that the digital measurement tool is meeting its intended use by generating objective data that accurately represents the concept of interest \u2013 the specific way in which the patient feels, functions, or survives \u2013 that it purports to be measuring. Validation answers the question, \u201cDid I build the right tool\u201d? The concept of validation can be broken down as follows:</p><p>Analytic validation: Is the algorithm processing the data to report the measurement of interest? For example, is the algorithm accurately processing raw accelerometry data to calculate gait speed in a particular patient population?</p><p>Clinical validation: Is the measurement of interest reflecting the concept of interest \u2013 the specific way in which the patient feels, functions, or survives? For example, is gait speed a meaningful measure that reflects the ability of how a particular patient populations feels, functions, or survives?</p><p>To answer whether the technology is measuring what its intended to measure (clinical validation) and is correct (analytic validation), developers should work with researchers to ensure that validation studies are well-designed.</p><p>The most important concept to remember when considering verification and validation is the separation of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">sensor</emphasis> from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">endpoint</emphasis>. All sensors can be boiled down to the physical construct that is measured, such as acceleration, temperature, or pressure. Verification testing can be completed at the bench, and is the process of ensuring that the sensor works appropriately. Validation testing almost always involves human subject testing, and is the process of ensuring that the output data from the technology is accurate against a gold-standard (analytic validation) and an appropriate reflection of the clinical concept of interest (clinical validation). Answering the latter questions will often involve testing the technology with human participants, which may require an ethics committee review prior to testing (see Part II). Typically, verification studies happen at the bench without human subjects and so do not require ethics committee review.</p><p>Clinical validation has multiple dimensions. We will not go into all of them here, but one example is whether a change in your new measurement is regarded as meaningful by people with the disease. Do the results generated by the tool capture all aspects of the concept you are measuring? Do changes to measurement values predict certain clinical outcomes down the road? Does the measurement respond to an intervention that is well understood to have an effect on the property you are measuring in that population? Can the measure correctly identify those patients with and without the condition (sensitivity and specificity)? Likewise, does that property remain unchanged in circumstances when it should not change? (e.g., in a different population, or when there is no intervention). Of particular note in the realm of digital medicine is the reliance on computational algorithms, whose performance can improve over time given access to more representative datasets (see Part I). The regulatory framework to deal with such systems is under active development at the FDA [102].</p><p>Often, researchers will ask how a novel digital measure compares to a gold standard assessment. We believe \u201cgold standard\u201d is often a misnomer because many gold standards are not necessarily high-quality measures. If the most widely used existing measurement is suboptimal, more appropriate terms include legacy standard, where a new and better measurement has been developed, or current standard, in cases where the standard is acknowledged to be inadequate but no alternative yet exists.</p><p>For example, the legacy assessment in Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the six-minute walk test. This is a poor endpoint for a number of reasons. First, it does not apply to the roughly 60% of that patient population who are confined to a wheelchair and cannot participate in a walk test. Second, DMD trial participants typically range in age from 7 years (though this has been noted to be lowering in recent years) to mid-teens, so bias may be introduced in a number of directions; in some cases due to issues of diminished patient volition and in others due to coaching or gaming by parents of young participants. These biases may lead to noise that obscures and signal in the endpoint.</p><p>Finally, many consider that the six-minute walk test fails to demonstrate strong ecological validity, i.e. that it is a poor measure of how test performance predicts behaviors in real-world settings. Stellman et al. [103] offer an excellent exploration of the ecological validity of mobility outcomes, including the six-minute walk test, in MS and consider the opportunities for digital tools to improve these measures.</p><p>Regardless of the quality of a legacy standard, it is unlikely that a digital measurement will agree perfectly with existing standard. In fact, for this reason, digital measures garner a lot of excitement: they may turn out to be more sensitive than traditional measures or be capable of measuring something researchers have never been able to measure before. Traditional measurements not only provide only a tiny snapshot of information about a patient\u2019s experience of their disease, but are also fraught with confounders such as white coat syndrome, where a patient\u2019s feeling of anxiety in a medical environment results in an abnormally high reading when assessing blood pressure [15].</p><p>In other instances, a digital assessment may measure an aspect of disease that has been inaccessible with traditional measures. For the DMD example, a more inclusive digital measurement could be of upper limb mobility, which can be applied to a much broader population of DMD patients. However, there would be little utility in trying to tether this new digital measure against the legacy standard of a six-minute walk test.</p><p>To summarize simply, if the test can be performed by a good engineer or physicist who flunked biology, then it is verification. If it requires medical knowledge, it is validation.</p><p>When Is Something \u201cValidated\u201d Enough?</p><p>This depends on the specific application. Tools need to be fit-for-purpose. This means that the level of validation associated with a medical product development tool is sufficient to support its context of use, a regulatory term that refers to a description of how the tool is used and where it is applied [104].</p><p>The CTTI, a public private partnership co-founded by Duke University and the FDA, has developed comprehensive recommendations and resources on developing digital measurement tools for use as clinical trial endpoints [105]. This may be a valuable resource to anyone looking to understand the body of evidence that is required to support the use of a digital medicine tool in a clinical trial.</p><p>The Increasing Overlap between Clinical Research and Care</p><p>Historically, measures that support research (endpoints) and care (outcomes) were siloed. But that is changing: many clinically validated endpoints used in research will likely transition into clinical care. A number of companies are working towards a universal vision of human digital measurement across the continuum of research and clinical care. Clinical research provides a practical use-case to link (or validate) everyday behaviors and outcomes. Companies that develop digital biomarkers validate these tools through clinical research as a first step towards what may eventually become a validated digital diagnostic or a digital therapeutic.</p><p>Similarly, a number of big tech companies are also developing digital measures for clinical settings. In 2018, the FDA cleared a \u201csoftware as a medical device\u201d (SaMD) for the Apple Watch, which can determine the presence of atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart condition. This clearance provides a regulatory pathway for companies to create more advanced diagnostics and interventions for the patient, at home, decentralized.</p><p>There is crossover in use cases between research and routine care, such as the safety monitoring of trial participants during the course of a clinical study. However, even in such crossover cases, the clinical trial environment is by its nature more structured and controlled than the variety of settings and scenarios where clinical medicine is practiced.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Our society is hitting an inflection point in digital medicine \u2013 more high-quality data than ever can be collected and remotely that can influence high-stakes measurements and intervention in near real-time \u2013 and now is the time to shape the healthcare community. There are a number of ontologies, frameworks, and decisions that we need to make to ensure that the advent of digital medicine creates a better healthcare system. Clarifying language and establishing a standard lexicon will advance the field faster, together, and with more trust. This primer is a first stake in the ground, and we expect and hope a common framework and understanding will evolve over time.</p><p>Our communities face challenging decisions, particularly ethical ones around surveillance, convenience, personalization, and privacy \u2013 and it is important to remember that all systems are first built by humans who design the incentives. Let us build an intentional future that we want to live in, and not an accidental one. We need to ensure that we adopt healthcare technologies that are worthy of the trust we place in them [106].</p><p>Acknowledgements</p><p>For refinement of ideas, frameworks, and terms relating to digital medicine, we gratefully acknowledge Adam Conner-Simons, Beau Woods, Jessie Bakker, and Emily Singer.

Although the internet giant is collaborating with several German banks, the move has increased anxieties that the big four US tech firms could soon muscle in on the financial services market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The banks fear that this powerful quartet - Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook - could turn their massive user bases into financial service hubs. Given their vast customer numbers and piles of money to invest, these tech titans would be well-positioned to capture the banks' current business. And at best, this could render traditional banks mere service providers to the companies who stole their client base.</p><p>Bafin, the country's financial regulator, shares these concerns. Felix Hufeld, the organization's president, recently warned that banks and insurance companies could lose a large proportion of their customers to tech companies entering the financial services market. Small and medium-sized banks were particularly at risk, he said.</p><p>But many regard the threat as exaggerated. If Big Tech wants to conquer the financial services market, it seems to be doing so in a remarkably slow and half-hearted way. There is little sign that they yearn to become banks in their own right.</p><p>Why, skeptics ask, would Google or Apple want the hassle of serving small savers? Not to mention the fiendishly complex banking regulations standing in their way. Furthermore, the financial services industry is still heavily dependent on national legal frameworks, another potential nightmare for international entrants. This may be the reason why Apple has yet to launch Apple Pay in Germany.</p><p>The fintech hysteria</p><p>It is true that Big Tech companies have been dipping their toes into financial services. For example, Apple recently announced a joint credit card with Goldman Sachs. But Apple and its weighty rivals test-market all kinds of new services, in many different sectors. Many of these fail and are swiftly abandoned; one new credit card hardly represents a strategic shift.</p><p>Anxieties over a tech invasion sound much like the recent hysteria about financial services startups, known as fintechs. A couple of years back, the talk was about how fintechs would inevitably kill off traditional banks. However, it quickly became clear that fintechs could barely survive alone, and desperately wanted to partner with existing banks, not supplant them.</p><p>Germans are also notoriously conservative, risk-averse financial consumers. A recent survey by marketing agency Brand Trust obtained by Handelsblatt confirms that German banks still enjoy a high level of confidence in their brands. By contrast, only 9 percent of consumers say they would trust Amazon with financial services. Facebook registers a mere 3 percent (see chart below).</p><p>This may explain the big four's tentative approach to financial services, especially in Germany. To use Google Pay or Apple Pay, customers need to have an existing bank account and credit card. Users can send cash through Facebook Messenger, but the service operates in cooperation with existing payment services like Paypal and Stripe. And as yet, none of the Big Tech companies have applied for banking licenses.</p><p>Of the four, Amazon has traveled furthest down the road towards financial services. But its financial facilities are all closely linked to its own retail business. Thus, Amazon Cash allows customers without a credit card to buy online, while Amazon Lending offers credit lines to traders selling on the Amazon platform.</p><p>China is the future</p><p>The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Amazon intended to launch something approximating a bank account, in collaboration with JPMorgan Chase. This prompted more speculation that hundreds of millions of existing Amazon customers could form the core of a new bank. Partnering with an existing bank would allow the Seattle-based company to avoid the hassle and expense of day-to-day banking.</p><p>As with many other online services, China points the way to a possible revolution in financial services. Chinese payment services provider Alipay has garnered a user base of over 600 million customers, with rival WeChat Pay not far behind. Prior to online payment services, banking in China was slow and highly bureaucratic.</p><p>The Chinese example shows why German bankers cannot dismiss the Big Tech threat forever. Disruption may not come today or tomorrow, but when their margins shrink in their other businesses, Google, Apple et al. may turn to financial services to drive growth.</p><p>Until that day comes, German banks will keep a close watch on Big Tech's forays into financial services. If nothing else, technology companies can teach the banks what their customers expect these days - speed, accessibility and seamless service.</p><p>Elisabeth Atzler has been a banking correspondent of Handelsblatt since 2012.

But about 4,000 years ago, one of our ancestors invented the wheel. It was one of the most important inventions in the entire history of humanity. Ever since, our lives have been shaped by innovations.  </p><p><br/>    Some of these innovations have made our life better \u2013 just think of vaccines or the telephone. Others have had more ambivalent impact \u2013 think of nuclear power. In any case, it is always hard to guess where an innovation will take us. And it is all too easy to get it wrong.  <br/>    As the President of IBMsaid in 1943: \u201cI think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\u201d He got it wrong, it seems. And so did Robert Metcalfe in 1995. As the founder of a tech company, he predicted that \u201cthe internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.\u201d  <br/>    The internet did not collapse. Instead, it has changed our lives. Could you live without the internet? Could you live without a mobile phone? Our entire life has become digital, and this includes the way we do banking. Fintech, as it is known, seems to be the next big thing.  <br/>    It\u2019s true that, in continental Europe, fintechs still account for just a small share of the markets for banking, payment services and asset management. Still, over the past years, they have received a lot of attention and a lot of funds. Fintechs are on the rise. They have entered the markets, and they are competing with banks \u2013 at least in some parts of the value chain.  <br/>    The question is: where will this innovation take us? Is it the end of banking as we know it? Will it create new risks? As I said before, it is hard to guess how innovations will evolve and easy to get it wrong. That said, let us take a very brief look at some potential futures.  <br/>    Scenario one: banks might embrace the digital trend and team up with fintechs. For banks this would be one of the more benign outcomes. And it seems to be happening right now.  <br/>    Scenario two: fintechs might break up the value chain of banking. Banks would end up losing revenue, market share and direct contact with clients. The result might be a more fragmented market where some players operate outside the scope of regulation and supervision.  <br/>    Scenario three: banks might still end up being crowded out. At the same time, however, the fintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. The market would become more concentrated, less competitive and less diversified.  <br/>    Whichever direction we are headed, there is one thing we supervisors worry about: increasing or unidentified risk. And there are indeed some risks that have become more apparent now that fintechs have entered the scene.  <br/>    A basic truth is that new players make the market more competitive. And that could squeeze profits and force banks to cut costs in areas such as risk management. This is a general concern we have.  <br/>    At the same time, bank funding might become less stable. New products, tools and services enable depositors to easily and quickly switch banks; they can select a better offer in a heartbeat. For banks, deposits might become a less reliable and more costly source of funding.  <br/>    With regard to lending, we are also seeing new trends such as peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Here, savers and borrowers interact directly \u2013 banks no longer serve as middlemen. As these new businesses grow, risks associated with traditional banking might emerge \u2013 just think of the risks from maturity and liquidity transformation. Some peer-to-peer lenders are already securitising the loans they originate from their platforms. Regulators will need to deal with the resulting vulnerabilities. The work on shadow banking done by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision might serve as a basis.  <br/>    Some fintechs also apply new models for scoring the quality of loans. These models are based on vast amounts of data and are supposed to be more precise than traditional approaches. But they have hardly ever been tested in a severe recession or a crisis. So we don\u2019t know how well they would work in such situations.  <br/>    In respect of asset management, new products such as robo-advice are now appearing. These are computer programmes that advise customers on how to invest their money. Depending on their design, they might lead many investors to take the same positions at the same time. Such herding could then enforce current trends, creating bubbles or bursting them.  <br/>    And then there are threats of a more technical kind: cyber risks. Cyber risks affect everyone \u2013 banks, fintechs and their customers. Arguably, fintechs are more exposed to cyberattacks and data theft. Their IT platforms are small and interconnected, and they often use public cloud solutions and outsource data storage. That said, fintechs are digital natives and are very aware of the risks.  <br/>    Ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to predict where the fintech journey will take us. It is obvious, however, that the train has left the station and is speeding up. Customers want to extend their digital life to banking; they want banking services anytime and anywhere. Those who can satisfy their needs will become dominant players.  <br/>    There is a chance that fintechs will deeply transform the banking business. It is up to regulators and supervisors to ensure that this does not come at the cost of stability. The issue is, of course, that fintechs often operate outside the regulated banking sector. With that in mind, policymakers should follow the general principle of \u201csame business, same risks, same rules\u201d. That is important.  <br/>    As banking supervisors, we focus on risks related to banks. In that regard, we are working on a number of projects.  <br/><br/>         Take bank licences, for example. We see a rising number of applications related to fintechs. In response to this, we have teamed up with the national supervisors to work on a joint policy approach. It will ensure that applications are treated in the same manner across the entire euro area. Risks that are specific to fintechs will be assessed appropriately and proportionately.<br/><br/>         We are also seeing more and more supervisors exploring and setting up mechanisms to facilitate the authorisation process for fintech banks. Innovation hubs and sandboxes are two of the key words here. And we too are seeking to implement a euro area-wide hub for fintechs.<br/><br/>         We are also assessing the risks that might arise when banks or fintechs outsource data or even entire IT systems. We already carried out some work in this regard; in 2015, we did a cybercrime survey, which was a unique project at the global level. As a follow-up we implemented a data base to track and analyse cyber incidents in large euro area banks.<br/><br/>         And last but not least, concerning the business models of banks, we will explore potential risks that emanate from fintechs and other non-bank competitors. In that regard, fintechs are among our supervisory priorities.  <br/><br/>     We have to closely monitor how fintech evolves and better understand its impact. Our workshop today serves that goal. It brings together fintechs, banks and supervisors, and it allows us all to share our ideas and experience. It helps us to shape our supervisory views and limit potential risks. And it helps the financial industry to provide modern and safe financial products. Such exchanges are vital.  <br/>    I therefore thank all those who are contributing to this event and all those who made it possible in the first place!  <br/>    Thank you for your attention.  <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-APMN50581620170425</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5ND8-PC41-DXCW-D160-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1309\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 25, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

At the same time, however, the fintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. The market would become more concentrated, less competitive and less diversified.</p><p>Whichever direction we are headed, there is one thing we supervisors worry about: increasing or unidentified risk. And there are indeed some risks that have become more apparent now that fintechs have entered the scene.</p><p>A basic truth is that new players make the market more competitive. And that could squeeze profits and force banks to cut costs in areas such as risk management. This is a general concern we have.</p><p>At the same time, bank funding might become less stable. New products, tools and services enable depositors to easily and quickly switch banks; they can select a better offer in a heartbeat. For banks, deposits might become a less reliable and more costly source of funding.</p><p>With regard to lending, we are also seeing new trends such as peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Here, savers and borrowers interact directly banks no longer serve as middlemen. As these new businesses grow, risks associated with traditional banking might emerge just think of the risks from maturity and liquidity transformation. Some peer-to-peer lenders are already securitising the loans they originate from their platforms. Regulators will need to deal with the resulting vulnerabilities. The work on shadow banking done by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision might serve as a basis.</p><p>Some fintechs also apply new models for scoring the quality of loans. These models are based on vast amounts of data and are supposed to be more precise than traditional approaches. But they have hardly ever been tested in a severe recession or a crisis. So we don't know how well they would work in such situations.</p><p>In respect of asset management, new products such as robo-advice are now appearing. These are computer programmes that advise customers on how to invest their money. Depending on their design, they might lead many investors to take the same positions at the same time. Such herding could then enforce current trends, creating bubbles or bursting them.</p><p>And then there are threats of a more technical kind: cyber risks. Cyber risks affect everyone banks, fintechs and their customers. Arguably, fintechs are more exposed to cyberattacks and data theft. Their IT platforms are small and interconnected, and they often use public cloud solutions and outsource data storage. That said, fintechs are digital natives and are very aware of the risks.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to predict where the fintech journey will take us. It is obvious, however, that the train has left the station and is speeding up. Customers want to extend their digital life to banking; they want banking services anytime and anywhere. Those who can satisfy their needs will become dominant players.</p><p>There is a chance that fintechs will deeply transform the banking business. It is up to regulators and supervisors to ensure that this does not come at the cost of stability. The issue is, of course, that fintechs often operate outside the regulated banking sector. With that in mind, policymakers should follow the general principle of \"same business, same risks, same rules\". That is important.</p><p>As banking supervisors, we focus on risks related to banks. In that regard, we are working on a number of projects.</p><p>Take bank licences, for example. We see a rising number of applications related to fintechs. In response to this, we have teamed up with the national supervisors to work on a joint policy approach. It will ensure that applications are treated in the same manner across the entire euro area. Risks that are specific to fintechs will be assessed appropriately and proportionately.</p><p>We are also seeing more and more supervisors exploring and setting up mechanisms to facilitate the authorisation process for fintech banks. Innovation hubs and sandboxes are two of the key words here. And we too are seeking to implement a euro area-wide hub for fintechs.</p><p>We are also assessing the risks that might arise when banks or fintechs outsource data or even entire IT systems. We already carried out some work in this regard; in 2015, we did a cybercrime survey, which was a unique project at the global level. As a follow-up we implemented a data base to track and analyse cyber incidents in large euro area banks.</p><p>And last but not least, concerning the business models of banks, we will explore potential risks that emanate from fintechs and other non-bank competitors. In that regard, fintechs are among our supervisory priorities.</p><p>We have to closely monitor how fintech evolves and better understand its impact. Our workshop today serves that goal. It brings together fintechs, banks and supervisors, and it allows us all to share our ideas and experience. It helps us to shape our supervisory views and limit potential risks. And it helps the financial industry to provide modern and safe financial products. Such exchanges are vital.</p><p>I therefore thank all those who are contributing to this event and all those who made it possible in the first place!</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1121214732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N9C-10X1-JCBF-S0RJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 27, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>IBM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>IBM (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001080</classCode><className>MARKET SHARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX626</classCode><className>FRANKFURT AM MAIN, GERMANY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Together, we have moved our city forward and accomplished much. Yet our work is not done. Many citizens have asked me about our city's future and my opinion on who should succeed me in District 2. I believe Barclay Harless is the best person for these challenging times.</p><p>We need to keep trust in local government, and Barclay will be a budget watchdog, an independent thinker and bring a fresh perspective to City Council. Barclay has a clear vision that spending must be kept in check and priority projects come first.</p><p>Barclay has the financial experience required to balance the wants and needs of our city. He's worked for both Alex Sink and Darryl Rouson, two public servants with very different leadership styles. Barclay's integrity is something that really matters. He has pledged not to use a political action committee and not accept large contributions from outside interests. We must have City Council members who are independent and adverse to pressures from large industries.</p><p>Barclay Harless is a fifth-generation Floridian and has been involved in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. After graduating from the University of South Florida, he went to work in Midtown during the height of the economic recession. He has served on the board of R'Club Childcare Inc., Equality Florida's advisory board for the Competitive Workforce Act, and the Louise Graham Center for Regeneration. Barclay has been the state policy chair in the St. Petersburg Area Chamber of Commerce and has served on grant boards for the Suncoast United Way.</p><p>Please make sure to vote by mail or on Nov. 7 for Barclay Harless.</p><p>Jim Kennedy, City Council member, District 2, St. Petersburg</p><p>* * *</p><p>Health care</p><p>GOP shares blame on costs</p><p>The Republicans latest desperate effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act died last week when they found, once again, that they had neither the public support nor the votes in the Senate to pass a bill that would have ended health care for millions.</p><p>Disaster was averted, but Florida won't escape these repeal antics without damage. The Republicans' decision to renew repeal efforts instead of dealing with the critical issue of cost-sharing reduction payments through bipartisan negotiations is going to increase costs for millions of Floridians like me who buy private insurance through the ACA federal exchange.</p><p>These cost-sharing reduction payments reduce out-of-pocket costs for people who buy insurance on ACA exchanges, making coverage affordable. Florida has the highest number of people enrolled through the federal exchange; two-thirds of them get assistance to afford that coverage.</p><p>The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation announced that it expects a 45 percent increase in insurance rates for the coming year for people who get insurance through the ACA exchange. Insurance companies have repeatedly cited instability in the market caused by repeal efforts and failure to address the cost-sharing payments as the main cause for premium increases.</p><p>There's a price to pay when Republicans play politics with our health care. Unfortunately, we're the ones picking up the tab.</p><p>Ramona Y. Burrowes, Ruskin</p><p>* * *</p><p>Leading by example - Sept. 30</p><p>Problems run deep</p><p>Like some individuals, our nation carries a bandaged, deep wound, a wound so slow to heal for generations, that when the scab comes off prematurely, we are forced to think about it again. The wound of racism and misogyny can't heal because a small but loud part of the body politic smolders in hatred, injustice, inequality and ungodliness, spurred by unintentional ignorance and intended deceptiveness to fan the flames.</p><p>It will be healed with love, not with laws, and the realization that teaching coming generations to live a caring life will feel much better than hatred. The U.S. Air Force Academy superintendent made it clear that his institution will not tolerate racism and misogyny. Like-minded people outnumber the ignorant and deceptive. We have a duty to express our core belief at every opportunity with unfailing consistency and without anger: that words and actions of racism and misogyny have no place in our presence.</p><p>Darlene A.

But it also includes eBay, Uber, Lyft, Spotify, Vodacom parent Vodafone and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>Facebook says its customers will use a wallet from its new Calibra division to use libra.</p><p>&amp; We believe,&amp; libra states in its ideologically optimistic white paper, &amp; that the world needs a global, digitally native currency that brings together the attributes of the world's best currencies: stability, low inflation, wide global acceptance and fungibility.&amp; It says its currency will be underpinned by assets. The founding members have all deposited $10m and every time someone buys a libra coin, that dollar/euro/rand will be held in reserve against the libra coin. Unlike the wildly fluctuating bitcoin, Facebook says libra will be pegged against its deposits and that of the investors.</p><p>Quoting the World Bank's figures, libra argues that there are 1.7-billion people worldwide who &amp; remain outside the financial system with no access to a traditional bank, even though one billion have a mobile phone and nearly half a billion have internet access&amp; However, the how, what and where of the new system weren't mentioned. Immediately after its announcement, commentators began tearing the libra idea apart.</p><p>&amp; Spoiler alert,&amp; warns the Financial Times's Alphaville column, &amp; it's a glorified exchange traded fund which uses blockchain buzzwords to neutralise the regulatory impact of coming to market without a licence as well as to veil the disproportionate influence of Facebook in what it hopes will eventually become a global digital reserve system.&amp; The Open Markets Institute's Matt Stoller sounds another warning: &amp; A permissionless currency system based on a consensus of large private actors across open protocols sounds nice, but it's not democracy. Today, American bank regulators and central bankers are hired and fired by publicly elected leaders. Libra payments regulators would be hired and fired by a self-selected council of corporations. There are ways to characterise such a system, but democratic is not one of them.&amp; Central banks around the world have expressed their scepticism.</p><p>And more critics of Big Tech, which hasn't covered itself in glory, have also emerged.</p><p>In the past two years there have been innumerable scandals over disinformation, compromised personal data and passwords stored in unencrypted plain text.</p><p>Despite the belief that libra will bring blockchain and cryptocurrency into the mainstream, there are enough reasons to fear Facebook getting even more access to our personal data and habits.</p><p>Facebook is a business, whose prime reason for being is to make money, not to give the unbanked access to digital money.</p><p>&amp; We are all increasingly aware of how much money Facebook makes from our data,&amp; says Joe Lubin, the co-founder of the ethereum cryptocurrency.</p><p>&amp; What happens when you wrap your personal finances up in this too? That our digital identity will never merge with libra's financial data is a hard perception to shake.&amp; Remember when Facebook said it wouldn't merge WhatsApp and Instagram data with its primary social network? It then promptly did that and has been fined repeatedly by various European privacy and competition watchdogs. Has that changed Facebook's behaviour? Of course not.</p><p>As Stoller says: &amp; Imagine Facebook's subsidiary Calibra knowing your account balance and your spending and offering to sell a retailer an algorithm that will maximise the price for what you can afford to pay for a product.&amp; It gets worse. &amp; Imagine this cartel having this kind of financial visibility into not only many consumers, but into businesses across the economy,&amp; he adds. &amp; Such conflicts of interest are why payments and banking are separated from the rest of the economy in the US.&amp; In one scenario, Uber, as a founding member, could offer libra-linked riders discounts, which would give it a strategic advantage over other ride-sharing firms.</p><p>As Lubin says: &amp; Facebook's cryptocurrency is a centralised wolf in decentralised sheep's clothing.&amp; You have been warned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFW-3B41-JCB2-W3N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

But it also includes eBay, Uber, Lyft, Spotify, Vodacom parent Vodafone and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>Facebook says its customers will use a wallet from its new Calibra division to use libra.</p><p>&amp; We believe,&amp; libra states in its ideologically optimistic white paper, &amp; that the world needs a global, digitally native currency that brings together the attributes of the world's best currencies: stability, low inflation, wide global acceptance and fungibility.&amp; It says its currency will be underpinned by assets. The founding members have all deposited $10m and every time someone buys a libra coin, that dollar/euro/rand will be held in reserve against the libra coin. Unlike the wildly fluctuating bitcoin, Facebook says libra will be pegged against its deposits and that of the investors.</p><p>Quoting the World Bank's figures, libra argues that there are 1.7-billion people worldwide who &amp; remain outside the financial system with no access to a traditional bank, even though one billion have a mobile phone and nearly half a billion have internet access&amp; However, the how, what and where of the new system weren't mentioned. Immediately after its announcement, commentators began tearing the libra idea apart.</p><p>&amp; Spoiler alert,&amp; warns the Financial Times's Alphaville column, &amp; it's a glorified exchange traded fund which uses blockchain buzzwords to neutralise the regulatory impact of coming to market without a licence as well as to veil the disproportionate influence of Facebook in what it hopes will eventually become a global digital reserve system.&amp; The Open Markets Institute's Matt Stoller sounds another warning: &amp; A permissionless currency system based on a consensus of large private actors across open protocols sounds nice, but it's not democracy. Today, American bank regulators and central bankers are hired and fired by publicly elected leaders. Libra payments regulators would be hired and fired by a self-selected council of corporations. There are ways to characterise such a system, but democratic is not one of them.&amp; Central banks around the world have expressed their scepticism.</p><p>And more critics of Big Tech, which hasn't covered itself in glory, have also emerged.</p><p>In the past two years there have been innumerable scandals over disinformation, compromised personal data and passwords stored in unencrypted plain text.</p><p>Despite the belief that libra will bring blockchain and cryptocurrency into the mainstream, there are enough reasons to fear Facebook getting even more access to our personal data and habits.</p><p>Facebook is a business, whose prime reason for being is to make money, not to give the unbanked access to digital money.</p><p>&amp; We are all increasingly aware of how much money Facebook makes from our data,&amp; says Joe Lubin, the co-founder of the ethereum cryptocurrency.</p><p>&amp; What happens when you wrap your personal finances up in this too? That our digital identity will never merge with libra's financial data is a hard perception to shake.&amp; Remember when Facebook said it wouldn't merge WhatsApp and Instagram data with its primary social network? It then promptly did that and has been fined repeatedly by various European privacy and competition watchdogs. Has that changed Facebook's behaviour? Of course not.</p><p>As Stoller says: &amp; Imagine Facebook's subsidiary Calibra knowing your account balance and your spending and offering to sell a retailer an algorithm that will maximise the price for what you can afford to pay for a product.&amp; It gets worse. &amp; Imagine this cartel having this kind of financial visibility into not only many consumers, but into businesses across the economy,&amp; he adds. &amp; Such conflicts of interest are why payments and banking are separated from the rest of the economy in the US.&amp; In one scenario, Uber, as a founding member, could offer libra-linked riders discounts, which would give it a strategic advantage over other ride-sharing firms.</p><p>As Lubin says: &amp; Facebook's cryptocurrency is a centralised wolf in decentralised sheep's clothing.&amp; You have been warned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFF-80P1-JCB2-W2C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

The industry in the UK will continue to grow at 3.6pc a year.</p><p>At the same time, fees on those payments are coming down rapidly. Changing expectations from customers, tougher regulation and improved technology within banks have helped to make payments faster, cheaper and more accessible.</p><p>From a customer perspective this is welcome, but the profound change in payments is not over yet. Customers expect more from their banks, and if they don't get it there's a risk that others could step in to take over.</p><p>Fintechs and social media giants are nipping at the heels of the banks, but so far they have only made limited inroads. Newcomers such as TransferWise and Revolut are making dents in international payments and currency exchange. In between are thousands of operators targeting different parts of the payments business. Despite these efforts, the newcomers haven't crashed the barriers. In 2019 non-banks carried out just 8.1pc of global payment revenues.</p><p>The UK is at the centre of this upheaval. Fintech investment here is growing at a high rate, and our regulators have led the way in building faster, more efficient payment systems to promote competition and innovation. Customers in the UK have been among the first to enjoy instant, invisible and free payments.</p><p>For our banks there is a very real threat of being left behind in this brave new world. At worst, they could face disintermediation, being cut off from consumers by a third party. The Starbucks app, for instance, integrates payments as part of a wider proposition in which the barista knows the customer's name and their favourite drink.</p><p>The bank, on the other hand, has all but disappeared from the process and no longer has access to any information other than the top-up of the app. If banks allow themselves to become purely transactional in this way they will end up handling only the low-margin, high-volume commodity payments. Given how slim margins are likely to become, this is a route open only to the biggest and most efficient of operators.</p><p>But there is nothing inevitable about this outcome. If the banks can fight tech with tech there is no reason they can't use the power of the data they now own to innovate and offer customers more valuable services.</p><p>In order to avoid being pushed out of their own back garden, the banks need to do two things, preferably at the same time. They need to develop scale - become huge, efficient payment machines - and they need to differentiate themselves in the minds of their customers.</p><p>Consolidation within the industry is already under way, both among the banks and fintechs. In the UK, Virgin Money has merged with CYBG, owner of Clydesdale Bank, while in the US, FIS and Worldpay announced a $43bn (\u00a334bn) merger earlier this year. M&amp;A has a continuing part to play in building scale and improving efficiency, but technology is equally critical in creating low-cost systems that can handle huge volumes of transactions in real time or close to it.</p><p>However, being big and efficient will not, on its own, be enough. Banks also need to innovate and offer customers improvements they didn't even know they needed. Some will be about anticipating customers' needs, such as PayPal offering credit provision at the point of sale. Others will be streamlining existing services, such as Santander using blockchain to deliver low-cost cross-border payments.</p><p>The delay to SCA regulation provides the banks with an obvious opportunity to put their innovation skills to good use. It allows time to develop new ways of improving payment security that do not require customers to remember pin codes or Byzantine passwords. Facial recognition technology is improving fast and customers have become used to using their thumbprints on mobile devices. Banks will need to innovate or impatient millennials will find different ways to pay for their coffee.</p><p>Even with open banking, lenders have so far held on to the vast proportion of their customers. The long-standing trust we have for our banks and caution about new fintech companies have both contributed to customer inertia. That reluctance to switch will not stay in place forever, though, and younger customers are far more likely to change.</p><p>So far, social media companies and Big Tech payments, like we see with Amazon Go, haven't made a full assault on the UK banks.

This is part of the findings of a study by world-renowned platform economy expert Sangeet Paul Choudary Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe's parent company, Standard Bank's corporate and investment banking (CIB) digital unit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe parent company, partnered Choudary to launch the paper, titled 'Can Africa take the platform economy forward?', which analyses the challenges facing the continent's platform economy, the path it is likely to follow, and the untapped opportunities for long-established organisations. The paper, launched digitally, was authored by Choudary and Standard Bank CIB digital's Jonathan Lamb and Kent Marais.</p><p>  \"Despite several unique challenges across the continent, the platform economy is gaining traction in Africa as consumers and businesses grow more accustomed to online services,\" said the bank in a media brief. Embodied by the likes of Amazon and Uber, the platform economy refers to value-creating interactions facilitated by digital intermediaries.</p><p> Africa's sophisticated mobile-money market is one of the best-known examples of platform innovation on the continent, which is fast developing alternative infrastructures in response to the dearth of continent-wide traditional digital infrastructure, it said. \"As its platform economy takes root, Africa may well draw on the experiences of both India and China, whereby governments work to develop standards and create basic digital capabilities such as identity management, while private companies build out the necessary financial and logistics infrastructure,\" it said.</p><p> At the same time, opportunities exist for traditional African organisations to drive new innovations and develop new operating models in the platform economy.  With their extensive networks and ecosystems of clients and partner organisations, companies that are already deeply entrenched in the African market are well placed to facilitate the growth of the business-to-business sharing economy, in which companies drive efficiencies by sharing services, processes and digital assets, said Standard Bank.</p><p> \"Banking groups are among those that could seize this opportunity,\" says Kent Marais, head of CIB digital channels, Standard Bank. \"For example, a financial services organisation can provide a digital platform that facilitates value-creating interactions between ecosystem participants  clients and other partner organisations\".</p><p> In such a scenario, the bank said a corporate banking client that has developed a robust risk-management function could consider taking on the role of a capability provider that on-sells this service to other businesses in the ecosystem. It said platform owners themselves can also on-sell some of their own digital capabilities, which they have built up over the years and invested heavily in.</p><p> For instance, a telecommunications company with a mobile-money platform could provide credit-scoring services to ecommerce platforms keen on offering instalment-based payment options to boost sales. By participating in the platform economy, organisations have an opportunity to better serve their clients while also generating new revenue streams.</p><p>  \"Globally, the current health and economic crisis sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic has brought platform operating models to the fore, and the digital infrastructure providers behind them  cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google  are playing a crucial role,\" says Sangeet Paul Choudary. \"But the crisis has also resulted in a stalling of big-tech regulations,\" he adds.</p><p> \"Against this backdrop, there needs to be a focus on ensuring that we leverage platforms to develop solutions to humanitarian problems, and to ensure that organisations are more efficient and able to withstand this shock and the period that will follow.\" As the Covid-19 pandemic weighs heavily on the African and global economy, it is clear that platform companies are faring better than most, said the bank.</p><p> It urged African organisations to consider how they can participate in this segment of the market through building and owning platforms themselves or participating in them, or both. This includes ensuring that organisations are agile and able to adapt their services while also accessing new revenue streams.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRNCLE-THECHRON12072020026080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRNCLE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BM-W9K1-JCH9-G432-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436440</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Chronicle</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CMR7</classCode><className>PARENT COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Rather than adopting a gently-gently approach, the ACCC has produced draft recommendations that are extensive and dramatic. If implemented, they would significantly affect the way the digital platforms make their money, and help direct the content we consume. What's more, the inquiry is touted as a world first. Its findings will be closely monitored, and perhaps even adopted, by regulators internationally. </p><p>Who should care? The digital platforms themselves should (and do) care. Any new regulations designed to foster competition or protect individual privacy (both are among the ACCC's recommendations) have the potential to harm their revenues. They've a lot to lose. In 2017, nearly A$8 billion was spent on online advertising in Australia, and more than half went to Google and Facebook ( p3 ). News organisations whose output is disseminated by those platforms should (and do) care too. As the ACCC notes, more than half of the traffic on Australian news websites comes via Google and Facebook ( p8 ). Read more: News outlets air grievances and Facebook plays the underdog in ACCC inquiry Increasingly, news producers depend on social media and search engines to connect with consumers. Google is used for 95% of searches (98% on mobile devices). The rise of Google, Facebook and other digital platforms has been accompanied by unprecedented pressures on traditional news organisations. Most obviously, classified advertising revenue has been unbundled from newspapers. In 2001, classified advertising revenue stood at A$2 billion. By 2016, it had fallen to A$200 million. The future of newspapers' ability to produce news is under a cloud, and digital platforms help control the weather. Of course, advertisers care too. But the stakeholders with the most to gain or lose are us, Australian citizens. Read more: Taking on big tech: where does Australia stand? Our lives are mediated by Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Twitter and others as never before. Google answers our search queries; Facebook hosts friends' baby snaps; YouTube (owned by Google) distributes professional and user-generated videos; Instagram (owned by Facebook) hosts our holiday snaps. As the ACCC notes, they have given us tremendous benefits, for minimal (apparent) cost. And they've done it at lightning speed. Google arrived in 1998, Facebook in 2004 and Twitter in 2006. They are mediating what comes before our eyes in ways we don't understand and (because they keep their algorithms secret) in ways we can't understand. What does the ACCC recommend? The ACCC's preliminary recommendations are far-reaching and bold. First, it suggests an independent review to address the inadequacy of current media regulatory frameworks. This would be a separate, independent inquiry to 'design a regulatory framework that is able to effectively and consistently regulate the conduct of all entities which perform comparable functions in the production and delivery of content in Australia, including news and journalistic content, whether they are publishers, broadcasters, other media businesses, or digital platforms'. This is a commendable and urgent proposal. Last year, cross-media ownership laws were repealed as anachronistic in a digital age. To protect media diversity and plurality, the government needs to revisit the issue of regulatory frameworks. Read more: Starter's gun goes off on new phase of media concentration as Nine-Fairfax lead the way Second, it proposes privacy safeguards. Privacy in Australia is dangerously under-protected. Digital platforms such as Google and Facebook generate revenue by knowing their users and targeting advertising with an accuracy unseen in human history. As the ACCC puts it, 'the current regulatory framework, including privacy laws, does not effectively deter certain data practices that exploit the information asymmetries and the bargaining power imbalances that exist between digital platforms and consumers.' It makes a number of specific preliminary recommendations, including creating a right to erasure and the requirement of 'express, opt-in consent'. It also supports the creation of a civil right to sue for serious invasions of privacy, as recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission . Australians lack the protections that Americans enjoy under the US Bill of Rights; we certainly lack the protection afforded under Europe's sweeping new privacy law . Read more: Google slapped hard in Europe over data handling It wants the penalties for breaches of our existing Privacy Act increased. It recommends the creation of a third-party certification scheme, which would enable the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner to give complying bodies a 'privacy seal or mark'. And it wants a new or existing organisation to monitor attempts by vertically-integrated platforms such as Google to favour their own businesses. This would happen where Google gives prominence in search results to products sold through Google platforms, or prominence to stories from organisations with which it has a commercial relationship.

Rather than adopting a gently-gently approach, the ACCC has produced draft recommendations that are extensive and dramatic.  If implemented, they would significantly affect the way the digital platforms make their money, and help direct the content we consume.  What\u2019s more, the inquiry is touted as a world first. Its findings will be closely monitored, and perhaps even adopted, by regulators internationally. </p><p>Who should care?  The digital platforms themselves should (and do) care.  Any new regulations designed to foster competition or protect individual privacy (both are among the ACCC\u2019s recommendations) have the potential to harm their revenues.  They\u2019ve a lot to lose. In 2017, nearly A$8 billion was spent on online advertising in Australia, and more than half went to Google and Facebook (p3).  News organisations whose output is disseminated by those platforms should (and do) care too.  As the ACCC notes, more than half of the traffic on Australian news websites comes via Google and Facebook (p8).  Read more:News outlets air grievances and Facebook plays the underdog in ACCC inquiry  Increasingly, news producers depend on social media and search engines to connect with consumers. Google is used for 95% of searches (98% on mobile devices).  The rise of Google, Facebook and other digital platforms has been accompanied by unprecedented pressures on traditional news organisations.  Most obviously, classified advertising revenue has been unbundled from newspapers.  In 2001, classified advertising revenue stood at A$2 billion. By 2016, it had fallen to A$200 million. The future of newspapers\u2019 ability to produce news is under a cloud, and digital platforms help control the weather.  Of course, advertisers care too.  But the stakeholders with the most to gain or lose are us, Australian citizens.  Read more:Taking on big tech: where does Australia stand?  Our lives are mediated by Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Twitter and others as never before. Google answers our search queries; Facebook hosts friends\u2019 baby snaps; YouTube (owned by Google) distributes professional and user-generated videos; Instagram (owned by Facebook) hosts our holiday snaps.  As the ACCC notes, they have given us tremendous benefits, for minimal (apparent) cost.  And they\u2019ve done it at lightning speed. Google arrived in 1998, Facebook in 2004 and Twitter in 2006. They are mediating what comes before our eyes in ways we don\u2019t understand and (because they keep their algorithms secret) in ways we can\u2019t understand. What does the ACCC recommend?  The ACCC\u2019s preliminary recommendations are far-reaching and bold.  First, it suggests an independent review to address the inadequacy of current media regulatory frameworks.  This would be a separate, independent inquiry to \u201cdesign a regulatory framework that is able to effectively and consistently regulate the conduct of all entities which perform comparable functions in the production and delivery of content in Australia, including news and journalistic content, whether they are publishers, broadcasters, other media businesses, or digital platforms\u201d.  This is a commendable and urgent proposal. Last year, cross-media ownership laws were repealed as anachronistic in a digital age. To protect media diversity and plurality, the government needs to revisit the issue of regulatory frameworks.  Read more:Starter's gun goes off on new phase of media concentration as Nine-Fairfax lead the way  Second, it proposes privacy safeguards. Privacy in Australia is dangerously under-protected. Digital platforms such as Google and Facebook generate revenue by knowing their users and targeting advertising with an accuracy unseen in human history.  As the ACCC puts it, \u201cthe current regulatory framework, including privacy laws, does not effectively deter certain data practices that exploit the information asymmetries and the bargaining power imbalances that exist between digital platforms and consumers.\u201d  It makes a number of specific preliminary recommendations, including creating a right to erasure and the requirement of \u201cexpress, opt-in consent\u201d.  It also supports the creation of a civil right to sue for serious invasions of privacy, as recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission.  Australians lack the protections that Americans enjoy under the US Bill of Rights; we certainly lack the protection afforded under Europe\u2019s sweeping new privacy law.  Read more:Google slapped hard in Europe over data handling  It wants the penalties for breaches of our existing Privacy Act increased. It recommends the creation of a third-party certification scheme, which would enable the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner to give complying bodies a \u201cprivacy seal or mark\u201d.  And it wants a new or existing organisation to monitor attempts by vertically-integrated platforms such as Google to favour their own businesses. This would happen where Google gives prominence in search results to products sold through Google platforms, or prominence to stories from organisations with which it has a commercial relationship.  The organisation would oversee platforms that generate more than A$100 million annually, and which disseminate news, or hyperlinks to news, or snippets of news.  It would investigate complaints and even initiate its own investigations in order to understand how digital platforms are disseminating news and journalistic content and advertising.  As it notes,      The algorithms operated by each of Google and Facebook, as well as other policies, determine which content is surfaced and displayed to consumers in news feed and search results. However, the operation of these algorithms and other policies determining the surfacing of content remain opaque. (p10)  It makes other recommendations, touching on areas including merger law, pre-installed browsers and search engines, takedown procedures for copyright-infringing content, implementing a code of practice for digital platforms and changing the parts of Australian consumer law that deal with unfair contract terms.  Apart from its preliminary recommendations, there are further areas on which it invites comment and suggestions.  Read more:New data access bill shows we need to get serious about privacy with independent oversight of the law  These include giving media organisations tax offsets for producing public interest news, and making subscribing to news publications tax deductible for consumers.  Platforms could be brought into a co-regulatory system for flagging content that is subject to quality control, creating their own quality mark. And a new ombudsman could deal with consumer complaints about scams, misleading advertising and the ranking of news content.  All of these recommendations and areas of interest will generate considerable debate. What\u2019s next?  The ACCC will accept submissions in response to its preliminary report until February 15.  At the Centre for Media Transition, we played a background role in one aspect of this inquiry.  Earlier this year, we were commissioned by the ACCC to prepare a report on the impact of digital platforms on news and journalistic content. It too was published on Monday.

Its findings will be closely monitored, and perhaps even adopted, by regulators internationally.</p><h>Who should care?</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The digital platforms themselves should (and do) care. </p><p>Any new regulations designed to foster competition or protect individual privacy (both are among the ACCC's recommendations) have the potential to harm their revenues. </p><p>They've a lot to lose. In 2017, nearly A$8 billion was spent on online advertising in Australia, and more than half went to Google and Facebook (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries/digital-platforms-inquiry/preliminary-report\">p3</url>).</p><p>News organisations whose output is disseminated by those platforms should (and do) care too. </p><p>As the ACCC notes, more than half of the traffic on Australian news websites comes via Google and Facebook (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries/digital-platforms-inquiry/preliminary-report\">p8</url>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: News outlets air grievances and Facebook plays the underdog in ACCC inquiry</emphasis></p><p>Increasingly, news producers depend on social media and search engines to connect with consumers. Google is used for 95% of searches (98% on mobile devices).</p><p>The rise of Google, Facebook and other digital platforms has been accompanied by unprecedented pressures on traditional news organisations. </p><p>Most obviously, classified advertising revenue has been unbundled from newspapers.</p><p>In 2001, classified advertising revenue stood at A$2 billion. By 2016, it had fallen to A$200 million. The future of newspapers' ability to produce news is under a cloud, and digital platforms help control the weather.</p><p>Of course, advertisers care too.</p><p>But the stakeholders with the most to gain or lose are us, Australian citizens. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Taking on big tech: where does Australia stand?</emphasis></p><p>Our lives are mediated by Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Twitter and others as never before. Google answers our search queries; Facebook hosts friends' baby snaps; YouTube (owned by Google) distributes professional and user-generated videos; Instagram (owned by Facebook) hosts our holiday snaps.</p><p>As the ACCC notes, they have given us tremendous benefits, for minimal (apparent) cost.</p><p>And they've done it at lightning speed. Google arrived in 1998, Facebook in 2004 and Twitter in 2006. They are mediating what comes before our eyes in ways we don't understand and (because they keep their algorithms secret) in ways we can't understand.</p><h>What does the ACCC recommend?</h><p>The ACCC's preliminary recommendations are far-reaching and bold. </p><p>First, it suggests an independent review to address the inadequacy of current media regulatory frameworks. </p><p>This would be a separate, independent inquiry to \"design a regulatory framework that is able to effectively and consistently regulate the conduct of all entities which perform comparable functions in the production and delivery of content in Australia, including news and journalistic content, whether they are publishers, broadcasters, other media businesses, or digital platforms\". </p><p>This is a commendable and urgent proposal. Last year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/media-reform-deals-will-reduce-diversity-and-amount-to-little-more-than-window-dressing-83957\">cross-media ownership laws were repealed</url> as anachronistic in a digital age. To protect media diversity and plurality, the government needs to revisit the issue of regulatory frameworks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Starter's gun goes off on new phase of media concentration as Nine-Fairfax lead the way</emphasis></p><p>Second, it proposes privacy safeguards. Privacy in Australia is dangerously under-protected. Digital platforms such as Google and Facebook generate revenue by knowing their users and targeting advertising with an accuracy unseen in human history. </p><p>As the ACCC puts it, \"the current regulatory framework, including privacy laws, does not effectively deter certain data practices that exploit the information asymmetries and the bargaining power imbalances that exist between digital platforms and consumers.\"</p><p>It makes a number of specific preliminary recommendations, including creating a right to erasure and the requirement of \"express, opt-in consent\".</p><p>It also supports the creation of a civil right to sue for serious invasions of privacy, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/serious-invasions-privacy-digital-era-alrc-report-123\">recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission</url>. </p><p>Australians lack the protections that Americans enjoy under the US Bill of Rights; we certainly lack the protection afforded under <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/tough-new-eu-privacy-regulations-could-lead-to-better-protections-in-australia-96992\">Europe's sweeping new privacy law</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Google slapped hard in Europe over data handling</emphasis></p><p>It wants the penalties for breaches of our existing Privacy Act increased. It recommends the creation of a third-party certification scheme, which would enable the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner to give complying bodies a \"privacy seal or mark\".</p><p>And it wants a new or existing organisation to monitor attempts by vertically-integrated platforms such as Google to favour their own businesses. This would happen where Google gives prominence in search results to products sold through Google platforms, or prominence to stories from organisations with which it has a commercial relationship.</p><p>The organisation would oversee platforms that generate more than A$100 million annually, and which disseminate news, or hyperlinks to news, or snippets of news. </p><p>It would investigate complaints and even initiate its own investigations in order to understand how digital platforms are disseminating news and journalistic content and advertising.</p><p>As it notes, </p><p>The algorithms operated by each of Google and Facebook, as well as other policies, determine which content is surfaced and displayed to consumers in news feed and search results. However, the operation of these algorithms and other policies determining the surfacing of content remain opaque. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries/digital-platforms-inquiry/preliminary-report\">p10</url>)</p><p>It makes other recommendations, touching on areas including merger law, pre-installed browsers and search engines, takedown procedures for copyright-infringing content, implementing a code of practice for digital platforms and changing the parts of Australian consumer law that deal with unfair contract terms.</p><p>Apart from its preliminary recommendations, there are further areas on which it invites comment and suggestions. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: New data access bill shows we need to get serious about privacy with independent oversight of the law</emphasis></p><p>These include giving media organisations tax offsets for producing public interest news, and making subscribing to news publications tax deductible for consumers.</p><p>Platforms could be brought into a co-regulatory system for flagging content that is subject to quality control, creating their own quality mark. And a new ombudsman could deal with consumer complaints about scams, misleading advertising and the ranking of news content. </p><p>All of these recommendations and areas of interest will generate considerable debate. </p><h>What's next?</h><p>The ACCC will accept submissions in response to its preliminary report until February 15.</p><p>At the Centre for Media Transition, we played a background role in one aspect of this inquiry. </p><p>Earlier this year, we were commissioned by the ACCC to prepare a report on the impact of digital platforms on news and journalistic content. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC%20commissioned%20report%20-%20The%20impact%20of%20digital%20platforms%20on%20news%20and%20journalistic%20content%2C%20Centre%20for%20Media%20Transition%20%282%29.pdf\">It too was published on Monday</url>. </p><p>Our findings overlap with the ACCC on some points, and diverge on others.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Google and Facebook cosy up to media companies in response to the threat of regulation</emphasis></p><p>Many thorny questions remain, but one point is clear: the current regime that oversees digital platforms is woefully inadequate. Right now, as the ACCC notes, digital platforms are largely unregulated. </p><p>New ways of thinking are needed. A mix of old laws (or no laws) and new media spells trouble.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sacha Molitorisz is a postdoctoral research fellow at The Centre for Media Transition at UTS.

But the expansion of digital platforms has also raised concerns, including those related to consumer privacy, transparent and fair trade practices, and antitrust law.Regulators around the world are focusing on these issues. Earlier this year, the EU enacted a regulation intended to increase transparency and fairness in transactions conducted over digital platforms with EU consumers. </p><p>In the US, under political pressure, the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general are investigating many of the trade practices of major digital platforms.While regulation will affect Big Tech, nearly every global business has online components that will face scrutiny. Potentially conflicting rules in the EU, US and Japan will intensify compliance challenges. While regulation will affect Big Tech, nearly every global business has online components that will face scrutiny.KEY REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN JAPAN By early 2020, Japan is expected to introduce transparency and fairness legislation similar to the EU's recently enacted law. This legislation will set rules on practices including adequate disclosure of platform terms and conditions, contractual changes, ease of access to data, data portability and data interoperability.In addition, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) is expected to use Antimonopoly Act (AMA) enforcement measures to regulate certain aspects of digital platform businesses. For example, on August 29, the JFTC released draft guidelines that would extend the abuse of superior bargaining position theory to business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions. JAPANESE COMPETITION LAW Japan's AMA regulations regarding abuse of superior bargaining position, are different from abuse of monopoly power (in the US) and abuse of dominant bargaining power (in the EU). The Japanese concept does not require absolute market power or dominance. Rather, a company may have superior bargaining position in relation to its competitors. As a result of this lower standard, companies may face even greater antitrust scrutiny. The competitive impact of Big Tech mergers, particularly 'killer acquisitions,' has also raised antitrust concerns in jurisdictions around the world, including Japan.THE AMA AND B2C TRANSACTIONS To date, Japan has only applied the abuse of superior bargaining position concept to business-to-business (B2B) relationships. The draft guidelines provide several examples to show how the JFTC might try to review B2C transactions by focusing on the provision of personal information to digital platforms in exchange for services, and the circumstances under which antitrust concerns may arise absent express consent for the use of such information.Given that much uncertainty still surrounds the grounds for, and specifics of, applying antitrust law to B2C transactions, industry representatives and legal counsel will seek clarifications through the public comment procedure before September 30.Current enforcement practice may require adjustments to address the issues raised by B2C transactions. For example, calculating fines in antitrust cases involving vast numbers of consumers who do not pay for services will be difficult. However, the JFTC is empowered to issue cease and desist orders. THE AMA AND KILLER ACQUISITIONS The competitive impact of Big Tech mergers, particularly 'killer acquisitions,' has also raised antitrust concerns in jurisdictions around the world, including Japan. A killer acquisition occurs when an incumbent company acquires a smaller, innovative target in order to eliminate it as a competitor. The JFTC is assessing whether killer acquisitions should be subject to its review.Applying antitrust law to killer acquisitions may prove difficult. The JFTC's merger control jurisdiction is based on turnover thresholds applicable to both companies. Yet in the case of killer acquisitions, the acquired companies are typically startups with little or no turnover. The JFTC has the authority to investigate such a merger, but would have no way of knowing it was taking place unless the current guidelines are amended. To date, only Germany and Austria have introduced reporting thresholds designed to capture these transactions, but it is too early to tell whether they will have the intended effect. A BALANCING ACT Adjustments to antitrust laws will be required to apply them in these new contexts. For example, antitrust enforcement cases can take years to resolve. Given the rapid pace of technological advances, antitrust agencies should be encouraged to develop expedited processes. In addition, regulators should take a flexible approach, applying the laws on a case-by-case basis. Finally, Japanese authorities will take great care to balance the interests of consumers and smaller businesses with the need to create a regulatory framework that does not put a damper on innovation.Click here[1] to download PDF[View source[2].] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitecase.com/sites/default/files/2019-09/japan-digital-platforms-1009604.pdf\">https://www.whitecase.com/sites/default/files/2019-09/japan-digital-platforms-1009604.pdf</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitecase.com/publications/insight/digital-platforms-will-soon-face-more-regulatory-scrutiny-japan\">https://www.whitecase.com/publications/insight/digital-platforms-will-soon-face-more-regulatory-scrutiny-japan</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111568674847651251763300015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2N-01W1-JCMN-Y0B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><timeReceived>11:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

This article argues that what happens on digital platforms is no longer an externality or an adjunct to offline politics-it is constitutive of it and inseparable from larger political mobilisation.</p><p><br/><br/>The 2019 general election shifted paradigms in Indian politics. The more obvious shift was electoral: with the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) became the first party in 35 years to return to power with an absolute majority that seemed to upend the conventional rules of Indian politics. The elections were also intimately connected to a second societal paradigm shift in India that happened between 2016 and 2019, which, in terms of its political impact, is comparatively less commented upon and is understudied. This is the impact of the rise of a digital data-consumption society driven by the second-highest smartphone penetration in the world (Canalys 2019; PTI 2018b), and the highest average data usage per smartphone, which reached 9.8 gigabytes (GB) per month at the end of 2018 (Ericsson 2019). From the Gutenberg press in medieval Europe to mobile phones of recent history, whenever a new mass technology emerges, it changes the very nature of politics (Jeffrey and Doron 2012).<br/><br/>Discussion on the digital impact of politics in India has long been on the margins in Indian political studies due to the perception of a digital divide: the idea that the digital impact in India was limited to a small elite section, while the vast voting population remained unaffected by the digital discourse simply because they did not have access to the internet. While this may have been true in the past, the rise of cheap data on mass mobile telephony between 2016 and 2019 has meant that the digital divide is now much less relevant in India than ever before. Internet users in India went up by eight times between May 2014 (65.3 million) and May 2019 (581.51 million) (Telecom Regulatory Authority Of India  2019; TRAI 2014).<br/><br/>Estimates vary about how many of these users were active, but most accounts agree that by 2019, about half of India's voting population now had access to information avenues in ways that were simply not possible earlier (Election Commission of India 2019). For example, in early 2019, Google estimated that there were 400 million active internet users in India, with an average of 40 million users being added each year. More significantly, Google also reported that more than half of its searches were now coming from \"Bharat,\" or non-metro cities. Crucially, this rise in users was being driven by the fact that India's average mobile data consumption per user (over 8 GB per month in 2018) was on par with developed markets[1]. By May 2019, roughly one-third of Indians had access to Facebook (up from 9% in 2014), Whatsapp and YouTube (CSDS lokniti 2019). This cheap data revolution, triggered by the launch of the Jio phone network in September 2016, also transformed Indian politics.<br/><br/>Digital penetration figures show that widespread adoption of technology may have been the single-largest politics-shifting event of the past decade, altering the underlying neural structures of how local political mobilisation works.  According to Saba Naqvi, an Indian journalist, the 2019 general election was India's first \"post-Jio-election\" (Naqvi 2019).<br/><br/>\"Some commentators have asked whether this was a post-caste and post-identity mandate, and thereby, a post-Mandal one. I believe that the change has been driven by technology in general, and the telecom revolution ushered in by Jio in particular.\"<br/><br/>Self-regulation by Big Tech Companies<br/><br/>Amidst a wider public debate around the imperative to regulate content online, the 2019 general election was the first one in which major social media companies-Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, ShareChat and TikTok, among others-agreed to a \"voluntary code of ethics.\" This code was submitted by the Internet &amp; Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) to the Election Commission of India (ECI) on 20 March 2019. It entailed that the companies who agreed to this code of ethics would voluntarily agree to four key initiatives: first, they would conduct education and communication campaigns to build awareness on elections. Second, to create a high-priority dedicated grievance redressal channel to take action on objectionable posts reported to the ECI under various electoral laws like Section 126 of the Representation of People Act, 1951. More importantly, this included commitments by tech companies to take action within three hours for reported violations during the mandatory 48-hours no-campaigning-and-silence period for candidates before voting. Third, to ensure pre-certification of all political advertisements published onto their platforms from the government's media certification and monitoring committees, as mandated by the Supreme Court. Fourth, to transparently report paid political advertisements, and to label and disclose them as such (ECI 2019).<br/><br/>The results of these initiatives have been mixed. The awareness part was relatively easy. On election communications, Facebook, for instance, launched two initiatives: \"Candidate Connect,\" which was designed to give voters accurate information on their candidates and help people learn more about different candidates, and \"Share You Voted\" to encourage people to vote (Facebook 2019). Similarly, Google News Initiative conducted a \"Poll-check\" programme,  which constituted training sessions for journalists in 30 cities on fact-checking, verification, and data visualisation (Google India 2019).<br/><br/>On the removal of objectionable posts, the ECI later reported that 909 posts were eventually taken down during the election period by tech platforms through the grievance redressal mechanism (ECI 2019). Facebook removed 650 posts, Twitter deleted 220 tweets and ShareChat removed 31 posts. Youtube removed five videos and three WhatsApp service users were disabled after being flagged by the ECI (PTI 2019).  While the idea behind this move was sound, the numbers reported here are clearly miniscule, given the millions of posts and forwards that circulate on social media. \"Can you imagine the millions of crazy things that float online every day,\" asks one tech company executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"This is nothing compared to that.\" As Chief Election Commissioner Shri Sunil Arora noted in a government press release, \"the formulation of the Code augurs a good beginning but is essentially, a work in making\" (Press Information Bureau 2019). While this is only a small step in regulating big tech companies, the process now exists and can be built upon.</p><p>Political Advertising on Facebook and Google<br/><br/>On political advertising, both Facebook and Google launched Ads Transparency initiatives ahead of the elections, reporting the exact number of political advertisements they received, from whom, and also the amount spent on political advertising. Users on both platforms can also scroll through all political advertisements and view spending by individual advertisements, donors, geographies and timelines. Between February and May 2019, Google and Facebook declared cumulative political online advertising of Rs 58.67 crore. The money spent on both platforms was similar, though Facebook's ad library received a far higher volume of individual advertisements. Google declared 12,276 political advertisements worth Rs. 29.3 crore. Facebook, in its India Ad Library, declared a total of 132,419 advertisements worth Rs 29.28 crore.<br/><br/>The takeaway from these numbers is significant. The BJP dominated digital political spending on both platforms. On Google, it accounted for 41.4% (Rs 12.19 crore) of political advertising, with Tamil Nadu's Dravida Munneta Kazhagam (DMK) a distant second with 13.6% (Rs 4 crore of spending), and the Congress third with 10% (Rs 3 crore). The BJP also dominated Facebook, accounting for 14.7% (Rs. 4.3 crore) of political advertising, with the Congress coming in a distant second with 6.1% (Rs. 1.8 crore) of political advertising. The declared political advertising on digital platforms is extremely low. The Congress's declared digital spends, for example, were miniscule when compared to the Rs 820 crore it declared to the ECI as campaign expenditure in 2019. At the time of writing, The BJP was yet to submit its 2019 accounts to the ECI. But, for the sake of comparison, its declared spending in 2014 was Rs 714 crore (Times News Network 2019).<br/><br/>There are serious definitional issues on what counts as political advertising. Most political spending on digital platforms is not done directly by political parties, but rather by related affiliates or sympathetic groups which are technically separate. This allows for plausible deniability. Clearly, significantly larger amounts are being spent by political parties on digital platforms-for digital messaging, digital war rooms, or for troll armies. What gets reported and pre-certified as political advertising by parties is only a small fraction of larger political mobilisation activities on digital platforms. Even within certified and pre-declared sets of political advertisements on digital platforms, appearances can be deceptive. with much of the advertising money coming through separate, but supportive groups. Consider Facebook: while the BJP was the highest declared spender among political parties between February and March 2019, seven of the top 10 spenders on its advertisers list for this period comprised of entities sympathetic to the party. These ranged from \"My First Vote for Modi\" to \"Bharat ke Mann ke Baat\" and \"Nation with NaMo.\"<br/><br/>Caveats notwithstanding, the data clearly indicates that the BJP dominated the digital domain, at least in terms of declared spending. The online trend on electoral spending is not an outlier. It mirrors offline trends on party earnings. In 2017-18, the BJP declared a total income of Rs 1027.34 crore, while the Congress declared an income of Rs 199.15 crore (Times of India 2019). In this sense, online expenditure reflected the relative size of the offline political war chests.</p><p>The BJP and Congress on Social Media: A Comparison<br/><br/>There is often an assumption made that somehow digital platforms are tailored for the right-wing, and are easier to dominate with polarising messaging. The truth is slightly more complicated. On Twitter and Facebook, while Modi swept the field in 2014, from 2017 onwards, then-Congress President Rahul Gandhi started getting his online strategy together after the Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly elections and made significant strides. While Modi remained significantly ahead in terms of both followers and total posts, (see Figures 1 and 2), in absolute terms, the level of engagement for Rahul Gandhi increased significantly in the last two years.</p><p>Between June 2017 and May 2019, even though Gandhi tweeted only 1,497 times as compared to 8,201 tweets by Modi, the level of engagement per tweet for Gandhi increased over time. Of course, Modi's cumulative engagement metrics remained much higher, but in terms of average engagement per tweet, Gandhi was surprisingly ahead in both retweets and likes (see Figure 1).</p><p>Figure 1: Rahul Gandhi vs Narendra Modi on Twitter (2017-19)</p><p>Source: Loki.ai analytics.</p><p>Virtually, the same trend was witnessed on Facebook. Modi's 44.02 million page likes and 135.76 million interactions between January 2018 and January 2019 completely dwarfed Gandhi's 2.83 million page likes and 33.28 million interactions. Yet, in terms of average rate of interaction per post, Gandhi was ahead of Modi.<br/><br/>Figure 2: Narendra Modi and BJP vs Rahul Gandhi and Congress on Facebook (2018-19)</p><p>Source: CrowdTangle, 2019</p><p>Thus, while the BJP and Modi remained dominant on social media platforms, Gandhi and the Congress did put up a fight online. The Congress did not lose the elections because it was outgunned on digital media. <br/><br/>Further, the election's digital advertising trail shows a curious dipping trend for the Congress during the last month of campaigning. On Google, from around 22 April-a month before the elections-the Congress's spending on digital media dropped sharply (see Figure 3). While spending by the BJP also dipped after April-since only the last phases of the campaign were left-the Congress' dip is much sharper. Also, while the BJP's spending saw an uptick in the final week of the campaign, the Congress's spending line inexplicably drops faster in this last phase (Figure 3).</p><p>Figure 3: Political Advertising Trend on Google by the BJP and Congress (Jan-May 2019)</p><p>Source: Google[2].</p><p>Why this happened is unclear and requires further investigation, but the Congress, at least in this final lap of the elections, seemingly took its foot off the accelerator.</p><p>It is useful to consider this digital trend in tandem with the offline campaigning patterns of Modi and Gandhi. Modi addressed 142 rallies during the campaign, travelling a cumulative 133,349 km, as recorded by the Times of India's detailed rally-by-rally campaign tracker. In contrast, Gandhi addressed a fewer number of rallies (115), and travelled lesser than Modi (123, 466 km). What is striking is that early on, in the first half of the campaign, Gandhi had addressed more rallies and covered more distance than Modi on the campaign trail. However, in the final month, while Modi held numerous rallies and travelled extensively, Gandhi fell behind during the second half of the campaign.<br/><br/>Even more revealing is where both leaders chose to focus their energy: in UP, which accounts for the most Lok Sabha seats (80)-and which the BJP swept-Modi addressed 31 rallies (13,455 km) compared to Gandhi's 12 (6,564 km). Similar trends were witnessed in most big battleground states where the number of Modi's rallies far outstripped those held by Gandhi-West Bengal (Modi: 17, Gandhi: 3), Bihar (Modi: 9, Gandhi: 5), Maharashtra (Modi: 9, Gandhi: 4), Odisha (Modi: 8, Gandhi: 2). While rally numbers are but one indicator among a complex matrix of factors, they do indicate to the ground-game emphasis by political parties, and also compares the effort put in by the BJP and Congress in winning key states. While Modi seemed to be concentrating on difficult states where the BJP was facing challenges (like UP with the Bahujan Samaj Party-Samajwadi Party alliance or new catchment areas for the party like West Bengal and Odisha)  the rally pattern shows that Gandhi largely travelled more than to Modi to states where Congress already seemed strong: Kerala, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan (after the assembly elections in December).<br/><br/>One of the under-appreciated facets of the 2019 general election is that BJP changed 115 sitting party members of parliament, whom it thought would lose due to a local anti-incumbency factor. The party ended up winning 86% (99) of these seats. It is possible that in a wave election, the BJP would have won many of these seats anyway.  People vote due to a complex matrix of factors in elections, but campaign strategies do make a difference at the last-mile. In this regard, the contrast between both parties was clear.<br/><br/>Social media strategies between the two parties also differed significantly. One of the reasons why the BJP's official social media handles sent out a far greater volume of content than the Congress' handles is because even though Modi was the dominant narrative, they put out content from a range of BJP leaders. As one social media manager said, \"The Congress only retweets Rahul Gandhi.\" Moreover, in terms of operational message discipline, while every Modi tweet was retweeted by all BJP ministers, most senior Congress leaders chose not to echo Gandhis \"Chowkidar Chor hai\" line online from their own handles. Gandhi did not retweet content by Priyanka Gandhi, who was made the in-charge for eastern UP, even once during the campaign. Social media strategies can be a force multiplier, but in the end, they are reflective of the organisations they represent and can only be as strong as their backend.<br/><br/>Reflective of this is the gulf between the trajectories of the NaMo app and the Congress's Shakti platform. By March 2019, the Namo app had been downloaded 10 million times across Android and iOS platforms, and had sold merchandise worth over Rs 5 crores. While the NaMo app, which came prefigured on Jio phones, has its closed Twitter-like ecosystem allowing users to post their own content, it also served as an important two-way system for information-gathering and for conducting surveys (Sharma 2019).<br/><br/>In contrast, the Congress's Shakti platform-which reportedly registered 60-80 lakh users-was created as an internal feedback tool for the party leadership to reach out to grassroots workers, and is said to have informed party decision on issues like Rafale and the Chowkidar Chor Hai campaign. After the elections, the app was engulfed in allegations of large-scale \"bonus registrations,\" \"fake users\" and of \"BJP infiltration\" (Venkat 2019). <br/><br/>Further, according to a report that quoted an internal note by a party general secretary, \"between 75-80% of Shakti registrations are bogus in each state  Crores of rupees have been sunk by the party in sending SMSes to mostly non-INC people. Consequently, the Congress has a huge database of fake workers with incorrect mobile numbers masquerading as INC workers\" (Sharma 2019). The party's data head, who spearheaded the Shakti initiative, has denied the allegations but the controversy surrounding the app is revealing. </p><p>The Future of Digital Politics<br/><br/>However one wishes to look at the 2019 elections, the fact remains that the campaigns conducted were a fundamental marker in India's journey as it transitions into a digital society driven by cheap data. The steps taken by digital platforms to self-regulate content violations and transparency in political funding are nascent ones, and much more needs to be done. Yet, an important beginning has been made.<br/><br/>Politically, like the BJP and the Congress, a couple of regional parties like the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress and the DMK also embraced digital technologies, but most were not active on digital platforms. This has begun to change. While different parties adapt differently, one thing is clear: cheap data means that the underlying beliefs that drove many of our older assumptions about political mobiliSation has seen a tectonic shift. We are just beginning to unravel the effects of this change. Current politics cannot be effectively understood without understanding the contours of this change. While it has opened up multiple possibilities for our politics, it has also thrown up fascinating new questions for research.</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] Sourced from Unlocking Digital for Bharat: $50 Billion Opportunity, a joint report by Bain and Company, Google, and Omidyar Network.

Meanwhile, the Internet has become a leading supplier of radio signals, providing far-flung audiences with new independent channels and digital transmission of a slew of existing stations.</p><p>Locally, over-the-air broadcasting soon will begin undergoing enormous changes. In underserved markets, low-power stations could be allowed to hunt with the big dogs. The FCC seems ready to grant licenses to new entities, if only to inspire competition in an increasingly consolidated marketplace.</p><p>The biggest problem, established broadcasters say, is that the low-power signals could interfere with those of existing stations, and these entities would face less regulation. In cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, frequency spectrum already is almost filled to overflowing, so it isn't likely that many stations could be added.</p><p>Just as in the TV industry, however, the most revolutionary aspect of digital transmission comes in the expanded options available both to stations and listeners.</p><p>There is some bad news here, however, in that consumers will have to buy a new set if they want to experience the full robustness of a digital AM and FM signal. Blessedly, it won't cost as much as an high-definition TV set, and the channel numbers will remain the same.</p><p>''Existing receivers will work in the system, because, for a period of time, we will continue to broadcast in analog,'' explained William J. Casey, director of marketing and sales for Lucent Digital Radio, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lucent Technologies.</p><p>In early June, Lucent said it had successfully tested its In-Band On-Channel Digital Audio Broadcast system in live broadcasts with National Public Radio member station WBJB-FM in Lincroft, N.J.Lucent said there was no degradation of the host FM analog channel during the transmission of the digital FM signal over the same band.</p><p>Suren Pai, subsidiary president, said testing will continue in 1999 and the technology should be commercially available next year.</p><p>''FM will have a near-CD-quality sound, and AM will sound like FM does today. At the same time, you'll have the ability to receive data over the digital signal,'' said David Bickle, public relations manager for Lucent's New Ventures Group. ''A radio probably will have a video display, which could show the name of the artist, the name of the song, local traffic or weather.''</p><p>Mr. Casey estimates that a digital car radio might cost $ 100 more than a comparable existing unit, depending on the extra services provided.</p><p>But, as Ron Rodrigues, editor of Radio &amp; Records magazine, notes, we're not too far from seeing the day when wireless communications will allow car radios to browse the Internet for commercial-free or distant Web stations and receive data on a dashboard screen.</p><p>Listening to radio over the Internet, at home or at work, is a growing phenomenon. ''It's been a big issue for the last year, especially after Arbitron came out with statistics showing that something like 16 percent to 27 percent of computer users are listening to audio on their computers and the Internet,'' said Mr. Rodrigues.</p><p>What's happening, observes E. Van Cullens, president of Harris Corp., a leading supplier of products and systems for the broadcast market, is this:</p><p>''You're seeing that long-awaited, much-touted, overhyped convergence of voice, data and video, and you're going to see bigger companies starting to straddle those markets because you now have the technology to actually intermix these things. Everybody's going to end up in the same place, because a bit is a bit is a bit, and once you get it digital, it becomes a software game.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUGCHR-9907110262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUGCHR1999</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3WXM-4JX0-00DK-D30X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156942</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Augusta Chronicle (Georgia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1999 Southeastern Newspapers Corporation</copyright><edition>ALL EDITIONS</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"1999\"><dateText>July 7, 1999, Wednesday,</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>ALCATEL-LUCENT SA\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>\u00a0MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>\u00a0VENTURES GROUP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>ALU (PAR)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>\u00a0ALU (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>\u00a0ALU (BIT)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>\u00a0MSI (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS334220 RADIO &amp;

Their vast wealth was simply a result of the laws of evolution in the industrial society, and any attempt by politicians to circumscribe their power would violate their rights and lead to economic ruin. Besides, business at these industrial frontiers was too complex for the authorities to understand, let alone control. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But for a class that amassed its fortunes not only through entrepreneurial pluck but thanks to no small amount of fraud, bribery, cartel-creation and exploitation of low-paid workers, the backlash was inevitable. And so came federal laws to limit cartels and monopolies and so much public opprobrium that some of the barons turned to philanthropy as a way of regaining their respectability.</p><p>Does this sound familiar? At the frontiers of today's creative economy, the modern tech giants benefited from a similar state of lawlessness and, as the writer Shoshana Zuboff has pointed out, have used variations on the same arguments as the \"robber barons\" to stave off the regulatory state. Such interference would stifle innovation, violate speech and property rights and put a brake on economic activity, they argued. In 2010, Eric Schmidt of Google said the company needed no regulation because it had in-built incentives to \"treat its users right\". The same year, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg suggested that privacy was a dying social norm. </p><h>Regulate </h><p>That was a decade ago. Today, no global gathering is complete without a Big Tech leader appearing on stage to urge governments to regulate their business. Last year, Zuckerberg called for new laws in four areas: elections, harmful content, privacy and data portability. He reiterated the message in the Financial Times this week, saying he didn't think \"private companies should make so many decisions alone when they touch on fundamental democratic values\". At Davos last month, the chief executives of Microsoft and IBM both spoke positively about regulation of artificial intelligence. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai even supported the idea of a temporary ban on facial recognition. </p><p>No doubt those who run the Silicon Valley giants must feel that they're in over their heads. Having set up Facebook as a lark in his college dorm in the early 2000s, Zuckerberg finds his company blamed for facilitating the subversion of democracy, genocide, the destruction of whole industries and self-harm among young people - among other things. But it's a stretch to think that as market dominance increases, a company's appetite for new external constraints rises with it. </p><p>Rather, the about-turn is a recognition that public opinion has changed. Damaging scandals and a growing public awareness of their intrusive surveillance-based business models have led to a shift in public opinion and a sharpening political focus, in the European Union and the United States, on the untrammelled power wielded by these platforms. </p><p>Even if she doesn't win the Democratic nomination for the US presidency, Elizabeth Warren will have made a lasting difference to public debate in the US by bringing the idea of tech regulation into the mainstream. Driven by Warren, who is surrounded by key thinkers on tech anti-trust, ideas that were confined to the fringes of left-wing debate just a few years ago, such as the break-up of Big Tech, are not only being adopted by fellow Democrats but are being examined by government officials. The EU also has the same monopolies in its sights. </p><p>A digital strategy published this week spoke of forcing the firms to share their data, and the European Commission is working on setting new rules for how platforms such as Google, Facebook and Twitter police online content and disinformation.</p><p>In positioning themselves on the right side of the regulation debate, the firms naturally hope to shape that debate in their own interests. This is a common pattern. One of the reasons Philip Morris supported restrictions on tobacco advertising was that, with 50 per cent of the US market, it felt the new rules would block competitors eating into its market share. So sceptics will argue, for example, that when Google argues for regulation of facial recognition, it is trying to steer the conversation away from any threat to its underlying model of appropriating private information for its commercial ends. </p><p>There is a delicate balance to be struck. Facebook is not wrong to argue that serious questions on freedom of speech are in play, and states must be careful not to create such burdensome duties that no small entrants could hope to perform them, inadvertently entrenching the power of the big incumbents. Ultimately, consumers too will have to accept that the public good will involve some private cost of them, and that constraints on the platforms will require them to sacrifice some of the convenience they take for granted in their digital lives. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4181999</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8B-6C41-DYS1-0302-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 22, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In 2015, the Henn-na Hotel, near Nagasaki, introduced robot staff, and recently launched a sister property near Tokyo Disneyland staffed by 140 robots and seven humans. At the Ghent Marriott Hotel in Belgium, a \"humanoid\" named Mario welcomes guests in 19 languages, dances and \"guards the buffet\".

DS</p><p>03 Out of Africa Smartphones, now commonplace in sub-Saharan Africa, are helping to lift communities out of poverty. One estimate suggests the M-Pesa mobile-money system - Africa's dominant mobile payments platform - lifted about 2 per cent of Kenyan households out of poverty between 2008 and 2014. Other statistics show the continent has a subscription penetration of 82 per cent of the population and it's expected to reach 100 per cent by 2021, with more than 1 billion active mobile subscriptions. DS</p><p>04 Fast talkers In December 2017, the 5G specification was completed. While we are unlikely to see our smartphones enabled with 5G before 2019, the next 12 months will see widespread trials, including at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. 5G will deliver speeds about 10 times faster than 4G, and more customers will ditch their home internet connection and go fully mobile. But 5G's true power lies in the \"internet of things\" - trillions of internetconnected devices that can talk to each other. Smart traffic cameras, smart washing machines and trees with tiny sensors will become normal, ushering in a new era of connectivity.

The power to influence the people or the plot is not far away. Netflix has begun trialling interactive programming for children, releasing two titles - Puss in Book: Trapped in an epic tale, and Buddy Thunderstruck - with functionality for some smart TVs, game consoles, iOS devices and Roku boxes. And last December there were reports that the company is set to announce its first interactive series for adults. Stay tuned.

Declaring he's \"democratising democracy\", founder Jamie Skella says if the same-sex marriage survey had used his technology, the process would have been cheaper by a factor of 10 or 15. He also says that because his technology is decentralised it can't be hacked and is totally secure. It may be years before blockchain is used at an Australian election but the technology is ready to go.

Carol Lin, a Sydney-based Chinese student, uses it to sell vitamins and baby formula to buyers in mainland China. With WeChat, users can shop for anything from groceries to shoe repairs; book a taxi; or make a medical appointment by sending a text. It's quick, easy, and likely to head to Australia.

You can ask a weather bot for a forecast, a news bot for the latest news or a shoe company what shoes are in fashion. DS</p><p>10 Taxi drones We're getting closer to the world of the Jetsons.

Its latest offering is a cellular watch that uses the same phone number as the user's smartphone - you can contact a friend on either device with one number. Fitbit has been losing market share because the competition is offering many of the same features, and regular smart watches offer more. Fitbit shares fell 16 per cent in 12 months. Apple Watch has a more elegant design and its own health monitoring, and that may be swaying former Fitbit users. But the longer battery life and comprehensive sleep monitoring on Fitbit's Blaze 2 may bring some of them back.

But even that rate of expansion is not enough to power innovations such as AI, where millions of calculations need to take place simultaneously, so the hot money is heading to the near oligopolistic industry of microchips. Venture Capitalists tipped $US1.5 billion into chip start-ups last year, and at least 45 are on the case to build a better transistor. The massive investment is akin to what happened in the PC revolution of the 1980s.

GC</p><p>25 Silicon Valley next?</p><p>China may soon replace California as the destination of choice for technology enthusiasts, with Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen shaping up as technology hubs to watch. The Chinese ecosystem has delivered hits such as Xaiomi, Alibaba and Uber rival Didi Chuxing. A high level of government involvement has partly contributed to the sector's success. More than 20 per cent of the country's National Social Security Fund has been allocated to venture capital and private equity investments, with 1600 government-funded incubators across the country. While the first crop of Chinese technology companies catered to domestic users, China's technology vision is now going global.

GL</p><p>27-29 Personal assistants Google, Amazon and Apple are all fighting to get their personal assistants into your home. With Google Home, you can request a weather report or news, ask about restaurants and movies, and control your home environment. You can ask it to play music, or videos on your TV. Home can connect to local services such as National Australia Bank, eBay, Optus and Officework accounts, and give you AFL match schedules. This year, you will be able to ask it to order your Uber. Amazon Echo's Alexa has more than 1000 connected services. It can give you instructions for recipes, tell you how to mix your favourite cocktail, order food, turn on a coffee machine, and play games with you. It can also control connected devices at home and you can order goods from Amazon. Apple's HomePod, available locally this year, has Siri functionality. Audio equipment manufacturers such as Sony, LG and Sonos are building personal assistants into their speakers. CG</p><p>30 Digital nomads More and more people will work outside the office. A good internet connection is their lifeblood, but in Australia they will encounter large areas with no coverage. They'll also need a plan for when the power fails, and that means batteries or solar chargers.

New supplies are a click away with Amazon Dash Buttons. Stick the wifi-enabled panel near where you use the product and press the button when you run out of razor blades, for example. Dash Buttons, launched in the US in 2015, are still not available here, and you must be an Amazon Prime member and pay for each product button. Amazon has released software that allows automatic reordering (of printer ink, for example) through the Amazon Dash Replenishment Service. Samsung, Whirlpool, Brother, GE and CleverPet are among those on board in the US, and users can opt in or out.</p><p>Dash Buttons have not really caught on and are likely to be superseded by consumers simply asking an Amazon Echo personal assistant to reorder an item for them. CG</p><p>45 Lingo Until advances in machine learning and natural language processing deliver a universal translator, there's Duolingo, Memrise and Babbel to help you learn another language. Most of the apps are free, break a language into levels and teach users through games. Most aren't designed to explain the mechanics of the language, and the focus is on repetition and rote learning. The lack of human interaction is a key deficiency. Enter Virtual Reality, which is now being used by platforms such as Mondly and ImmerseMe to deliver an interactive experience through virtual scenarios and characters.

It's using EEG (electroencephalography) caps, thermal imaging, heart rate monitors and the equivalent of lie detector tests. Dolby's neuroscientists, led by Poppy Crum, produce a matrix of data to indicate how audiences are responding to screen entertainment. Are scary scenes causing goose bumps? Does a romantic ending generate warm and fuzzy feelings? In the future this bio-data could be incorporated dynamically, so that a movie could heighten the action, turn up the volume or even change the plot until your body complies. JB</p><p>48 Face facts British Airways won a global innovation award last year for its biometric self-boarding gates for domestic services at London's Heathrow Airport. The technology matches and verifies images of passengers' faces taken at immigration points. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and Brisbane Airport have also been experimenting with biometric boarding, but Singapore Changi Airport's Terminal already includes camera options at its boarding gates. Expect more widespread application of facial recognition to streamline boarding and disembarking. Camera shy? US-based Delta Air Lines is using fingerprint recognition instead of boarding passes for pre-registered frequent flyers in Washington. SK</p><p>49 Driverless cars Car-makers are suggesting they will offer \"autonomy\" in production models of driverless cars in three or four years. They work on a five-point scale: Level 1 covers active cruise control or lane-keeping systems, with only one function, such as steering or braking, controlled by the car. Level 5 means the car can do everything a driver can do. Audi offers Level 3 in its new A8 sedan - full autonomy within a narrow set of conditions with the driver intervening if required. For most manufacturers, the goal is Level 4: a driver can put her feet up within the stated limits of the system. PK</p><p>50 Information super-highway For autonomous driving to become commonplace, a few things are essential, including low-cost laser scanners, or Lidar, used to monitor a car's surrounds; extremely detailed 3D maps; and more intelligent infrastructure. That means traffic lights and road signs that can gather information about conditions and potential hazards and pass it on to cars. This is called vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. When it includes communication with other cars and pedestrians as well, it is known as vehicle-to-X (often V2X or Car2X). Once one vehicle has registered a hazard, such as ice or an accident, that information is passed on using radio frequencies to other vehicles similarly equipped, and to pedestrians via their smartphones. Every V2X vehicle extends the eyes and ears of a driver - or their driverless car - through an ad hoc network. The benefits include rerouting to avoid congestion and increased efficiency of the road system, as well as safety dividends. Shared information allows autonomous cars to \"learn\" more quickly about the countless potential situations they can encounter. PK</p><p>51 - 60 ALPHABET SOUP A is for Alibaba - Is there nothing this Chinese multinational can't do?

There's no need to carry special equipment, and it's safer than plugging and unplugging high-power cables. Many brands, from Volkswagen to Rolls-Royce, have included inductive charging in their visions for an electric future. BMW and Mercedes are expected to offer it for their plug-in hybrid cars before long. PK</p><p>62 Carbon revolution Victorian start-up Carbon Revolution has pioneered the manufacture of wheels using a patented technique and is the world's sole producer of one-piece carbon fibre rims. Compared with alloy items, they are up to 50 per cent lighter. Reducing the \"unsprung mass\" of a car - the wheels, brakes and so on - improves every aspect of its dynamics. Carbon Revolution wheels are available for performance cars from McLaren, Porsche, BMW, Audi and Lamborghini, with distributors in North America and Europe. More recently, Carbon Revolution won the contract to supply Ford with wheels for its limited edition GT supercar and a Shelby Mustang. The company is expanding production and lowering costs, with opportunities also in aerospace and defence. After a $50 million capital raising last year, it's on track for an IPO in late 2018.

GL</p><p>66 Eyes outdoors Community resistance to coal seam gas exploration is driving development of a network of sensors to provide a real-time window into potential impacts. The NSW Chief Scientist has recommended the creation of a State Whole-of-Environment Data Repository so that data from CSG industry operations can be interrogated as needed and in the context of the wider environment. Work is under way on a new generation of sensors and control systems to allow real-time monitoring of CSG operations that will enable automatic scrutiny of the resulting data.

HT</p><p>95 Artificial meat Concerns about the unsustainability of feeding grain to meat livestock, and their high methane emissions and water use, are revolutionising the food and agriculture industries. Replacing meat and dairy products with plant proteins was recently named as the biggest food trend of 2018. Think antioxidant-rich algae and seaweed grown in vast ponds and tanks, or large insect farms producing protein meal. Then there is synthesised or \"fake\" meat: stringing together meat-identical molecules and peptides on a 3-D printer to create burgers that taste like \"real\" meat. SN</p><p>96 Vertical farming With the world's population exploding to 9.5 billion by 2050, food demand is soaring as productive land is being swallowed by urbanisation and water becomes a finite resource. One solution is vertical farming. Skyscrapers in cities such as Tokyo and Amsterdam are already cultivating mushrooms in their basements, farming chickens on multiple floors, growing hydroponic tomatoes and cucumbers in the levels above, and harvesting water from the roof. Other ideas include expanding fish farms, developing new algae and seaweed \"farms\", growing vegetables and crops on floating barges using desalinated water, and farming the deserts. The $90 million Sundrop farm in South Australia's Port Augusta uses solar thermal power generation to convert seawater to fresh water providing hydroponic water and cooling to massive off-grid greenhouses. These are now growing 20 per cent of all truss tomatoes and cucumbers for Coles. SN</p><p>97 Precision farming Tractors already use GPS to drive around paddocks and plant seeds. Robots can photograph, identify and spray vegetable and fruit crops 24/7. Drones can check water troughs on vast cattle stations, or fly over pecan and almond crops checking for canopy \"hot spots\". Farmers can use commercial satellites to measure the rate of their crop and pasture (biomass) growth. Matched with iPad farm management programs, these can tell producers to the exact kilogram how much dry feed is left in paddocks or when it is time to move the herd. Grain growers will increasingly use overlay digital paddock mapping to \"tell\" their fertiliser spreaders when and where to apply nutrients, reducing costs. SN</p><p>98 Liquid biopsy Australian researchers are part of a major medical move to use a technique known as liquid biopsy to detect cancers at an early stage. The technique has attracted intense commercial and research interest because of its potential to change our approach to managing cancers. One blood test, CancerSEEK, can detect eight of the most common cancers long before they turn lethal.</p><p>It was recently announced in the journal Science, and was developed by an international team led by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, with three researchers from Melbourne's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute contributing. HT</p><p>99 Retail Amazon Marketplace landed in Australia in December amid huge hype and trepidation from our $300 billion retail sector.</p><p>This is the nature of the Amazon beast, well on its way to a market capitalisation of $US1 trillion, and so large in its reach, scope and power that some lawmakers are even beginning to talk openly about the idea of forcibly breaking up the world's biggest retailer in the same way John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil was spilt apart for anti-trust violations. For the past few decades Australia has been sheltered from the full onslaught of Amazon, but the arrival of Amazon Marketplace, and the expected launch here this year of its premium service Amazon Prime, changes all that. The world's biggest retailer offers a universe of shopping options combined with discounts and speedy shipping. Retail will never be the same again.

Chatting on WhatsApp, watching Netflix, sharing your work calendar with colleagues - all these services use the cloud, a network of remote servers accessed over the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the cloud systems used by Europe have long been far from European. In fact, according to the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies, just four per cent of western world data is currently stored in Europe.</p><p>Europe's voice on the international cloud market has been largely confined to a whisper, drowned out by a select few who have grown all too large and powerful.</p><p>Signs that we are heading towards data monopolisation are plain to see. Of the $56bn generated globally between 2017-2018 by on-demand cloud computing platforms known as \"infrastructure as a service (IaaS), three quarters of that cash went directly to the top five providers. Four of those providers were American, one was Chinese, and zero were European.</p><p>The extent to which the big tech companies now control how and where our data is held was brought home forcefully by Google's decision to move the data of millions of British users from its European HQ in Ireland back to the US.</p><p>European nations have recently moved to rectify this imbalance. The launch of European Cloud Service Gaia X in November last year by Germany and France put data at the heart of the continent's agenda for the first time. Linking various cloud providers across a European platform subject to robust data privacy and security standards, Gaia X's quintessentially \"made in Europe\" message offers an opportunity for Europe to obtain the digital resilience and data capability that has been long been overdue.</p><p>However, trends elsewhere in Europe have yet to impact the UK. Top level interest in developing our own data capability remains low, and we continue to procure public sector services from the same small circle of big international tech players. According to 2019 figures from the approved supplier's marketplace known as G-Cloud, Amazon Web Services (the cloud computing arm of the tech giant) was the leading supplier to the government, at nearly \u00a383m.</p><p>This level of market influence is uncomfortable when you take time to consider the immense importance that data has to our economy - and also to sensitive areas such as healthcare and national security.</p><p>Britain is the most significant digital economy in Europe, with investment in the tech industry last year more than twice that of Germany and France combined. Nevertheless, we are at risk of losing out if Europe becomes a pioneer in cloud networking. As we forge new trade deals, the opportunity to invest in our own national data capability has never been stronger. Some of the world's most innovative and competent tech businesses are based right here in the UK, and there is a hunger among companies, industry specialists and individuals alike to create a UK cloud provider platform - the benefits of which would be enormous both socially and economically. Developing our own version of Gaia X has the potential to provide Britain with a transparent and regulated national capability that could begin to level the playing field among a variety of suppliers: small and large, British and international. In turn, we will be able to harness the power of our data assets across new industries, generating new wealth and jobs and forging a twenty-first century tech sector driven by the latest innovations.</p><p>Such a development would make Britain a formidable tech powerhouse, and grant us real digital sovereignty.</p><p>\u00a3 Margot James is a former minister for digital and creative industries.</p><p>Britain is at risk of losing out if Europe becomes a pioneer in cloud networking</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-158091370</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBX-6HR1-JCBW-N0J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City A.M.

But even he is apparently unaware of the power of his empire, which includes Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. This week, he demanded that politics should regulate him more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zuckerberg is thus also reacting to the increasing unease about Big Tech. The industry's superstars, most of whom are based in the USA, have now reached a size that dominates not only people's everyday lives but also the economic order.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has long since recognised this. At ever shorter intervals, stability watchdogs from Washington warn against the dominance of the superstars. Shortly before the start of this year's spring meeting in Washington, the IMF supervisors are again dedicating one of their important chapters in the current World Economic Outlook (WEO) to the phenomenon. \"We don't have a monopoly problem yet. But we should take appropriate measures so that we don't even get one,\" warns IMF chief Christine Lagarde.</p><p>The financial guardians are also so concerned because, almost at the same time as the rise of the superstar firms, growing inequality, slower economic growth and overall less dynamism have developed, at least in the industrialised countries. The IMF experts therefore aim to find out whether there is an economic connection between the two phenomena.</p><p>In the background there is always the concern that the world economy could experience a relapse into the dark times of monopolization, as it had already existed during the industrial revolution in the late 19th century.</p><p>The IMF does not want to go that far. In the study there is no reference to the phenomena of that time. Nevertheless, the Monetary Fund warns of the superstar firms that are moving away, while social progress falls by the wayside and competition and progress are hampered. Supervisors have identified some worrying trends.</p><p>These include the decline in the wage share in important OECD countries, falling investments despite low interest rates and rising stock market valuations. But the IMF economists have also identified growing profit margins and increasing concentration. \"Could the growing market power of the colossuses be a factor behind the weakening growth and rising inequality?\" is one of the central questions.</p><p>To find answers, economists have surveyed nearly one million companies in 27 countries. They have looked at the profit surcharges that companies can take on the manufacturing costs when selling their products.</p><p>Since the turn of the millennium, average premiums in the industrialised countries have risen by no less than eight percent. This was accompanied by an increase in company concentration.</p><p>The increase in profit surcharges in the USA was particularly severe. Since the turn of the millennium, these have risen by around 15 percent, twice as fast as the profit surcharges of European counterparts. But the increasing monopolisation is not proceeding at the same pace in all sectors.</p><p>While no superstar companies have yet formed in traditional industries that can demand higher profit margins, the situation is different in technology-heavy industries. Wherever products and services can be digitized, the monopoly risk is greatest. This is due to the so-called network effect, which results in the value of a company growing exponentially with an increasing number of customers. It is a phenomenon known in the business world as the \"winner takes most\" effect.</p><p> \"We are dealing with a 'winner-takes-most' dynamic, which is particularly pronounced in the digital economy,\" Lagarde warned of the fact that in certain sectors some companies have now achieved such a leading position that it is difficult to deal with them by competition alone.</p><p>The IMF economists are by no means the only ones who are concerned about growing monopolisation. In a recently published study, the British Barclays Bank also addresses the phenomenon of the increasing market power of a few corporations - and how this is reflected in the business world. Of particular concern is the rapid increase in concentration in certain industries, particularly Big Tech. In the competition index determined by the analysts, competition has been on the retreat since the turn of the millennium in 75 percent of all sectors surveyed.</p><p>The fact that this development also has an impact on the dynamic economic fabric is also shown by statistics on new business start-ups and closures in the USA. Both the new companies and those that were unable to hold their own in the market recently experienced new lows. This can be interpreted as an indication that market concentration is increasing. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter has already recognised that creative destruction is important for the growth of national economies.</p><p>In this context, the new superstars from the technology scene are probably particularly dangerous. Thanks to their power, they can keep weaker competitors and imitators small or buy them up, thus increasing concentration and the trend towards monopolisation. \"The digital business models have produced powerful players that recall the era of the Gilded Age,\" according to a study by independent analysts Bernstein Research.</p><p>This refers to the time at the end of the 19th century, when heavily wealthy families like the Rockefellers also publicly displayed their wealth and splendour and made a name for themselves with generous donations and gained political influence.</p><p>Only a public riot against the so-called robber barons led to the so-called Sherman Act, named after the US Senator John Sherman, and to the smashing of Rockefeller's Standard Oil in 1911. 60 years later another anti-monopoly movement took place in the USA, at the end of which the telephone company AT&amp;T was smashed in 1982.</p><p>Note: This article has been translated automatically.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVWE20190404DWBEHPWIRTSCHAFTBH5PHB2I1TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DIEWEN-163247743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIEWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT7-TMN1-DY2B-S1KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465485</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Axel Springer SE All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Die Welt (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12658\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>Ausg. 80</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 4, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While a century ago many of these utilities began as independent companies competing for customers, this was not a sustainable model: it is costly and inefficient to install competing sets of wires on every street. The greater efficiency of having a single supplier is what makes such utilities natural monopolies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The absence of competition is a potential challenge - a monopoly supplier can charge exceptionally high prices, which is clearly not in the public interest, especially with vital infrastructure like electricity and water. </p><p>While the classic solution to monopoly is to break up the dominant firm into businesses that compete with each other, this is not a good option for natural monopolies because multiple suppliers would be so much more inefficient and costly than a single provider. </p><p>Instead the solution in most European countries was to bring utility networks into public ownership. When the ESB was set up in 1927 it took over a number of private and local authority electricity businesses. </p><p>However, even nationalised utilities remain monopolies. While the state can control the price these utilities charge, it has been much less effective in containing their costs. In essential services that face no direct competition costs may push upwards, for example through inefficient work practices or staffing levels. </p><p>That is why across Europe independent regulators have been created in areas like electricity, gas and water. Their job is to ensure that the price charged for the monopoly services is reasonable and that the cost base of the regulated firms is not over-inflated. In addition, competitive parts of the monopoly utility companies have been hived off. </p><p>The internet has seen the growth of a new range of massive firms like Google and Facebook which have many of the characteristics of networks, and have near-monopolies in the niche businesses that they have developed.</p><h>Crowded marketplace </h><p>Facebook provides a very convenient platform for friends, including those in distant places, to keep in touch. While it began in a more crowded marketplace with other apps like MySpace and Bebo, it has now come to dominate its segment of the market.  </p><p>It has reached a scale where most of the direct competition has faded away. Likewise Google from early on established a dominance in the field of web search. These companies are now among the biggest and most profitable on the planet.</p><p>Other tech companies or platforms like YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp have emerged to dominate their particular segments of the market. </p><p>While the services of social media companies to some extent overlap, they each have their distinctive niche which they dominate worldwide. While this dominance could prove to be temporary, the bigger and more ubiquitous these companies become the harder it is for new entrants to take them on.</p><p>The global dominance of these firms has seen their profitability rocket. The extent of their user base and global reach, along with the data they harvest on their customers who use these services \"for free\", makes them massively profitable media for targeted advertising. </p><p>Where network services are provided on a national basis, it is national authorities that regulate them. </p><p>However, because of their global nature, these new technology monopolies are not amenable to national regulation, and there is no realistic prospect of supranational regulation. As a result these firms remain hugely profitable, benefiting from their monopoly position.</p><p>This is the background to the proposals emerging across Europe to raise a special tax on the big tech firms. </p><p>There is a related political concern about the influence these companies can wield through their unique capacity to reach and target voters, as well as about their history of aggressive tax planning to minimise tax paid anywhere in the world. </p><p>How can some of these monopoly profits be captured for the public's benefit? A useful analogy may be to look at how natural resource companies are taxed on oil or gas fields. Such companies often pay royalties or special higher rates of corporation tax to ensure that society shares the benefits. </p><p>The UK announced a tech tax this week. While this type of tax has serious defects, the move reflects a public concern felt across the EU. While the imposition of such a tax at the EU level may cost Ireland a few hundred million in lost corporation tax, it may well be sensible to sacrifice this \"pawn\" to maintain wider EU solidarity, a better long-term prize for Ireland.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3683589</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TMM-3NY1-DYS1-003S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 2, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The following are excerpts from their conversation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> How would you define digital therapeutics?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> There's no standard definition. At Sanofi, we define them as nonpharmacological, tech-focused solutions that work as a stand-alone therapy or are combined with drugs to improve patient outcomes-and, of course, drive business impact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> Does the world need digital therapeutics? Some people question their value.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> I think about that almost every day. It comes down to two things: What determines our health as individuals? And, is this the right time for digital therapeutics?</p><p>There's a famous paper from WHO [World Health Organization] that breaks down the determinants of health. About 20 percent is down to medical care-what doctors and healthcare practitioners do, plus the labs and the drugs. About 20 to 30 percent is behavior-diet, exercise, lifestyle, positive thinking, mindfulness techniques, quitting smoking, and things like that. And the rest is environmental, social, genetic, and psychological.</p><p>As an industry, we focus on that 20 percent of medical care, but behavior change is huge. In the United States, more than 80 percent of healthcare costs-$3.4 trillion, almost 20 percent of the whole economy-is spent on diseases that could be <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">modified or even reversed</emphasis> through behavior change. So, yes, the world does need digital therapeutics, especially since they don't have side effects.</p><p>The other element is timing. If we look at major trends, people are living longer, on average, so there's a rise in chronic diseases associated with aging. Meanwhile, healthcare workers are in short supply, and physicians and nurses don't have enough time for patients. Yet everyone has powerful computers in their pockets that give them access to technology, education, and information. Put all that together, and it's the perfect moment for digital solutions to come to the market, change behavior, and enhance health outcomes at scale.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> What opportunities do digital therapeutics open up for pharma companies?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> Many people ask whether digital therapeutics will replace drugs-and whether big pharma should be afraid. The answer is no to both. Digital therapeutics won't replace drugs, except in a very few instances. Instead, the two of them will work together to improve outcomes.</p><p>At Sanofi, we think about two scenarios. In the stand-alone scenario, a digital therapeutic is used independently of drugs, often as step one in a treatment algorithm targeting diet, exercise, or lifestyle. In the second scenario, a digital therapeutic is combined with a drug to improve the drug's effect, which creates a whole slew of opportunities. You can differentiate new products and bundle them with drugs, or you can offer them separately.</p><p>All these opportunities improve patient outcomes and health-and create new business models. They can help companies grow existing revenues from medicines or create brand-new businesses offering digital-only solutions, with no drugs involved.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> What are Sanofi's key areas of focus in capturing the digital-therapeutics opportunity?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> We look at this in different ways. One is to focus on diseases or therapeutic categories where a change in behavior can have a huge impact-neural diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and others. Another angle is to look at any disease that costs healthcare systems a lot of money, affects large numbers of patients, and can be significantly affected by digital therapeutics. So identifying diseases where we can move the needle is the first step.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>In the United States, more than 80 percent of healthcare costs-$3.4 trillion, almost 20 percent of the whole economy-is spent on diseases that could be modified or even reversed through behavior change. So yes, the world does need digital therapeutics.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>And then there are other questions: How does this therapy work with the healthcare ecosystem and doctors' workflows? How does it work with our current, medicine-based business model? What are our ambitions and our perceived level of risk? How are we going to organize ourselves to capture the opportunities?</p><p>There are many variables. But everything starts with finding the therapeutic categories where we can really influence outcomes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> Where will the value come from for companies like yours?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> In the short term to midterm, it's likely to be from offering stand-alone digital-therapeutic solutions. That's a new category, with its own P&amp;L [profit and loss], product development, promotional costs, and sources of revenue. Then we have the combination of digital with drugs. From a business perspective, that enables us to grow existing revenues and differentiate our product from competitors'. I don't see any scenarios where we have me-too drugs.</p><p>The long-term picture is much more important, but it's intangible and abstract. Digital therapeutics present a big opportunity. They have the potential to become a multibillion-dollar category. The greatest value will be from data. If we know, for instance, when the right time is for a patient to move to the next step in the treatment algorithm, that will be better for everyone in the system.</p><p>A few years ago, I heard the CEO of Netflix talking about how they made one of its more successful shows. They said, \"If we put <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">this</emphasis> scriptwriter and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">this</emphasis> director and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">these</emphasis> actors together and create a show, there's a high probability it will be successful.\" All of that came out of data-and people liked it. Netflix is an entertainment-and-media company, but it's a data company, as well. I think that's what's going to happen, in the end, with digital therapeutics too.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> We talked about opportunities and value; what about risk?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> Our thinking about risk is changing. The question people were asking five to seven years ago was, \"Will patients engage with this product?\" A bit later, it was, \"Will this product deliver outcomes?\" Then three years ago, it was, \"How do we bring this smart product to market, from a regulatory standpoint?\"</p><p>By now, I think we can answer, \"Check, check, check.\" Yes, patients will use the products, if you design them well. Yes, the products will deliver outcomes-companies have demonstrated that through randomized clinical trials. And yes, regulators in the United States have set a clear pathway for getting to market.</p><p>What's left is what I call the \"last mile of digital therapeutics.\" Will payers adopt this new category? If so, how fast? We don't know. Second, how do we commercialize these products? Our current commercial channels in pharma, with or without sales reps, may not be the right ones. So I would say, market access and how to commercialize are the biggest risks. Some of the risks we used to worry about aren't risks any longer, which is good news.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> How will the digital-therapeutics business model differ from today's pharma business model?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> When we talk about business models, there's a danger we might think that digital therapeutics are just like drugs, only digital. So a doctor prescribes a drug, and a digital therapeutic as well, and everything else is the same-development, commercialization, market access. But the way products are commercialized will be different, in fact, and that will have a huge spillover effect.</p><p>Digital therapeutics will be used by more patients, but the price will be lower, which makes sense. Doctors will see fewer sales reps. Even today, 50 percent of US doctors don't see reps, and an average sales visit lasts a couple of minutes. The productivity of that model is declining.</p><p>I think digital therapeutics will spur the kind of experimentation that happens with all new commercial models. We already see consumer-healthcare companies combining paid media with e-commerce and telemedicine to bring products to market. I'm excited about what's coming, and I see it having an impact on pharma as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis>Sanofi recently announced a deal with the app provider Happify to produce a digital therapeutic. How do you plan on incorporating it into your business model?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> Happify has shown in both real-world situations and randomized clinical trials that using a mobile app can reduce anxiety and depression. When Sanofi was looking at multiple sclerosis [MS], we saw that the top five symptoms patients experience include anxiety, depression, and fatigue-yet most MS drugs don't address them. So we see this partnership as an opportunity to treat patient holistically-mind and body. Physical and mental health are connected. For example, reducing depression in patients with MS has a direct effect on relapses.</p><p>So we plan to bring a better solution to patients. It won't be aimed only at patients on our drugs; it will be for patients with MS on any drug, bringing them that extra component of mind health. It will be one of the first to showcase that this approach can work. That's exciting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis>Sanofi's collaboration with Happify is an example of how the healthcare ecosystem is changing. What will the next stages of evolution look like?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> There are a lot of questions about where digital therapeutics fit in and what pharma's role should be. I think pharma should play a big role in digital therapeutics. And partnership models have the best chance of delivering successful outcomes because they give you the best of both worlds. You have a big company, with scale and global reach and a certain rigor in everything it does, and a start-up that's agile and brings user experience, design, rapid prototyping, paid media, and other capabilities. Merging the two cultures creates something that works and can be scaled quickly.</p><p>Then there's the question of how digital therapeutics fit into the broader ecosystem. How will payers pay for this? Will it be per outcome or per patient per month? The latter is more likely, because that's how the systems are set up. Attribution is difficult to deliver for paying per outcome. As for doctors, digital therapeutics have to fit into their workflows and will probably involve the same amount of work or more, rather than less. We need to think carefully about how we do all this. But it will definitely improve the quality of care and, ideally, patient outcomes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> Do you think companies from pharma and digital therapeutics will evolve into an ecosystem?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> Yes. It's a good match: agility from start-ups and scale from big companies. Another interesting match will be with the big tech players, which are increasingly becoming health companies. Tim Cook has said that Apple's biggest legacy will be in health. Then there's Amazon's partnership with JPMorgan Chase and others.</p><p>I think we'll see interesting partnerships among pharma and healthcare players, tech companies, and start-ups. Payers and tech companies are forming partnerships, too, but we don't know how that will play out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> How do payers and providers need to change to bring digital therapeutics to patients more effectively?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> Both of them will play a huge role in whether or not digital therapeutics get adopted. With payers, there's a healthy dose of skepticism. They're asking, \"What is this? Could it work for my overall population, not just the 3 or 4 percent of patients who are already engaged with their health? Will it reduce my costs?\" If digital-therapeutic companies take these questions seriously and show-through randomized clinical trials and real-world settings-that they can deliver lower costs and improved population health, there's a fair chance payers will speed up adoption.</p><p>When it comes to providers, there's always some inertia with the adoption of any new category or innovation. We have to think through doctors' workflows and make sure we don't unleash a flurry of new questions from patients, because physicians aren't paid to spend their time explaining things. Our digital-therapeutic solutions must address that. We could have a service on the back end: a nurse or coach to answer questions. We could have an educational component so that when the doctor steps in, they work with a patient who is already engaged, educated about their disease, and more adherent. Then the patient and doctor can have a conversation that requires human interaction, which would be time well spent.</p><p>It all takes thought, but once physicians and providers see the value of digital therapeutics, they will start to use them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McKinsey:</emphasis> Are digital therapeutics the future of healthcare? What will it take to succeed?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bozidar Jovicevic:</emphasis> They certainly represent a huge opportunity. The world needs them because they can drive behavior change at scale. Everyday apps, such as Instagram, are already affecting our behavior. And we have video games that people are happy to play for hundreds of hours. We can use the same technologies for something good: being healthier and happier. It's a bright future.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>[T]en years from now, I'd love to see prescribing and using digital therapeutics become just standard of care-a normal thing, like prescribing a drug.

News Corporation has made this point strongly in its submission to Treasury, which is currently considering the government's response to the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission's digital platforms inquiry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government's response to the ACCC's recommendations comes as the impact of the tech -titans' behaviour is now very real. Without swift action, more jobs will be lost and more communities will lose valuable sources of information. This pain is particularly stark for independent publishers. Similarly, the platforms have sought to frustrate media companies building subscription services to fund their journalism, as alternatives to giving away content for free and being reliant primarily on advertising, so much of which has been diverted to the platforms themselves.</p><p>News Corp's submission outlines a blueprint for how Australia can show global leadership. However, we shouldn't delude ourselves about the forces at play here. Be warned. We are already seeing intense lobbying from the likes of Google to present themselves as friends of journalism, an industry where they've sucked the life out of so many publishers while profiting from their content.</p><p>Don't be fooled by their smokescreens: their sole aim is to convince lawmakers against curtailing their largely unregulated market dominance.</p><p>It's guaranteed that when governments threaten intervention, the platforms make hollow promises - ones that make publishers sceptical.</p><p>On Friday in the Australian -Financial Review, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai made all the usual promises of working with publishers before making it clear Google opposed any ACCC attempt for oversight of Google's commercial dealings with media companies. Again in the AFR -recently, Melanie Silva, managing director of Google Australia, had glowing praise for Google's effort of sending billions of clicks from users to Australian news publishers, and the changes to its secretive algorithms to better recognise original reporting in search. It all sounded rosy until she revealed a now familiar theme: Google opposes ACCC proposals for what she calls \"regulator-sanctioned negotiation of revenue sharing between platforms and news publishers\".</p><p>Similarly, another Google executive claimed recently \"we don't accept payment from anyone to be included in search results\" - except it does; search for almost anything and you're bound to see a paid ad as the top result. \"We're committed to playing our part in ensuring a successful and sustainable future for news,\" he also said, but if the word \"playing\" was actually \"paying\", then Google's commitment might mean something. As it stands, among the biggest beneficiaries of Google's platform are publishers of news that's fake, not factual.</p><p>Google simply wants to continue exploiting and profiting from publishers' content for free and has little interest in compensating publishers fairly. Other tech giants have begun to see the light - Facebook reportedly has engaged in serious negotiations with media companies as it begins to fashion a new news tab using premium content. And there are signs that governments around the world have woken to the societal and economic damage wrought, as evidenced by actions undertaken in Australia, the UK, the EU and the US.</p><p>It is in light of such official inquiries, and to encourage even more co-operation between the platforms and publishers, News Corp welcomes the ACCC's recommendation for a specialist digital platforms branch to monitor proactively potentially unfair and anti-competitive practices. Platforms such as Google have substantial market power in dealings with media companies because they are unavoidable trading partners. A specialist ACCC branch could enforce competition and consumer laws by monitoring how digital platforms' algorithms rank and distribute news content and advertising to consumers, and act if they are anti-competitive.</p><p>News Corp also believes the ACCC's proposal to establish codes of conduct for digital platforms is a wise move but the ACCC, not the Australian Communications and Media Authority as recommended, should regulate them because of its competition expertise.</p><p>To ensure platforms comply, the government should legislate minimum standards requiring they are fair and transparent in negotiations with publishers, prohibit anti-competitive or discriminatory practices and stipulate real consequences for non-compliance. The legislation would prohibit platforms using any publisher's content and from collecting any data generated by use of that content unless all publishers (or the major ones) have negotiated and entered into agreements with them. Otherwise, platforms can continue to play publishers off against each other to force them to take it or leave it on use of and payment for content and use and provision of data.</p><p>Further, News Corp supports an ACCC inquiry into supply of ad tech services, an opaque environment where intermediaries with market power engage in predatory conduct that leads to less competition, higher prices for advertisers and fewer revenues for publishers. The ACCC has identified that owners of media websites can be considered -competitors to digital platforms for supply of ad inventory but are also reliant on platforms like Google, which offers ad services that assist websites to sell their ad inventory.</p><p>This has had a serious impact on publishers' advertising revenue particularly because digital advertising revenues have not offset the dramatic decline in print income. There are at least two reasons for that - both -related to the platforms' extraordinary power.</p><p>First, digital ad growth is -almost entirely captured by big tech platforms, not least because of the vast troves of user data protected within their walled gardens. Second, Google has effectively strengthened that wall by monopolising ad serving and intermediation services for ads placed on the open web, on which publishers rely to monetise their inventory. As recognised by the ACCC, Google has the ability and incentive to leverage its power to preference its own services and foreclose other publishers and competing ad tech services.</p><p>Google's advertising dominance not only crushes would-be competitors, it forces anyone wanting to build a business in Australia to play by its rules just like inmates locked in a prison.</p><p>One issue raised by the ACCC - a harmonised media regulatory framework - would be counterintuitive. Regulatory design should be about a principled examination of regulating the unregulated, not re-regulation of existing print and online media. Australian companies should not be at a disadvantage against multinational platforms not subject to regulation.</p><p>Another important challenge is infringement of copyright on digital platforms, particularly with live streaming of sport. However, ACCC's call for a mandatory take-down code would not be the best approach. Instead, misuse of copyrighted material must be combated proactively by amending the Copyright Act to make platforms liable for infringing content on their platforms. Until they are liable, they will not change their behaviour.</p><p>These are critical issues. How the government responds to the ACCC's recommendations will have a profound effect on our media: it is vital we get this right for all Australians.Michael Miller is Executive Chairman of News Corp Australasia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-5e513076e10511e9a89aec85e90c8ae5dbd6136d2245b3e1e722d78826cdd3c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X58-V1J1-JD3N-518S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1310\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 30, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

In just five days, hundreds of contributors signed up for a piece of what they hope will be the next Silicon Valley unicorn. But there's a catch - unlike traditional venture capital investments, the tokens don't confer a claim on Storj's equity or future profits.<br/> Instead, the tokens' value derives from their utility in the firm's app, by providing access to data storage on a distributed network. They are the latest entry in the growing ledger of cryptocurrencies, digital coins that unlock myriad apps across the computing world. The coins are tradable on dozens of online exchanges and demand for all sorts of them has exploded as people speculate on the next big tech startup.<br/> \"The average investor is missing out on the Ubers and AirBnbs of the world,\" said Bart Stephens, a managing partner at Blockchain Capital, a VC firm that's invested in blockchain-related startups since 2012. \"If the next Uber decides to issue tokens, that would be an opportunity for more investors to get access to the most exciting technologies out there.\" The Storj sale is known as an initial coin offering, a model of finance spreading across the tech sector. Investors spent US$332 million on tokens in the past year, more than double what VCs handed over in seed rounds, according to data compiled by coin-focused blog The Control. The haul is slated to hit US$600 million in 2017, it says, adding to a market for tokens that's nearly tripled in the past year.<br/> ICOs are possible thanks to blockchain, the catchall term for a digital ledger that promises incorruptible storage of financial transactions. Banks and stock exchanges have spent millions on it, looking for ways to cut the costs for transferring money or recording equity sales. One of the latest to back the technology was the chief executive officer of Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson. Most famously, it's the technology that underpins bitcoin - just as it does for every token offered in an ICO.<br/>  Their massive increase in popularity has more than a few detractors warning of a bubble, worried that the allure of finding the next tech lottery ticket is fueling rampant speculation. The concern is particularly acute at a time when investors are fretting about stretched valuations for tech startups, with the likes of Uber commanding multibillion-dollar price tags even as they burn through cash.<br/> Take Gnosis, a prediction market application based on the Ethereum blockchain that raised US$12.5 million in 12 minutes on April 24, resulting in a market cap of almost US$300 million. It's generated no revenue and has little more than a white paper describing what it intends to do. Yet its tokens, which would allow users to bet on things such as election outcomes, soared eightfold in the three weeks since May 2, giving it a valuation of over US$2 billion - more than the average Russell 2000 Index stock.<br/> Gnosis's runup is just part of the craze that's gripped the cryptocurrency market in the last month, with bitcoin surging more than 30 per cent in the past week alone. That's pushed the market capitalization of digital currencies over 50 per cent higher to more than US$90 billion.<br/> Even after that surge, the market is still relatively small, though it's taking steps toward maturity as the ICO boom spreads. There are platforms to track historical prices and volume, and reports on individual issuances to help prospective buyers assess a firm's prospects.<br/> The offerings happen outside the purview of regulators - quite by design - as technically, the coins are part of the app and not securities. ICOs don't have disclosure requirements, and the issuer can accept an unlimited number of US investors, instead of the 99 vetted investors limited to traditional VC funding rounds.<br/> The space has also been a breeding ground for scams, and some coins have turned out to be vulnerable to attacks. Hackers were able to steal US$50 million from a fund called Decentralized Autonomous Organization after it raised US$150 million in the biggest issuance ever in April 2016.<br/> For entrepreneurs, the appeal is obvious. A white paper published online replaces weeks of pitches to VC firms, followed by an online auction that can take minutes. The technology can be poked and prodded by geeks around the world, providing a depth of expertise often missing at even the best Silicon Valley firms.<br/> \"You don't have to limit yourself,\" said Jae Kwon, who raised US$16.8 million in a coin sale for Cosmos, which aims to provide custodian-like service for transactions across different blockchains. \"There are just not that many VCs and they're not experts. People who contributed to our fundraiser are the experts.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNRCOM-n10006115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNRCOM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NNC-2731-JBYT-H0GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410684</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tendernews.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>May 25, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Business Opportunities</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000DFI9</classCode><className>AIRBNB INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00028E1</classCode><className>FMR CORP</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

It also raises concerns such as data privacy and security, the regulation of cross-border data flows, market concentration and taxation.</p><p>As such, rules are important, attendees at the fifth UNCTAD eCommerce Week, at the United Nations' European headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on 2 April heard.</p><p>\"As with other areas of trade, rulemaking about data and e-commerce will need to achieve a balance between potential trade disciplines and national policy objectives,\" said UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Isabelle Durant.</p><p>Understanding how digital data and trade interact requires different perspectives to bring a complex picture into focus.</p><p>The African Union's (AU) infrastructure and energy commissioner, Amani Abou-Zeid, said aside from physical infrastructure, mobile money, and a better understanding of the informal economy, one of the biggest challenges in Africa is data.</p><p>The lack of it, how it differs, and the inability to analyse it when it does exist, are all concerns.</p><p>\"When we talk about data for trade, there is an assumption that this data exists,\" Ms. Abou-Zeid said. \"Lack of up-to-date data is recognized as one of the impacts of lower intra-African trade. When there is data, it can differ from agency to agency and sometimes even within agencies.\"</p><p>The AU is working to address the data issue, she said, saying it would establish a trade observatory located within the AU Commission with funding from the International Trade Centre and the European Union.</p><p>The observatory would deal with the issue of not having a central trade data repository at a continental level and quantitative information to make decisions.</p><p>The term data though, said Deborah Elms, founder and executive director of the Asian Trade Centre, has been used too loosely, which makes it confusing and complicated. \"Data is used to describe everything, so it ends up describing nothing,\" she said. \"We have to be more precise.\"</p><p>\"The more complicated you make it, the more difficult you make it for small businesses operating in the digital world.\"</p><p>With data and trade at the core of the wide-ranging discussion, the definitional issue was central.</p><p>Governments are grappling with this, said Lantosoa Rakotomalala, Madagascar's industry, trade and crafts minister. \"We have all the challenges relating to (digital) connection, data storage and ensuring this data is secure.</p><p>\"But on the other hand, we also have research and development policies which today are not yet allowing us to fully appreciate the usage of data in terms of economic development,\" she said, but added there were costs especially in machine learning, new equipment and the rights to a private life.</p><p>She said an additional challenge is identifying how to process and analyze data in Africa.</p><p>The case of Paraguay is heartening for other developing nations, but also demonstrates that connectivity alone is not enough.</p><p>Pedro Mancuello, Paraguay's vice minister of trade, said while more that 86% of people in Paraguay have internet, only 14.3% buy online. This connectivity is a testament to its investment in digital infrastructure, but also a portend of what's required to get entrepreneurs selling, and consumers buying, online.</p><p>But getting online is a challenge for many says, said Jo\u00e3ozinho Mendes of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA).</p><p>\"Because of the digital divide an awful lot of our producers are simply not able to have such a high online profile for economic, infrastructure or indeed educational reasons.\"</p><p>He said he doesn't believe data collection is a bad thing and contributes to development.</p><p>\"Digital technologies do generate a great deal of information, but we need to be in a position to process, collect, analyses, and store it to implement development strategies. Hence the need to develop competencies that allow us to manage data,\" Mr. Mendes said.</p><p>On the industry and civil society side, there was emphasis on the difference between consumer and business data and its use.</p><p>Consumers International's director general Helena Leurent said data benefits consumers daily, citing the example of TripAdvisor.</p><p>But she said there is a dark side that needs to be considered.</p><p>\"The value that companies and nations gain from data originates from individuals. Our ability to create a rich personal profile which helps aid decision-making and recommendations is the same thing that then creates the challenges.\"</p><p>\"For consumers there is a fear that (their data) is being used against them, which stops them wanting to engage in a digital world,\" she said.</p><p>Meanwhile Ms. Elms' view is that while big data may be the preserve of big tech companies, the 2,500 companies in her network simply don't see business information as data that needs major protections.</p><p>\"It's just information that is needed to do business. If you want to move goods from country A to country B, companies need to be able to use your address and credit card to do that,\" Ms. Elms said.</p><p>Indeed, data can be a force for good, a point made by Xiaofei Yao, founder and CEO of Rogrand E-commerce, China's largest pharmaceutical supply chain management company.</p><p>She said: \"Data has become an essential thing for business.\"</p><p>\"Many describe data as the oil of the future \u2013 but it's more than just oil, it's the engine and currency in the digital economy \u2013 and is much more powerful than its fiscal counterparts as it helps us understand more about ourselves, our country and our civilization.\"</p><p>\"It will fundamentally enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of production and services.\"</p><p>\"We are all desperate to get more data. Despite the concerns we should look into the uniqueness of the data to overcome these, and design by industry and sector around the purpose of the data use.\"</p><p>The meeting agreed data can be a force for good, but it needs to be better defined and understood ahead of regulation efforts, which could damage the engines of economic growth it aims to help.</p><p>\"Whatever the outcome of trade negotiations, it is clear that more support is needed to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital era,\" Ms. Durant added.</p><p>The fifth edition of e-Commerce Week \u2013 an annual gathering that draws leading e-commerce figures, start-ups, policy makers and officials from around the world \u2013 is taking place in Geneva from 1 to 5 April. The theme of this year's week, which comprises dozens of sessions, is From Digitalisation to Development.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/632/1802/38/155439018827.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/632/1802/38/155439018827.jpg</url></p><p>TF0417_p30_01<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSNIG-141731955</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSNIG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT9-T761-JDJN-6332-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428555</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1230\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The News Chronicle.

The issue is with the sensitive part of the government such as the department of finance. This happened because of the Abu Dhabi data centre. Data sovereignty is a key issue. HR and payroll are crucial and sensitive in this part of the world,&amp;#x201D; he said.</p><p>Security and privacy issues have been taken care of because of the local data centre, he said and added that the cost of running a cloud is cheaper as there is no infrastructure cost, skills are not needed as Oracle own the skills and upgrades.</p><p>Oracle sees more UAE governments moving to the cloud platform<br/>Microsoft sees room for growth opportunities for all cloud providers in UAE<br/>Oracle on track to beat AWS in number of data centres by end of the year<br/>Growth drivers: CRM and ERP</p><p>Khehar said that business issues have become critical and digital transformation has become a much bigger issue than where the data is going to reside.</p><p>Nag said that the collective economic goal of the region to become more technology- and data-centric has been a cornerstone to this rapid acceptance of both the private and public cloud.</p><p>The regional market is expected to increase 21% year on year to $3b this year compared to $2.5b a year ago and this figure is expected to increase to $3.6b in 2021.</p><p>Nag said that SMEs in the region are focusing their investments in cloud deployments that will enable faster business analytics and artificial intelligence, both of which are key growth drivers for public cloud in the region.</p><p>In the public cloud space, software as a service (SaaS) is expected to account for 53% of the total public cloud service revenue to $1.6b this year compared to $1.3b a year ago.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;SaaS products are typically sold via subscription, allowing companies to avoid large up-front licensing fees and capital costs. The cost-effectiveness of SaaS is one of the motivations for organisations to increase their spending in the segment,&amp;#x201D; Nag said.</p><p>Customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) remain the top two segments driving the growth of SaaS and will continue to go up as businesses keep enhancing their customer experience.</p><p>Nag said that ERP will accounts for 12% of the overall public cloud service revenue forecast this year and this is because most independent software vendors have converted their ERP applications from on-premises, license-based offerings to cloud-based SaaS offerings.</p><p>While business intelligence (BI) applications are currently low in the region, he said that it is the fastest-growing segment among SaaS offerings and on pace to total $29 million in 2020, an increase of 37% from 2019.</p><p>&amp;#x201C;BI revenue is expected to achieve 30% growth over the next three years as local businesses leverage BI-based analytics to make smarter decisions and optimize their business operations,&amp;#x201D; he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBREAK-167436484</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBREAK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y74-14V1-JDJN-64FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TBREAK MEDIA Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

In Singapore, banks were well-prepared to deliver services digitally, to the extent that Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) customers were able to withdraw cash using QR codes. Elsewhere, customers of United Overseas Bank (UOB) could use their contactless ATM settings on the UOB Mighty app to withdraw cash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every time a customer does an online transaction, banks get some data. Unsurprisingly, banks have been mining data for decades: risk assessment requires data and the credit history of the consumer or company. Now, the ability to collect transactional data has already enabled some banks to unlock new revenue streams from more personalised services through effective marketing. Banks can also better manage their own credit and operational risks, and achieve operational efficiencies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, the pandemic has seen many financial institutions complete three years worth of digital transformation within three months. \"The acceleration has...allowed us to actually bring a lot of recalcitrant people - people who are naysayers or somewhat caught by inertia - into the mainstream of the change,\" he observes.</p><p>Gupta was speaking at the SingaporeFinTech Festival (SFF) Green Shoots Series, a weekly FinTech e-meetup organised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in the run-up to the SFF proper in December. On a panel also featuring Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer at MAS, the event sought to discuss issues related to digital disruption such as digitalisation in the financial sector, sustainable finance and the future of work.</p><p>Gupta - who likes to think of DBS as the digital bank of Singapore - has been busy attempting to digitalise the banking supply chain. This is a challenge for a bank that has been caught on the wrong side with customers such as Hin Leong Trading which financially engineered its financial statements, or Eagle Hospitality Trust which misled readers on its prospectus. Some forms of digitalisation have clearly not kept up with financial engineering. Both Hin Leong and Eagle Hospitality Trust are under investigation by the Criminal Affairs Department.</p><p>\"We are thinking hard about the rules and the use of data, what makes data okay to use and not okay to use,\" adds Gupta. The bank has developed a framework called \"PURE\" - Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful and Explainable - relying on those with knowledge of philosophy to develop the ethical foundation upon which this framework rests.</p><p>Everyone's banking digitally</p><p>Since banking digitally was the mainstay for consumers and SMEs during the circuit breaker, both local and qualifying full banks (QFBs) reported increased digital activity during the period.</p><p>For DBS, digital activity volumes have increased from 30-60% overall, especially among older clients whose activity increased fourfold. Banks must therefore improve the manner in which they deliver services digitally to adapt to the increasing digital activity of clients in a more timely and efficient manner.</p><p>Other banks also reported large increases in digital activity. An OCBC spokeswoman says close to 100,000 \"digital debutantes\" have started using digital banking for the first time in 2020. OCBC recorded a 40% jump in digital transactions y-o-y by those aged 50 to 64 during the circuit breaker and a 48% jump in digital transactions y-o-y by those aged 64 years and above.</p><p>In 1Q2020, OCBC announced a 40% y-o-y rise in financial transactions; a 4x increase in digital unit trust investments; and a 3.5x increase in OCBC RoboInvest investments. After the launch of its virtual wealth advisory service on June 9, OCBC recorded a 45% increase in the sale of wealth management products in the first 10 days of launch compared to the prior 10 days; and within the first two weeks of the circuit breaker, time deposit placements increased 150%.</p><p>The number of digital transactions such as funds transfer and bill payments made on UOB's mobile banking app, UOB Mighty, increased by 60% in 2Q2020 compared with the same period in 2019. In particular, the number of PayNow transactions made by our retail banking customers in 2Q2020 more than doubled compared with the same period in 2019.</p><p>\"Our customers are also buying more investment products through UOB Mighty and UOB Personal Internet Banking in the past few months. The number of online transactions for investment products such as gold and unit trusts in the second quarter of 2020 grew by 18 times compared with the same period in 2019,\" says Aaron Chiew, head of mobile and digital, group retail, UOB.</p><p>The focus on consumer banking's \"last mile\" delivery has taken on an urgency for local banks including the QFBs, following the award of new digital bank licences later this year. The last mile in banking refers to delivery of banking services to consumers. These services are viewed as important for financial inclusion, particularly in emerging markets with significant unbanked populations. Over time, the aspiration for Asia's unbanked millions to have access to bank accounts is likely to be fulfilled through digital or neo banks.</p><p>\"Increasingly, institutions are reshaping their digital presence to focus on the \"last mile\". Building a foundation focused on this critical customer touchpoint requires banks to deploy technology that documents, in a fully compliant manner, consumer and commercial loan and deposit transactions while at the same time supporting a fully digital customer experience,\" Kevin Polinsky, managing director of Financial Institution Sales at Compliance Systems, tells BankDirector.com.</p><p>Deploying technology</p><p>With the data from app-based banking transactions, traditional banks are able to collect and process this data using automation, AI, and algorithmic processing such as machine learning (ML) and neural networks to process the data.</p><p>Asked what trends will likely be the most prominent secular trends for financial services in future, Gupta highlights AI/ML and Big Tech as he believes that the future driver of the global economy lies in data.</p><p>Banks are already using AI with customer data. UOB launched its digital-only bank TMRW in Thailand in February last year and in Indonesia earlier this year. TMRW uses FinTech in which UOB has either an investment or a joint venture. These include companies such as Personetics, an Icelandic company Meniga which does complex data categorisation, and Avetec.AI which focuses on AI-driven credit assessment.</p><p>Unlike a digital banking app which is part of an omnichannel banking strategy, TMRW does not have any branches, and its model is to use data to engage customers as its primary goal and business model. TMRW uses net promoter score (NPS) to gauge its progress. NPS is an index that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company's products or services to others.</p><p>OCBC has also made use of AI in its voice banking on its mobile banking app. A tool called \"Personalised Insights\" in OCBC's banking app also gives customers personalised prompts to save, spend or manage their money better.</p><p>A bank's purpose</p><p>Financial services encompass a lot more than using a banking app. The role of banks - and they are the cogs of the wheel of any economy - is to manage risk. As is evident during the pandemic, banks provide liquidity to businesses. Hence, banking and financial services in general remain highly regulated.</p><p>The impact of technology and data on banking is different than for companies like, Facebook, or even Ant Financial and Tencent. Ant and Tencent are increasingly coming under the purview of the People's Bank of China, and the China Banking Regulatory Commission.</p><p>For their own good, banks have to protect people and companies from borrowing money they cannot afford to repay. In Singapore, we have Hin Leong Trading in judicial management owing some US$1.3 billion ($1.8 billion) to local and foreign banks, or KrisEnergy which is trying to restructure its loans for the second time in four years. Its main creditor bank is DBS.</p><p>Banks also have to stop their customers from making complex and risky investments they do not understand, especially with their retirement money. Once again, DBS was the sole financial adviser for Hyflux's perpetual securities and for the IPO of Eagle Hospitality Trust. The latter is a case of financial engineering where Urban Commons took IPO monies, and judging by how quickly defaults took place after the IPO, one cannot help but think there is no intention of honouring its commitments to the trust.</p><p>The main advantages banks have compared to FinTech firms such as Ant, Tencent, Sea, Grab and Razer are their reputation and trust. Customers trust banks with their deposits, and deposit gathering continues to be a service where banks have an edge over their FinTech competitors. Most customers are unlikely to approach a FinTech company for a residential mortgage.</p><p>FinTech players would need to be regulated under the same rules and regulations as banks should they wish to attract deposits. More recently, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia are offering FinTech firms digital-only bank licences to become full-fledged digital banks. Becoming a digital bank would involve these firms accepting capital and liquidity requirements that would undoubtedly erode their return on equity (ROE). If the FinTech companies do not accept these requirements, it would limit their ability to raise deposits at scale, notes a recent JPMorgan report.</p><p>\"We think the threat to lending and liability franchise from FinTech is limited in the near term. Banks have a significant advantage in deposit gathering in terms of trust which has been built for generations as well as regulatory factors. Even if FinTechs start digital banks, with similar regulatory burdens as traditional banks, it would take time for them to scale up the deposit franchise,\" JPMorgan says.</p><p>Alternatively, banks can also cooperate with FinTechs, in a co-opetition model to leverage the technological edge of FinTechs to add value to their offering and share revenues (like Robo advisors on their wealth platforms), the report adds.</p><p>For digital banks, JPMorgan says \"new regulations like those in Singapore require digital banks to chart a course to profitability. So they can't take the loss-leading market share focused approach typical of FinTechs.\"</p><p>In a comprehensive report titled \"Banking of the future: finance in the digital age\", Josh Bottomley, a director of HSBC Bank (Singapore) and global head of digital data &amp; development, HSBC, says: \"The successful bank of the future will need to carefully balance a series of trade-offs between what technology and data enable, in terms of improving customer experiences, with the need to ensure the highest standards are upheld and the integrity of the financial system is maintained.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K0-TPK1-DYX1-T00F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Edge Publishing PTE.

This is according to a newly released report by Synechron. Based on the recent trends in the financial markets, the report outlines four key themes for financial services for 2019.</p><p><br/> Digital Business Ecosystems - Ecosystems will reshape the future of Financial Services as banks look to change the way they engage with and support customers to provide value-added services that reinforce their underlying business ecosystem vision. This may be fuelled by a need to keep up with 'new' service providers such as FinTechs and InsurTechs or with traditional Technology companies like Amazon becoming increasingly involved in the banking sector.<br/> To be successful, these new Business Ecosystems will need to bring together the firm's Digital Platform Strategy Mobile, and an open Application Programming Interface (API) approach to ingest data sources from the Internet of Things' (IoTs') 'things'. It will need access to powerful Analytics from the programmable economy to help firms go beyond traditional banking services and think about specific events and experiences where data or distributed business models can enable a better customer experience. This will all need to be supported by an Enterprise Cloud strategy, and it needs to happen now for Banks, Asset Managers, and Insurance companies to shift into a successful digital business, said the report.<br/> Technology-led transformation - When discussing digital transformation, it is impossible to strategize on an action plan without a heavy focus on Technology.  In 2019, firms expect to update systems to become future-ready with a modern, flexible technology architecture. This will include accelerating the move from monolithic business systems to a microservices architecture and adopting an Open API strategy to support \"beyond banking\" business models.<br/> According to the report, in terms of front-end engineering, this means ramping up design thinking for more customer-optimized, usable user interfaces (UIs) that shift to AngularJS. This full-stack technology transformation to a more flexible technology architecture also will require a hard look at Cloud strategy.<br/> Data as a Horizontal - Digital Transformation has been fuelling a massive growth in data available to banks, asset managers and insurance companies available for analysis and further business value. Given the vast amount of data created each day, it is considered one of the banks' most valuable assets - but only if it is properly mined and the value is extracted. Data analytics, data mining, data lakes, and data visualization tools are essential to assign value to the immense amount of data being created and to use it to better understand and target customers.<br/> While 2018 moved AI strategies beyond simple automation to more complex Data Science focused use cases, 2019 will set the stage for the push toward enterprise-scale Business Intelligence and further advancement of Data Science strategies to achieve business return on investment (ROI).  Given the anticipated, continued exponential growth of data, firms should also start to prepare for their five to ten-year data strategies which should think about things like Quantum Computing and Ecosystems, said the report.<br/> Culture Transformation - Because banks are re-structuring and rethinking their business strategies to align with a new generation of customers and a new generation of service providers, the culture also must transform to adapt. This will include a change in spending from run-the-bank to change-the bank initiatives, as well change management with a focus on agile workspaces and DevOps.<br/> Firms will change to support remote workers from anywhere, and invest in diversity and inclusion initiatives for pluralistic workspaces and teams. Sustainable finance will also be a key trend in 2019 as firms' appeal to a new generation of customers with different priorities, the report said.<br/> \"2019 will really push forward the future of financial services and see immense change take place. We expect that this year will see the start of ecosystems that bring together some key technologies that aim to provide more effective methods of engaging with customers. We cannot wait to see what 2019 will bring and look forward to leading the way on this new and exciting journey for financial services,\" said Faisal Husain, Co-founder and CEO at Synechron.<br/> Digital transformation in the financial industry is spurred by two main factors, believe experts, one changing consumer demands and the growing threat from disruptive challenger banks. Some of the big tech firms introducing consumer IT experiences and consumers expecting that level of interaction has driven the transformation of financial services. At the same time, regulation, such as GDPR is often viewed as a hindrance to digital transformation. But, in many cases it's acted as an accelerator for banks and the trends will continue for the coming year.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CXOTDY-n10852251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CXOTDY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9N-X121-JBYT-H0KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410850</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CXOToday.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 30, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009SVL</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

In our previous blog[1]we explored how regulators may respond to innovation by presenting two forward-looking regulatory scenarios. In light of this, how should incumbents approach their digital transformation? In this blog, we explore where incumbents should play to hedge against regulatory risk by assessing their optimal digital transformation target and their geographic footprint.TrendDespite this rising regulatory risk, incumbents cannot afford a \"wait and see\" approach delaying their decisions to invest in digital transformation. </p><p>Indeed, three interrelated trends in particular underlie the necessity of digital transformation: profitability, customer centricity and competition. In terms of profitability, on average, from 2005 to 2016, the return-on-equity (ROE) for European and US retail banks has decreased by 9%[2] and the cost-to-income ratio has increased by 6.8%[3], despite renewed effort on cost containment. Digital transformation can help increase ROE through various levers, including through cutting costs sustainably. Indeed, Temenos and Deloitte estimate[4] that banks running modern core banking systems have enjoyed on average a 28% higher ROE and a 6.5% lower cost-to-income ratio than banks running legacy applications.There is a continuing focus on customer centricity - an approach to banking where customers are considered primary stakeholders and which results in increased trust-based relationships. The aim here is to establish long-term banking relationships by leveraging customers' data to provide more personalised products and services. Incumbents still have much to do. Examples of providing seamless 24/7 interactions across multiple channels continue to rise, such as video on demand service for mortgage advice, which is not based on appointments and reduces waiting time to talk to a specialist.Finally, in terms of competition incumbent retail banks are increasingly at risk of losing their market share to non-traditional players. In particular, the spectre of BigTechs is looming[5]. Incumbents' services around payments and lending, in particular, will continue to face a higher risk of market share loss as these services offer more opportunity to create differentiated customer experiences. BigTechs have a competitive advantage over incumbents insofar as they have no technological legacy issues, have significant volumes of customer data, large cash reserves for investing in new ventures, and, critically, are better positioned to attract the already scarce talent. It is also clear that the interplay between customer centricity and competition puts pressure on incumbents' cross-subsidisation business model, which will further indent their market share.ImplicationWe have segmented the disruptive innovation underpinning digital transformation into four maturity clusters:cluster 1 - high maturity: online banking, mobile banking, wearables and biometric security;cluster 2 - medium maturity: cloud, blockchain, chatbots, open banking and cryptocurrencies; andcluster 3 - low maturity: quantum computing, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, initial coin offerings and sonic payments;cluster 4 - next frontiers of future disruptive innovations.The value of undertaking digital transformation based on \"cluster 1\" and \"cluster 2\" typically scales linearly. The value of adopting digital transformation based on \"cluster 3\" and, in particular, \"cluster 4\" will be determined by a more complex set of factors.In our previous blog,[6] we explored the interplay of three factors (and the two regulatory scenarios that could result, whilst keeping in mind that are many other scenarios that could also be considered):risk management;regulatory design and architecture; andregulatory convergence.Alongside these factors, the \"disruptive innovation maturity level\" (degree of adoption and penetration of disruptive innovation by market players) should be considered. This results in us identifying four forward-looking scenarios for digital transformation (Figure 1):scenario 1: with the flow;scenario 2: clear waters;scenario 3: against the flow; andscenario 4: turbulent waters.Each scenario then identifies where incumbents should play to hedge against regulatory risk by assessing their digital transformation target and geographic footprint.In \"Scenario 1: With the flow\", stagnant economic growth results in sluggish profitability, which puts pressure on incumbents' budget for innovation (organic and inorganic) and on new entrants' capacity to attract funding for innovation. Customers are becoming increasingly vigilant towards data privacy risks. In an attempt to counter this stagnant economic growth, regulation acts as a facilitator for innovation. New entrants emerge slowly.In this scenario, incumbents focus their efforts on augmenting their existing digital transformation perimeter across the international footprint. This can be achieved through:investing in the existing value chain to generate scale;retaining the existing customer base by alleviating their key pain points as part of the customer experience journey; andacquiring a small set of new entrants based on their capacity to achieve 1. and 2.In \"Scenario 2: Clear waters\", strong economic growth results in solid profitability, which allows incumbents to invest in innovation (organic and inorganic) and new entrants to attract funding for innovation. Customers are becoming ever more demanding in terms of their experience. Given that market players (incumbents and new entrants) are effectively managing the risks related to disruptive innovation, regulation acts as a facilitator for innovation. New entrants emerge quickly and competition from both incumbents and new entrants accelerates.In this scenario, incumbents focus their efforts on advancing new digital transformation frontiers across their international footprint. This can be achieved through:developing in-house disruptive products and services to generate new market penetration;expanding the customer base by offering a highly anticipative customer experience (giving customers what they need before they know to ask for it); andbuying a large set of new market entrants based on their capacity to achieve 1. and 2.In \"Scenario 3: Against the flow\", uneven economic growth results in unbalanced profitability, which channels incumbents and new entrants to pursue innovation, and subsequently operate, on a more geographically constrained basis. Customer demand is becoming ever more heterogeneous. As national and/or regional protectionism are on the rise, regulation acts as a deterrent because it is divergent (gaps and/or inconsistencies within the regulatory framework). New entrants emerge slowly but compete aggressively with incumbents.In this scenario, incumbents focus their efforts on optimising their existing digital transformation perimeter across the domestic footprint. This can be achieved through:developing an agile operating model to generate speed;optimising the customer base through micro-segmentation; andbuying a small set of new entrants based on their capacity to achieve 1. and 2.In \"Scenario 4: Turbulent waters\", high profile cyber-attacks and data privacy wrongdoings undermine confidence in the financial services sector. Customers are ever more protective in terms of their data usage and privacy and exercise their civic muscle to ensure market players are held accountable. Consequently, regulation acts as a deterrent, whereby it de-risks market participants by limiting both the depth and breadth of the applications of disruptive innovation. The number of both new entrants and incumbents shrinks.In this scenario, incumbents retrench their existing digital transformation perimeter across both the international and domestic footprint. This can be achieved through:minimising the interconnectedness with third parties within existing value chain;divesting from products and services which are high impact in terms of customer mistrust if things go wrong; andpausing on acquisitions.Incumbents should start now using this or similar scenario analysis as a tool - for developing a long-term corporate strategy - to help them determine:which of their existing fundamental assumptions about the future of digital transformation must be re-examined;which actions they should stop if future events indicate that digital transformation is headed towards \"Scenario 3: Counter the flow\" or \"Scenario 4: Turbulent waters\"; andwhich actions they should take if future events indicate that digital transformation is headed towards \"Scenario 1: With the flow\" or \"Scenario 2: Clear waters\".Since scenario analysis is an art rather than a science, incumbents should adopt a \"learning by doing\" approach and probe earlier scenarios that with the benefit of hindsight turned out to be wrong, so as to identify what went wrong. The next blog[7] post in this series will explore how incumbents should play to win.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

It is important for newspaper publishers to stay on top of these trends and use them to reach wider audiences and engage readers. To assist them, E&amp;P has put together a list of digital trends to watch as we move further into 2019.</p><p>(1) THE PIVOT FROM VIDEO TO AUDIO</p><p>In 2018, the rise of the voice assistant continued to gain traction from the previous year, with more than one in 10 U.S. adults regularly using a smart speaker, equating to about 34 million people or 17 million homes, according to the Reuters report \"The Future of Voice and the Implications for News.\"</p><p>Last year, we saw more tech companies hopping on the bandwagon and others already in the race releasing more smart devices: the Google Assistant, Apple's HomePod, Amazon's 12 new smart devices, including the Auto Echo, and Facebook's Portal.</p><p>While Amazon already includes several news organizations on its news briefing feature called \"Flash Briefing,\" there are still a few wrinkles to iron out if more newspapers are to hop on board and create personalized content for the platform. The Reuters report found that news publishers lack things, such as a clear path to monetization and data to guide development.</p><p>However, Google announced last December it would be developing an open audio news standard for the Assistant and partner with several media companies like CNBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post. It is also putting out a call in hopes of recruiting other English-language publishers. Using the same technology behind the artificial intelligence on Google News, the Assistant will generate a playlist of stories based on the listener's interests.</p><p>With the rise of the smart speaker in the home, it is not surprising that news publishers have taken an interest in voice. With other legacy media companies guiding the way, it shouldn't be long until others follow their lead.</p><p>(2) TRACKING THE IMPACT OF STORIES</p><p>Patrick Butler, vice president of programs for the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), said recently in Nieman Lab, \"News organizations have gotten very good at measuring things like impressions, reach, and engagement... What we don't do well is measure why our content matters.\"</p><p>In April 2018, ICFJ Knight Fellow and Brazilian journalist Pedro Burgos was already formulating an answer. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, he launched a public version of Impacto, a project backed by Google News Initiative that aims to help newsrooms and journalists track, understand and demonstrate the impact of their reporting on communities and society. Essentially, instead of news organizations searching manually for mentions of their work or combing through social platforms, blogs and new sites, journalists can search the database for impact measurement and analysis of a story.</p><p>For Impacto, the premise is that tracking the impact of a story will inevitably aid in winning the battle of trust in the media, which became a much bigger theme in 2018.</p><p>Since providing communities with local journalism was also a constant theme throughout the year, news organizations may begin to look at the impact that this shift in focus has had on their communities.</p><p>With the kind of artificial intelligence being developed today, the use and creation of tracking tools, such as Impacto, can be expected to increase this year.</p><p>(3) MISINFORMATION MOVES TO SMALLER PLATFORMS</p><p>Social media has been under fire for some time, and following the 2016 presidential election, companies like Facebook and Twitter have taken steps to combat the spread of fake news and misinformation on its platforms.</p><p>These changes continued to occur in 2018. For example, when Facebook engineers discovered suspicious evidence that Russian activity was linked to the platform, the company announced major changes to the news algorithm, which prioritized content from friends and family. Both Facebook and Twitter put systems in place to prevent the spread of fake news prior to the 2018 midterm elections as well.</p><p>This crackdown on monitoring news in turn has led to various misinformers getting banned from these platforms. In turn, we can expect fake news and misinformation to make the shift to smaller and/or ephemeral platforms.</p><p>According to Daniel Funke, who covers fact-checking and online misformation for Poynter, misinformers around the world are already \"migrating to private groups, chats and fringe sites to avoid detection by journalists and tech companies.\"</p><p>As such, we can expect many new fact-checking tools to pop up.</p><p>(4) PODCASTING CONTINUES TO GROW</p><p>The shift in focus and resources to podcasting is sure to become more apparent this year. Edison Research's annual Infinite Dial report discovered the number of monthly podcast listeners increased about 9 percent between 2017 and 2018. Streaming platforms like Pandora and Spotify joined the podcast market last year, helping with its popularity by reaching a wider audience.</p><p>This wider audience also happens to be diverse. VoxNest's \"The State of the Podcast Universe\" report noted \"podcasts (can no longer be) seen as by-white-male, for white-male medium.\" The report also stated that 2018 \"marked the year when the demographics of podcasts audiences nearly mirrored the demographics of the United States overall, at least for gender and ethnicity.\"</p><p>News organizations took notice of the increasing popularity of podcasts and several released new podcasts. Although the Washington Post already produces a library of 14 audio shows, 2018 saw its most ambitious show yet--\"The Post Reports,\" a 20-minute daily news podcast. Similarly, the Guardian also released a 20-minute podcast titled 'Today in Focus.\"</p><p>According to the VoxNest report, there are currently 619,000 podcasts on Apple Podcasts alone--the demand for podcasts has steadily been rising and the supply will surely follow.</p><p>(5) THE MEDIA AND GDPR</p><p>Hands-down, one of 2018's most talked about subjects was the implementation of the GDPR, a regulation meant to protect the people's data and impose strict rules on the processing of personally identifiable information.</p><p>This new regulation could affect a multitude of things and companies; however, big tech giants have every reason to be wary. The regulation requires that companies processing data have appropriate security and must notify their data protection authority within 72 hours of a breach as well as reserve the right to fine companies 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros (whichever is larger).</p><p>In an article by The Next Web, the head of communications for the Irish Data Protection Commission, Graham Doyle said it's clear that the new regulation has already had an impact as breech notifications and complaints have doubled since last year.</p><p>One company that has shown initiative in adapting to the GDPR is Mozilla. The company developed the Firefox Public Data Report, an anti-tracking browser feature.</p><p>According to The Next Web article, Data Protection Acts are doubling their staff, thus enforcing the new regulations that are sure to come. We can soon expect to see tech companies adapt--perhaps by creating new tools to comply, or else they will reap the consequences.</p><p>(6) DEVELOPING BLOCKCHAIN JOURNALISM</p><p>Despite the quick rise and fall of Civil, the industry can expect more of blockchain technology in the months to come. In the words of WAN-IFRA's director of insights Dean Roper: \"There appears to be widespread agreement that blockchain is well-suited to intellectual property (IP) protection.\"</p><p>Civil, one of the better known projects aiming to master blockchain, is a media platform and community-owned journalism network that uses blockchain tech to \"ensure every newsroom and journalist has public, immutable and permanent proof to ensure total ownership and control of their data and content,\" according to its website.</p><p>Civil is meant to function off their cryptocurrency, which allows buyers to become shareholds. In September 2018, the company held a token sale, but fell short of its minimum number of tokens it aimed to sell by more than $6 million, according to the New York Times.</p><p>The trouble seems to be that no one really had a complete understanding of the technology or the how Civil worked. So while there is widespread interest in the technology, there is also agreement that it is complex and underdeveloped.</p><p>However, this isn't stopping the company or ConsenSys (the company's main investor). In fact, it gave Civil an additional $3.5 million for funding to try again. Meanwhile, Larry Ryckman, editor of the Colorado Sun, an online news site founded by former Denver Post staffers and a Civil-funded newsroom, told alt-weekly newspaper Westword, Civil's failure to sell tokens didn't affect their future.</p><p>\"It's really not a huge event for us one way or the other,\" he said. \"Subscriptions are a much more stable source of funding for any organization, and we realize that's where our future is--in serving subscribers.\"</p><p>Only time will tell if Civil will succeed the second time around (which is set to launch sometime this month), but one thing is for sure, if they do succeed, our industry can expect to see a lot more of blockchain-based publishing.</p><p>(7) THE BATTLE FOR NEWS CONSUMERS</p><p>In the last decade or so, social media companies have treated news as only an add-on feature for consumers. The Pew Research Center reported that in 2018, one in five U.S. adults received their news via social media, compared to the 16 percent that got their news from print newspapers.</p><p>In a recent article for the New York Times, columnist Jim Rutenberg reflected on the convergence of technology with media. \"As newspapers fall, leaving important local issues uncovered, the social media companies contributing to their deaths are helping to fill the content void with unverified, and at worst patently false, information. Solutions are not coming fast, though smart people are working on it.\"</p><p>Though that maybe true, will it be necessary? Pew also reported that adult Facebook users have either taken a break from checking the platform for a period of several weeks or more (42 percent), or have deleted the Facebook app entirely from their phone (67 percent).</p><p>Recent headlines such as \"How to Delete Facebook\" and \"Why You Should Delete Facebook\" have cropped up. This seems to be the reaction to the number of issues the platform is fielding, including privacy concerns and the spreading of misinformation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that the company hit more than 3 million paid digital-only subscribers and more than 4 million subscribers total in 2018.</p><p>As more news consumers seek out truth and facts, it seems that the unruly and wild nature of social media is driving them into the arms of trusted news organizations. Will digital subscriptions continue to rise for media companies, and how will it affect the social media platforms that depend on their content and their audiences? It should be interesting to find out.</p><p>Caption: Podcast listeners have increased in the last year by 9 percent, and as a result, podcasters continue to create new content to satisfy demand.</p><p>Caption: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses the company's 10-year road map at the F8 conference in May 2018. Facebook came under heavy scrutiny in 2018 for privacy and data issues.</p><p>Caption: Last year, the Pew Research Center discovered that one in five U.S. adults receive their news via social media.</p><p>Please Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-574314443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 574314443</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRT-5RD1-JCBJ-K04F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1951\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Duncan McIntosh Company, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Editor &amp;

In what he calls the rise of the \"digital welfare state\", billions of dollars of public money is now being invested in automated systems that are radically changing the nature of social protection.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Poverty/Pages/SRExtremePovertyIndex.aspx\">Alston's report</url> on the human rights implications of the shift will be presented to the UN general assembly on Friday. It says that AI has the potential to improve dramatically the lives of disadvantaged communities, but warns that such hope is being lost amid the constant drive for cost cutting and \"efficiency\".</p><p>Big tech companies are being allowed to go unregulated in \"human rights free-zones\", welfare budgets are being decimated and new penalties are being imposed for non-compliance on people who may be digitally illiterate or lack access to the internet. In the UK, he notes, 12 million people, or one in five of the population, do not have essential digital skills needed for modern day-to-day life.</p><p>Alston writes that \"crucial decisions to go digital have been taken by government ministers without consultation, or even by departmental officials without any significant policy discussions taking place\". As a result of the absence of accountability, \"digital technologies are employed in the welfare state to surveil, target, harass and punish beneficiaries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable among them\".</p><p>A New York-based lawyer, Alston has become a piercing critic of inequality and disdain for basic human rights. In June 2018 he caused <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Poverty/Pages/SRExtremePovertyIndex.aspx\">major ructions</url> with the Trump administration by reporting that it was cruelly forcing millions of people into deprivation with its tax cuts for the rich. He went on to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Poverty/Pages/SRExtremePovertyIndex.aspx\">anger the British government</url> with his damning report on austerity in the UK.</p><p>Now he is likely to displease several governments who will find his report uncomfortable reading. He says that the normal state of affairs whereby governments are accountable to their citizens has been turned upside down by the introduction of automated decision-making and the removal of human discretion from welfare systems.</p><p>\"In such a world, citizens become ever more visible to their governments, but not the other way around.\"</p><p>Alston's report also tears a strip out of Big Tech companies who he says are acting as forces unto themselves. The advent of the digital revolution has allowed the private sector to appropriate huge swaths of welfare state almost without public comment.</p><p>He points to examples from around the globe of companies involved in welfare systems: Net 1's subsidiary Cash Paymaster Services together with MasterCard were initially involved in South Africa's social grant distribution system which raised privacy concerns because of its biometric data collection. In Australia, Indue and Visa helped introduce cashless debit card trials, and IBM was central to the multimillion-dollar Sams system in Canada, the US, Germany and New Zealand.</p><p>The report states that in many schemes, the role and responsibility of these corporations are opaque, rendering public accountability impossible. \"A handful of powerful executives are replacing governments and legislators in determining the directions in which societies will move and the values and assumptions which will drive those developments,\" Alston writes.</p><p>Looking to the future, the UN monitor calls for Silicon Valley to be made accountable through regulation. The self-regulation that has been permitted in the big tech sector, uniquely so among major sectors of the economy, must end and technology companies must \"legally be required to respect applicable human rights standards\".</p><p>That includes addressing the increasing use of data matching that is used to punish and criminalize low-income people. It also involves bringing under control the \"evermore refined surveillance options that enable around-the-clock monitoring of beneficiaries\".</p><p>The UN report was drawn from Alston's country visits to the UK, US and elsewhere as well as 60 submissions from 34 countries. He concludes on a rallying note, saying it is not too late to drop the obsession with fraud and the \"undeserving poor\".</p><p>Instead of inflicting misery on millions, digital technology could be used as a force for good. It could \"ensure a higher standard of living for the vulnerable and disadvantaged, devise new ways of caring for those left behind. That would be the real digital welfare state revolution.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-57009956</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8W-4CH1-F021-605Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"801\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The digitisation of the wealth management sector needs to go beyond simply moving physical into digital, Nucoro says, and fundamentally rethink products from the conceptual to execution.<br/> \u00a0<br/> The report finds that this is being driven by the rise of automation facilitating scalable growth, and the transformation of customers where their expectations, needs, behaviours and demographics are changing.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Nikolai Hack, the COO and UK MD of Nucoro, says: \u20ac\u0153As with any investment in a financial business, a central motivation should be to ultimately produce outcomes that can benefit customers. Adopting bolt-on enhancements like digital customer experiences or automations for back office functions are the best routes to upgrading the services to existing and potential clients due to their accessibility, scalability and affordability.<br/> \u00a0<br/> \u20ac\u0153Wealth managers must embrace technology. The industry is heavily regulated, and it therefore faces a large administrative burden, but technology can minimise the time and resources spent on tasks that are very basic but high in volume.\u20ac<br/> \u00a0<br/> The report says it is now realistic to consider direct to consumer robo-platforms as legitimate industry challengers. By the end of 2018, they were managing USD257 billion, and this could grow to USD1.26 trillion by 2023.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Meanwhile, while tradition still reigns supreme in wealth management, Nucoro says, there are major indications that the next decade will see technology driven services enjoy strong growth. Taking an example from another industry, looking at the banking and payments market in Europe \u20ac\u201c new entrants (including challenger banks, nonbank payment institutions and big tech companies) that entered the market after 2005 now amass up to one third of new revenue, despite only taking 7 per cent of the overall revenue.<br/> \u00a0<br/> The cost of financial advice is demonstrably pricing out large sections of potential clients, Nucoro says. A report in 2018 found that more than 40 per cent of financial advisers has been forced to review their charging structures in the first half of 2019, the report says, representing a huge threat and opportunity for wealth managers.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Beginning around 2030, an estimated USD4 trillion of wealth is going to be passed on to millennials in the UK and North America from their parents.<br/> \u20ac\u0153However, only some 20 per cent of UK advisers currently have an existing relationship with their current clients' beneficiaries, many of whom are millennials. This means that digital and mobile first access will become more universal as the younger generations mature. Digital finance is a highly effective engagement tool for younger generations.\u20ac<br/> \u00a0<br/> Hack says: \u20ac\u0153An unprecedented transfer of wealth is expected to be served by a shrinking pool of advisers. They will be dealing with a client base that is likely to need them to become more flexible and deliver a more modern and personal service.<br/> \u00a0<br/> \u20ac\u0153This could mean more agile tech-driven firms will need to fill the gap. Alternatively, the existing firms could push to streamline their operational functions and manage overheads \u20ac\u201c cost cutting essentially \u20ac\u201c while handling an influx of orphaned clients at the same time.<br/> \u00a0<br/> \u20ac\u0153For the next generation, their needs and expectations are centred on interacting with their finances via digitally accessible platforms that link their money, their everyday lives and their goals to the future. Greater customisation of service levels will also be key here.\u20ac<br/> \u00a0<br/> Finally, Nucoro comments that the amount of regulatory change that regulated organisations must track on a global scale has more than tripled since 2011 and good technological solutions can help wealth managers carry that burden. inhouse contentResearchCopy type:\u00a0inhouse</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTDV-278533</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTDV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X17-7001-DXSP-9551-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"719\"/><timeReceived>09:37 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GFM Ltd.

They're called binary option scams. Don't be baffled by the name. There are questions about whether authorities and big tech companies are doing enough to stop them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, Mario, I have to admit that until you started this story I had never heard of binary options scams, and when you first mentioned it to me, I had a little snooze.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: I hope that I've sort of convinced you that they are actually fascinating and they are very scary. But just a few years ago even our financial regulator didn't think that they were a major issue. Another scam that I'm sure you are familiar with, the Nigerian love letters scam that winds up in your junk box or spam filter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: The, 'Hi, I've never been married...'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: That's the one.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: 'Write me an email if you're looking for a relationship.'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Those scams generally top the list of the biggest scams. Over the last few years you've seen investment scams beating dating and romance scams. Since binary options came onto the scene, they have pushed investment scams to top the list as the scams that cost Australians the most money.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: How much?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: $31 million is how much investment scams are worth. Binary option scams are worth about $4.5 million. That doesn't sound like much but that is a fraction and a very small fraction of the total amount that it costs Australians.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: Right, well Mario, if I didn't know about binary option scams before, I definitely do now and that's because we've had this amazing insight because you actually got hold of a scammer himself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Yeah, Shlomo Blitz is a good guide through what might seem a pretty confusing world, he used to be the guy on the other end of the phone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Shlomo, I'm sitting here with my executive producer Alice Brennan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: Hi Shlomo.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: I've been trying to explain binary options and she doesn't get it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: I don't get it, Shlomo, I'm sorry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: Basically all you really need to do in binary options is predict a certain movement of the market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: Shlomo this doesn't sound very simple. This does not sound simple.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: Okay, well binary, you know the word 'binary' means either/or. That's what the actual word actually means.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: Right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: So all you're really doing is making your prediction whether a certain asset is going up or down in a certain time frame.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: And that asset can be anything.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: Yeah, it could be a stock, a commodity, foreign exchange. Technically, it can be even the price of your TV. So the scam actually starts from the moment I would get on the phone with you. Obviously I'm not saying 'Hi Alice, this is Schlomo speaking from an office here in Tel Aviv', I'm calling you from London or from God knows where, we're an investing firm. So already from the beginning the lies begin.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: So you don't even say your real name when you call me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: No, no one does, no one in the industry would actually use their real name and if they do, they'll use a fake family name.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Hey Shlomo, what was your made-up name?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: My made-up name...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: Or did it change every week?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: No, no, it was it was pretty much the same, it was Scott Martin. You're not really investing money, so if you have an account with, who knows, $1,000, $10,000 in there, that's an illusion because that money, that's not really money in there, it's all a big charade. The money that you send has has gone to some kind of account somewhere in some island...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: Like in the BVI.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: Yeah, and from there you can be sure that that money was already transferred into 10 different accounts somewhere else around the world. It's not real, no, not at all. It's basically...it's a casino, that's what it is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: So there are two types of binary option setups, right Mario? You'll hear about both of them in this story.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: There are the licensed operators and then there are scams. The licensed operators are regulated but they're still considered pretty risky.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: And the unlicensed operators are mostly just scams, focusing solely on stealing your money?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Yes, and it's these unlicensed operations, the scams, that have become one of the biggest frauds in Australia in a really short time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alice Brennan</emphasis>: So Mario, you unpicked these international scams and followed their money trail all over the world, the UK, New Zealand, the Caribbean, the Philippines, back to Australia, and then on to Israel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Shlomo lives in Tel Aviv, Israel's second largest city. His life as a scammer began in 2013. He was working in a 24-hour sales centre, and his wife was getting a little annoyed at the long hours.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: I was working a lot of nights, weekends, holidays and all that stuff, and at the time my wife was kind of unhappy that I was doing that, so at some point she said to me basically find yourself a new job. An old friend of mine from high school calls me probably within that week or so and he says to me, 'I'm working at binary options, I need workers.' At the time I had absolutely no idea what binary options were.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: His new employer was based in Herzliya Pituah, Israel's version of Silicon Valley. Big companies like Apple have an office there, alongside slick start-ups. And that's where Shlomo was headed when he suited up for his job interview five years ago.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: I had to sit for an interview, it was kind of like for the books interview, because I got there through him which he was a manager at the time, so they were explaining what binary options are, but they are showing it in a way of this is legit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: These scammers usually find their victims online and then move on to gain their trust over the phone.</p><p>But Shlomo didn't see himself as a scammer. He genuinely thought he was there to help clients make money. What he ended up realising was that he wasn't there to make money, he was there to steal it.</p><p>You'll hear binary option scams dressed up as trading, as investing. To the untrained ear it sounds legit. But listen closely, this is just like any other scam. It's all designed to separate you and your money. And once you hand it over, chances are you'll never see it again.</p><p>Shlomo used a sales technique called the five call strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: The first call you don't even talk to them about more money, it's like forbidden, and from there you go into the second call, the second call you're starting to really trade. And once you're really showing this person some profit and he's really starting to trust you, you are going to call the person and be like 'you know, there's this great position coming right now' and start getting him all psyched up about it. It could be inside information, you know it doesn't really matter where this information came from but it's a crazy, crazy opportunity and you've got to get in on this, it's a very big amount that you could go in on. And you are basically telling the person 'you can't lose this, there's no chance you lose this'.</p><p>And then what happens is the guy says 'okay, how much is it', I don't know, a few hundred thousand dollars' or whatever, he puts the money in, you go into that trade. Now what happens is you so-called win that trade, that's it, you've won the person over, he thinks you're a genius. And then the person is yours. Whatever you tell him to do, he'll do that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: So let's recap. Never ask for money on the first call. Show them how to trade and make a profit on the second, third, fourth call. And on the fifth? On the fifth call you really rope them in. Tell them about a big deal going down, a deal they just can't refuse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: Hi, how are you doing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe</emphasis>: Good, good, what's going on?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: On the phone is a broker and her client, who we'll call Joe. This is an actual phone call between the two from 2016. The broker is trying to convince Joe to get in on a new deal. She's asking him to bet that the share price of four companies will go up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: Okay, very interesting, very, very interesting. I just need a little bit of your time, I have a very, very big opportunity for us, okay. The option is currently sitting in my division alone, right now, with only my clients at $5.2 mil. My guys are jumping on this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe</emphasis>: Okay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: That's how big it is. If you wanna go in heavy this year, and actually touch the mil within the next three months, three, four months, I need you in with me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: The broker says this deal is like nothing she has ever seen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: When I talk to my guys and I'm sitting on the phone for five minutes, all I said was X, Y and Z they go 'holy shit, the time is now'.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: She's asking him to bet that four companies are going to increase in price. Those companies are Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which she collectively calls FANG. She wants him to bet $500,000. And Joe is worried.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: Minimum investment is five hundred.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe</emphasis>: Okay, that assumes I have access to that, I don't know how I would even get that without...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: It's gonna jump, we've got up until...I would say the positions right now are closing, even my VIP division in Cyprus, and my VIP division is going to get wind of FANG, because right now I have exclusivity on FANG.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Joe sounds like he'd struggle to afford just half that amount.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe</emphasis>: If I was to come up with $250,000...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: I would say that that's weak, I would say that for this position it's weak. I would say 500 and you're pulling in at least enough to get a profit margin, and you are going to be so far in the money that $5 million is going to look like peanuts to us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Joe mentions he happens to have access to a company account with $1 million in reserve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe</emphasis>: I'm going to have to get approval from them to do this, if they are all going to ask about what the risk is and for me trying to explain to them what you told me is almost next to impossible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: I get that but they don't know the markets, I don't think they...unless they are in the market, then they wouldn't understand it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe</emphasis>: No, they wouldn't, no idea, no way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: You know what this is and you know how liquid you are and you know what I'm capable of, this is why I am telling you to take sole action and do this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe</emphasis>: I am now going into the realm of OPM, other people's money, so I want to be able to go back to them and say, 'Hey guys...'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: You can go back to them and say the upside is 'Winner winner chicken dinner. Here's one for you, one for you and one for you.'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: To close the deal, the broker promises to pay for any losses using her own money.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe</emphasis>: All right, I will work on this and I will try and execute it tomorrow. Hopefully that's fast enough for you</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broker</emphasis>: It's fast enough, I'm holding the position now, unofficially the position is yours, welcome to FANG.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe</emphasis>: Ah you're killing me girl, you're killing me, okay, all right, I'm on the horse, I don't know where it's going. I'm praying.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Now, let's get some things straight. FANG, the way this broker talks about it, is a fiction. The 'VIP division' she mentions, it probably doesn't exist. She's not going to use her own money to bail out Joe if he loses because she is not a real broker, she is a scam artist. And, really, it's that simple. Scammers pose as brokers to convince you to hand over your money.</p><p>Joe lost over a million dollars through this scam. Most victims, after they hand over their money, will never see it again.</p><p>We asked Shlomo for his take on the recording.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: If you look at it on a professional sales level, she was a very good salesman, there's no question about it, she had it all written down, she got herself ready at the beginning of her work day, maybe it may have even been her first call, I don't know. They do that, they do a market review and that's why she was also able to use all this terminology that sounds real, but the bottom line at the end of the day, if you took this girl now into Wall Street, let's say, and say to her, 'okay start selling real stocks', she can't.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Shlomo says people fall for binary option scams because, in his words, 'they want to believe'. Most clients-or victims-he says just want a better life. And that's exactly what he sold.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: A lot of these people just don't have money and they want to find a way how they can make fast money so they actually live a normal life. If I didn't know any better I would think, wow, this girl, she knows, she knows the market, she knows how to work, it sounds very convincing, and put that together with a person who wants to believe, he wants to believe that he can get out of whatever he's in, they'll sell, they'll buy, that's how it is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Shlomo didn't think much about the consequences of his job. That is, until one particular phone call.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: This one lady from South Africa, very, very sweet lady, she put in $200 which is the minimum amount of deposit and she got to me, so I started working with her, talking to her. And she was able to put another $300 in, basically she was able to put $500 in, which is a very small amount, but for her, she was very, very excited, she was literally crying to me on the phone. She was telling me how she got her salary yesterday, it was $500, she is really, really excited, she trusts us, she's putting the money in, she knows we're going to make her money, and at the back of my mind at this point already I knew that she's probably going to lose that money, and yet I still took it. I felt really bad about it. And just like...that was the point where it really hit me. I was thinking to myself I can't believe I am doing this to these people, I really...this is just horrible, like it's really bad thing to do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Some European countries say binary option scams now make up a quarter of all fraud complaints. In Australia, government researchers have watched losses increase ninefold since 2014.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delia Rickard</emphasis>: There's been a huge increase in binary options scams in recent years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: That's Delia Rickard, deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. It releases statistics on the biggest scams in Australia.</p><p>Three years ago, for the first time, investment scams, fuelled by an increase in binary option fraud, topped the list.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delia Rickard</emphasis>: If I look at just the ACCC statistics, back in 2014 we had a bit less than half a million dollars in losses to these scams reported to us, by 2016 we had around $4.5 million.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Ms Rickard is only talking about the illegal side of the industry, the unlicensed operators. And she only has statistics on the scams we know about. That's around 5% of the total.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delia Rickard</emphasis>: Which means there's an awful lot out there that we haven't recorded in the statistics</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: We are potentially talking in the hundreds of millions then?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delia Rickard</emphasis>: I think we are talking in the hundreds of millions, and we have just seen a very, very big increase in the last couple of years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: One thing that sets binary option scams apart from other scams is the large amount of money people tend to lose. The average loss is around $43,000 per person.</p><p>Patrick Venaille estimates he lost a lot more than that, more than half a million dollars in just three months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: I came across on the internet something that was described as an automatic money making program.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: 59-year-old Patrick was semi-retired. He remembers searching for an investment that could generate some cash flow.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: So I opened that webpage and listened to a guy talking on the other side forever. I kind of left my name and contact number and the next thing I know I got somebody that got in touch with me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: The man who rang him was a broker, called Don.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: He was very polite, very, very polite, he was always talking about...his way was to make a good team and look at long term investment and have a clear plan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Patrick and Don did seem to make a good team. In a single hour's trading, Patrick says they made $200,000, or at least that's what it said on his computer screen.</p><p>In January 2015 he told Don he needed to withdraw $220,000.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: Basically he said, why do you want it now, we can make more money out of that amount. And I said, look, I've got a development, I've got a partner on to that development and I need the money. Then he said 'okay, by Friday it will be all organised'.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Friday came and went but there was no money. Patrick started to worry. And then, disaster struck. On Don's advice Patrick bet big. In just three trading sessions, his account balance went from more than $1 million, to just $9,000.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: I asked him 'what's going on', you know, then I started panicking a bit and you get to a stage where, what do you do, you stop, you lost a lot of money or you trust the guy that you used to trust 110% when he says we can make it up again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: In his panic, Patrick called Don on Skype. He recorded the conversation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: Don, in three days we went from 1.1 to nothing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don</emphasis>: Right, because you wanted also, if you remember, the thing that I wanted to do is to create a net of $1 million so you can just free it all up, any withdrawal that you like at any given time, without any issues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: Don, what are you telling me, that the money is not there and it's my fault?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don</emphasis>: I'm not saying, first of all, I'm not saying it's your fault, no, I'm not saying it's your fault, absolutely not, and it is not our fault either, it's a matter of numbers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: Hang on, hang on, why did you keep on asking me to trade when we were losing big time? Why didn't we stop, why didn't we stop?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don</emphasis>: First of all, I'm not really, you know, I'm not really, aaah...if we have a winning trade we have a winning trade, if we have a losing trade, we have a losing trade, for me it doesn't really make a difference...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: Ha!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don</emphasis>: ...because sometimes you lose and sometimes you win, that's how it is and you know it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Stories like this are common among the victims of binary option scams. Just when you want to take out your money, your broker pushes you to bet big. Patrick lost more than half a million dollars. He had to sell his house, and borrow money from his brother-in-law to repay debts. It's a period he doesn't like to speak about.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: You know, it's not a time I like to go back to, but you are faced with no recourse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: He says his life will never be the same.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Venaille</emphasis>: I'm still struggling now, we're living in a two-bedroom apartment and I am slowly making another life, if you want, but it's not the same level as where we were.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Don told Patrick he was based in London. His number even began with the United Kingdom's telephone code, 44, which Patrick now believes was faked.</p><p>The truth is, Don could have been anywhere. These are global operations in every sense. While the headquarters might be in Tel Aviv, the brokers could be in India, Bangladesh, or in a call centre outside Manila. The Philippines is a known hub for internet scams of all varieties, including binary option scams.</p><p>In 2015 cyber-crime investigator Ken Gamble was in the Philippines tracking the sale of fake medicines. He stumbled across a binary option scam operating out of a call centre just north of Manilla in the province of Pampanga.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Gamble</emphasis>: We were looking at a number of websites and we were asked to investigate and try to find out who was behind these websites and as it turned out we tracked the websites to a call centre.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: A specialist cybercrime group prepared to raid the call centre in Pampanga. Twenty police officers were involved.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Gamble</emphasis>: We just waited for the signal and as soon as we had that go signal we were straight in there.</p><p>[Audio of raid]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Ken recorded the raid on his phone. The footage shows rows and rows of cubicles. Hanging on the wall are whiteboards and on one are workers' names listed next to their total call count. One worker, Roxanne, has made 171 calls. In the footage, workers look puzzled.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Gamble</emphasis>: What sort of business are you running here?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Call centre worker</emphasis>: Hi, we're basically a call centre.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Ken said he found call logs and other paper records in the office of a manager.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Gamble</emphasis>: We very quickly found a lot of documentation that related to binary option companies. We did find some copies of emails, there were notes, discussions with people from Australia but definitely Australian victims were amongst the victims from many, many other countries as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: He says police then seized around 150 hard drives, so many they couldn't fit them in the police cars and had to bring in a bus.</p><p>Now, here's where things got interesting. Around a week after the raid, when police took a long look at the hard drives, they discovered, to their surprise, that there was nothing on them. Someone had disconnected the computers from the database as officers arrived. Ken described it as a 'kill switch'.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Gamble</emphasis>: They actually killed the database, so whilst the police were able to seize all the computers and even the servers, there was no evidence on them, there was nothing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: And there was another discovery. While police were raiding the call centre they were being watched on security cameras. But Ken says the cameras weren't being monitored in the Philippines, they were being watched on the other side of the world in Israel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ken Gamble</emphasis>: They were watching what was going on 24/7 inside that call centre, they would have known when the police walked in, they would have seen it on their cameras in Israel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: So the people really controlling this scheme weren't even in the Philippines. Just like so many other binary option scams, the base of operations was in Israel.</p><p>Austin Smith lives in Tel Aviv. He's worked with Ken to track binary option scams. He runs Wealth Recovery International, a company which tries to get victims their money back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Austin Smith</emphasis>: Usually you are looking at very large syndicates of organised crime and these people have either Eastern European connections to organised crime or to some Middle Eastern or Israeli crime family and that's usually who is connected to it at the very top.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Austin says his work can be dangerous. He tells a story about a morning when his business partner walked outside her front door to find a small flashing light planted on her car.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Austin Smith</emphasis>: She had to call police, it was a fake bomb, she woke up with the police with the robotics there trying to look at it, it ended up being a GPS device.</p><p>For about two weeks we were followed every single night out of the office. Lights flashing behind you, you know, just someone flicking their brights to you, and we would leave the office very late at night. We had to hire actually an ex Shabak, Shin Bet security officer with a gun to stand inside the office for over a month to check underneath the car to make sure there was no bomb in the car. This is the fear of everyone going in from this office.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: But not all of Austin's investigations involve threats of violence. And some lead to the most unexpected places. He began chatting about a case he's recently worked on involving a company called Binary Tilt. So we thought we'd take a close look at the company ourselves and see what we could see. We visited Binary Tilt's website and, I've got to admit, it looks pretty slick. It shows smooth time-lapse footage of traders gathered around computer monitors, it shows businesspeople walking down the streets of London. The company's motto, plastered across the home page, says 'COME INSIDE, NO SUIT REQUIRED'.</p><p>Binary Tilt is unlicensed in Australia. Authorities in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and South Africa have all issued warnings about it. It was registered as a financial services provider in New Zealand for around two years.</p><p>Last year, our own regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, warned people to stay away from Binary Tilt, saying it could possibly be a scam.</p><p>We reached out to former Binary Tilt clients and found Western Australian project manager David Steele. David worked in the railways, and in 2016 he was planning for his retirement. His story follows a similar trajectory to Patrick's, which we heard earlier. Except for one detail; David actually met the people on the other end of the phone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Steele</emphasis>: We met them at a hotel in Singapore. I suppose our intent was to trip them up a bit, but at no stage did something jump out at us to say that, hang on, we're not too sure about these guys. They had beautiful bottles of scotch, scarves for the girls and...well, as it is I am a bit partial to scotch, it was a very good bottle of scotch, they were bottles of Glenfiddich\u00c2 18-year-old.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: David began depositing money with the company in October 2016. In those early days he said he was making about an 80% return on his investment. And on a couple of occasions he was able to withdraw some money.</p><p>But in July 2017, he told Binary Tilt he wanted to pull out around $50,000 for a deposit on his daughter's first home. Binary Tilt failed to hand the money over. And the timing couldn't have been worse. David and his wife had just flown out of Perth for a family holiday in France and Croatia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Steele</emphasis>: It was absolutely frustrating, they then made that commitment that the money would be paid as promised, and then within the week or two weeks nothing had happened, another contact, all you did was get fobbed off all the time. Nobody would make a commitment 100%, so it was very infuriating and frustrating and we certainly exchanged some heated communications.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: David didn't want us to tell you his total losses, but it was in the hundreds of thousands. He says his last contact with Binary Tilt was in November 2017. Despite trying, he hasn't heard from them since.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Steele</emphasis>: It's different at the end of the day if somebody's broken into your house and robbed, you know, it is what it is unfortunately, but something like this where people have promised that they are going to give you a service and a product and they don't return and then they set the dogs on you, if that's the right word, and then totally remove all contact, block you out of your account and cease all forms of communication. I've followed up through several means to try and make contact with these people, absolutely nothing, no comment, no communication at all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: We thought we'd try contacting Binary Tilt ourselves. I mean, how hard could it be? On their website they list two numbers. So we tried their London office.</p><p>\u00c2 [Phone ringing]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Automated Message</emphasis>: The number you called could not be reached, please try again in a few minutes. This has been a free call.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Disconnected. So we tried their Manchester office.</p><p>[Phone rings, engaged tone]</p><p>No luck there, either. So we dug a little deeper. Binary Tilt is owned by a company called Chemmi Holdings Limited. We googled their address. They are based in central London, in a building occupied by a company called London Presence. What does London Presence do?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recorded message</emphasis>: Thank you for calling London Presence, your call may be monitored or recorded for quality and training purposes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Receptionist</emphasis>: Good morning, how may I help?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Hello, my name is Mario Christodoulou, I'm a journalist calling from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Sydney, Australia. I was wondering if you could put me through to Binary Tilt, please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Receptionist</emphasis>: If I could put you through to who sorry?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: To Binary Tilt, their company is based at this address, at this number that I'm calling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Receptionist</emphasis>: Okay, so we are a company that is providing services for other companies like registered office address, so that means that English companies can actually use our address to register their companies here. Basically companies choose to go for this kind of service because it will keep their residential address private.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Another dead end. But we weren't finished yet. Chemmi Holdings Limited, the owner of Binary Tilt, is owned by another company called Depix Holdings. Its registered address is in St Vincent and the Grenadines, a small idyllic Caribbean nation. Chances are you've seen it before, as the backdrop to the movie <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pirates of the Caribbean</emphasis>.</p><p>[Excerpt from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pirates of the Caribbean</emphasis>]</p><p>[Phone rings]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Hello, have I reached St Vincent and the Grenadines?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Receptionist</emphasis>: Yes sir.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: I'm trying to speak to a company called Depix Holdings, I was wondering if you could put me through.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Receptionist</emphasis>: What happened, Depix registered in St Vincent as an international business company, but Depix operations is not in St Vincent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: I'm a bit confused, how does that work? Because when I checked their address on their company's house documentation in London, it had an address in St Vincent and the Grenadines and I...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Receptionist</emphasis>: That's right, that's the registered address. In St Vincent there's a lot of companies from around the world that register as international business companies here. However, although they are registered as an international business company, their operations are not in physically in St Vincent and the Grenadines.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: We'd hit a brick wall.</p><p>We scoured the internet for other Binary Tilt clients. We spoke to former clients from across the world, including Australia. One was a 91-year-old pensioner, who says she mistakenly handed over her credit card details. Everyone we spoke to was angry and all felt they'd been scammed. But we were still no closer to finding out who was behind Binary Tilt. So I asked Austin Smith about his own investigation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Austin Smith</emphasis>: And so what we were able to discover, and this is based on affidavits that we received from previous workers, that it was owned by a Louis Detata who was living in Australia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: So we decided to check this out for ourselves. We told David Steele about what the paperwork showed, and it sparked a memory. He remembered something his broker from Binary Tilt had said to him.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Steele</emphasis>: She had indicated that her boss was from Australia. We had asked on a number of occasions to meet this gentleman and that had been declined on the basis that he was a very busy man.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: It turns out that the person registered as having 'significant control' over Binary Tilt's parent company up until October 2017, at least on paper, was a 37-year-old woman living near Perth called Tamica Sharon Payne. What does 'significant control' mean? It means she had the right to hire and fire directors.</p><p>Her listed address on corporate documents is a house which, according to land title records, is owned by a 40-year-old former investment adviser called Louis Guy Detata. Mr Detata, a former Morgan Stanley financial adviser, it turns out originally owned the Binary Tilt website. Seven months after he left Morgan Stanley, in August 2013, the Binary Tilt website was registered in his name and he remained the owner for 18 months, during which time the company that owned Binary Tilt was registered as a financial services provider in New Zealand.</p><p>On March 9, 2015, four days after Mr Detata says he left the company, the Canadian Securities Administrators raised the alarm about Binary Tilt, advising Canadians to steer clear because it was unlicensed in Canada.</p><p>We contacted Mr Detata and Ms Payne. They declined to be interviewed. Through his lawyer Mr Detata says he had nothing to do with Binary Tilt since March 2015, when the business was disposed of. He says that while he owned the company, he made all efforts not to trade in unlicensed countries, and people detected trading from those countries had their accounts frozen and original deposit refunded, a fact which he says may account for any complaints from that period. He said on occasion he's continued to provide ad hoc advice to those who now manage Binary Tilt, even going as far as to help former clients recover their money from the business.</p><p>Ms Payne, through her lawyer, says she should not have been registered as having significant control over the company. She says the UK parent company was created in order to transfer Binary Tilt to new owners and her name was recorded in error. She says she has previously written to UK authorities to correct the record.</p><p>They both told us they had nothing to do with the running of the company when complaints were made and when people we've spoken to claimed they were burned. So then, who are the true owners of Binary Tilt? The answers are might lie in company records in offshore jurisdictions, where such information isn't publicly accessible, and it may never see the light of day.</p><p>Now, up until this point we've been talking about the illegal side of the industry. But there's another side. In Australia, binary options are legal and some companies are licensed and regulated. Licensed operators are overseen by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. They are regularly audited and, if things go wrong, customers can complain to an independent umpire.</p><p>But many experts say even when it's regulated, it's not trading, it's not investing, it's gambling. They point to the fact that bets can take place over a very short time period of time, sometimes just 15 minutes, and the bets are win or lose, all or nothing, just like gambling.</p><p>Licensed companies we've spoken to say calling it gambling is a 'gross oversimplification'. But even the corporate regulator in an interview falls into the language of gambling when asked about binary options.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Yanco</emphasis>: If you think of binary, sounds like I'm going to win or lose half the time maybe, but I think we are seeing that's not the case.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: That's Greg Yanco, head of market supervision at the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Yanco</emphasis>: We've seen issues around how the underlying calculation of whether you win or lose occurs, how it occurs, when it occurs, and so we think that these products are high risk and people need to be really careful about what they're investing in, and do they really understand who they're dealing with and what they're dealing with.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: You are using words like 'bet' and 'win or lose', not traditional words that you'd associate with, say, an investment scheme. What's the difference between binary options and gambling?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Yanco</emphasis>: I think it's been put to me that gambling, you might have a better outcome occasionally than on binary options, but I'll leave that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Mr Yanco is in the midst of a review into licensed binary option setups. The report isn't out yet but he told us that, so far, it doesn't look good.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Yanco</emphasis>: We've recently done what we would call a deep dive into the licensed providers of these products and one of the things we've asked about is how often their clients win or lose. We're now reviewing all that information and we'll be able to say a little bit later in the year what those win-loss ratios are. But the preliminary indication is that it is concerning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Greg Yanco is also trying to stop unlicensed operations. And he's taken a novel approach. Instead of just going after the operators, he's also targeted the facilitators, companies like Apple, Google and Facebook which have historically carried binary option ads online.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Yanco</emphasis>: Early last year we contacted both Apple and Google about the advertising of binary options apps on the App store and Google Play store. The problem for us was that we saw about 330 apps for binary options that were offered by people who were not licensed in Australia. So we thought that it would be fair enough to contact Google and Apple and ask them if they would take those apps down.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Apple and Google agreed. But that wasn't the end of it. In June last year, Apple updated its developer guidance, banning any apps that facilitate binary option trading. Six months later, Facebook followed suit, banning binary option advertisements. But there's one company that's happy to carry binary option apps, and it's strangely the one whose unofficial motto is 'don't be evil'. It's Google.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delia Rickard</emphasis>: Google's proposition is that they are a source you can trust, they are someone who will give you the best results, towards the top of the list always, so I think there is a reputational issue involved for them in showing results for binary options.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delia Rickard</emphasis>: That's Delia Rickard from the ACCC again. She says government authorities across the world have written to Google asking it to take down binary option apps. But they're still there. Try searching for binary options on the Google app store and you will find more than 200 results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delia Rickard</emphasis>: I would like Google to follow the request of regulators. ASIC, the US financial services regulator, the Canadian ones have all asked Google to stop showing results for binary options. Unfortunately it does appear they're still showing them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: We contacted Google, and it said it takes concerns like this very seriously and is 'actively investigating' the situation.</p><p>Banning binary option ads and apps is one thing. Other countries have taken it a step further. Canada and Belgium have banned binary options outright. In October last year, Israel introduced its own ban.</p><p>But Austin doesn't think the laws have had much impact.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Austin Smith</emphasis>: When it comes to the Israeli legislation that was passed against binary options, it's usually a day late and a dollar short. I am familiar with right now multiple binary options offices with over a hundred employees in them today within about 15 minutes of my office, in Israel, and these people go to work, they have a sign, they recruit like nothing's changed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: In Australia, licensed binary option operators are legal. As countries across the world walk away from binary options, the question for our regulator is, will Australia be next? We asked ASIC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Yanco</emphasis>: At the moment we don't have the legal right to ban binary options. We don't have that right now, although there is a proposal that ASIC have a product intervention power and if we were to get that power we would certainly look at the binary options that are offered to Australians and whether there should be some use of that power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: But it's not the licensed operators that do the most damage, it's the scams, and there are hundreds of them. It's these illegal operations that really worry regulators, and that's because there's not a lot they can do about them.</p><p>We asked Delia Rickard if there is any hope for victims trying to get their money back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delia Rickard</emphasis>: Realistically you've got very, very little chance whatsoever. You could talk to your bank if you transferred money through a bank and there may be some remedies there, but you are very, very unlikely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: Shlomo is now working with Austin to help catch and prosecute binary option scammers. Back when he was a scammer, he used to work the morning shift where he would often speak to Australians.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: A lot of the leads will be Australians, for a few reasons. Australians, we could say they are...how would I say it, they are easier to talk with, they are polite people, they are nice people, a lot of times even fun to talk to, you know, really nice people. I wouldn't say these are easy targets, but they were definitely good targets in terms of binary options.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: It took Shlomo almost a year to come to terms with his life as a scammer. Looking back, he says he felt dirty.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shlomo Blitz</emphasis>: You know, I actually went to therapy for a whole year, just to get myself back to who I really am. I felt like it just wrecked me, you know, from the inside it just kind of like ate my soul. And I had to...kind of like a junkie, like a junkie has to clean himself up from the drugs and everything, and it's kind of like that. It's kind of like I felt like everything inside me was dirty. It was just like it has to be cleaned up, it has to be taken care of.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mario Christodoulou</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Background Briefing</emphasis>'s sound engineer this week is Judy Rapley, our sound producer is Leila Shunnar, production by Brendan King and our series producer Jess O'Callaghan, additional production help by Judah Kauffman, our executive producer is Alice Brennan.</p><p>I'm Mario Christodoulou.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-9522996</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RVX-WVP1-JCM0-63W8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6871\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 8, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, Economics and Finance</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000759</classCode><className>FRAUD &amp; FINANCIAL CRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DKD4</classCode><className>COURTSHIP &amp; DATING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST00096SE</classCode><className>EMAIL MARKETING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00090O3</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000568</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC MAIL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST00096SE</classCode><className>EMAIL MARKETING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Ask any consumer of financial products having to go through hundreds of pages of product disclosure written in unintelligible legalese,\" said Mr Menon.</p><p>The board and senior management of financial institutions are responsible for setting a clear strategy in fair dealing, he noted.</p><p>Against this backdrop, Mr Menon said MAS has conducted a stocktake of culture and conduct practices across selected financial institutions.</p><p>With MAS intensifying its supervisory emphasis on the culture and conduct within financial institutions, the regulator's supervisors had extensive one-on-one conversations with not just the management of these financial institutions but also staff across the ranks.</p><p>In doing so, MAS tried to develop a keener sense of whether \"the organisational values plastered on the walls of the board room were practised on the ground\", said Mr Menon.</p><p>\"What have we found? Culture and conduct practices are uneven in the industry. Many financial institutions still struggle to articulate the conduct risks they face,\" Mr Menon said.</p><p>He added that many financial institutions are \"only starting\" to develop tools and indicators to get a fuller, cross-functional view of the culture within their organisation.</p><p>MAS has set up a steering group with the banks to identify emerging trends in conduct and behaviour as well as share best practices in \"getting the culture right\".</p><p>The regulator has also set up a small behavioural sciences unit to help supervisors with methodologies get a better understanding of culture and conduct issues in the institutions they supervise, he said.</p><p>In Singapore, prospective financial advisory representatives will in time be tested on their understanding of ethical principles as well, going beyond just product knowledge and skills to engage their customers to understand their financial needs and risk profiles, said Mr Menon.</p><p>Into its 12th edition, the Symposium on Asian Banking and Finance is jointly organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the MAS.</p><p>In a keynote address, Mary Daly, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said she has a front-row seat watching the wariness of financial firms.

Owners who are committed to, and accountable for, doing right by their customers and their communities.\"</p><p>The financial sector still suffers from a trust deficit globally. Mr Menon cited the Edelman Trust Barometer that showed financial services was the least trusted industry out of 15 industries.</p><p>\"Why this mistrust?

But over all the city has problems the rest of the country would love to have. Start-up technology companies are clamoring for the prestige of a Palo Alto address. The vibrancy of Stanford University keeps the city young and humming.</p><p>In an election year, with nearly constant squawking from presidential candidates about well-paying jobs, the mayor of Palo Alto has an unusual message for some of the cash-flush tech companies based here: Go away. Please.</p><p>''Big tech companies are choking off the downtown,'' Mayor Patrick Burt said.

In the charming downtown, where battalions of tech workers from companies like Amazon stroll the streets, their eyes often glued to their smartphones, the mayor is looking to enforce, in some form, an all-but-forgotten zoning regulation that bans companies whose primary business is research and development, including software coding. (To repeat: The mayor is considering enforcing a ban on coding at ground zero of Silicon Valley.)</p><p>''This is crazy,'' said Kate Vershov Downing, a lawyer who lit up the internet this month when she announced that she was quitting the city's planning commission because she was moving someplace cheaper. ''This is Silicon Valley. We've been writing code here for decades.''</p><p>I interviewed Ms. Downing on Facebook Live, but the connection kept cutting out. Her husband, Steve, works for Palantir Technologies, a software company, and joined the interview.</p><p>The symbolism of the couple's departure from Palo Alto is poignant: Even a lawyer married to an engineer can't afford Palo Alto. (The median price of a home is around $2.5 million, making it one of the most expensive places in the country.)</p><p>But as symbols go, it's hard to beat the paradox of bad cellphone reception in the cradle of cutting-edge technology.</p><p>Brian Reid, a computer scientist and Palo Alto resident, blames ''an unbelievable, fanatical fear of cell towers'' among Palo Alto residents for the somewhat spotty coverage, and he said heavy data usage compounded the problem.</p><p>Mr. Reid, who lives four doors from the house of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple who died in 2011, remembers the irony in 2007, a time of even worse cellphone coverage, when the iPhone was being introduced.</p><p>Mr. Jobs had to leave his house to make calls, Mr. Reid said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-2214917</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KKP-VY91-JC85-N32Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>September 1, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

However, regulatory and business forces could lead Silicon Valley to seek out wireless partnerships with companies like Dish. While Ergen did not identify potential partners,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis><br/> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis><br/> \u00a0came up during the discussion as two tech firms that could benefit from a wireless connection.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shares of Dish dropped 2.3% to $62.93 on Monday following its earnings report. The company said it earned 76 cents per share in the first quarter, topping forecasts of 70 cents per share, according to FactSet. However, sales of $3.68 billion missed forecasts of $3.76 billion.\u00a0</p><p>A confluence of factors could push big tech companies into wireless, Ergen suggested.</p><p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has proposed unwinding net neutrality regulations, which prevents blocking or prioritizing traffic online. The move would shift power to the network operators like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AT&amp;T</emphasis><br/> , <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast</emphasis><br/> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Verizon</emphasis><br/> , and away from the Facebook, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Netflix</emphasis><br/> , Amazon and others that sell ads, content and products online.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, the importance of being connected to the Internet is growing.\u00a0\"One or more people from Silicon Valley will look at [wireless] more seriously,\" Ergen predicted, \"not just because of perhaps net neutrality regulations being weakened but because their business depends on connectivity.\"</p><p>Facebook CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has noted the heightened role that connectivity plays in the social media company's plans, Ergen noted.</p><p>\"Whether it be balloons or drones or connectivity or autonomous vehicles or health care, Silicon Valley is all over connectivity,\" Ergen said. The big tech groups will have to make sure they do not find themselves in a bind in which \"their traffic, their connectivity is clogged,\" he added.</p><p>The reference to balloons could refer to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet</emphasis>'s  <br/>  , which aims to provide broadband through balloons.

Consultant Tim Farrar of TMF Associates suggested recently that  , as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TheStreet.com</emphasis> reported.\u00a0</p><p>Asked during the question and answer session whether Amazon could be a partner for Dish, Ergen said, \"As you mention, there's people outside the industry who might want to protect their connectivity.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, T-Mobile and Dish have reasons to work together.</p><p>The two companies were the top bidders in a recently concluded government auction of\u00a0licenses for 600 MHz wireless spectrum, spending about $8 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.\u00a0</p><p>Ergen said that the two could deploy the spectrum jointly.\u00a0\"T-Mobile's going to go build 600-megahertz spectrum, maybe starting as early as later this year,\" he said. \"There's opportunity there to say\u00a0let's build that together. Let's build that at the same time and share the savings.\"</p><p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere also suggested that the wireless business would attract new entrants during the telecom's earnings call in April.\u00a0\"Will Amazon come in [to the wireless market] at some point in the day?\" Legere asked, raising similar questions about the ambitions of Google and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis><br/> \u00a0in wireless.</p><p>Wireless competition has grown fierce, as all of the major carriers adopted unlimited plans.

In 2011, Facebook was hailed as a platform that would bring democracy to the world, Google was breaking new ground in convenience and access to information, and the protests taking place in Iran, Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, and many other countries were spurred in part by bloggers and social media commentators who used the platforms to galvanize people and encourage them to take to the streets. But, by 2017, we had learned that although the Internet transformed protest, it has not much improved democracy. Moreover, we learned again the lesson that the post-Cold War democracies had apparently forgotten: that misinformation and propaganda are powerful, and that repeating \"big lies\" can persuade susceptible people of nonsensical and dangerous ideas. This essay will examine the various sources and forms of disinformation that are most prevalent in today's political and media environment, the implications of this new reality on democracy, and the ways in which government can and must respond.</p><p>2016 was the year that public opinion turned against social media and big tech companies. In 2011, Facebook was hailed as a platform that would bring democracy to the world. We were grateful to Google. The protests in Iran, Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, and many other countries were spurred in part by bloggers and social media commentators who used social media to galvanize people and encourage them to take to the streets.</p><p>By 2017, we had learned that although the Internet had transformed protest, it has not much improved democracy. Moreover, we learned again a lesson that the post-Cold War democracies had apparently forgotten: that misinformation and propaganda are powerful and that repeating \"big lies\" can persuade susceptible people of all kinds of nonsensical and dangerous ideas. This should not have been a surprise, but critic Norah Ephron once said that \"people have a shocking capacity to be surprised by the same things over and over again.\" The question now is what to do. Regulation of social media platforms comes up repeatedly, but of what kind is less clear.</p><p>Of course, it was not all boundless optimism in 2011. Even before the Arab Spring, critics like Evgeny Morozov had warned that the Internet could be used as a tool of surveillance, and Cass Sunstein and Markus Prior had warned that giving everyone the right to select the news they wanted to read would compromise the marketplace of ideas.2 What wasn't clear at the time was the scale of the disinformation that would flood the Internet and the effect this could have on voting. It didn't seem plausible that people would be so susceptible to lies on the Internet and that they would resist reasoned attempts to explain facts, that truth would seem not to matter. By 2017, it became clear that anger over social inequality had turned into the conflation of privilege with expertise, and that many hated experts. Global demagogues stoked the fires of this hatred with constant attacks on the judiciary, the media, science, climate change scientists, and any institution that could undermine their agendas.3 At the time of this writing, it does not seem an exaggeration to say that disinformation spread by social media has undermined the functioning of democracy globally. But if social media is undermining our ideas of democracy, how can we solve the problem without also undermining the processes of democracy?</p><p>Looking Back at the Optimistic Debates of 2010 and 2011</p><p>A few months before the Arab Spring, two books were published that discussed the role of digital technology on society and democracy. One, The Net Delusion, by Evgeny Morozov, got widespread attention for its robust attack on the \"techno optimists\" who were foolish enough to believe that the likes of Facebook could bring about social change and force governments to become more accountable and democratic. \"A dictator who answers his cell phone is still a dictator,\" Morozov wrote. Further, he argued, sophisticated authoritarian regimes would be able to use the web not just for propaganda purposes but to track their opposition; so that digital technology was actually helping authoritarian regimes survive-a point that, with the passage of time, no longer seems novel.</p><p>But it was a book that got far less attention that turned out to be more immediately prescient. Using a data set of Islamic countries from around the world, political science professor Philip Howard argued that digital technology was bringing communities together, providing vast amounts of information to closed societies; and forcing governments to become more accountable. This in itself was making the world more democratic. A few months after these two books appeared, the Arab Spring revolutions cemented the idea that digital technology was a force for political change. The new conventional wisdom became that the Internet had dispersed the power of international organizations and governments and emerging communities online have undermined traditional state authority. From mobile money to crowd-mapping crises and bringing citizens together to report on news, distribute information, and organize politically, digital technology had the potential to leave obsolete power structures behind. Scholars such as Zeynep T\u00fcfek\u00e7i and Jennifer Earl argued that the \"affordances\" of the web had transformed protest in part by lowering the amount of time, effort, and money it required, and by making it easier to gather large numbers of disparate people from around the world into new communities.4 The recent scholarship makes it clear that the nature of activism and protest had changed and that the web was not just recreating earlier forms of protest.</p><p>2016, and the Values of Big Tech: Make Billions by Spreading Millions of Dangerous Lies</p><p>By 2016, it was apparent that something had gone very wrong; many of the optimists of 2010 and 2011 had changed their thinking, warning of the dangers of digital technology. Wael Ghonim, whose Facebook pages are credited with galvanizing the protests in Egypt, declared that the web had become a \"mobocracy.\" Along with Emily Parker, Ghonim launched a site called Parlio that was meant to encourage civilized and expert discourse online about vital topics of the day.5 The site never garnered a large following but was bought by Quora and eventually closed down. Philip Howard began studying bot activities and disinformation during the 2016 elections in Europe and the US and came up with some startling numbers about the amount of disinformation shared over Twitter.6 Howard and his colleagues at the Computational Propaganda Research Project at the Oxford Internet Institute looked at seven million tweets that used hashtags related to the 2016 election between November 1 and November 11 in 16 swing states. After developing a typology based on the URLs included in these tweets, which sorted all tweets into six categories including professional political content such as government and campaign sources, professional news outlets, and polarizing and conspiracy content; Howard and his colleagues found overwhelming levels of news from Russian outlets, Wikileaks, and \"junk news\" sources flooding Twitter just before the 2016 US presidential elections.7 Howard and his colleagues also noted that in these 16 swing states, levels of \"junk\" and polarizing news exceeded those of the United States as a whole.</p><p>How many Facebook users saw what kinds of disinformation, when they saw it, and how often this took place is unclear, in part because Facebook consistently refused to provide information to researchers about the political advertisements it displayed and who saw them. According to Howard:</p><p>At this point Facebook is the single most important platform for public life in the vast majority of countries. Its advertising algorithms allow politically motivated advertisers to reach a purposefully selected audience. Unfortunately, the company provides no public record of the political advertisements it serves to users, and there is no systematic way for analysts to measure the spread of junk news. For other kinds of media, political candidates must declare their sponsorship and file copies with the FEC. In the US election, for example, Trump spent 70 million on Facebook ads we'll never see.8</p><p>Without knowing what people saw, how many times, and for how long, it is difficult to know whether or how much of an effect disinformation had on voting patterns. An early study was released in early 2017 by economists Hunt Allcott and Matthew Gentzkow and concluded that \"fake news\" had no effect on the US elections.9 The earlier draft of the study, however, was based on some assumptions that seemed shaky at best, including the assumption that one piece of fake news was comparable to 36 negative campaign advertisements.10 By the time the paper was published, it had already been circulated widely and read closely by senior people at Facebook. Another questionable part of the study includes the authors giving their subjects \"placebo\" headlines so as to compare their judgement of real news with their judgement of fake news. However, understanding media effects is far more complicated than doing a scientific experiment in which randomized control groups are necessary. It is possible that there was a backfire effect resulting from the placebo headlines, or even what scholars call \"misinformation persistence.\"11</p><p>For all of these reasons, we don't actually know whether or how disinformation affected the 2016 elections. The use of social media to move public opinion is a relatively new phenomenon, and the speed and volume of the incorrect messages transmitted by social media may be unprecedented.</p><p>However, the example of Fox News is instructive. When Fox News began, it was assumed that people watching it would be influenced to vote for the Republican party, and early research suggested that this was indeed the case.12 In the fall of 2017, a more definitive paper was published in the American Economic Review that solved the question of causation.13 Consumption of Fox News pushed voters to vote for Republican candidates. The prevalence of junk news also suggests that voters with low exposure to information participated in elections at high rates, perhaps a different trendline from past elections, when the assumption was that those who were uninformed and didn't follow the news were also the people who did not vote.</p><p>Propaganda, lies, and \"truthiness\" have been around for hundreds of years and used by many political candidates, corporations, and religions to persuade and mislead. What is different today is the speed and volume of disinformation. We simply do not know what it means for the electorate when millions of Russian propaganda messages are targeted at swing states. We can guess, but the research has not yet been done, and the information is not available for us to know with absolute certainty.</p><p>Even so, it is not too early to take action. When there is a strong possibility of danger, society must act. Governments don't wait for everyone to be in an automobile accident before mandating that air bags should be put in every car. Now is the time to consider low-hanging policy measures that may help the situation. All policy involves tradeoffs, but we need to consider measures are acceptable to a democratic society.</p><p>MIT researcher Yochai Benkler said at an October 2016 talk at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, that there are five parties circulating fake news:</p><p>1. Bodies thought to be close to the Russian government that circulate propaganda and disinformation with the intent of sowing confusion and distrust;</p><p>2. Right-wing US groups such as Breitbart;</p><p>3. Groups that make money from circulating disinformation such as the notorious Macedonians profiled by Buzzfeed in the fall of 2016;14</p><p>4. Formal campaigns using behavioral marketing tools, such as Cambridge Analytica;15</p><p>5. Peer-to-peer distribution networks, including the far-right activists of 4Chan. Benkler says:</p><p>The problem is potentially sufficiently serious enough that we should spend a lot of money quickly to figure out what is happening so we know what measures to take. At arninimum we should support transparency in political advertising and that should include anyone paid to comment online on (or) spread political information even if it's by marketing companies as well as the commercial equivalent of the 50-cent army.</p><p>While millions of dollars are being spent on research, there should be a focus on policy prescriptions that can be put in place quickly. One example of policymaking which involves an acceptable tradeoff was the bi-partisan bill introduced in the US Senate in October 2016 that would have required social media companies to tell the Federal Elections Commission the source of funding for online political advertisements.16 Just as we require disclosure for political advertising on television, so too should we disclose the sources of paid information online. Technology expert Julia Angwin notes that such laws would not cover paid commenters, but Benkler says that the law could be expanded to cover people paid to comment online.</p><p>In many cases, countries with laws against hate speech and incitement will need to find democratic ways to enforce them online so that the fight against disinformation does not become an excuse for corporate and government censorship. Asking big tech companies to deal with the problem on their own opens the way to corporate censorship, free expression advocates have consistently warned.17 On the other hand, it is important not to let technology companies use free speech as an excuse not to take action.</p><p>In their comprehensive report on \"Information Disorder\" for the Council of Europe, Claire Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan discuss the need to create cultures of truth and provide recommendations for governments, journalists, technology companies, and other parties.18 While many of the fixes being proposed, including media literacy education and changes in ownership models, are long term, changing norms and culture will be part of getting back to a culture of truth and evidence. The topic is too important to leave to tech companies to handle alone and without disclosure. Government, academia, and civil society need to lead the conversation on how to address the problem of the millions of lies and propaganda mentions that can spread so quickly on social media. E-Bay creator and philanthropist Pierre Omidyar wrote in an October 2017 op-ed:</p><p>Just as new regulations and policies had to be established for the evolving online commerce sector, social media companies must now help navigate the serious threats posed by their platforms and help lead the development and enforcement of clear industry safeguards. Change won't happen overnight, and these issues will require ongoing examination, collaboration and vigirance to effectively turn the tide)9</p><p>In fact, more needs to be done. Columbia law professor Tim Wu believes that Facebook should become a nonprofit or public benefit corporation, and Columbia University professor Joseph E.Stiglitz argues that Facebook is similar to a public utility and should be strongly regulated. Privacy, taxation and distribution of dis/ misinformation are all areas where there needs to be strong global regulation of the tech and social media sectors. There are a number of options. It seems that there is an emerging consensus around cracking down on tax avoidance and protecting privacy. However, it is likely that some European countries will pass laws regulating the dissemination of free speech, just as Germany has done. Regulations will look different in different countries, as it will be hard to obtain a European-wide consensus. Facebook, of course, argues that ultimately these regulatory mechanisms will be copied by authoritarian regimes.</p><p>Implications for Democracy</p><p>The implications of these developments for democracy are enormous. Is the Internet killing our democracy and paving the way for uninformed mob rule? Democracy rests upon the assumption of an educated populace; this is part of why public education is so important. Understanding the important issues of the day, as well as government representatives' positions on these issues, is necessary for citizens to participate actively in a democracy. Without this knowledge, voting decisions may be arbitrary, and government can be based on capturing voters or pandering, and can cease to be a truly functioning democracy.</p><p>The problem of misinformation on the Internet has come at a dangerous time, when growing resentment over inequality and the worsening state of the American middle class have stoked a deep mistrust in institutions of education, science, and media that have traditionally served to keep \"false facts\" and demagoguery at bay. Citizens are increasingly turning to the Internet, a forum for distributing information that does not adhere to typical standards of truth, scientific inquiry, and evidence-based news and information. At the same time, the institutions that have typically distributed information to citizens are being usurped. Consequently, for the average American citizen, distinguishing between true and false information has only become more difficult.20</p><p>Polling data suggests that we live in a country where a large part of the populace is either unable or unwilling to accurately educate themselves on the reality of their country and leaders. An uninformed citizenry of this type is unable to act in its own best interest when electing leaders and representatives. If misinformation and fake news campaigns truly do frustrate citizens' attempts to educate themselves-or, even worse, actively manipulate citizens into believing false information-then the very foundations of democracy are at risk.\u00e7fc?</p><p>\"How many Facebook user saw what kinds of disinformation, when they saw it, and how often this took place is unclear, in part because Facebook consistently refused to provide information to researchers about what political advertisements it displayed and who saw them.\"</p><p>Anya Schiffrin is the director of the Technology, Media, and Communications specialization at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs where she teaches courses on media and development and innovation.

As one benchmark, Spenkuch and Toniatti (2016) show that exposing voters to one additional television campaign ad changes vote shares bv approximately 0.02 percentage points. This suggests that if one fake news article were about as persuasive as one TV campaign ad, the fake news in our database would have changed vote shares by an amount on the order of hundredths of a percentage point. This is much smaller than Trump's margin of victory in the pivotal states on which the outcome depended.\"</p><p>11 Man-pui S. Chan, Christopher R.

This paper conducted a meta analysis of studies on how to effectively debunk misinformation. Among other things it found that simply printing a correction or warning does not bring people to change their minds but rather can result in \"misinformation persistence.\" The authors point to Schwarz et al. (2007), who found that corrections often inadvertently strengthen the misinformation thev intend to contest when they merely ask people to \"consider the opposite\" of stated facts. This risk is lowered only when a well argued, detailed debunking message is offered (Jerit 2008). The authors concluded that detailed corrections produce a stronger debunking effect than non-detailed ones. However, they can also inadvertently perpetuate misinformation.</p><p>12 Stefano DellaVigna and Ethan Kaplan, \"The Fox News Effect: Media Bias and Voting,\" NBER Working Paper 12169 (April 2006), <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nber.org/papcrs/wl2169\">http://www.nber.org/papcrs/wl2169</url>.</p><p>13 Gregory J Martin and Ali Yurukoglu, \"Bias in Cable News: Persuasion and Polarization,\" American Economic Review 107, no. 9 (2017), 2565-99.</p><p>14 Craig Silverman and Lawrence Alexander, \"How Teens in the Balkans are Duping Trump Supporters with Fake News,\" Buzzfeed News, 3 November 2016, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-globaI-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.ygVV9NJpA#.jqb-\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-globaI-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.ygVV9NJpA#.jqb-</url> nQ58jk.</p><p>15 Carole Cadwalladr, \"The Great British Brexit Robbery: How Our Democracy Was Hijacked,\" The Guardian, 7 May 2017, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexitrobbery-hijacked-democracy\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexitrobbery-hijacked-democracy</url>.</p><p>16 Kenneth R Vogel and Cecilia Kang, \"Senators Demand Online Ad Disclosures as Tech Lobby Mobilizes,\" New York Times, 19 October 2017, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/facebook-google-russia-meddling-disclosure.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/facebook-google-russia-meddling-disclosure.html</url>.</p><p>17 Courtney C.

In 2011, Facebook was hailed as a platform that would bring democracy to the world, Google was breaking new ground in convenience and access to information, and the protests taking place in Iran, Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, and many other countries were spurred in part by bloggers and social media commentators who used the platforms to galvanize people and encourage them to take to the streets. But, by 2017, we had learned that although the Internet transformed protest, it has not much improved democracy. Moreover, we learned again the lesson that the post-Cold War democracies had apparently forgotten: that misinformation and propaganda are powerful, and that repeating \"big lies\" can persuade susceptible people of nonsensical and dangerous ideas. This essay will examine the various sources and forms of disinformation that are most prevalent in today's political and media environment, the implications of this new reality on democracy, and the ways in which government can and must respond.</p><p>2016 was the year that public opinion turned against social media and big tech companies. In 2011, Facebook was hailed as a platform that would bring democracy to the world. We were grateful to Google. The protests in Iran, Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, and many other countries were spurred in part by bloggers and social media commentators who used social media to galvanize people and encourage them to take to the streets.</p><p>By 2017, we had learned that although the Internet had transformed protest, it has not much improved democracy. Moreover, we learned again a lesson that the post-Cold War democracies had apparently forgotten: that misinformation and propaganda are powerful and that repeating \"big lies\" can persuade susceptible people of all kinds of nonsensical and dangerous ideas. This should not have been a surprise, but critic Norah Ephron once said that \"people have a shocking capacity to be surprised by the same things over and over again.\" The question now is what to do. Regulation of social media platforms comes up repeatedly, but of what kind is less clear.</p><p>Of course, it was not all boundless optimism in 2011. Even before the Arab Spring, critics like Evgeny Morozov had warned that the Internet could be used as a tool of surveillance, and Cass Sunstein and Markus Prior had warned that giving everyone the right to select the news they wanted to read would compromise the marketplace of ideas.2 What wasn't clear at the time was the scale of the disinformation that would flood the Internet and the effect this could have on voting. It didn't seem plausible that people would be so susceptible to lies on the Internet and that they would resist reasoned attempts to explain facts, that truth would seem not to matter. By 2017, it became clear that anger over social inequality had turned into the conflation of privilege with expertise, and that many hated experts. Global demagogues stoked the fires of this hatred with constant attacks on the judiciary, the media, science, climate change scientists, and any institution that could undermine their agendas.3 At the time of this writing, it does not seem an exaggeration to say that disinformation spread by social media has undermined the functioning of democracy globally. But if social media is undermining our ideas of democracy, how can we solve the problem without also undermining the processes of democracy?</p><p>Looking Back at the Optimistic Debates of 2010 and 2011</p><p>A few months before the Arab Spring, two books were published that discussed the role of digital technology on society and democracy. One, The Net Delusion, by Evgeny Morozov, got widespread attention for its robust attack on the \"techno optimists\" who were foolish enough to believe that the likes of Facebook could bring about social change and force governments to become more accountable and democratic. \"A dictator who answers his cell phone is still a dictator,\" Morozov wrote. Further, he argued, sophisticated authoritarian regimes would be able to use the web not just for propaganda purposes but to track their opposition; so that digital technology was actually helping authoritarian regimes survive-a point that, with the passage of time, no longer seems novel.</p><p>But it was a book that got far less attention that turned out to be more immediately prescient. Using a data set of Islamic countries from around the world, political science professor Philip Howard argued that digital technology was bringing communities together, providing vast amounts of information to closed societies; and forcing governments to become more accountable. This in itself was making the world more democratic. A few months after these two books appeared, the Arab Spring revolutions cemented the idea that digital technology was a force for political change. The new conventional wisdom became that the Internet had dispersed the power of international organizations and governments and emerging communities online have undermined traditional state authority. From mobile money to crowd-mapping crises and bringing citizens together to report on news, distribute information, and organize politically, digital technology had the potential to leave obsolete power structures behind. Scholars such as Zeynep T\u00fcfek\u00e7i and Jennifer Earl argued that the \"affordances\" of the web had transformed protest in part by lowering the amount of time, effort, and money it required, and by making it easier to gather large numbers of disparate people from around the world into new communities.4 The recent scholarship makes it clear that the nature of activism and protest had changed and that the web was not just recreating earlier forms of protest.</p><p>2016, and the Values of Big Tech: Make Billions by Spreading Millions of Dangerous Lies</p><p>By 2016, it was apparent that something had gone very wrong; many of the optimists of 2010 and 2011 had changed their thinking, warning of the dangers of digital technology. Wael Ghonim, whose Facebook pages are credited with galvanizing the protests in Egypt, declared that the web had become a \"mobocracy.\" Along with Emily Parker, Ghonim launched a site called Parlio that was meant to encourage civilized and expert discourse online about vital topics of the day.5 The site never garnered a large following but was bought by Quora and eventually closed down. Philip Howard began studying bot activities and disinformation during the 2016 elections in Europe and the US and came up with some startling numbers about the amount of disinformation shared over Twitter.6 Howard and his colleagues at the Computational Propaganda Research Project at the Oxford Internet Institute looked at seven million tweets that used hashtags related to the 2016 election between November 1 and November 11 in 16 swing states. After developing a typology based on the URLs included in these tweets, which sorted all tweets into six categories including professional political content such as government and campaign sources, professional news outlets, and polarizing and conspiracy content; Howard and his colleagues found overwhelming levels of news from Russian outlets, Wikileaks, and \"junk news\" sources flooding Twitter just before the 2016 US presidential elections.7 Howard and his colleagues also noted that in these 16 swing states, levels of \"junk\" and polarizing news exceeded those of the United States as a whole.</p><p>How many Facebook users saw what kinds of disinformation, when they saw it, and how often this took place is unclear, in part because Facebook consistently refused to provide information to researchers about the political advertisements it displayed and who saw them. According to Howard:</p><p>At this point Facebook is the single most important platform for public life in the vast majority of countries. Its advertising algorithms allow politically motivated advertisers to reach a purposefully selected audience. Unfortunately, the company provides no public record of the political advertisements it serves to users, and there is no systematic way for analysts to measure the spread of junk news. For other kinds of media, political candidates must declare their sponsorship and file copies with the FEC. In the US election, for example, Trump spent 70 million on Facebook ads we'll never see.8</p><p>Without knowing what people saw, how many times, and for how long, it is difficult to know whether or how much of an effect disinformation had on voting patterns. An early study was released in early 2017 by economists Hunt Allcott and Matthew Gentzkow and concluded that \"fake news\" had no effect on the US elections.9 The earlier draft of the study, however, was based on some assumptions that seemed shaky at best, including the assumption that one piece of fake news was comparable to 36 negative campaign advertisements.10 By the time the paper was published, it had already been circulated widely and read closely by senior people at Facebook. Another questionable part of the study includes the authors giving their subjects \"placebo\" headlines so as to compare their judgement of real news with their judgement of fake news. However, understanding media effects is far more complicated than doing a scientific experiment in which randomized control groups are necessary. It is possible that there was a backfire effect resulting from the placebo headlines, or even what scholars call \"misinformation persistence.\"11</p><p>For all of these reasons, we don't actually know whether or how disinformation affected the 2016 elections. The use of social media to move public opinion is a relatively new phenomenon, and the speed and volume of the incorrect messages transmitted by social media may be unprecedented.</p><p>However, the example of Fox News is instructive. When Fox News began, it was assumed that people watching it would be influenced to vote for the Republican party, and early research suggested that this was indeed the case.12 In the fall of 2017, a more definitive paper was published in the American Economic Review that solved the question of causation.13 Consumption of Fox News pushed voters to vote for Republican candidates. The prevalence of junk news also suggests that voters with low exposure to information participated in elections at high rates, perhaps a different trendline from past elections, when the assumption was that those who were uninformed and didn't follow the news were also the people who did not vote.</p><p>Propaganda, lies, and \"truthiness\" have been around for hundreds of years and used by many political candidates, corporations, and religions to persuade and mislead. What is different today is the speed and volume of disinformation. We simply do not know what it means for the electorate when millions of Russian propaganda messages are targeted at swing states. We can guess, but the research has not yet been done, and the information is not available for us to know with absolute certainty.</p><p>Even so, it is not too early to take action. When there is a strong possibility of danger, society must act. Governments don't wait for everyone to be in an automobile accident before mandating that air bags should be put in every car. Now is the time to consider low-hanging policy measures that may help the situation. All policy involves tradeoffs, but we need to consider measures are acceptable to a democratic society.</p><p>MIT researcher Yochai Benkler said at an October 2016 talk at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, that there are five parties circulating fake news:</p><p>1. Bodies thought to be close to the Russian government that circulate propaganda and disinformation with the intent of sowing confusion and distrust;</p><p>2. Right-wing US groups such as Breitbart;</p><p>3. Groups that make money from circulating disinformation such as the notorious Macedonians profiled by Buzzfeed in the fall of 2016;14</p><p>4. Formal campaigns using behavioral marketing tools, such as Cambridge Analytica;15</p><p>5. Peer-to-peer distribution networks, including the far-right activists of 4Chan. Benkler says:</p><p>The problem is potentially sufficiently serious enough that we should spend a lot of money quickly to figure out what is happening so we know what measures to take. At arninimum we should support transparency in political advertising and that should include anyone paid to comment online on (or) spread political information even if it's by marketing companies as well as the commercial equivalent of the 50-cent army.</p><p>While millions of dollars are being spent on research, there should be a focus on policy prescriptions that can be put in place quickly. One example of policymaking which involves an acceptable tradeoff was the bi-partisan bill introduced in the US Senate in October 2016 that would have required social media companies to tell the Federal Elections Commission the source of funding for online political advertisements.16 Just as we require disclosure for political advertising on television, so too should we disclose the sources of paid information online. Technology expert Julia Angwin notes that such laws would not cover paid commenters, but Benkler says that the law could be expanded to cover people paid to comment online.</p><p>In many cases, countries with laws against hate speech and incitement will need to find democratic ways to enforce them online so that the fight against disinformation does not become an excuse for corporate and government censorship. Asking big tech companies to deal with the problem on their own opens the way to corporate censorship, free expression advocates have consistently warned.17 On the other hand, it is important not to let technology companies use free speech as an excuse not to take action.</p><p>In their comprehensive report on \"Information Disorder\" for the Council of Europe, Claire Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan discuss the need to create cultures of truth and provide recommendations for governments, journalists, technology companies, and other parties.18 While many of the fixes being proposed, including media literacy education and changes in ownership models, are long term, changing norms and culture will be part of getting back to a culture of truth and evidence. The topic is too important to leave to tech companies to handle alone and without disclosure. Government, academia, and civil society need to lead the conversation on how to address the problem of the millions of lies and propaganda mentions that can spread so quickly on social media. E-Bay creator and philanthropist Pierre Omidyar wrote in an October 2017 op-ed:</p><p>Just as new regulations and policies had to be established for the evolving online commerce sector, social media companies must now help navigate the serious threats posed by their platforms and help lead the development and enforcement of clear industry safeguards. Change won't happen overnight, and these issues will require ongoing examination, collaboration and vigirance to effectively turn the tide)9</p><p>In fact, more needs to be done. Columbia law professor Tim Wu believes that Facebook should become a nonprofit or public benefit corporation, and Columbia University professor Joseph E.Stiglitz argues that Facebook is similar to a public utility and should be strongly regulated. Privacy, taxation and distribution of dis/ misinformation are all areas where there needs to be strong global regulation of the tech and social media sectors. There are a number of options. It seems that there is an emerging consensus around cracking down on tax avoidance and protecting privacy. However, it is likely that some European countries will pass laws regulating the dissemination of free speech, just as Germany has done. Regulations will look different in different countries, as it will be hard to obtain a European-wide consensus. Facebook, of course, argues that ultimately these regulatory mechanisms will be copied by authoritarian regimes.</p><p>Implications for Democracy</p><p>The implications of these developments for democracy are enormous. Is the Internet killing our democracy and paving the way for uninformed mob rule? Democracy rests upon the assumption of an educated populace; this is part of why public education is so important. Understanding the important issues of the day, as well as government representatives' positions on these issues, is necessary for citizens to participate actively in a democracy. Without this knowledge, voting decisions may be arbitrary, and government can be based on capturing voters or pandering, and can cease to be a truly functioning democracy.</p><p>The problem of misinformation on the Internet has come at a dangerous time, when growing resentment over inequality and the worsening state of the American middle class have stoked a deep mistrust in institutions of education, science, and media that have traditionally served to keep \"false facts\" and demagoguery at bay. Citizens are increasingly turning to the Internet, a forum for distributing information that does not adhere to typical standards of truth, scientific inquiry, and evidence-based news and information. At the same time, the institutions that have typically distributed information to citizens are being usurped. Consequently, for the average American citizen, distinguishing between true and false information has only become more difficult.20</p><p>Polling data suggests that we live in a country where a large part of the populace is either unable or unwilling to accurately educate themselves on the reality of their country and leaders. An uninformed citizenry of this type is unable to act in its own best interest when electing leaders and representatives. If misinformation and fake news campaigns truly do frustrate citizens' attempts to educate themselves-or, even worse, actively manipulate citizens into believing false information-then the very foundations of democracy are at risk.\u00e7fc?</p><p>\"How many Facebook user saw what kinds of disinformation, when they saw it, and how often this took place is unclear, in part because Facebook consistently refused to provide information to researchers about what political advertisements it displayed and who saw them.\"</p><p>Anya Schiffrin is the director of the Technology, Media, and Communications specialization at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs where she teaches courses on media and development and innovation.

This suggests that if one fake news article were about as persuasive as one TV campaign ad, the fake news in our database would have changed vote shares by an amount on the order of hundredths of a percentage point.

This paper conducted a meta analysis of studies on how to effectively debunk misinformation.

(2007), who found that corrections often inadvertently strengthen the misinformation thev intend to contest when they merely ask people to \"consider the opposite\" of stated facts. This risk is lowered only when a well argued, detailed debunking message is offered (Jerit 2008).

We have used the powers of the Committee system, by ordering people to give evidence and by obtaining documents sealed in another country's legal system. We invited democratically-elected representatives from eight countries to join our Committee in the UK to create an 'International Grand Committee', the first of its kind, to promote further cross-border co-operation in tackling the spread of disinformation, and its pernicious ability to distort, to disrupt, and to destabilise. </p><p>Throughout this inquiry we have benefitted from working with other parliaments. This is continuing, with further sessions planned in 2019. This has highlighted a worldwide appetite for action to address issues similar to those that we have identified in other jurisdictions. This is the Final Report in our inquiry, but it will not be the final word. We have always experienced propaganda and politically-aligned bias, which purports to be news, but this activity has taken on new forms and has been hugely magnified by information technology and the ubiquity of social media. In this environment, people are able to accept and give credence to information that reinforces their views, no matter how distorted or inaccurate, while dismissing content with which they do not agree as 'fake news'. This has a polarising effect and reduces the common ground on which reasoned debate, based on objective facts, can take place. Much has been said about the coarsening of public debate, but when these factors are brought to bear directly in election campaigns then the very fabric of our democracy is threatened. This situation is unlikely to change. What does need to change is the enforcement of greater transparency in the digital sphere, to ensure that we know the source of what we are reading, who has paid for it and why the information has been sent to us. We need to understand how the big tech companies work and what happens to our data. Facebook operates by monitoring both users and non-users, tracking their activity and retaining personal data. Facebook makes its money by selling access to users' data through its advertising tools. It further increases its value by entering into comprehensive reciprocal data-sharing arrangements with major app developers who run their businesses through the Facebook platform. Meanwhile, among the countless innocuous postings of celebrations and holiday snaps, some malicious forces use Facebook to threaten and harass others, to publish revenge porn, to disseminate hate speech and propaganda of all kinds, and to influence elections and democratic processes\u2014much of which Facebook, and other social media companies, are either unable or unwilling to prevent. We need to apply widely-accepted democratic principles to ensure their application in the digital age. The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight. But only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them. The legislative tools already exist. They must now be applied to digital activity, using tools such as privacy laws, data protection legislation, antitrust and competition law. If companies become monopolies they can be broken up, in whatever sector. Facebook's handling of personal data, and its use for political campaigns, are prime and legitimate areas for inspection by regulators, and it should not be able to evade all editorial responsibility for the content shared by its users across its platforms. In a democracy, we need to experience a plurality of voices and, critically, to have the skills, experience and knowledge to gauge the veracity of those voices. While the Internet has brought many freedoms across the world and an unprecedented ability to communicate, it also carries the insidious ability to distort, to mislead and to produce hatred and instability. It functions on a scale and at a speed that is unprecedented in human history. One of the witnesses at our inquiry, Tristan Harris, from the US-based Center for Humane Technology, describes the current use of technology as 'hijacking our minds and society'. We must use technology, instead, to free our minds and use regulation to restore democratic accountability. We must make sure that people stay in charge of the machines.

You can sign up for it here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 256 days, Americans will head to the polls to vote on whether to re-elect Donald Trump as President or to go in another direction. A lot will happen between now and then. But one thing is near certain: disinformation campaigns, both domestic and foreign, will be waged on the American electorate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Thursday, NYT reported (and CNN confirmed) that House lawmakers were warned by an intel official that Russia was taking steps to interfere in the 2020 election and get Trump re-elected. If the Russians follow a similar playbook from 2016, that effort will include exploiting divisions and spreading misinformation on tech platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Is Big Tech ready for this challenge? Is America ready? A Thursday opinion piece in WaPo eloquently said, \"As Americans approach November worrying about foreign interference, they should remember that it cannot succeed without willing Americans. Americans can and must safeguard their own elections, and those who refuse ... must be called out for their actions.\" So what is being done? What's being ignored? Let's take a look at a few stories published Thursday that touch on this topic...</p><p>\"We can't remove all of it because it will disproportionately affect conservatives\"</p><p>First let's take a look back into the past. WaPo's Craig Timberg published a deeply reported story Thursday detailing what took place inside Facebook in the aftermath of the 2016 election. According to Timberg, \"Facebook created 'Project P' --- for propaganda --- in the hectic weeks after the 2016 presidential election and quickly found dozens of pages that had peddled false news reports ahead of Donald Trump's surprise victory.\"</p><p>As Timberg noted, \"In a world of perfect neutrality, which Facebook espouses as its goal, the political tilt of the pages shouldn't have mattered.\" But that, apparently, wasn't the case. Timberg reported that Joel Kaplan, a Republican who is now the head of Facebook's Washington office, brought forward a concern: \"We can't remove all of it because it will disproportionately affect conservatives.\"</p><p>The statement is both troubling and revealing. As Timberg noted, the \"Project P\" debate \"exemplified the political dynamics that have reigned within Facebook since Trump emerged as the Republican Party's presumptive nominee to the White House in 2016.\" As Timberg succinctly summarized, \"Such factors have helped shape a platform that gives politicians license to lie and that remains awash in misinformation, vulnerable to a repeat of many of the problems that marred the 2016 presidential election.\" </p><p>Streaming services offer loophole for political advertisers </p><p>\"The 'deep state' is trying to inject our health system with socialist price controls,\" one recent Hulu ad said, according to a story by WaPo's Tony Romm. The ad urged viewers to text \"SOCIALISM SUCKS\" to the FreedomWorks, the group behind the ad.</p><p>But as Romm noted, neither FreedomWorks nor Hulu are \"required to reveal much more to the public about the 30-second spot or whom it targeted, leaving watchdogs and regulators fearful that federal election laws aren't fit for the digital age --- and that voters remain vulnerable to manipulation.\" Other streaming services, like Roku, offer similar loopholes, which as Romm noted stand \"in stark contrast\" to regulations governing traditional television channels, like ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.</p><p>Romm's conclusion? \"Four years after Russian agents exploited popular online platforms to push propaganda, sow unrest and promote the Trump candidacy, the U.S. government has made virtually no progress on bringing more transparency to paid political speech. The risks remain high that voters could be duped and deceived by foreign governments, U.S. candidates and advocacy groups --- particularly online, where major regulatory gaps exist.\"</p><p>Artificial intelligence-created images surface in harassment campaigns</p><p>If you haven't yet, read this story from CNN's Donie O'Sullivan. The story revealed how an account that threatened Sleeping Giants, a group that persuades companies not to run ads with media orgs that spread misinformation or hate speech, with potentially embarrassing information used a profile image created by artificial intelligence.</p><p>\"Most of the major social media platforms have rules against using other people's pictures in this way and have an option for people to make impersonation complaints if their identity is being used,\" O'Sullivan reported. \"But by using AI-generated faces of people that do not exist, trolls can potentially avoid being reported for impersonation.\"</p><p>&gt;&gt; O'Sullivan's big takeaway: \"AI-generated images can potentially help lend credibility to online harassment campaigns as well as coordinated information campaigns...\" </p><p>Twitter tests warning label</p><p>When you log-on to Twitter in the future and come across misinformation, it a bright orange caution label might be attached to it. That's according to NBC's Ben Collins, who obtained a leaked demo showing new methods Twitter is testing to combat misinformation online.</p><p>In the version that Collins obtained, the orange caution label would inform users that the claim was potentially misleading and it would feature fact-checks from verified users. You can check out screen grabs showing how this work in Collins' story...</p><p>FOR THE RECORD</p><p>-- Bloomberg News reported Thursday evening that the Trump campaign has purchased the \"coveted advertising space\" on YouTube's homepage during Election Day and the immediate run up to it...

This week, Elizabeth Warren, the leading contender for the Democratic nomination in next year's presidential race, renewed her call for the division of some of America's largest businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the idea is proving popular among voters, such a move will hand a major advantage to the Chinese at a time when the struggle for dominance between East and West is accelerating - without solving the issues consumers have with these companies. Strategically, it's a terrible idea for Washington and its Western allies - and it's not that good for consumers either.</p><p>This debate is increasing in importance because Ms Warren is gaining traction. In the most recent George Washington University Politics Poll, the Massachusetts senator led the Democratic field with 28pc of the vote. Bernie Sanders was second at 21pc, and Joe Biden, the supposed frontrunner, polled just 18pc. Ms Warren repeated her calls for a break up of large technology companies in this week's televised primary debate between Democratic candidates.</p><p>Reassuringly, none of the other 11 candidates endorsed this view.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" Ms Warren says on her website. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else ... That's why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition - including breaking up Amazon, Facebook and Google.\"</p><p>There is no doubt that such a move has popular appeal. A poll released last month showed almost two thirds of Americans would support breaking up technology companies by undoing recent mergers, such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, if it means ensuring more competition in the future. But, ultimately, it would be a geopolitical disaster.</p><p>Currently there are two main clusters of big technology. One is in the US, where the major names we all know are based, and one in China, which consists of businesses such as Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and Tencent. Should the US cluster be forced to splinter it will hand a major advantage to the Chinese for years to come.</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) will be a major driver of future innovation. These technologies require a large amount of organised data to scrutinise. Breaking up these companies in the US will hand an advantage in AI to the Chinese - an area that is a priority for Beijing because surveillance is an intrinsic part of the state's model. Pitting fragmented US businesses against consolidated state-protected Chinese companies cannot be allowed to happen in this industry.</p><p>It also doesn't make sense because the problem with technology companies isn't about size. Indeed, scale often makes services better for consumers. A global reach in social media is important for friends and family in different countries to keep in touch. Amazon has also brought both convenience and value to the shopping experience that has proved a real benefit to consumers. Users are better off with a few large players than with a fragmented industry.</p><p>Wanting to break up these companies is a result of the application of an old-economy mindset to the modern world. These businesses are completely different to the companies that the current antitrust system was designed to police. Users of sites such as Facebook do not actually pay for the service with cash. They pay for the service with their data, which the companies then monetise.</p><p>It makes sense to break up monopolies that are price-gouging consumers because of their structural advantage - but Facebook's service is 100pc free to the user. Facebook is not Standard Oil, which was involved in perhaps the most famous antitrust case of the early 20th century when it was branded an illegal monopoly and broken up.</p><p>So, why are people so angry with these companies that they nod sagely when someone suggests smashing them up? People are furious because of the way these companies have used their data to make money. They feel the benefits have been asymmetric. They also don't like the way companies such as Facebook have allowed false political claims to spread without acting to stop the dissemination of questionable information.</p><p>Then there's the perceived tax avoidance to add into the mix. Wanting to break up these businesses reflects these concerns, but it will not solve these issues. The only way these issues can be sorted out is by sensible regulation.</p><p>Technology companies with deep pockets will also play hardball. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, is already getting ready. \"I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government,\" Mr Zuckerberg said. \"But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Warren claims she will be tougher on China than Donald Trump should she win the White House. However, one of her flagship policies will hand a major technological advantage to Beijing that could potentially do great damage to the West. If she really wants to be tough on China, Ms Warren needs to go easier on Big Tech.</p><p>Garry White is chief investment commentator at wealth management company Charles Stanley</p><p>'Breaking up these companies in the US will hand an advantage in AI to the Chinese - an area that is a priority for Beijing'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-153939789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X98-3CM1-JCBW-N2J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Although the U.S. tends to have a more business-friendly approach than the EU, worries about the market influence, power and reach of Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are growing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Anyone with a vested interest in a properly functioning commercial internet should welcome enhanced notice provisions, consumer access and transparency around information collected about our online actions and control over what happens to the resulting data. Ideally, people should be able to selectively delete information they don\u2019t want to be shared with brands, ad-tech and mar-tech firms and other businesses in the data space.</p><p>But there are real concerns around implementation. When laws are crafted without close attention to the way they impact the digital playing field, politicians are inadvertently concentrating power in the hands of the current big players. Facebook and Google may be easy targets and logical examples of bad actors that need regulation, but paradoxically, the legislation will end up benefitting them most.</p><p>Looking at this issue from a larger standpoint: The \u201cplumbing\u201d behind digital identity is important. It includes publishers, marketers and platforms and how they collect and share data. They all want to align their business practices to the spirit and letter of privacy and security laws. Yet the big players that operate enormous walled gardens have inherent advantages over other firms who do business in the free and independent internet.</p><p>Mega-platform users must create accounts to authenticate their identity with usernames, passwords, mobile phone numbers, email address and even postal addresses. The big tech companies therefore have a wide array of touchpoints from which to collect and tether consumer data. The ID plumbing allows them to engage with their audiences directly, surfacing privacy controls and offering users visibility into the data collected about them. This gives them an important leg up on compliance with privacy and security regulations.</p><p>Contrast this with firms operating outside of the walled gardens: publishers, marketers and platforms. They\u2019re forced to use an array of proprietary IDs stored in web browsers through first- and third-party cookies and exchanged and synced via pixels in webpage loads. In mobile app environments, there\u2019s yet another step in the form of mobile ad IDs provided by Apple and Google through their mobile app developer tools. This is a digital ID patchwork that is highly diffused, inefficient and all too often ineffective.</p><p>Some might think that this diffused ID infrastructure outside the walled gardens is good for consumers because it weakens the ties between IDs and digital behavior, but ironically, these main companies\u2019 ID infrastructures are essential for consumers to manage their privacy settings. How can one say \u201cDon\u2019t track me\u201d or \u201cShow me my data\u201d or \u201cOnly use my info for this purpose\u201d if there aren\u2019t consistent IDs connecting a person to the information?</p><p>Apple, Google and Facebook (through its app) are using their market dominance to prevent other players from building that same strong and stable ID infrastructure. Meanwhile, these big five players continue to build fortified walled garden ID environments, compelling marketers to work with them as the only scalable choice for targeted advertising, functioning attribution and privacy regulation compliance. This is the anti-competitive irony of the current ID infrastructure.</p><p>As governments look at hitting them for anti-competitive practices, it might be better to think beyond breaking up the walled gardens. It would be far more productive to focus on what can be done to help every online player organize data management and governance practices around shared digital ID plumbing that is safe, secure, regulated and effective.</p><p>It is only with the help of digital plumbers that politicians will be able to level the playing field for commerce while also protecting consumer choice and privacy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1066171</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WV1-4CS1-JC8H-T0C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"683\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 16, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

If so, would it ever happen?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"FATHER LENNON, have you some money? Buy Standard Oil.\" That's what John D. Rockefeller is said to have told his golf partner, a priest, when he heard the news in 1911 that the Supreme Court had ruled his oil company was to be broken up into 34 smaller firms. It was good advice. Within a few years the value of those firms rose threefold. The net worth of Rockefeller, who owned more than 25% of each, grew from about $300m in 1911 to $900m in 1913, around $23bn in current dollars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A break-up of today's tech titans\u2014Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple\u2014could also unlock vast value, say some with an eye on the industry. If the most radical plan, proposed by Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic contender for America's presidency, were fully implemented, by some calculations the parts spun off alone could be worth over $2trn\u2014roughly half the value of the four complete firms today.</p><p>Ms Warren's two-pronged scheme was presented in March, but it is now coming under closer scrutiny as her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination gathers steam. The first part is relatively straightforward. She intends to unwind tech mergers deemed \"anticompetitive\" because they were undertaken to neutralise potential competitors. This is mainly aimed at Facebook, which in 2012 bought Instagram, a picture-heavy social network, for $1bn and in 2014 paid $19bn for WhatsApp, an instant-messaging service. Both of these, industry insiders argue, could have become serious rivals to Facebook. But Ms Warren also aims to undo other deals, such as DoubleClick, an advertising exchange bought by Google, and Whole Foods, a grocery chain acquired by Amazon.</p><p>The second prong requires more explanation. The tech titans are mostly two-headed beasts. They not only operate a market but compete in it too. Amazon owns the world's biggest e-commerce marketplace and also sells products on it under its private labels. Apple hosts the app store on the iPhone but also offers its own apps. This creates incentives for these firms to promote their wares unfairly, for instance by showing them at the top of the result pages of their search engines.</p><p>Ms Warren wants operators of any online marketplace which generates annual global revenues of more than $25bn to be declared \"platform utilities\" and prohibited from both owning a platform and doing business on it. At a minimum this would mean, for instance, that Amazon would have to spin off its private brands, in particular Amazon Basics. Apple would have to shed such apps as Mail and Maps.</p><p>Determining the effect of break-ups is tricky, though an analysis of the revenues of various parts of the tech titans' businesses gives a sense of their worth (see chart on next page). Equity analysts who engage in \"sum-of-the parts\" (SOTP) analysis also try to estimate the value of bits of a business using similar firms as a yardstick. Their over-excited assessments of how much these might be worth sometimes look like flights of fancy. But the approach may work reasonably well for business units that have closely comparable peers, such as Instagram. In June Bloomberg Intelligence reckoned that Instagram would fetch $100bn (although some in Silicon Valley put the number much higher, at around $200bn, because of its fast growth). Brent Thill of Jefferies, a bank, values Amazon's online retail business (including Amazon Basics, but without its marketplace) at nearly $200bn and the firm's physical stores (mostly Whole Foods) at up to $6bn.</p><p>If good comparisons and financial data are absent, such estimates are more art than science, says Brian Wieser of Group M, the world's largest advertising buyer. That makes it even harder to put a number on Google's advertising business as a whole (Jefferies' estimate is $539bn). Ms Warren wants to split it into an ad marketplace and services that operate in it. But valuing its constituent parts is guesswork. The firm is not forthcoming with numbers.</p><p>These are not the only problems. WhatsApp, despite the whopping price Facebook paid for it, does not make much money, which makes assessing its worth hard. Trying to estimate a price for Apple's and Google's apps would be hopeless.</p><p>The fuzziness of Ms Warren's plan also makes estimating a total break-up value difficult. If Facebook has to part with WhatsApp, why should it keep Messenger, its other instant-messaging service? Or why should Apple keep iMessage? Both may be regarded as services on top of a platform utility. It is similarly unclear what would happen to the app stores of Apple and Google or the cloud-computing arms of Amazon and Google (and Microsoft's, for that matter, a rival to Amazon). A spin-off of Amazon Web Services, for example, would create the world's second-most-valuable corporate IT firm. It would be worth $438bn, says Morgan Stanley, a bank\u2014about four times more than IBM.</p><p>Even though most analysts assume that the separate parts are worth more than the whole, could the opposite be true? Break-ups could destroy value. Synergies would evaporate, points out Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI, a financial firm. Apple may no longer be able to offer a tightly integrated package of hardware, software and services, which is its main competitive advantage. If Amazon were shorn of cloud-computing arm, it would lose its most profitable business, making whatever is left a less attractive investment. It is also unclear how markets would react if divestitures were to weaken network effects, the economic forces that let big firms get bigger and are pervasive in the digital world.</p><p>Those who think they can benefit from break-ups ought not to be too hopeful. Political and legal barriers abound. Even if Ms Warren wins next year's election, the Senate would probably remain under Republican control and might be unwilling to endorse a radical break-up. The other path, through regulatory agencies, seems equally rocky. Ms Warren intends to appoint regulators \"committed to reversing illegal and anticompetitive tech mergers\". But they would probably have to make their cases in court. Both federal appeals-court judges and the conservative majority on the Supreme Court are antitrust sceptics.</p><p>Second, practical difficulties will act as a further drag. In other industries \"line-of-business\" prohibitions, of the sort Ms Warren wants to impose on Amazon and Apple, have been used to avoid abuse of a dominant position. American railways were banned from carrying commodities they produced themselves and banks from engaging in commerce. In the digital world, these borders are more arbitrary and fluid.</p><p>Separating platforms from services which run on them sounds elegant. But how would one divvy up all the data the tech giants have collected? What is part of the platform and what is not? What happens if the lines between them move? Instant-messaging could be described as a feature of a social-networking platform but also a separate service. The case against Microsoft was triggered when it bundled its Windows operating system with its web browser, which were then separate pieces of software. Today, browsers are usually considered part of an operating system.</p><p>Third, the fear of unintended consequences will act as a brake on break-ups. Ms Warren's plan was in part inspired by Lina Khan, a legal scholar, who in 2017 published an influential paper entitled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\" and now advises the antitrust subcommittee of the House of Representatives in its investigation of Big Tech. But in a more recent paper she lists several drawbacks to heavy regulation. Quickly evolving technology can make break-ups obsolete. Because they introduce friction, they could lead to higher prices. If they are limited in what they can do, platforms may cut investment, thus slowing innovation. Although she identifies these drawbacks she says they are \"not a compelling argument for inaction\".</p><p>What is more, break-ups alone will not suffice to tame big tech. Harold Feld at Public Knowledge, a left-leaning think-tank, notes the \"starfish problem\". Some starfish have incredible powers of regeneration: tear them up and the pieces quickly grow into complete new creatures. Similarly, one part of a tech giant could become dominant again because of network effects. Break-ups, he argues, need to be complemented by regulation that weakens this effect, for instance with requirements that a user of one instant-messaging service can exchange texts with another.</p><p>Given all these hurdles, will break-ups ever happen? Sector-wide divestitures seem unlikely, but even Makan Delrahim, head of the Department of Justice's antitrust division, said on October 22nd that they are \"perfectly on the table\". Amazon looks vulnerable. It is disrupting many industries and creating many enemies. A line-of-business prohibition seems a relatively easy sell politically. The most likely victim is Facebook. Privacy scandals and its role in distributing misinformation have made the firm a target for both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>The case against Facebook is relatively easy to make. Scott Hemphill and Tim Wu, two legal scholars based in New York, have already started advancing it. Backed up by Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook now turned critic of the firm, they have been giving presentations to regulators explaining that \"available evidence indicates that as of 2010, Facebook launched a programme of serial defensive acquisitions in order to maintain its dominance.\"</p><p>Legal arguments notwithstanding, it will be hard to unscramble the eggs. WhatsApp is still a separate entity but Instagram is not. It uses the same advertising platform as Facebook's social network. And the firm is busy tying its biggest services together even more tightly by merging their address books. Facebook subscribers will at some point be able to send messages on WhatsApp. The goal, the firm says, is to make life easier for users. Critics argue that the aim is to make divestiture more difficult. To avoid \"irreparable harm\", Messrs Hemphill and Wu call on regulators to ask for a preliminary injunction that would put an end to the integration work.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's boss, knows that he has a target on his back. If Ms Warren were elected president, he recently told staff, \"then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge.\" He would also bet that he would win, he added. Mr Zuckerberg may want to read up on the history of Standard Oil. Rockefeller thought so too\u2014until it was too late.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-01885J6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBM-DYT1-JBKN-B02K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc  , Alphabet Inc's Google  and Twitter Inc . It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump's directive.      Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.    The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump's social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.    The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.    \"The EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\" said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.    \"It directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine ... allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\" the motion said.      The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump's political arsenal.    Avery Gardiner, CDT's general counsel, called Trump's executive order \"unconstitutional.\" CDT's lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.    \"Instead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\" Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration's move.    The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.    White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \"it is not a valid legal argument.\"    \"The left-wing lobbying organization's brief seems to suggest it doesn't understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn't understand the nature of the judicial system,\" he told Reuters on Wednesday.    The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.     Twitter called the executive order a \"reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\" It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.    Trump's order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency's chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.    The US Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump's executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Go on, start the bell, sir.  Dow Jones Industrials are lower.  Con Ed  ringing the closing bell.  No records on the Dow, the Nasdaq or the S&amp;P.   In fact, the day very much in two halves, the way stocks fell in the  afternoon.  And yes, you can stop ringing now.  Oh, one, two, three.  A  strong, robust gavel.  Trading is over worldwide on Thursday, it's December  the 14th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, the mouse catches the Fox.  Disney's deal changes the media world  forever.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Life in the slow lane.  Legal actions on the way as the U.S. government  rolls back net neutrality.  </p><p>And back to Brussels for Theresa May.  The British Prime Minister insists,  Brexit is still on course, even though there have been embarrassing losses.  </p><p>I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York.  Where,  of course, I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  One big story in the business world today.  The house of the  mouse takes over.  Rupert Murdoch has sold off prized assets that's taken  him a lifetime to build up.  Around the world, his assets, some $52 billion  worth.  And for Disney's Bob Iger, this still caps a career of deal-making.   It faces huge regulatory hurdles in many different jurisdictions.  And  we're covering it from all angles.  </p><p>Let's begin with what each side actually gets.  Of course, look at the  assets on both sides.  Disney has the movie studios.  20th Century Fox.   Fox 2000 Pictures.  Fox Search Light.  It has much more.  It has  entertainment channels, FX.  You've got FX Sky, you've got National  Geographic.  And this is also what the other side has.  It has Hulu, as  well.  This is what Disney is picking up in terms of the assets that it's  buying from Fox.  </p><p>There's one name on the screen that's particularly important for Bob Iger.   It's this one.  It is Hulu, a streaming service.  Disney's platforms,  including Hulu, have a total subscription level of 46 million subscribers.   Now, compare Hulu and Disney's current 46 to Netflix's 109 million.   Speaking on \"Good Morning America,\" part of ABC, which used to be Cap  Cities, which Bob Iger bought, or at least Disney bought in the 1990s.   Iger was clear, Hulu and all of this has made for Netflix in his sights.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB IGER, CEO, DISNEY:  We're not really looking to necessarily reach the  scale of Netflix quickly.  But we certainly aim to be, you know, an able  competitor to theirs.  More importantly, we believe that this is the way of  the future, to be able to reach consumers directly.  There's clearly a  value proposition associated with that.  But it's also something that  consumers want.  Because in doing so, you can tailor the offering to  consumers in a far more customized way.  More personalized ways.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Shelly Palmer is our expert on all things streaming.  Chief  executive of the Palmer Group.  Good to see you.  </p><p>SHELLY PALMER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, PALMER GROUP:  How are you, Richard?  </p><p>QUEST:  The range of assets that we just saw, the studios, the television  channels, you can see them there, Star, Sky, Hulu.  Is this just about  streaming?  </p><p>PALMER:  Well, first of all, the future is about streaming.  And whether  you want to look at it as an isolated streaming tools or just the streaming  business, video is about streaming.  And the players who are great at it,  Facebook and Google and Netflix and Amazon, have taken a bite out of the  entertainment business, as we understand it.  And so, you've got Rupert  saying let me consolidate my assets into things that are live a temporal  like sports and news.  And you've got Disney, a behemoth saying let me  really shore up my streaming capability.  This all makes good sense.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, Disney announced earlier this year it's going to start its own  streaming network.  </p><p>PALMER:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  And if it's going to do that, I mean, does it add Hulu -- we don't  really know, do we, how they put these things together.  So, is the Disney  streaming effectively just become Hulu?  </p><p>[16:05:00] PALMER:  So, they bought the rest of BAMTech, but they didn't  own, which is a really significant streaming organization.  Now they're  going to have Hulu.  They do have their own streaming strategy that is sort  of their own.  When it comes out, Bob Iger has made it very clear, he's  going to take a big shot.  He's going to make a big bet.  And clearly  today, he made a big bet in the future of video streaming.  And so, Yes,  it's an obvious future.  And makes all the sense.  Like, it just makes  sense.  </p><p>QUEST:  But, you know, again, I'm looking at what he's buying.  And what  he's already got.  </p><p>PALMER:  Right.</p><p>QUEST:  Disney is huge in its own right.  </p><p>PALMER:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  But Walt Disney studios, that are various divisions.  But ABC.  </p><p>PALMER:  They're not big enough.  They're not going to be big enough after  this.  </p><p>QUEST:  Against who?  </p><p>PALMER:  Against tier one tech and its ability to distribute at incredibly  low cost with incredible low cost of capital.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, now let's just pause there.  That's the point here.  </p><p>PALMER:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  It's not that these Amazons and Netflix -- they're spending lots of  money on production.  </p><p>PALMER:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  But they're still relatively small in terms of the movie-making  industry, compared to the big six.  </p><p>PALMER:  Well, think about it this way.  Amazon has announced they're going  to spend 5, $6 billion on original programming.  Netflix, the number keeps  going up.  Last I heard was $8 billion they're going to spend on original  programming.  I've got to tell you something, that's going to go towards  the studio side in Hollywood, because there aren't that many places that  make great television or great video or great movies.  But in practice this  is money pouring into this business from people who are not traditionally  distributors of content.  So, if you're going to compete in this world and  you're going to compete with -- you're going to find your way out of the  traditional television business.  The traditional theatrical distribution  business and find your way into the smartphones and handheld devices of a  new generation of consumer, you have to do what Disney is doing.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  So taking all of that, this deal has put -- this deal has put  the sector in play.  </p><p>PALMER:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  Who else now needs to watch out?  </p><p>PALMER:  Look, this is a -- this is a game of chess and checkers and the  DOJ hasn't weighed in yet.  Because we are still waiting for AT&amp;T in that  deal to get done.  This deal has to go through regulatory.  You mentioned  in your open there were some regulatory hurdles.  It makes sense the DOJ  should let this happen and it should just be allowed to occur.  But no  matter how big these organizations get, they're still going to be, from a  viewer standpoint, from a user standpoint, significantly smaller in the  streaming world than the big streaming competition.  So they're going to  have to work hard to make it happen.  It's all about numbers.  And these  are the new numbers.  They laughed at Mark Zuckerberg when he bought his  chat app.  They laughed at mark Zuckerberg when they spent all that money  for Instagram.  Who is laughing now?  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  There's something magic though about the old  studios.  </p><p>PALMER:  There is.  </p><p>QUEST:  History.  </p><p>PALMER:  Yes, Marilyn Monroe.  It's awesome.  And guess what?  It will  still be awesome.  It's going to be distributed differently.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  Shelly Palmer, thank you.  </p><p>We deliberately weren't talking with Shelly about Rupert Murdoch, because  that's the focus now.  Murdoch may never have imagined it would end like  this.  A picture with Bob Iger overlooking the London skyline is the final  shot before the credits roll on this part of his career.  He told Sky News,  of which he owns 39 percent and is trying to buy the rest of it, but the  deal came together relatively quickly.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUPERT MURDOCH, EXECUTIVE CO-CHAIRMEN, 21ST CENTURY FOX:  This started with  Bob Iger, a friend of mine, sitting at my winery one evening, having a  couple of glasses and just talking about our businesses and the industry  generally.  Forces of disruption were happening.  And that was all.  Then  he rang me back a couple weeks later, and said let's have this conversation  a bit more.  And I said, that's only two months ago.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Murdoch is a classic newspaper man.  Made his name in his homeland  of Australia.  Then, of course, in the United Kingdom with \"The Sun\" and  \"The Times\" and \"News of the World.\"  It wasn't until the 1980s when he got  into movies.  He bought 20th Century Fox -- as it was then -- from the oil  baron, Marvin Davis.  And then Fox broadcasting.  Following on from that,  he got into Sky, and Star TV.  Controversy, everywhere.  Triumphs.  There  were failed attempts to make the empire even bigger.  Now he's come full  circle.  He's cutting back on the TV and the movies, and he's focusing on  the papers.  Stewart Purvis is the have a former executive of Independent  Television News, known as ITN.  Stewart joins me from London.  The way in  which Murdoch is dismantling the very empire that he built speaks volumes  about the man, doesn't it?  And his capacity to play this three-dimensional  chess of media markets.  </p><p>[16:10:00] STEWART PURVIS, FORMER CEO, ITN:  Absolutely right, Richard.   Here's a man who nearly 50 years ago got off a plane from Australia, bought  an English Sunday newspaper, upset the British establishment, never really  got on with the British establishment.  But built businesses, bought more  newspapers, bought TV.  Even last year, he bought some commercial radio  assets.  Now he's actually doing a deal to become smaller.  I mean, we're  still in a bit of shock here.  All the headlines about, you know, 21st  Century Fox and Disney.  I'm saying, the story is, Murdoch sells Sky.  The  platform he spent years and years developing.  The platform he had been  trying desperately for seven years to take complete ownership control of.   And he's suddenly at the very moment maybe just weeks away from the moment  when he could have had it all, he's decided he doesn't want it.  </p><p>QUEST:  Now I'm hearing two views.  One is he didn't want to risk being  found to be not a fit and proper person to own Sky.  That's one view.  The  second view is that this is just a genius foresight in getting out of old  school, or old style.  But getting 25 percent of the new Disney with its  streaming capability.  </p><p>PURVIS:  Well, it could be a bit of both.  I mean, I personally always  thought this deal was going to go through.  And we'll find out, actually.   Because it's still going through the processes whilst American regulators  look at the Disney/Fox deal.  So, you know, if he was put off by the kind  of noise that's been around it, that's a little bit unusual for him.  But  there we are.  </p><p>But on the other piece you mentioned, yes, absolutely right.  I mean, he's  basically telling us in this interview with Sky that actually he doesn't  really think entertainment has a future on television.  So, you know, you  read from that that he's selling his television interests, which are in the  entertainment area, so that he doesn't lose value on them.  So, he's  actually getting out as he would see it, at the best point in the market.  </p><p>QUEST:  In terms of Disney and how they will perform, Disney obviously, the  movies are familiar.  Disney has less of a footprint elsewhere within the  international markets.  </p><p>PURVIS:  Yes.  I mean, Disney has had a sort of inconsistent record in  distribution.  Sometimes it's been just a seller to networks.  Sometimes  it's had its own brand of networks.  I mean, the point I think is relevant,  this is about regulation.  You take this deal here in Britain.  Murdoch is  having to go through a whole series of hoops to try to get control of what  he wanted on this platform.  But at the same time, the giants, the new  digital giants are coming into countries like the U.K. throughout Europe,  throughout Asia and actually setting up amid the danger to call them  monopolies, but that's to many people what they are.  So, to his point of  view, he's being disadvantaged because he is seen as television.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, in terms of -- back to Rupert -- in terms of -- I mean, he's  got the newspapers.  People say he might fold the remaining news assets,  particularly in the U.S., the Fox News, Fox Sports, Fox Business, into his  newspapers, join them all up again.  He's still a news man at heart.  </p><p>PURVIS:  That' what he says.  Though he is curiously unemotional about  letting go of Sky News and Sky Sports, the two things he says news and  sports are the future.  What I take from that, he likes Fox News and he  likes Fox Sports and wants to develop those and who knows what he wants to  do in the number of stations he can own in the states.  So, yes, that's the  story.  There as you see a fit with a news corp., which is a news-led --  mostly newspaper group.  So, he can bring those two together.  Very  interesting tonight, he was trying to make clear that actually there is -- there will be I think $2 billion cashflow from this news and sport TV  business.  </p><p>QUEST:  Stewart, it's good to see you.  Thank you, sir, for coming in  tonight.  Thank you.  </p><p>To Wall Street, where Disney shares were the top performer in the Dow.  As  you can see, they were up 2.8 percent.  When you wish upon a star, the  shared price rises.  Boeing was also good stock.  The Dow closed in the  red, and you can see why.  Surrendering an all-time high.  The S&amp;P 500 was  also down.  Paul La Monica.  As you wish on a star, Amazon was up during  the day.  Netflix was up during the day.  Never mind how they may have  closed.  But they are all -- Google.  All the competitors to Disney's new  streaming.  You would have thought they would have been down.  </p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  You would have thought that  would be the case.  But I think that investors realize that while Disney  now is an even more formidable content company, people aren't going to all  of a sudden decide, you know, I'm not going to watch \"Stranger Things\" on  Netflix anymore, because I'm busy watching all of these shows on whatever  Disney decides to name its streaming service, that is yet to come out.  So  obviously, there is room for content providers that consumers already love.   And that's why Netflix and Amazon I think will be able to withstand this  threat from Disney.  </p><p>[16:15:00] QUEST:  You've got to hand it to Rupert Murdoch.  The ability to  within two months for this -- or three months to sort of -- the leak that  Disney's interested.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  Get Comcast and others -- </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, Sony, Chatter into their briefly.  </p><p>QUEST:  Sniffing around.  They drop out.  Iger comes in.  Who is the real  genius here?  Is it Iger or is it Murdoch, or both?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I think we can safely say, Richard, that it is both.  I mean,  Murdoch throughout his history has been a bit of a renegade in the media  industry, not afraid to make changes.  And obviously, this is in some  respects a cashing in of the chips.  Even though let's not weep too many  tears for Murdoch, because he obviously still has the \"Wall Street  Journal,\" \"The New York Post,\" the news aspects of Fox, as well, on the  cable side.  </p><p>But for Bob Iger to be able now to have the rest of the Marvel family, \"X- Men,\" \"Fantastic Four,\" \"Dead Pool,\" and add that to the library that  already has with all these other superheroes, then you throw on top of that  Pixar and the Disney princesses and Lucas Films.  \"Star Wars\" is coming  out, I'm going to see it on Saturday, no spoilers, please.  I mean, Iger  has really made this company into a Hollywood juggernaut.  The only problem  is that everyone cares about ESPN on Wall Street.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  One quick question, in the La Monica household, we use you  as a barometer.  What percentage is your streaming viewing versus your  television viewing?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  It is -- I would say for my wife and I, maybe about 40 percent,  and for the two kids, I would say maybe 80 percent, because they're more  technologically savvy than their old folks/parents.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Used you as the barometer.  Thank you.  </p><p>As we continue tonight, and let's think about that for the La Monica  household.  They had better be careful.  Net neutrality has gone.  As we  continue, the slow lane for some unless you're prepared to pay more to go  faster.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  From the fast lane to the slow lane, the Federal Communications  Commission in the United States has voted to repeal something known as net  neutrality.  The rules that basically say everybody is equal on the  internet.  It's a big win for broadband companies like Verizon and AT&amp;T,  which is attempting to buy Time Warner, parent company of this network.  </p><p>It's a major setback for consumers and tech companies, so some say.   Outside the FCC building in Washington, there were demonstrators to protest  against the ending of this net neutrality.  Netflix has already promised  legal action.  Saying we're disappointed in the decision to gut protections  that ushered inn unprecedented era of innovation.  </p><p>[16:20:00] The rules have been controversial for years.  Many internet  users have struggled to understand them.  So, let us explain net neutrality  through the eyes of CNN Money, Jon Sarlin.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON SARLIN, CNNMONEY PRODUCER:  If the internet is a highway, vehicles or  content providers, can't pay more to use a special fast lane.  Think of it  this way.  All content is created equal in the eyes of the internet  provider.  That's the basic tenant behind net neutrality.  So, if the  internet is neutral, then the internet providers are treated basically like  public utilities.  Comcast or AT&amp;T, they couldn't slow down or speed up  certain content like Netflix or Hulu.  But if net neutrality ends, some  companies are going to be stuck in that slow lane.  And customers might  stop using sites that never seem to load.  The rules that made the net  neutral were put in place during the Obama administration.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This set of  principles, the idea of net neutrality has unleashed the power of the  Internet and given innovators the chance to thrive.  </p><p>SARLIN:  But now things are going in a different direction.  Ajit Pai is  now the chairman of the FCC.  He's a former lawyer for Verizon.  </p><p>AJIT PAI, CHAIRMAN FCC:  Entrepreneurs are constantly developing new  technologies and services.  But too often, they are unable to bring them to  market for consumers, because outdated rules or regulatory inertia stabbed  in the way.  </p><p>SARLIN:  To him, repealing net neutrality will lead to innovation that will  get the government out of, quote, micro managing the internet.  The  internet providers will have more money.  They'll then invest more in  infrastructure and will have faster streaming.  But while deregulation  certainly has earned the praise of the telecommunications industry, on the  other side of the coin, you have tech companies and consumer advocacy  groups.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We don't want our internet to start looking like our  television cable.  We don't want to have tiered access.  We don't want to  have all the things that have really stifled innovation in other  industries.  </p><p>SARLIN:  For those who want to keep net neutrality intact, it's a matter of  Internet freedom.  Repeal would mean that internet service providers can  choose how affordable and fast certain content is.  That is, there will be  a slow lane and a fast lane.  So, this summer, some big tech giants like  Facebook, Google, Netflix, they participated in a day of action to advocate  for net neutrality.  But really, it's the small companies and the startups  that have the most to lose if net neutrality ends.  They don't have the  deep pockets to pay the toll to access the faster lane.  The open question  now.  Will repeal of net neutrality lead to innovation or to a traffic jam?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  Mozilla is one of the companies, many companies that took a stand  against the repeal of net neutrality.  Mitchell Baker is Mozilla's founder  and chairwoman, joins me from Austin, Texas.  Good to see you ma'am.  Thank  you for taking time to speak to us this evening.  </p><p>MITCHELL BAKER, CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRWOMAN, MOZILLA:  Of course.  </p><p>QUEST:  Why don't you buy this argument that getting rid of net neutrality  will spur innovation?  </p><p>BAKER:  Because losing net neutrality spurs the innovation that Verizon or  the ISPs are interested in, and that meets their business practices and  that works well for them.  But it doesn't spur innovation that challenges  them or is irrelevant or has new ideas that just don't make sense to  Verizon.  And we need that kind of innovation that is spread out and that  all of us could actually attempt, because there's lots of new things to be  invented and big problems to solve.  And sending all that through Verizon's  business planning and Verizon's decisions doesn't benefit any of us, except  for the ISPs.  </p><p>QUEST:  I was listening to the chair of the FCC there, who says, you know,  outdated regulations of a different era in a multifaceted environment,  where people do have choice.  You know, if you wish to switch.  Now, I know  it's t that easy in some parts of the U.S. to switch ISPs.  But the goal  here -- the FCC believes is that it will spur greater growth.  </p><p>BAKER:  Well, three of the five FCC commissioners believe that.  So  secondly, the idea that there is choice is very important.  Because for  many people, they are not.  Something close to half of Americans don't  actually have choice.  And so, this idea that consumers are going to  exercise choice or that the market works or that telling people how badly  you're treating them is an answer, it just -- it's like a fantasy if you  have no choice.  And even if you have a second choice, if they're both bad,  like how does that help us?  Like, if you have got two companies and  they're both treating you badly, well choices exist in theory, but it  doesn't have any real meaning.  And so that is a fundamental problem with  the whole new system.  </p><p>QUEST:  One of the things that puzzles me in the administration's decision  is that though a big company is on both sides.  So, it's not as if it was a  sort of one-way bet.  Why do you think the administration decided, or the  FCC chair decided to get rid of it?  </p><p>[16:25:00] I mean, why do you think he favored the ISPs and the  communications companies over the providers?  </p><p>BAKER:  Ah.  Over the providers of web services or internet websites or  apps that were familiar with.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes.  </p><p>BAKER:  This is an ongoing battle about when you pay, you know, where does  the money that's generated by the internet go.  And so, the  telecommunication companies, which you know provide the access or sometimes  it's called the pipes, are also interested in the revenue or money that the  application providers or Google or Facebook are generating.  And so,  underlying this is a fight for those economics.  And so, the size -- there  are big companies on both sides.  You also find the big companies from the  internet side, you know, are engaged with smaller companies, as well.  And  so, it's not exactly a big company/small company piece.  It's who actually  has control over all of the content.  And how many new players can get  involved?  </p><p>QUEST:  Surprisingly, the rest of the world is watching.  Thank you very  much for joining us tonight from Austin.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>BAKER:  My pleasure.  </p><p>QUEST:  Before making its decision, the FCC invited comments via its  website.  Millions of people responded.  Well, it looked as if millions of  people responded.  Until you looked a bit closer.  And then you discovered  nefarious people using stolen identities.  Luckily for us, Laurie Segall  went to discover more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECH CORRESPONDENT:  The Obama administration  ramped through a massive scheme that gave the federal government broad  regulatory control over the internet.  </p><p>TERENCE GORDON:  Not me.  I did not submit that to the FCC.  </p><p>SEGALL (voice-over):  Yet posted under his current address, a paragraph  long opinion on the highly contentious net neutrality vote.  In his name.  </p><p>GORDON:  Not only was my right privacy compromised and breached, but so in  a larger sense was the democratic process.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Terry Gordon is a retired director of network engineering in New  York City and his identity has also been used to spout political beliefs.  </p><p>It started earlier this year.  The FCC called for public opinion on whether  to end net neutrality.  The regulations put into place in 2015 dictated  that internet providers had to treat all content the same when it comes to  speed.  Ahead of the vote, the FCC called on the general public to leave  their thoughts.  And then something strange started happening.  </p><p>ERIC T.  SCHNEIDERMAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF NEW YORK:  The internet  is the public square of the 21st century.  Unfortunately, the internet is  also the crime scene of the 21st century.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Of more than 20 million comments made to the FCC, the attorney  general's office and multiple independent studies say that millions of the  submitted comments are fake.  On both sides of the debate.  The irony?   Terry has worked in technology for decades and actually has some pretty  strong views on the demise of net neutrality.  </p><p>GORDON:  Let's keep net neutrality laws so that everyone is on an even  playing field.  </p><p>SEGALL:  A spokesperson for the FCC said that people whose identities were  stolen should submit a complaint contesting the fraudulent comments.  But  the FCC isn't removing them.  And was unable to provide CNN with any  evidence that they looked into who was behind the millions of fraudulent  remarks.  For Chris Basco, whose mother's identity was also used to weigh  in, it felt personal.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER BASCO, SON OF MARGARET BASCO:  My mother's name, it is Margaret  Mary Basco.  She sadly passed away on June 9th, 2017.  There is no way she  could have posted that comment.  </p><p>SEGALL (on camera):  How did you feel when you saw your mom's identity used  for essentially a political opinion?  </p><p>BASCO:  It was when I saw the date.  That's when I really got angry.  How  close in proximity it was to her death.  </p><p>SEGALL (voice-over):  Here's what Margaret thinks about net neutrality.   According to the comment fraudulently made with her name.  The  unprecedented regulatory power the Obama administration imposed on the  internet is smothering innovation.  </p><p>BASCO:  It was a little message, something she never did.  I would probably  have to explain what net neutrality was to her to begin with.  </p><p>SEGALL:  The FCC General Counsel said the commission didn't rely on any of  the alleged corrupted comments to draft the document that was up for a  vote.  </p><p>BASCO:  I feel that this was something that was in a system that at a  moment's notice could be deployed anywhere for anything.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Increasingly, we're all at risk of this type of threat.  More  hacks mean more of our personal information is floating around for anyone  to use.  </p><p>GORDON:  You can use very simple technology to influence people without  knowledge of those that you are really impacting.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  That's Laurie Segall.  </p><p>As we continue after the break, central banks in their decisions and women  in economics.  Diane Swonk will be joining us to tell us why there aren't  more women in the world of economics.  After of course, we have discussed  what those Fed, Bank of England, ECB.  What did they do?  It's after the  break.  </p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  When Theresa May says she's disappointed as she heads into  Brexit talks in Brussels.  And the Simpsons are going to Disneyland with a  whole new cast of characters at Disney's disposal.  </p><p>As we continue, this is CNN.  And on this network, the facts will always  come first.  </p><p>Here's been a deadly collision between a train and a school bus in the  eastern Pyrenees region of Southwestern France.  A CNN affiliate BFM TV  says at least four people have died, and about a dozen have been injured.   Emergency crews are looking for other survivors and retrieving injured.  </p><p>President Vladimir Putin had some positive words for his U.S. counterpart  during Putin's annual end of year news conference.  He said Donald Trump  has made some, quote, fairly serious achievements since taking office.  He  dismissed U.S. investigations into possible collusion, saying the issue was  dreamt up by Mr. Trump's political opponents.  </p><p>Six months after the deadly Brentford fire in London and the victims were  remembered on Thursday at a memorial service.  It was attended by the  British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and members of the Royal family.  The  fire engulfed a residential tower, killed 71 people.  An investigation is  still ongoing.  </p><p>Super Thursday for central banks.  The BOE and the ECB kept rates on hold.   Only one day after the Fed made its move.  Diane Swonk joins me from  Chicago.  We should of course, put this into context.  The Fed moved, the  BOE did move at its last meeting.  So, they're waiting to see what happens.   Who knows when the ECB is next going to move?  </p><p>DIANE SWONK, FOUNDER, DS ECONOMICS:  That's exactly right.  I do think it  was interesting that the ECB, like the Fed, also saw stronger growth next  year.  We're talking about the strongest synchronized global growth in 2018  in probably a decade.  I think that's very important.  It's one of the  things we're sort of seeing.  The momentum from the end of 2018 is a high  jumping off point for 2018.  And this is global in scope.  It also seems to  be a global in scope phenomena is the lack of inflation for both the year - - both in Europe and in the U.S. and that missing on inflation, of course,  even here in the U.S., we saw two dissents on the Fed's voting panel.  And  here in the U.S., when you vote to dissent, you're often voting for people  who can't vote.  </p><p>[16:35:00] And so, when Charlie Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed and  the Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Fed voted in their last  vote of the year, they're probably voting for other people.  So that's a  big issue that's facing both the U.S. and Europe right now.  </p><p>QUEST:  We have a moment or two more today.  So, let us just grab this  thistle on inflation.  The lack of inflation after eight years of ultra- uber low interest rates, with unemployment down 4 percent in the U.S.,  similarly in the U.K. It is a conundrum.  Do you believe the rules on  inflation have changed?  </p><p>SWONK:  I don't believe the rules have changed, but I do think we  constantly have to sort of look the shifting ground around us.  Not only is  there the Amazon effect and the, you know, flood of online and more  comparative shopping that's going on.  We also have -- and that's sort of a  substitute for globalization.  So, it's having the same effect that  globalization perhaps had in the 1990s that was pushing down inflation.  We  don't have a lot of productivity growth.  Which is not the phenomena that  we had before.  But what's interesting is even in Germany, where labor  markets are much tighter than they are here, you're still not seeing that  wage acceleration.  And, of course, there's many different reasons for  that.  The unions in Germany actually opted for job security over wage  increases.  But these are real -- it is a bit of an issue going forward.  </p><p>QUEST:  We want to talk about women in the world of economics.  Have a  listen to Janet Yellen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR:  In terms of the kinds of research  that's done in the field, I think also a greater diversity, more women and  minorities may change the focus to some extent of the questions that people  choose to look at and the analysis that they bring in, range of thinking  that bears on research and all of that would be a healthy development.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Why do you think more women do not go into the world of economics  and become economists?  I mean, you know, obviously there are many.  But  not as many as -- </p><p>SWONK:  Not enough.  </p><p>QUEST:  Why is it?  </p><p>SWONK:  I was the only woman in my class, believe me.  You know, it is --  they have done a lot of studies now.  And we know it is one of the last  bastions, really.  To think it's harder to stay in economics as a woman  than it is to stay in a STEM.  research as an undergraduate, that really is  sort of disappointing.  And we know that women economists, when they're  married and they're economists, or even if they're not married, when they  put together research, they're not cited the same way as men.  </p><p>There really is pretty systematic kinds of things we can look at to show  that if you were to do more blind research out there, and not have the  names attached or the sex of the person producing the research, would you  have a different kind of citations, and different kinds of reflections from  the group itself and economist itself.  You remember, all of the men who  are tenured professors in economics get to vote on who gets to join their  club.  </p><p>QUEST:  Naked, raw sexism.  Do you think that's what it is?  At the end of  the day, we have to understand, you know, why the next generation are not  wanting too into the world of economics.  One can put it to a certain  extent, you say you're the only woman in your class.  But if you look to  the future, do you get the implication or the feeling that younger women do  want a career in economics?  </p><p>SWONK:  Actually, you know, they do join economics, but they drop out more  than other professions, as well.  Which suggests, again, something  systemic, in its not because of the rigor of the course.  They're doing  other things that are rigorous, as well.  So that can't explain it alone.   I do think also one of the things that I as an economist, one of the things  you see by not having this diversity out there, you see a lot of research  that originally said, you know, women don't stay in the labor force because  they just want to opt out and have babies and opt on a mommy track, opt on  these different tracks.  That's just garbage.  </p><p>Actually, what we know now is the choices women are given in the labor  force are different than the choices that men are given, even in their  first entry level job.  And having been there myself, I can certainly  attest to, it wasn't exactly fun.  What's disappointing, is that it's still  there.  And, you know, it's hard for me to even change the name of chair of  the Federal Reserve back to chairman, because I think it should be just  chair.  I'm going to call Chair Powell, he's a wonderful guy.  I'm going to  call him chair Powell.  Because frankly, I don't want to lose the sense  that a woman will once again be chair of the Federal Reserve.  And I think  we should start to think of these things as just a fact, rather than only  firsts.  </p><p>QUEST:  You know, it's funny you talk about that.  I had to mention his  name on a broadcast the other day, and that's exactly what I was thinking.   Do -- I instinctively went to say, meanwhile, chairman -- and I thought,  nope.  Diane, wonderful to see you.  Thank you.  Have a great holiday.  </p><p>SWONK:  Thank you, Richard.  </p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST:  As we continue tonight, as Theresa May is toughing it  out in Brussels.  The British Prime Minister is facing EU leaders a day  after an embarrassing defeat in her own Parliament.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, insists Brexit is on  course, despite her government suffering a humiliating blow in Parliament.   Theresa May is facing EU leaders in Brussels.  Less than 24 hours after the  defeat.  Lawmakers will now get to vote on the final deal before Britain  bows out, and the government won't be able to make any changes before the  vote.  The fears are holding up, putting pressure on Mrs.  May as she heads  into phase two of the talks.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  I'm disappointed with the amendment.   But actually, the EU withdrawal bill is making good progress through the  House of Commons.  And we are on course to deliver on Brexit, and remember  last week, the President Juncker said that sufficient progress had been  made to move on to phase two of our negotiations.  Yesterday the European  Parliament overwhelmingly voted to accept that recommendation too, and I'm  looking forward to discussing that deep and special partnership for the  future.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  CNN's Bianca Nobilo joins me from London.  I mean, an element of  schadenfreude from the other leaders.  Weren't there?  You know, ho, ho,  ho, you got a bloody eye, a black eye in your own Parliament.  But as you  reminded me yesterday, all leaders come to this, knowing that they're only  one stage themselves from problems with politics at home.  </p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN WESTMINSTER:  That's quite right.  And, in fact, it's  just expected in a democracy.  In some EU leaders at the council today have  actually come out in support of the Prime Minister, saying that.  Saying  this is just politics.  And it's to be expected.  The Prime Minister said  the bill is making good progress.  I suppose in relative terms, it is.  And  I hate to break it to you and the other viewers of the show, Richard.  But  this is just the committee stage.  There's a report stage, there's a third  reading, it's got to go through the House of Lords.  This bill is going to  look very different than it does now when it reaches the final stage,  anyway.  </p><p>QUEST:  That said, let's move strictly then to phase two.  And the  difficulty of phase two.  You know, the council is obviously going to  approve it, bearing in mind the commission president and the council  president are in favor.  So, what should we look for, and how long do you  think phase two, the trade part, the future relationship part will last?  </p><p>NOBILO:  The Prime Minister and the head of the EU Commission want to see a  framework for that future relationship done by March.  That is ambitious.   This was already an incredibly tight timetable.  And as David Davis, the  Brexit secretary, said this morning, it's now even further compressed by  this government defeat last night.  I think compressed is putting it  mildly, too.  This is almost a Konstantina effect.  They have very little  time.  </p><p>[16:45:00] But, of course, they can't start the trade discussions in  earnest until after the U.K. has left the EU.  And then when it's a third  country, they can begin those discussions.  But the foreign secretary,  Boris Johnson, has been out speaking today, saying that Britain is hoping  to strike a deal with Japan as soon as possible after Brexit.  So, there is  certainly an eye on that already from the U.K. side.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY:  The point I would make to our  Japanese friends, our partners, is that we intend to build a deep and  special partnership.  As Theresa May has said, with our friends and  partners in the European Union.  So that the U.K. remains the best place in  this hemisphere to come and invest and develop your companies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  There's only one problem, Bianca.  It was the Japanese earlier,  immediately after the referendum late last year, they were the ones that  took the highly unusual step of writing to the British government saying on  behalf of Japanese companies they wanted clarity for the very large  automakers and others that have invested in the U.K. </p><p>NOBILO:  They did say that.  In fact, the Japanese have actually been  fairly outspoken on the Brexit process.  I remember that the ambassador,  the Japanese ambassador for the U.K., spoke to you, Richard, and offered  officials to intervene and offer advice on the Brexit negotiations.  They  do want more clarity, but both the Japanese foreign minister and Boris  Johnson said they were both confident that a mutual recognition of trade  standards agreement could be struck to make market access easier.  Very  soon after Brexit.  So that's really optimistic language from both of them.   And very consistent with Boris' glorious vision for Brexit, which he has  pushed the entire time as one of the leading Brexiteers in the U.K. </p><p>QUEST:  Bianca, good to see you.  Thank you.  Keep watching, you've got a  busy week ahead as stage 2 and phase 2 gets underway.  </p><p>As we stay with Brexit, the former head of the WTO says he doesn't think  any post Brexit relationship will be as good as the single market.  I asked  Pascal Lamy what's the best relationship that they can hope for?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PASCAL LAMY, FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL, WTO:  I think the best is to keep  trade open.  Now, if the British do not want to remain in the customs  union, they do not want to remain in the internal market, it's probably a  sort of Canada/EU-like agreement.  Which is way, way less open than the  internal market.  But I think it will take time.  More time than expected.   I don't think a minute something like this can be negotiated within a year,  which is what it should be in order to be ratified by 2019.  And, you know,  we are in a process where the United Kingdom is slowly, very slowly,  realizing that getting the egg out is not only painful, but it's also  costly.  </p><p>QUEST:  How prepared are the Europeans, the EC side, to make the  concessions necessary to get a status just underneath single market customs  union?  Granting that it can't be full, but a free trade, Canada-plus deal?  </p><p>PASCAL:  I think this is perfectly -- the EU will -- the red line of the EU  is if you don't accept free circulation of people, you have to leave the  internal market.  That's it.  And what the EU will say, is the moment U.K.  becomes a third country, there needs to be a border with checks for origins  of products, or with checks for regulation of services, for instance.  But  I think the EU, on this phase, are really, really very open-minded.  What  remains a very difficult issue is this Irish border, which basically has  been fudged in the deal which was passed last week, and which remains a  thorny issue, because of the politics and the economics of that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Luke Skywalker is  from a distant galaxy.  Homer Simpson is from Springfield.  And Mickey  Mouse spent time as Steamboat Willie.  Now they all have one place to call  home.  </p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  When you wish upon a star and you bring the two together, what do  you end up with?  Disney's capture of Fox, creator of the deepest vaults of  intellectual property in cinema and popular culture.  Bringing the famous  franchises all under one roof.  And possibly under one streaming device.   This is extraordinary.  Take a look over here and you will see what's  coming together.  First of all, you've got X-Men, that will reunite with  the Marvel cinematic universe, which Disney bought in 2009.  Wolverine will  share digs with the Avengers, all in the same Fox/Disney house.  And then  legendary series like \"The Simpsons\" will join franchises already in the  Disney locker.  \"Star Wars,\" which is still being milked with the \"The Last  Jedi\" releasing today.  And off-screen benefits, just oodles everywhere.   \"Avatar,\" James Cameron's, \"Avatar,\" which owns outright, the highest- grossing movie of all-time.  Only months after it opened, \"Avatar,\" a theme  park of its animal kingdom, Pandora, in Florida.  It doesn't get better  than that.  Frank Pallotta we need you, sir, to explain and help us  understand that this is a true colossus being put together with regulatory  concerns, perhaps.  </p><p>FRANK PALLOTTA, CNNMONEY MEDIA REPORTER:  Perhaps.  Now imagine for a  moment I offered you a streaming service that had \"Captain America\" Luke  Skywalker, \"Moana,\" the Na'vi of \"Avatar.\"  That would be something you  would be interested in.  You would pay maybe a lot of money for that  streaming service.  That is the name of the game here.  Disney has for  years had one of the biggest vaults of intellectual property with its  animated movies, its Disney princesses, and now it's just getting even  bigger than that.  </p><p>QUEST:  It's also got the studios.  Which, of course, is the only part of  horizontal integration between the two.  Does it keep both the Disney  studios and all the various affiliates of Disney studios and the 21st  Century or the 20th Century Fox bit?  </p><p>PALLOTTA:  I think it definitely does.  It's going to be interesting to see  what kind of material they're going to be using from Fox.  Fox has Fox  Searchlight, which is very prestigious.  Maybe even makes Disney an Oscar  contender.  It's always been this very family-friendly place.  Maybe it  starts making a little bit more of adult content.  You look at something  like Marvel Studios, you have a character like Dead Pool, who was an R- rated Marvel superhero.  Maybe Bob Iger was saying maybe we'll even make R- rated Marvel movies going forward.  </p><p>QUEST:  In the same way that AT&amp;T's chief executive sort of made it clear  when talking about buying Turner, Time Warner and CNN, we know what we're  buying.  We know what we've got.  We're not buying CNN to destroy it or  ruin it.  </p><p>PALLOTTA:  Right.  </p><p>QUEST:  Disney is not buying the racier assets of 21st Century Fox only to  gut them.  </p><p>[16:55:00] PALLOTTA:  No, not at all.  I would say the big ones that they  are buying here is the Marvel characters.  They're also buying \"The  Simpsons,\" as you are saying.  That's going to celebrate its 30th  anniversary in 2019.  And then you have \"Avatar\" that's going to have  multiple, multiple sequels.  Remember, \"Avatar\" it's the biggest movie ever  made, $2.7 billion around the world when it was released.  </p><p>QUEST:  Netflix is the largest streaming service, but it is only one and  who knows who will be there in five, ten years' time.  Is Hulu the gateway  through which this goes, or does Disney now continue with its Disney  streaming service that it said it was going to start, or does it fold it  all in?  </p><p>PALLOTTA:  I think they're going to have multiple services.  You have to  look at this almost like streaming is the new cable television.  Disney for  years had ESPN, Disney channel, ABC.  Why did anyone always say, why don't  we put all your stuff on ESPN?  Because they diversify.  Maybe we will see  instead of a big six studios or multiple cable channels, maybe we'll see  all these different streaming services and Disney will sell a package of  ESPN and Marvel and Hulu and \"Star Wars\" and you'll have to buy it for a  high price.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  I could talk more.  </p><p>PALLOTTA:  Good to see you.</p><p>QUEST:  Profitable Moment after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>Tonight's Profitable Moment.  The genius of Rupert Murdoch spotting the way  and the trend of the industry.  And not being afraid to dismantle an empire  that's taken a lifetime to put together and still have 25 percent of the  new media.  Brilliant.  And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm  Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up in the hours ahead, I hope  it's profitable.  Let's do it again tomorrow, please.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Go on, start the bell, sir. Dow Jones Industrials are lower. Con Ed ringing the closing bell. No records on the Dow, the Nasdaq or the S&amp;P. In fact, the day very much in two halves, the way stocks fell in the afternoon. And yes, you can stop ringing now. Oh, one, two, three. A strong, robust gavel. Trading is over worldwide on Thursday, it's December the 14th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, the mouse catches the Fox. Disney's deal changes the media world forever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Life in the slow lane. Legal actions on the way as the U.S. government rolls back net neutrality.</p><p>And back to Brussels for Theresa May. The British Prime Minister insists, Brexit is still on course, even though there have been embarrassing losses.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York. Where, of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. One big story in the business world today. The house of the mouse takes over. Rupert Murdoch has sold off prized assets that's taken him a lifetime to build up. Around the world, his assets, some $52 billion worth. And for Disney's Bob Iger, this still caps a career of deal-making. It faces huge regulatory hurdles in many different jurisdictions. And we're covering it from all angles.</p><p>Let's begin with what each side actually gets. Of course, look at the assets on both sides. Disney has the movie studios. 20th Century Fox. Fox 2000 Pictures. Fox Search Light. It has much more. It has entertainment channels, FX. You've got FX Sky, you've got National Geographic. And this is also what the other side has. It has Hulu, as well. This is what Disney is picking up in terms of the assets that it's buying from Fox.</p><p>There's one name on the screen that's particularly important for Bob Iger. It's this one. It is Hulu, a streaming service. Disney's platforms, including Hulu, have a total subscription level of 46 million subscribers. Now, compare Hulu and Disney's current 46 to Netflix's 109 million. Speaking on \"Good Morning America,\" part of ABC, which used to be Cap Cities, which Bob Iger bought, or at least Disney bought in the 1990s. Iger was clear, Hulu and all of this has made for Netflix in his sights.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB IGER, CEO, DISNEY: We're not really looking to necessarily reach the scale of Netflix quickly. But we certainly aim to be, you know, an able competitor to theirs. More importantly, we believe that this is the way of the future, to be able to reach consumers directly. There's clearly a value proposition associated with that. But it's also something that consumers want. Because in doing so, you can tailor the offering to consumers in a far more customized way. More personalized ways.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Shelly Palmer is our expert on all things streaming. Chief executive of the Palmer Group. Good to see you.</p><p>SHELLY PALMER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, PALMER GROUP: How are you, Richard?</p><p>QUEST: The range of assets that we just saw, the studios, the television channels, you can see them there, Star, Sky, Hulu. Is this just about streaming?</p><p>PALMER: Well, first of all, the future is about streaming. And whether you want to look at it as an isolated streaming tools or just the streaming business, video is about streaming. And the players who are great at it, Facebook and Google and Netflix and Amazon, have taken a bite out of the entertainment business, as we understand it. And so, you've got Rupert saying let me consolidate my assets into things that are live a temporal like sports and news. And you've got Disney, a behemoth saying let me really shore up my streaming capability. This all makes good sense.</p><p>QUEST: So, Disney announced earlier this year it's going to start its own streaming network.</p><p>PALMER: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: And if it's going to do that, I mean, does it add Hulu -- we don't really know, do we, how they put these things together. So, is the Disney streaming effectively just become Hulu?</p><p>[16:05:00] PALMER: So, they bought the rest of BAMTech, but they didn't own, which is a really significant streaming organization. Now they're going to have Hulu. They do have their own streaming strategy that is sort of their own. When it comes out, Bob Iger has made it very clear, he's going to take a big shot. He's going to make a big bet. And clearly today, he made a big bet in the future of video streaming. And so, Yes, it's an obvious future. And makes all the sense. Like, it just makes sense.</p><p>QUEST: But, you know, again, I'm looking at what he's buying. And what he's already got.</p><p>PALMER: Right.</p><p>QUEST: Disney is huge in its own right.</p><p>PALMER: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: But Walt Disney studios, that are various divisions. But ABC.</p><p>PALMER: They're not big enough. They're not going to be big enough after this.</p><p>QUEST: Against who?</p><p>PALMER: Against tier one tech and its ability to distribute at incredibly low cost with incredible low cost of capital.</p><p>QUEST: Right, now let's just pause there. That's the point here.</p><p>PALMER: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: It's not that these Amazons and Netflix -- they're spending lots of money on production.</p><p>PALMER: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: But they're still relatively small in terms of the movie-making industry, compared to the big six.</p><p>PALMER: Well, think about it this way. Amazon has announced they're going to spend 5, $6 billion on original programming. Netflix, the number keeps going up. Last I heard was $8 billion they're going to spend on original programming. I've got to tell you something, that's going to go towards the studio side in Hollywood, because there aren't that many places that make great television or great video or great movies. But in practice this is money pouring into this business from people who are not traditionally distributors of content. So, if you're going to compete in this world and you're going to compete with -- you're going to find your way out of the traditional television business. The traditional theatrical distribution business and find your way into the smartphones and handheld devices of a new generation of consumer, you have to do what Disney is doing.</p><p>QUEST: OK. So taking all of that, this deal has put -- this deal has put the sector in play.</p><p>PALMER: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Who else now needs to watch out?</p><p>PALMER: Look, this is a -- this is a game of chess and checkers and the DOJ hasn't weighed in yet. Because we are still waiting for AT&amp;T in that deal to get done. This deal has to go through regulatory. You mentioned in your open there were some regulatory hurdles. It makes sense the DOJ should let this happen and it should just be allowed to occur. But no matter how big these organizations get, they're still going to be, from a viewer standpoint, from a user standpoint, significantly smaller in the streaming world than the big streaming competition. So they're going to have to work hard to make it happen. It's all about numbers. And these are the new numbers. They laughed at Mark Zuckerberg when he bought his chat app. They laughed at mark Zuckerberg when they spent all that money for Instagram. Who is laughing now?</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. There's something magic though about the old studios.</p><p>PALMER: There is.</p><p>QUEST: History.</p><p>PALMER: Yes, Marilyn Monroe. It's awesome. And guess what? It will still be awesome. It's going to be distributed differently.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Shelly Palmer, thank you.</p><p>We deliberately weren't talking with Shelly about Rupert Murdoch, because that's the focus now. Murdoch may never have imagined it would end like this. A picture with Bob Iger overlooking the London skyline is the final shot before the credits roll on this part of his career. He told Sky News, of which he owns 39 percent and is trying to buy the rest of it, but the deal came together relatively quickly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUPERT MURDOCH, EXECUTIVE CO-CHAIRMEN, 21ST CENTURY FOX: This started with Bob Iger, a friend of mine, sitting at my winery one evening, having a couple of glasses and just talking about our businesses and the industry generally. Forces of disruption were happening. And that was all. Then he rang me back a couple weeks later, and said let's have this conversation a bit more. And I said, that's only two months ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Murdoch is a classic newspaper man. Made his name in his homeland of Australia. Then, of course, in the United Kingdom with \"The Sun\" and \"The Times\" and \"News of the World.\" It wasn't until the 1980s when he got into movies. He bought 20th Century Fox -- as it was then -- from the oil baron, Marvin Davis. And then Fox broadcasting. Following on from that, he got into Sky, and Star TV. Controversy, everywhere. Triumphs. There were failed attempts to make the empire even bigger. Now he's come full circle. He's cutting back on the TV and the movies, and he's focusing on the papers. Stewart Purvis is the have a former executive of Independent Television News, known as ITN. Stewart joins me from London. The way in which Murdoch is dismantling the very empire that he built speaks volumes about the man, doesn't it? And his capacity to play this three-dimensional chess of media markets.</p><p>[16:10:00] STEWART PURVIS, FORMER CEO, ITN: Absolutely right, Richard. Here's a man who nearly 50 years ago got off a plane from Australia, bought an English Sunday newspaper, upset the British establishment, never really got on with the British establishment. But built businesses, bought more newspapers, bought TV. Even last year, he bought some commercial radio assets. Now he's actually doing a deal to become smaller. I mean, we're still in a bit of shock here. All the headlines about, you know, 21st Century Fox and Disney. I'm saying, the story is, Murdoch sells Sky. The platform he spent years and years developing. The platform he had been trying desperately for seven years to take complete ownership control of. And he's suddenly at the very moment maybe just weeks away from the moment when he could have had it all, he's decided he doesn't want it.</p><p>QUEST: Now I'm hearing two views. One is he didn't want to risk being found to be not a fit and proper person to own Sky. That's one view. The second view is that this is just a genius foresight in getting out of old school, or old style. But getting 25 percent of the new Disney with its streaming capability.</p><p>PURVIS: Well, it could be a bit of both. I mean, I personally always thought this deal was going to go through. And we'll find out, actually. Because it's still going through the processes whilst American regulators look at the Disney/Fox deal. So, you know, if he was put off by the kind of noise that's been around it, that's a little bit unusual for him. But there we are.</p><p>But on the other piece you mentioned, yes, absolutely right. I mean, he's basically telling us in this interview with Sky that actually he doesn't really think entertainment has a future on television. So, you know, you read from that that he's selling his television interests, which are in the entertainment area, so that he doesn't lose value on them. So, he's actually getting out as he would see it, at the best point in the market.</p><p>QUEST: In terms of Disney and how they will perform, Disney obviously, the movies are familiar. Disney has less of a footprint elsewhere within the international markets.</p><p>PURVIS: Yes. I mean, Disney has had a sort of inconsistent record in distribution. Sometimes it's been just a seller to networks. Sometimes it's had its own brand of networks. I mean, the point I think is relevant, this is about regulation. You take this deal here in Britain. Murdoch is having to go through a whole series of hoops to try to get control of what he wanted on this platform. But at the same time, the giants, the new digital giants are coming into countries like the U.K. throughout Europe, throughout Asia and actually setting up amid the danger to call them monopolies, but that's to many people what they are. So, to his point of view, he's being disadvantaged because he is seen as television.</p><p>QUEST: So, in terms of -- back to Rupert -- in terms of -- I mean, he's got the newspapers. People say he might fold the remaining news assets, particularly in the U.S., the Fox News, Fox Sports, Fox Business, into his newspapers, join them all up again. He's still a news man at heart.</p><p>PURVIS: That' what he says. Though he is curiously unemotional about letting go of Sky News and Sky Sports, the two things he says news and sports are the future. What I take from that, he likes Fox News and he likes Fox Sports and wants to develop those and who knows what he wants to do in the number of stations he can own in the states. So, yes, that's the story. There as you see a fit with a news corp., which is a news-led -- mostly newspaper group. So, he can bring those two together. Very interesting tonight, he was trying to make clear that actually there is -- there will be I think $2 billion cashflow from this news and sport TV business.</p><p>QUEST: Stewart, it's good to see you. Thank you, sir, for coming in tonight. Thank you.</p><p>To Wall Street, where Disney shares were the top performer in the Dow. As you can see, they were up 2.8 percent. When you wish upon a star, the shared price rises. Boeing was also good stock. The Dow closed in the red, and you can see why. Surrendering an all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 was also down. Paul La Monica. As you wish on a star, Amazon was up during the day. Netflix was up during the day. Never mind how they may have closed. But they are all -- Google. All the competitors to Disney's new streaming. You would have thought they would have been down.</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT: You would have thought that would be the case. But I think that investors realize that while Disney now is an even more formidable content company, people aren't going to all of a sudden decide, you know, I'm not going to watch \"Stranger Things\" on Netflix anymore, because I'm busy watching all of these shows on whatever Disney decides to name its streaming service, that is yet to come out. So obviously, there is room for content providers that consumers already love. And that's why Netflix and Amazon I think will be able to withstand this threat from Disney.</p><p>[16:15:00] QUEST: You've got to hand it to Rupert Murdoch. The ability to within two months for this -- or three months to sort of -- the leak that Disney's interested.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Get Comcast and others --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, Sony, Chatter into their briefly.</p><p>QUEST: Sniffing around. They drop out. Iger comes in. Who is the real genius here? Is it Iger or is it Murdoch, or both?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think we can safely say, Richard, that it is both. I mean, Murdoch throughout his history has been a bit of a renegade in the media industry, not afraid to make changes. And obviously, this is in some respects a cashing in of the chips. Even though let's not weep too many tears for Murdoch, because he obviously still has the \"Wall Street Journal,\" \"The New York Post,\" the news aspects of Fox, as well, on the cable side.</p><p>But for Bob Iger to be able now to have the rest of the Marvel family, \"X- Men,\" \"Fantastic Four,\" \"Dead Pool,\" and add that to the library that already has with all these other superheroes, then you throw on top of that Pixar and the Disney princesses and Lucas Films. \"Star Wars\" is coming out, I'm going to see it on Saturday, no spoilers, please. I mean, Iger has really made this company into a Hollywood juggernaut. The only problem is that everyone cares about ESPN on Wall Street.</p><p>QUEST: Right. One quick question, in the La Monica household, we use you as a barometer. What percentage is your streaming viewing versus your television viewing?</p><p>LA MONICA: It is -- I would say for my wife and I, maybe about 40 percent, and for the two kids, I would say maybe 80 percent, because they're more technologically savvy than their old folks/parents.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Used you as the barometer. Thank you.</p><p>As we continue tonight, and let's think about that for the La Monica household. They had better be careful. Net neutrality has gone. As we continue, the slow lane for some unless you're prepared to pay more to go faster.</p><p>QUEST: From the fast lane to the slow lane, the Federal Communications Commission in the United States has voted to repeal something known as net neutrality. The rules that basically say everybody is equal on the internet. It's a big win for broadband companies like Verizon and AT&amp;T, which is attempting to buy Time Warner, parent company of this network.</p><p>It's a major setback for consumers and tech companies, so some say. Outside the FCC building in Washington, there were demonstrators to protest against the ending of this net neutrality. Netflix has already promised legal action. Saying we're disappointed in the decision to gut protections that ushered inn unprecedented era of innovation.</p><p>[16:20:00] The rules have been controversial for years. Many internet users have struggled to understand them. So, let us explain net neutrality through the eyes of CNN Money, Jon Sarlin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON SARLIN, CNNMONEY PRODUCER: If the internet is a highway, vehicles or content providers, can't pay more to use a special fast lane. Think of it this way. All content is created equal in the eyes of the internet provider. That's the basic tenant behind net neutrality. So, if the internet is neutral, then the internet providers are treated basically like public utilities. Comcast or AT&amp;T, they couldn't slow down or speed up certain content like Netflix or Hulu. But if net neutrality ends, some companies are going to be stuck in that slow lane. And customers might stop using sites that never seem to load. The rules that made the net neutral were put in place during the Obama administration.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This set of principles, the idea of net neutrality has unleashed the power of the Internet and given innovators the chance to thrive.</p><p>SARLIN: But now things are going in a different direction. Ajit Pai is now the chairman of the FCC. He's a former lawyer for Verizon.</p><p>AJIT PAI, CHAIRMAN FCC: Entrepreneurs are constantly developing new technologies and services. But too often, they are unable to bring them to market for consumers, because outdated rules or regulatory inertia stabbed in the way.</p><p>SARLIN: To him, repealing net neutrality will lead to innovation that will get the government out of, quote, micro managing the internet. The internet providers will have more money. They'll then invest more in infrastructure and will have faster streaming. But while deregulation certainly has earned the praise of the telecommunications industry, on the other side of the coin, you have tech companies and consumer advocacy groups.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't want our internet to start looking like our television cable. We don't want to have tiered access. We don't want to have all the things that have really stifled innovation in other industries.</p><p>SARLIN: For those who want to keep net neutrality intact, it's a matter of Internet freedom. Repeal would mean that internet service providers can choose how affordable and fast certain content is. That is, there will be a slow lane and a fast lane. So, this summer, some big tech giants like Facebook, Google, Netflix, they participated in a day of action to advocate for net neutrality. But really, it's the small companies and the startups that have the most to lose if net neutrality ends. They don't have the deep pockets to pay the toll to access the faster lane. The open question now. Will repeal of net neutrality lead to innovation or to a traffic jam?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Mozilla is one of the companies, many companies that took a stand against the repeal of net neutrality. Mitchell Baker is Mozilla's founder and chairwoman, joins me from Austin, Texas. Good to see you ma'am. Thank you for taking time to speak to us this evening.</p><p>MITCHELL BAKER, CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRWOMAN, MOZILLA: Of course.</p><p>QUEST: Why don't you buy this argument that getting rid of net neutrality will spur innovation?</p><p>BAKER: Because losing net neutrality spurs the innovation that Verizon or the ISPs are interested in, and that meets their business practices and that works well for them. But it doesn't spur innovation that challenges them or is irrelevant or has new ideas that just don't make sense to Verizon. And we need that kind of innovation that is spread out and that all of us could actually attempt, because there's lots of new things to be invented and big problems to solve. And sending all that through Verizon's business planning and Verizon's decisions doesn't benefit any of us, except for the ISPs.</p><p>QUEST: I was listening to the chair of the FCC there, who says, you know, outdated regulations of a different era in a multifaceted environment, where people do have choice. You know, if you wish to switch. Now, I know it's t that easy in some parts of the U.S. to switch ISPs. But the goal here -- the FCC believes is that it will spur greater growth.</p><p>BAKER: Well, three of the five FCC commissioners believe that. So secondly, the idea that there is choice is very important. Because for many people, they are not. Something close to half of Americans don't actually have choice. And so, this idea that consumers are going to exercise choice or that the market works or that telling people how badly you're treating them is an answer, it just -- it's like a fantasy if you have no choice. And even if you have a second choice, if they're both bad, like how does that help us? Like, if you have got two companies and they're both treating you badly, well choices exist in theory, but it doesn't have any real meaning. And so that is a fundamental problem with the whole new system.</p><p>QUEST: One of the things that puzzles me in the administration's decision is that though a big company is on both sides. So, it's not as if it was a sort of one-way bet. Why do you think the administration decided, or the FCC chair decided to get rid of it?</p><p>[16:25:00] I mean, why do you think he favored the ISPs and the communications companies over the providers?</p><p>BAKER: Ah. Over the providers of web services or internet websites or apps that were familiar with.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>BAKER: This is an ongoing battle about when you pay, you know, where does the money that's generated by the internet go. And so, the telecommunication companies, which you know provide the access or sometimes it's called the pipes, are also interested in the revenue or money that the application providers or Google or Facebook are generating. And so, underlying this is a fight for those economics. And so, the size -- there are big companies on both sides. You also find the big companies from the internet side, you know, are engaged with smaller companies, as well. And so, it's not exactly a big company/small company piece. It's who actually has control over all of the content. And how many new players can get involved?</p><p>QUEST: Surprisingly, the rest of the world is watching. Thank you very much for joining us tonight from Austin. We appreciate it.</p><p>BAKER: My pleasure.</p><p>QUEST: Before making its decision, the FCC invited comments via its website. Millions of people responded. Well, it looked as if millions of people responded. Until you looked a bit closer. And then you discovered nefarious people using stolen identities. Luckily for us, Laurie Segall went to discover more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECH CORRESPONDENT: The Obama administration ramped through a massive scheme that gave the federal government broad regulatory control over the internet.</p><p>TERENCE GORDON: Not me. I did not submit that to the FCC.</p><p>SEGALL (voice-over): Yet posted under his current address, a paragraph long opinion on the highly contentious net neutrality vote. In his name.</p><p>GORDON: Not only was my right privacy compromised and breached, but so in a larger sense was the democratic process.</p><p>SEGALL: Terry Gordon is a retired director of network engineering in New York City and his identity has also been used to spout political beliefs.</p><p>It started earlier this year. The FCC called for public opinion on whether to end net neutrality. The regulations put into place in 2015 dictated that internet providers had to treat all content the same when it comes to speed. Ahead of the vote, the FCC called on the general public to leave their thoughts. And then something strange started happening.</p><p>ERIC T. SCHNEIDERMAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF NEW YORK: The internet is the public square of the 21st century. Unfortunately, the internet is also the crime scene of the 21st century.</p><p>SEGALL: Of more than 20 million comments made to the FCC, the attorney general's office and multiple independent studies say that millions of the submitted comments are fake. On both sides of the debate. The irony? Terry has worked in technology for decades and actually has some pretty strong views on the demise of net neutrality.</p><p>GORDON: Let's keep net neutrality laws so that everyone is on an even playing field.</p><p>SEGALL: A spokesperson for the FCC said that people whose identities were stolen should submit a complaint contesting the fraudulent comments. But the FCC isn't removing them. And was unable to provide CNN with any evidence that they looked into who was behind the millions of fraudulent remarks. For Chris Basco, whose mother's identity was also used to weigh in, it felt personal.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BASCO, SON OF MARGARET BASCO: My mother's name, it is Margaret Mary Basco. She sadly passed away on June 9th, 2017. There is no way she could have posted that comment.</p><p>SEGALL (on camera): How did you feel when you saw your mom's identity used for essentially a political opinion?</p><p>BASCO: It was when I saw the date. That's when I really got angry. How close in proximity it was to her death.</p><p>SEGALL (voice-over): Here's what Margaret thinks about net neutrality. According to the comment fraudulently made with her name. The unprecedented regulatory power the Obama administration imposed on the internet is smothering innovation.</p><p>BASCO: It was a little message, something she never did. I would probably have to explain what net neutrality was to her to begin with.</p><p>SEGALL: The FCC General Counsel said the commission didn't rely on any of the alleged corrupted comments to draft the document that was up for a vote.</p><p>BASCO: I feel that this was something that was in a system that at a moment's notice could be deployed anywhere for anything.</p><p>SEGALL: Increasingly, we're all at risk of this type of threat. More hacks mean more of our personal information is floating around for anyone to use.</p><p>GORDON: You can use very simple technology to influence people without knowledge of those that you are really impacting.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: That's Laurie Segall.</p><p>As we continue after the break, central banks in their decisions and women in economics. Diane Swonk will be joining us to tell us why there aren't more women in the world of economics. After of course, we have discussed what those Fed, Bank of England, ECB. What did they do? It's after the break.</p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. When Theresa May says she's disappointed as she heads into Brexit talks in Brussels. And the Simpsons are going to Disneyland with a whole new cast of characters at Disney's disposal.</p><p>As we continue, this is CNN. And on this network, the facts will always come first.</p><p>Here's been a deadly collision between a train and a school bus in the eastern Pyrenees region of Southwestern France. A CNN affiliate BFM TV says at least four people have died, and about a dozen have been injured. Emergency crews are looking for other survivors and retrieving injured.</p><p>President Vladimir Putin had some positive words for his U.S. counterpart during Putin's annual end of year news conference. He said Donald Trump has made some, quote, fairly serious achievements since taking office. He dismissed U.S. investigations into possible collusion, saying the issue was dreamt up by Mr. Trump's political opponents.</p><p>Six months after the deadly Brentford fire in London and the victims were remembered on Thursday at a memorial service. It was attended by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and members of the Royal family. The fire engulfed a residential tower, killed 71 people. An investigation is still ongoing.</p><p>Super Thursday for central banks. The BOE and the ECB kept rates on hold. Only one day after the Fed made its move. Diane Swonk joins me from Chicago. We should of course, put this into context. The Fed moved, the BOE did move at its last meeting. So, they're waiting to see what happens. Who knows when the ECB is next going to move?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, FOUNDER, DS ECONOMICS: That's exactly right. I do think it was interesting that the ECB, like the Fed, also saw stronger growth next year. We're talking about the strongest synchronized global growth in 2018 in probably a decade. I think that's very important. It's one of the things we're sort of seeing. The momentum from the end of 2018 is a high jumping off point for 2018. And this is global in scope. It also seems to be a global in scope phenomena is the lack of inflation for both the year - - both in Europe and in the U.S. and that missing on inflation, of course, even here in the U.S., we saw two dissents on the Fed's voting panel. And here in the U.S., when you vote to dissent, you're often voting for people who can't vote.</p><p>[16:35:00] And so, when Charlie Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed and the Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Fed voted in their last vote of the year, they're probably voting for other people. So that's a big issue that's facing both the U.S. and Europe right now.</p><p>QUEST: We have a moment or two more today. So, let us just grab this thistle on inflation. The lack of inflation after eight years of ultra- uber low interest rates, with unemployment down 4 percent in the U.S., similarly in the U.K. It is a conundrum. Do you believe the rules on inflation have changed?</p><p>SWONK: I don't believe the rules have changed, but I do think we constantly have to sort of look the shifting ground around us. Not only is there the Amazon effect and the, you know, flood of online and more comparative shopping that's going on. We also have -- and that's sort of a substitute for globalization. So, it's having the same effect that globalization perhaps had in the 1990s that was pushing down inflation. We don't have a lot of productivity growth. Which is not the phenomena that we had before. But what's interesting is even in Germany, where labor markets are much tighter than they are here, you're still not seeing that wage acceleration. And, of course, there's many different reasons for that. The unions in Germany actually opted for job security over wage increases. But these are real -- it is a bit of an issue going forward.</p><p>QUEST: We want to talk about women in the world of economics. Have a listen to Janet Yellen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: In terms of the kinds of research that's done in the field, I think also a greater diversity, more women and minorities may change the focus to some extent of the questions that people choose to look at and the analysis that they bring in, range of thinking that bears on research and all of that would be a healthy development.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Why do you think more women do not go into the world of economics and become economists? I mean, you know, obviously there are many. But not as many as --</p><p>SWONK: Not enough.</p><p>QUEST: Why is it?</p><p>SWONK: I was the only woman in my class, believe me. You know, it is -- they have done a lot of studies now. And we know it is one of the last bastions, really. To think it's harder to stay in economics as a woman than it is to stay in a STEM. research as an undergraduate, that really is sort of disappointing. And we know that women economists, when they're married and they're economists, or even if they're not married, when they put together research, they're not cited the same way as men.</p><p>There really is pretty systematic kinds of things we can look at to show that if you were to do more blind research out there, and not have the names attached or the sex of the person producing the research, would you have a different kind of citations, and different kinds of reflections from the group itself and economist itself. You remember, all of the men who are tenured professors in economics get to vote on who gets to join their club.</p><p>QUEST: Naked, raw sexism. Do you think that's what it is? At the end of the day, we have to understand, you know, why the next generation are not wanting too into the world of economics. One can put it to a certain extent, you say you're the only woman in your class. But if you look to the future, do you get the implication or the feeling that younger women do want a career in economics?</p><p>SWONK: Actually, you know, they do join economics, but they drop out more than other professions, as well. Which suggests, again, something systemic, in its not because of the rigor of the course. They're doing other things that are rigorous, as well. So that can't explain it alone. I do think also one of the things that I as an economist, one of the things you see by not having this diversity out there, you see a lot of research that originally said, you know, women don't stay in the labor force because they just want to opt out and have babies and opt on a mommy track, opt on these different tracks. That's just garbage.</p><p>Actually, what we know now is the choices women are given in the labor force are different than the choices that men are given, even in their first entry level job. And having been there myself, I can certainly attest to, it wasn't exactly fun. What's disappointing, is that it's still there. And, you know, it's hard for me to even change the name of chair of the Federal Reserve back to chairman, because I think it should be just chair. I'm going to call Chair Powell, he's a wonderful guy. I'm going to call him chair Powell. Because frankly, I don't want to lose the sense that a woman will once again be chair of the Federal Reserve. And I think we should start to think of these things as just a fact, rather than only firsts.</p><p>QUEST: You know, it's funny you talk about that. I had to mention his name on a broadcast the other day, and that's exactly what I was thinking. Do -- I instinctively went to say, meanwhile, chairman -- and I thought, nope. Diane, wonderful to see you. Thank you. Have a great holiday.</p><p>SWONK: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>[16:40:00] QUEST: As we continue tonight, as Theresa May is toughing it out in Brussels. The British Prime Minister is facing EU leaders a day after an embarrassing defeat in her own Parliament.</p><p>QUEST: The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, insists Brexit is on course, despite her government suffering a humiliating blow in Parliament. Theresa May is facing EU leaders in Brussels. Less than 24 hours after the defeat. Lawmakers will now get to vote on the final deal before Britain bows out, and the government won't be able to make any changes before the vote. The fears are holding up, putting pressure on Mrs. May as she heads into phase two of the talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I'm disappointed with the amendment. But actually, the EU withdrawal bill is making good progress through the House of Commons. And we are on course to deliver on Brexit, and remember last week, the President Juncker said that sufficient progress had been made to move on to phase two of our negotiations. Yesterday the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted to accept that recommendation too, and I'm looking forward to discussing that deep and special partnership for the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: CNN's Bianca Nobilo joins me from London. I mean, an element of schadenfreude from the other leaders. Weren't there? You know, ho, ho, ho, you got a bloody eye, a black eye in your own Parliament. But as you reminded me yesterday, all leaders come to this, knowing that they're only one stage themselves from problems with politics at home.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN WESTMINSTER: That's quite right. And, in fact, it's just expected in a democracy. In some EU leaders at the council today have actually come out in support of the Prime Minister, saying that. Saying this is just politics. And it's to be expected. The Prime Minister said the bill is making good progress. I suppose in relative terms, it is. And I hate to break it to you and the other viewers of the show, Richard. But this is just the committee stage. There's a report stage, there's a third reading, it's got to go through the House of Lords. This bill is going to look very different than it does now when it reaches the final stage, anyway.</p><p>QUEST: That said, let's move strictly then to phase two. And the difficulty of phase two. You know, the council is obviously going to approve it, bearing in mind the commission president and the council president are in favor. So, what should we look for, and how long do you think phase two, the trade part, the future relationship part will last?</p><p>NOBILO: The Prime Minister and the head of the EU Commission want to see a framework for that future relationship done by March. That is ambitious. This was already an incredibly tight timetable. And as David Davis, the Brexit secretary, said this morning, it's now even further compressed by this government defeat last night. I think compressed is putting it mildly, too. This is almost a Konstantina effect. They have very little time.</p><p>[16:45:00] But, of course, they can't start the trade discussions in earnest until after the U.K. has left the EU. And then when it's a third country, they can begin those discussions. But the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has been out speaking today, saying that Britain is hoping to strike a deal with Japan as soon as possible after Brexit. So, there is certainly an eye on that already from the U.K. side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: The point I would make to our Japanese friends, our partners, is that we intend to build a deep and special partnership. As Theresa May has said, with our friends and partners in the European Union. So that the U.K. remains the best place in this hemisphere to come and invest and develop your companies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: There's only one problem, Bianca. It was the Japanese earlier, immediately after the referendum late last year, they were the ones that took the highly unusual step of writing to the British government saying on behalf of Japanese companies they wanted clarity for the very large automakers and others that have invested in the U.K.</p><p>NOBILO: They did say that. In fact, the Japanese have actually been fairly outspoken on the Brexit process. I remember that the ambassador, the Japanese ambassador for the U.K., spoke to you, Richard, and offered officials to intervene and offer advice on the Brexit negotiations. They do want more clarity, but both the Japanese foreign minister and Boris Johnson said they were both confident that a mutual recognition of trade standards agreement could be struck to make market access easier. Very soon after Brexit. So that's really optimistic language from both of them. And very consistent with Boris' glorious vision for Brexit, which he has pushed the entire time as one of the leading Brexiteers in the U.K.</p><p>QUEST: Bianca, good to see you. Thank you. Keep watching, you've got a busy week ahead as stage 2 and phase 2 gets underway.</p><p>As we stay with Brexit, the former head of the WTO says he doesn't think any post Brexit relationship will be as good as the single market. I asked Pascal Lamy what's the best relationship that they can hope for?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PASCAL LAMY, FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL, WTO: I think the best is to keep trade open. Now, if the British do not want to remain in the customs union, they do not want to remain in the internal market, it's probably a sort of Canada/EU-like agreement. Which is way, way less open than the internal market. But I think it will take time. More time than expected. I don't think a minute something like this can be negotiated within a year, which is what it should be in order to be ratified by 2019. And, you know, we are in a process where the United Kingdom is slowly, very slowly, realizing that getting the egg out is not only painful, but it's also costly.</p><p>QUEST: How prepared are the Europeans, the EC side, to make the concessions necessary to get a status just underneath single market customs union? Granting that it can't be full, but a free trade, Canada-plus deal?</p><p>PASCAL: I think this is perfectly -- the EU will -- the red line of the EU is if you don't accept free circulation of people, you have to leave the internal market. That's it. And what the EU will say, is the moment U.K. becomes a third country, there needs to be a border with checks for origins of products, or with checks for regulation of services, for instance. But I think the EU, on this phase, are really, really very open-minded. What remains a very difficult issue is this Irish border, which basically has been fudged in the deal which was passed last week, and which remains a thorny issue, because of the politics and the economics of that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Luke Skywalker is from a distant galaxy. Homer Simpson is from Springfield. And Mickey Mouse spent time as Steamboat Willie. Now they all have one place to call home.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: When you wish upon a star and you bring the two together, what do you end up with? Disney's capture of Fox, creator of the deepest vaults of intellectual property in cinema and popular culture. Bringing the famous franchises all under one roof. And possibly under one streaming device. This is extraordinary. Take a look over here and you will see what's coming together. First of all, you've got X-Men, that will reunite with the Marvel cinematic universe, which Disney bought in 2009. Wolverine will share digs with the Avengers, all in the same Fox/Disney house. And then legendary series like \"The Simpsons\" will join franchises already in the Disney locker. \"Star Wars,\" which is still being milked with the \"The Last Jedi\" releasing today. And off-screen benefits, just oodles everywhere. \"Avatar,\" James Cameron's, \"Avatar,\" which owns outright, the highest- grossing movie of all-time. Only months after it opened, \"Avatar,\" a theme park of its animal kingdom, Pandora, in Florida. It doesn't get better than that. Frank Pallotta we need you, sir, to explain and help us understand that this is a true colossus being put together with regulatory concerns, perhaps.</p><p>FRANK PALLOTTA, CNNMONEY MEDIA REPORTER: Perhaps. Now imagine for a moment I offered you a streaming service that had \"Captain America\" Luke Skywalker, \"Moana,\" the Na'vi of \"Avatar.\" That would be something you would be interested in. You would pay maybe a lot of money for that streaming service. That is the name of the game here. Disney has for years had one of the biggest vaults of intellectual property with its animated movies, its Disney princesses, and now it's just getting even bigger than that.</p><p>QUEST: It's also got the studios. Which, of course, is the only part of horizontal integration between the two. Does it keep both the Disney studios and all the various affiliates of Disney studios and the 21st Century or the 20th Century Fox bit?</p><p>PALLOTTA: I think it definitely does. It's going to be interesting to see what kind of material they're going to be using from Fox. Fox has Fox Searchlight, which is very prestigious. Maybe even makes Disney an Oscar contender. It's always been this very family-friendly place. Maybe it starts making a little bit more of adult content. You look at something like Marvel Studios, you have a character like Dead Pool, who was an R- rated Marvel superhero. Maybe Bob Iger was saying maybe we'll even make R- rated Marvel movies going forward.</p><p>QUEST: In the same way that AT&amp;T's chief executive sort of made it clear when talking about buying Turner, Time Warner and CNN, we know what we're buying. We know what we've got. We're not buying CNN to destroy it or ruin it.</p><p>PALLOTTA: Right.</p><p>QUEST: Disney is not buying the racier assets of 21st Century Fox only to gut them.</p><p>[16:55:00] PALLOTTA: No, not at all. I would say the big ones that they are buying here is the Marvel characters. They're also buying \"The Simpsons,\" as you are saying. That's going to celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2019. And then you have \"Avatar\" that's going to have multiple, multiple sequels. Remember, \"Avatar\" it's the biggest movie ever made, $2.7 billion around the world when it was released.</p><p>QUEST: Netflix is the largest streaming service, but it is only one and who knows who will be there in five, ten years' time. Is Hulu the gateway through which this goes, or does Disney now continue with its Disney streaming service that it said it was going to start, or does it fold it all in?</p><p>PALLOTTA: I think they're going to have multiple services. You have to look at this almost like streaming is the new cable television. Disney for years had ESPN, Disney channel, ABC. Why did anyone always say, why don't we put all your stuff on ESPN? Because they diversify. Maybe we will see instead of a big six studios or multiple cable channels, maybe we'll see all these different streaming services and Disney will sell a package of ESPN and Marvel and Hulu and \"Star Wars\" and you'll have to buy it for a high price.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. I could talk more.</p><p>PALLOTTA: Good to see you.</p><p>QUEST: Profitable Moment after the break.</p><p>Tonight's Profitable Moment. The genius of Rupert Murdoch spotting the way and the trend of the industry. And not being afraid to dismantle an empire that's taken a lifetime to put together and still have 25 percent of the new media. Brilliant. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. Let's do it again tomorrow, please.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017121401cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5Y-9W91-DXH2-6007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 14, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;
