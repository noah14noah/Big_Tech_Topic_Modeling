Tech CEOs Promise Better Security</p><p>Some of the world's top tech executives gathered at the RSA Conference in San Francisco last week and promised to step up security on all computing platforms. </p><p>While it remains to be seen how effectively they'll carry out their promises, there was a palpable sense that business as usual won't work as governments wake up to the havoc caused by cyberattacks, data breaches, ransomware and misuse of social media sites. </p><p>\"If we don't take control of our destiny it's going to be controlled for us,\" said John Stewart, chief trust officer at CISCO, the maker of networking hardware and telecom equipment. Technology companies \"need to talk to governments and one another\" about how to improve the security of computers and devices, he said. </p><p>Read more from my story here.</p><p>2.

Thune and Walden also said they would explore online privacy legislation.</p><p>Lawmakers in both parties have encouraged the FTC to take a tough stance in evaluating whether there were consent-decree violations in connection with the unauthorized use of data from as many as 87 million Facebook users by campaign firm Cambridge Analytica, which conducted political profiling in the 2016 election.</p><p>Lawmakers on both sides have brushed aside <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>argument that the company fully complied with the consent accord. </p><p>Read Alan K. Ota's story here. </p><p>3. Facebook Steps up Lobbying </p><p>Facebook racked up its largest ever lobbying tab, $3.3 million, during the first quarter of the year, as the social media giant defended itself against widespread concerns over data privacy, fake news, and foreign interference in the 2016 elections.</p><p>The first quarter, which covers Jan. 1 to March 31, does not reflect spending from this month, when <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>came to Washington.</p><p><person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>relying on preparations from a team of in-house lobbyists and outside advisers from such firms as WilmerHale, was the sole witness at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on April 10 and at the House Energy and Commerce panel on April 11.   </p><p>CQ Reporter Kate Ackley has the details here.</p><p>4. U.K.'s Cyber Unit is a Top Bug Hunter, Microsoft Says</p><p>Last week, Microsoft released its latest quarterly report on the world's top researchers who hunt for bugs in the company's products and notify it before hackers can exploit the weaknesses. The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Center was named as one of the top five. </p><p>The recognition by Microsoft signals that the U.K. cyber unit is going beyond just passively warning British companies and users about security risks but is taking an active role in looking for vulnerabilities in commonly used software. Typically, such bug hunting is pursued by individual researchers and security firms. </p><p>Speaking on the last day of the RSA Conference, the security center's CEO, Ciaran Martin, said the U.K. has \"quite an ambitious plan to make internet safer.... Our success will be amplified if we can nurture the partnership with the United States.\"  </p><p>The joint U.S.-U.K. statement issued April 16 on Russian threats to infrastructure entities in both countries was the first time the two had teamed up on such a warning. </p><p>Last week, Great Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May hosted a summit of its allies including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand on coordinating cyber defense strategy, Martin said. </p><p>The British security center was set up in 2016 as a public arm of the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, the British signals intelligence and information assurance agency -- the equivalent of the National Security Agency in the United States. </p><p>The goal in setting up such an agency was to find ways to safely declassify and publish information on cybersecurity threats so companies and individuals can act on it, Martin said. A review by the U.K. government before it set up the unit found that just issuing warnings meant \"we scared people about cybersecurity and left them alone.\" </p><p>The security center has begun a new program to help U.K. government entities block access to harmful websites, Martin said. Users in about 165 such entities that participate have their computers linked to a special server that already has a list of known harmful sites. Any attempts to access those sites will be automatically blocked, Martin said. </p><p>5. Twitter Bans Ads by Kremlin-Linked Kaspersky</p><p>Last week Twitter banned ads by Kaspersky Lab, a Russia-based anti-virus and security company that is alleged to have close ties with the Kremlin. </p><p>Twitter said its ban was \"based on our determination that Kaspersky Lab operates using a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices,\" Reuters reported. </p><p>In September, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was \"concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks.\" </p><p>Those ties could \"compromise federal information and information systems, directly implicating U.S. national security,\" DHS said in warning all U.S. federal agencies to identify whether they used Kaspersky anti-virus software and remove them within 90 days. </p><p>Kaspersky has challenged the DHS decision in a lawsuit. </p><p>Speaking at the RSA Conference, Jeanette Manfra, the top cybersecurity official at DHS, said her department did not direct any U.S. company to punish Kaspersky. </p><p>Facebook in January said it was removing Kaspersky from a list of anti-virus products it recommends.</p><p>Twitter previously banned Russian media outlets including Sputnik and Russia Today -- both linked to the Kremlin -- after investigations showed that both promoted fake news on Twitter during the 2016 elections. </p><p>In an open letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Kaspersky founder Eugene Kaspersky said he was dumbfounded by the decision. \"One thing I can say for sure is this: We haven't violated any written -- or unwritten -- rules, and our business model is quite simply the same template business model that's used throughout the whole cybersecurity industry: We provide users with products and services, and they pay us for them,\" Kaspersky wrote.</p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

One of the significant issues debated today is whether patients should be given free and open access to their health records sitting today in EHR systems. A\u00a0 proposed ruling by the Dept of Health and Human Services (HHS), awaiting finalization, will hand over data access to patients who, in turn, can share it freely with anyone they choose. Further, the ruling warns of penalties for information-blocking and other restrictive practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proponents of granting access declare it to be a fundamental right for consumers. It enables, among other things, portability of medical information, long seen as a barrier to improved care, especially in life-threatening emergencies. Look deeper, and there are significant stakes involved in the battle for access to patient data. Firstly, the monetization of healthcare data is part of every health system and digital health startup's business model today, as I discussed in an earlier blog here titled The New Innovation Model - Monetizing Healthcare data.</p><p>Big tech firms have been mainly supportive of the proposed HHS ruling, having struggled for years with interoperability and information blocking that have led to unnecessary costs and have acted as barriers to the acceleration of digital health innovation. Access to the data enables technology firms such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft as well as digital health startups to mine the data for insights using advanced AI and machine learning algorithms. In turn, the insights are expected to drive improvements in care quality and better healthcare outcomes.</p><p>However, there are also dissenters from this point of view. For the past couple of months, the HHS has been in a stand-off with Epic, a dominant major electronic health record (EHR) systems provider over opening up access to patient data. Epic has threatened to sue to block the ruling, prompting regulators to denounce it as \"scare tactics.\"</p><p>Can consumers be trusted with their data?</p><p>Opponents of the idea that patients should have access to their data as a fundamental right contend that once patients have access to their data, they may harm themselves by having no control over where the data may end up. EHR provider Epic and their supporters among hospitals and health systems have argued for the HHS to delay the finalization of its proposed data-sharing rules on this basis. They argue that consumers, used to signing away data rights routinely when downloading apps on their smartphones, may find their data ending up in the wrong places. Besides, the data may be used in undesirable ways and may even be easily vulnerable to breach.</p><p>Part of Epic's reluctance to share data is purely commercial - as long-time stewards of patient data, they do not want to see tech firms and startups profiting off the data through free and open access. However, there is also a valid concern about the data falling into the wrong hands, especially without proper vetting of the entity gaining access to the records. Consider the case of Clearview, an unknown startup that has stealthily accumulated billions of images of individuals by scraping them off the internet. The company, a tiny operation that has built sophisticated facial recognition algorithms that law-enforcers across the country have been piloting for solving cold cases, had its entire client list stolen recently in a data breach.</p><p>How safe is patient medical information with tech firms?</p><p>When it comes to healthcare data, it's a wild west out there right now. After nearly two decades of harvesting consumers' digital exhaust, big technology companies ( who have been referred to as surveillance capitalists) have earned themselves billions in profits - and a \u00a0growing trust deficit among consumers. Healthcare data privacy is held to a higher standard through HIPAA information privacy rules; however, in the absence of any standardized rules around the use of consumer data in the app economy, \u00a0\"digital health\" companies are monetizing the data in ways consumers may not fully appreciate. It is indeed the only way for some digital health startups to turn a profit. Google's $2.1 Billion acquisition of Fitbit (still awaiting regulatory approvals) is in large part due to the fact that, in the words of Fitbit CEO James Park, \"ultimately Fitbit is going to be about the data.\"</p><p>The scrutiny around data-sharing agreements signed by several leading health systems with Google points to the growing unease with health systems sharing patient medical records, even though such practices have existed for a long time in technology partnerships. A report by Stat News, which studied a 2016 data-sharing agreement between Google and the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) obtained under a public information request, found adequate privacy protections to prevent unauthorized access, including restrictions on access to clinical notes and images.</p><p>Indeed, in a manner evoking imagery from classic Greek literature, Google asked to be \"lashed to a mast and blindfolded\" lest they are tempted by the sight of protected health information (PHI), much as Ulysses wished to be protected from being tempted by the sirens in the Odyssey. Despite the contractual safeguards, the notion of complete anonymization is in doubt after Google's own research revealed that the encryption of data, especially unstructured data, cannot be assumed to be 100% effective. The nuances of encryption and anonymization can be all but lost when making the case to a skeptical public about the privacy protections on their health records.</p><p>The challenges of regulating AI in healthcare</p><p>The battle over access to patient data is as much about patient rights as it is about the untold riches that can accrue from analyzing the data for insights that can deliver competitive advantages to tech firms and health systems alike. UCSF's data-sharing agreement provides the data free of charge to Google, implying that by itself, the data has no value whatsoever. The value lies ultimately in the insights generated through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms that can detect patterns, predict healthcare events, and enable targeted interventions for health systems looking to manage the health of their populations.</p><p>Tech firms with large consumer-oriented businesses can, for their part, enhance their understanding of consumers by cross-referencing their medical histories with other demographic data. The ability to cross-reference consumers further strengthens the algorithms for targeted advertising (though both health systems and tech firms alike have taken pains to point out that such use is explicitly prohibited in data sharing agreements).</p><p>Health systems that have taken the lead on using AI in improving healthcare outcomes are seeing significant benefits in clinical as well as administrative functions. AI-led approaches are prevalent in patient engagement, population health risk management, and revenue cycle operations. However, for more advanced applications, there remain questions around AI algorithms: How they work, what insights they reveal, and how the insights can support health care decisions.</p><p>AI algorithms are considered proprietary IP, and a source of competitive advantage by most firms. Hence, no two algorithms work the same way. There have been ongoing concerns about algorithmic bias from underlying datasets that are not representative of broader populations, prompting calls for more transparency in the use of AI tools.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been grappling with the issue of AI, especially in the context of medical devices where the risk of patient harm can be high. The ethics of AI, especially in facial recognition algorithms that have routinely delivered incorrect matches, in using them for employment or even healthcare decisions, has been yet another growing worry. Facebook's recent $ 550 M settlement against a class-action lawsuit, brought under the Illinois Biometric privacy law, is a sign of how sensitive the use of facial recognition technology can be.</p><p>The battle over data access rights and transparency in the use of AI algorithms is intensifying against big tech firms. As always, the European Union has taken a lead in this regard and is set to announce strict rules requiring tech firms to \"explain\" their AI models, with provisions to make tech firms \"reboot\" the models and learn from scratch with new datasets before rolling them out.</p><p>Nowhere is this more pertinent than in healthcare where lives are at stake. Healthcare apps that use AI algorithms on patient data must start getting more transparent about their terms of service, with provisions for notifying consumers and regulators whenever there are material changes to the terms as well as to AI algorithms.</p><p>It is perhaps also time to implement model agreements for patient data use, which hold all parties accessing the data to the same standards of disclosure and compliance. Finally, it may be time to compensate consumers for their healthcare data.</p><p>The market for selling personal data is nascent. However, some firms, such as IKEA, are looking at offering greater control to consumers over their\u00a0 data as a competitive differentiator. Regulators, tech firms, and healthcare providers must embrace the concept as passionately as they embrace the idea of granting unfettered access to patients to their data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOMAG-3530330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOMAG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBW-BT01-DY58-D358-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258373</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1581\"/><timeReceived>04:36 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 IDG Communications, Inc.

Inquisitors burned heretics. Nazi's burned books - before taking far more extreme measures. Soviets employed famines, gulags, salt mines and executions. </p><p>ChiComs and other tyrants starved, jailed and murdered millions. Today's Green New Dealers and their allies have mapped out their own totalitarian strategies. They proclaim themselves socialists, but their economic policies and tolerance for other viewpoints reflect a different form of government - fascism: A political system in which authoritarian government does not own businesses and industries, but strictly regulates and controls their actions, output and rights - while constraining and suppressing citizens and their thought, speech and access to information. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has 'no problem' with the fact that implementing her Green New Deal would require 'massive government intervention[1],' wealth redistribution on an unprecedented scale, and many trillions of dollars in new debt. GNDealers want to totally eliminate fossil fuel production and use, and control how much we can drive and fly, heat and cool our homes, eat meat, and live our lives. If retrofitting 29 million British homes to make them climate-friendly would cost $5.6 trillion[2] - remaking America's 125 million generally larger private homes would easily cost $25 trillion! Putting just five million electric cars on California roads would require 5 billion pounds[3] of lithium-ion batteries. Replacing fossil fuels that provide 82% of our energy and 100% of countless plastic and other products would require biofuels grown on tens of millions of acres. Replacing coal and gas-generated electricity with wind and solar would require millions of turbines and panels, on tens of millions more acres, billions of tons of rare earth and other metals, and hundreds of billions of pounds of lithium-ion batteries. China controls all those rare earth metals[4] and most of the lithium, cadmium and cobalt[5] needed for all that pseudo-renewable, pretend-sustainable energy. They are produced in China[6] and Africa[7], often with child labor and near-slave labor, and with virtually no health, safety or environmental safeguards. Meanwhile, Asian, African and EU nations are building or planning over 2,000 coal and gas-fired power plants. So even US elimination of fossil fuels would do absolutely nothing to reduce global CO2 levels. Moreover, citizens are likely to rise up in loud opposition to having millions of wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and biofuel plantations in their backyards and across scenic vistas and wildlife habitats. GNDealers don't want to talk about any of those ethical, social justice or environmental issues - or about the GIGO computer models and bald assertions of Climate Armageddon[8] that have no basis in real-world evidence[9]. They don't want anyone else talking about it, either. They want to control what we say and think, even what ideas and information we can find online and in print, television, radio and social media. They loath and fear ideas, facts and questions that challenge their views and political power. Free speech and access to other people's free speech is a clear and present danger to their perceived and asserted wisdom on fossil fuels, capitalism, manmade climate chaos, Western culture, and who should make policy decisions on energy, economics, jobs, living standards, religion, civil rights and other matters. Their version of 'free speech' thus includes - and demands - that their critics have no free speech. On college campuses, in 'mainstream' and social media, on search engines, in online information libraries, even in the arts, bakeries and K-12 education, thought control and electronic book burning are essential. Despite having a 12 to 1 ratio of liberal to conservative professors, leftist college faculty, administrators and students still ban, disinvite, disrupt and physically attack conservative speakers and their hosts. They harass Trump administration officials in restaurants - and 'dox' political opponents, revealing their names and home addresses, so that other radicals can harass, intimidate and attack them thereby 'persuading' others to stay silent. They assaulted North Korean escapees[10] for wearing MAGA hats. The Big Tech monopoly routinely implements electronic book-burning tactics. Google and other internet search engines[11] systematically employ liberal biases and secret algorithms to send climate realism articles[12] to intellectual Siberia and censor conservative thinking and discussion. GoogleYouTube[13] blocks access to Prager University (PragerU.com) videos that its censors decree offer 'objectionable content' on current events, history, constitutional principles, environmental policies and other topics. Google helps the Chinese government[14] deny its citizens access to 'dangerous ideas' - and says nothing when China sends a million Uighur Muslims to 'reeducation camps.' Its hard-left employees ostracize any conservatives they still find in their ranks and claim helping the US Defense Department with Cloud computing or artificial intelligence surveillance would 'violate their principles.' Facebook 'shadow banned' an ad[15] promoting a Heartland Institute video that called on millennials to reject socialism and embrace capitalism. Facebook censors told Heartland they 'don't support ads for your business model' (capitalism) and would not reveal 'red flags' and trade-secret algorithms they use to 'identify violations' of their policies and 'help preserve the integrity of our internal processes.' Google suppressed Claremont Institute ads[16] for a talk on multiculturalism and political speech restrictions. Twitter routinely engages in similar cold, calculated censorship of views it opposes. Wikipedia posts distorted or false bios[17] for climate realist experts and organizations - labeling me an anti-environment lobbyist - and then pops up ads soliciting money for its biased 'educational' material. Securing corrections is a long, often fruitless process. Even more totalitarian, the Southern Poverty Law Center[18] uses phony 'hate speech' claims to defund and 'deplatform' conservative groups like David Horowitz's Freedom Center[19], by pressuring credit card companies to close off donations to them. State attorneys general[20] and members of Congress[21] want to prosecute and jail people for 'denying the reality' of 'manmade climate cataclysms.' Worst of all, the callous organizations and policies that Big Tech supports cause millions of deaths every year[22], by denying impoverished nations and families access to the modern energy, insect control and agricultural technologies that its vocal, racist elements loathe. Creating conservative competitors or finding ways around these social media and fake info behemoths is vital, but would be stymied by their sheer size, wealth and dominance. Trust busting by the FTC, other federal agencies, Congress and the courts[23],  la Standard Oil Company, should certainly be considered. These cyber-giant social media and information platforms may be private companies, but they wield massive power, especially with younger generations that get almost all their information online. They are entirely dependent on the internet - which was created by US government agencies and taxpayers. ('You didn't build that,' President Obama might tell Google.) They have become essential, dominant public forums for discussing and evaluating public policies that increasingly affect our lives. A federal judge has ruled[24] that President Trump may not block hate-filled criticism from his Twitter account. Because it is a public forum, akin to a park or town square, for discussing important policy and personnel matters, it is protected by the First Amendment. Blocking unwanted tweets is therefore viewpoint discrimination, and Twitter is not beyond the reach of First Amendment public forum rules, she held. Her reasoning should not apply only to the President and his most obnoxious critics. The right of free speech and free assembly - to participate fully in debates over important political and public policy matters - is the foundation for the other rights and freedoms that enable our vibrant nation to function. Banning, censoring and deliberately falsifying certain viewpoints deprive major segments of our population and electorate of the right to speak, be heard, become informed, examine all sides of an issue, and live in harmony, peace and prosperity. Viewpoint censorship, bullying and silencing violates the basic rights of speakers, students, professors, voters and all people whose views an elite, intolerant, power-hungry few have deemed 'inappropriate' or 'hurtful' to the sensitivities of climate alarmist, pro-abortion, atheist and other liberal factions. It's time to take action, demand investigations, and rein in the monopolistic cyber censors.Self-Educated American Contributing Editor, Paul Driessen, is Senior Policy Advisor for Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow[25],author of 'Cracking Big Green', 'Eco-Imperialism: Green Power - Black Death', and several other recent books.

A former member of the Sierra Club and Zero Population Growth, he abandoned their cause when he recognized that the environmental movement had become intolerant in its views, inflexible in its demands, unwilling to recognize our tremendous strides in protecting the environment, and insensitive to the needs of billions of people who lack the food, electricity, safe water, healthcare and other basic necessities that we take for granted.

Inquisitors burned heretics. Nazi's burned books - before taking far more extreme measures. Soviets employed famines, gulags, salt mines and executions. </p><p>ChiComs and other tyrants starved, jailed and murdered millions. Today's Green New Dealers and their allies have mapped out their own totalitarian strategies. They proclaim themselves socialists, but their economic policies and tolerance for other viewpoints reflect a different form of government - fascism: A political system in which authoritarian government does not own businesses and industries, but strictly regulates and controls their actions, output and rights - while constraining and suppressing citizens and their thought, speech and access to information. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has 'no problem' with the fact that implementing her Green New Deal would require 'massive government intervention[1],' wealth redistribution on an unprecedented scale, and many trillions of dollars in new debt. GNDealers want to totally eliminate fossil fuel production and use, and control how much we can drive and fly, heat and cool our homes, eat meat, and live our lives. If retrofitting 29 million British homes to make them climate-friendly would cost $5.6 trillion[2] - remaking America's 125 million generally larger private homes would easily cost $25 trillion! Putting just five million electric cars on California roads would require 5 billion pounds[3] of lithium-ion batteries. Replacing fossil fuels that provide 82% of our energy and 100% of countless plastic and other products would require biofuels grown on tens of millions of acres. Replacing coal and gas-generated electricity with wind and solar would require millions of turbines and panels, on tens of millions more acres, billions of tons of rare earth and other metals, and hundreds of billions of pounds of lithium-ion batteries. China controls all those rare earth metals[4] and most of the lithium, cadmium and cobalt[5] needed for all that pseudo-renewable, pretend-sustainable energy. They are produced in China[6] and Africa[7], often with child labor and near-slave labor, and with virtually no health, safety or environmental safeguards. Meanwhile, Asian, African and EU nations are building or planning over 2,000 coal and gas-fired power plants. So even US elimination of fossil fuels would do absolutely nothing to reduce global CO2 levels. Moreover, citizens are likely to rise up in loud opposition to having millions of wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and biofuel plantations in their backyards and across scenic vistas and wildlife habitats. GNDealers don't want to talk about any of those ethical, social justice or environmental issues - or about the GIGO computer models and bald assertions of Climate Armageddon[8] that have no basis in real-world evidence[9]. They don't want anyone else talking about it, either. They want to control what we say and think, even what ideas and information we can find online and in print, television, radio and social media. They loathe and fear ideas, facts and questions that challenge their views and political power. Free speech and access to other people's free speech is a clear and present danger to their perceived and asserted wisdom on fossil fuels, capitalism, manmade climate chaos, Western culture, and who should make policy decisions on energy, economics, jobs, living standards, religion, civil rights and other matters. Their version of 'free speech' thus includes - and demands - that their critics have no free speech. On college campuses, in 'mainstream' and social media, on search engines, in online information libraries, even in the arts, bakeries and K-12 education, thought control and electronic book burning are essential. Despite having a 12 to 1 ratio of liberal to conservative professors, leftist college faculty, administrators and students still ban, disinvite, disrupt and physically attack conservative speakers and their hosts. They harass Trump administration officials in restaurants - and 'dox' political opponents, revealing their names and home addresses, so that other radicals can harass, intimidate and attack them thereby 'persuading' others to stay silent. They assaulted North Korean escapees[10] for wearing MAGA hats. The Big Tech monopoly routinely implements electronic book-burning tactics. Google and other internet search engines[11] systematically employ liberal biases and secret algorithms to send climate realism articles[12] to intellectual Siberia and censor conservative thinking and discussion. GoogleYouTube[13] blocks access to Prager University (PragerU.com) videos that its censors decree offer 'objectionable content' on current events, history, constitutional principles, environmental policies and other topics. Google helps the Chinese government[14] deny its citizens access to 'dangerous ideas' - and says nothing when China sends a million Uighur Muslims to 'reeducation camps.' Its hard-left employees ostracize any conservatives they still find in their ranks and claim helping the US Defense Department with Cloud computing or artificial intelligence surveillance would 'violate their principles.' Facebook 'shadow banned' an ad[15] promoting a Heartland Institute video that called on millennials to reject socialism and embrace capitalism. Facebook censors told Heartland they 'don't support ads for your business model' (capitalism) and would not reveal 'red flags' and trade-secret algorithms they use to 'identify violations' of their policies and 'help preserve the integrity of our internal processes.' Google suppressed Claremont Institute ads[16] for a talk on multiculturalism and political speech restrictions. Twitter routinely engages in similar cold, calculated censorship of views it opposes. Wikipedia posts distorted or false bios[17] for climate realist experts and organizations - labeling me an anti-environment lobbyist - and then pops up ads soliciting money for its biased 'educational' material. Securing corrections is a long, often fruitless process. Even more totalitarian, the Southern Poverty Law Center[18] uses phony 'hate speech' claims to defund and 'deplatform' conservative groups like David Horowitz's Freedom Center[19], by pressuring credit card companies to close off donations to them. State attorneys general[20] and members of Congress[21] want to prosecute and jail people for 'denying the reality' of 'manmade climate cataclysms.' Worst of all, the callous organizations and policies that Big Tech supports cause millions of deaths every year[22], by denying impoverished nations and families access to the modern energy, insect control and agricultural technologies that its vocal, racist elements loathe. Creating conservative competitors or finding ways around these social media and fake info behemoths is vital, but would be stymied by their sheer size, wealth and dominance. Trust busting by the FTC, other federal agencies, Congress and the courts[23],  la Standard Oil Company, should certainly be considered. These cyber-giant social media and information platforms may be private companies, but they wield massive power, especially with younger generations that get almost all their information online. They are entirely dependent on the internet - which was created by US government agencies and taxpayers. ('You didn't build that,' President Obama might tell Google.) They have become essential, dominant public forums for discussing and evaluating public policies that increasingly affect our lives. A federal judge has ruled[24] that President Trump may not block hate-filled criticism from his Twitter account. Because it is a public forum, akin to a park or town square, for discussing important policy and personnel matters, it is protected by the First Amendment. Blocking unwanted tweets is therefore viewpoint discrimination, and Twitter is not beyond the reach of First Amendment public forum rules, she held. Her reasoning should not apply only to the President and his most obnoxious critics. The right of free speech and free assembly - to participate fully in debates over important political and public policy matters - is the foundation for the other rights and freedoms that enable our vibrant nation to function. Banning, censoring and deliberately falsifying certain viewpoints deprive major segments of our population and electorate of the right to speak, be heard, become informed, examine all sides of an issue, and live in harmony, peace and prosperity. Viewpoint censorship, bullying and silencing violates the basic rights of speakers, students, professors, voters and all people whose views an elite, intolerant, power-hungry few have deemed 'inappropriate' or 'hurtful' to the sensitivities of climate alarmist, pro-abortion, atheist and other liberal factions. It's time to take action, demand investigations, and rein in the monopolistic cyber censors. Paul Driessen[25] is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)[26].

Inquisitors burned heretics. Nazi's burned books \u2013 before taking far more extreme measures. Soviets employed famines, gulags, salt mines and executions. ChiComs and other tyrants starved, jailed and murdered millions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today's Green New Dealers and their allies have mapped out their own totalitarian strategies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They proclaim themselves socialists, but their economic policies and tolerance for other viewpoints reflect a different form of government \u2013 fascism: A political system in which authoritarian government does not own businesses and industries, but strictly regulates and controls their actions, output and rights \u2013 while constraining and suppressing citizens and their thought, speech and access to information.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has \"no problem\" with the fact that implementing her Green New Deal would require \"massive government intervention,\" wealth redistribution on an unprecedented scale, and many trillions of dollars in new debt. GNDealers want to totally eliminate fossil fuel production and use, and control how much we can drive and fly, heat and cool our homes, eat meat, and live our lives.</p><p>If retrofitting 29 million British homes to make them climate-friendly would cost $5.6 trillion \u2013 remaking America's 125 million generally larger private homes would easily cost $25 trillion! Putting just five million electric cars on California roads would require 5 billion pounds of lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>Replacing fossil fuels that provide 82% of our energy and 100% of countless plastic and other products would require biofuels grown on tens of millions of acres. Replacing coal and gas-generated electricity with wind and solar would require millions of turbines and panels, on tens of millions more acres, billions of tons of rare earth and other metals, and hundreds of billions of pounds of lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>China controls all those rare earth metals and most of the lithium, cadmium and cobalt needed for all that pseudo-renewable, pretend-sustainable energy. They are produced in China and Africa, often with child labor and near-slave labor, and with virtually no health, safety or environmental safeguards.</p><p>Meanwhile, Asian, African and EU nations are building or planning over 2,000 coal and gas-fired power plants. So even US elimination of fossil fuels would do absolutely nothing to reduce global CO2 levels. Moreover, citizens are likely to rise up in loud opposition to having millions of wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and biofuel plantations in their backyards and across scenic vistas and wildlife habitats.</p><p>GNDealers don't want to talk about any of those ethical, social justice or environmental issues \u2013 or about the GIGO computer models and bald assertions of Climate Armageddon that have no basis in real-world evidence. They don't want anyone else talking about it, either. They want to control what we say and think, even what ideas and information we can find online and in print, television, radio and social media.</p><p>They loath and fear ideas, facts and questions that challenge their views and political power. Free speech and access to other people's free speech is a clear and present danger to their perceived and asserted wisdom on fossil fuels, capitalism, manmade climate chaos, Western culture, and who should make policy decisions on energy, economics, jobs, living standards, religion, civil rights and other matters.</p><p>Their version of \"free speech\" thus includes \u2013 and demands \u2013 that their critics have no free speech. On college campuses, in \"mainstream\" and social media, on search engines, in online information libraries, even in the arts, bakeries and K-12 education, thought control and electronic book burning are essential. Despite having a 12 to 1 ratio of liberal to conservative professors, leftist college faculty, administrators and students still ban, disinvite, disrupt and physically attack conservative speakers and their hosts.</p><p>They harass Trump administration officials in restaurants \u2013 and \"dox\" political opponents, revealing their names and home addresses, so that other radicals can harass, intimidate and attack them \u2026 thereby \"persuading\" others to stay silent. They assaulted North Korean escapees for wearing MAGA hats.</p><p>The Big Tech monopoly routinely implements electronic book-burning tactics. Google and other internet search engines systematically employ liberal biases and secret algorithms to send climate realism articles to intellectual Siberia and censor conservative thinking and discussion. GoogleYouTube blocks access to Prager University (PragerU.com) videos that its censors decree offer \"objectionable content\" on current events, history, constitutional principles, environmental policies and other topics.</p><p>Google helps the Chinese government deny its citizens access to \"dangerous ideas\" \u2013 and says nothing when China sends a million Uighur Muslims to \"reeducation camps.\" Its hard-left employees ostracize any conservatives they still find in their ranks \u2026 and claim helping the US Defense Department with Cloud computing or artificial intelligence surveillance would \"violate their principles.\"</p><p>Facebook \"shadow banned\" an ad promoting a Heartland Institute video that called on millennials to reject socialism and embrace capitalism. Facebook censors told Heartland they \"don't support ads for your business model\" (capitalism) and would not reveal \"red flags\" and trade-secret algorithms they use to \"identify violations\" of their policies and \"help preserve the integrity of our internal processes.\" Google suppressed Claremont Institute ads for a talk on multiculturalism and political speech restrictions.</p><p>Twitter routinely engages in similar cold, calculated censorship of views it opposes.</p><p>Wikipedia posts distorted or false bios for climate realist experts and organizations \u2013 labeling me an anti-environment lobbyist \u2013 and then pops up ads soliciting money for its biased \"educational\" material. Securing corrections is a long, often fruitless process. Even more totalitarian, the Southern Poverty Law Center uses phony \"hate speech\" claims to defund and \"deplatform\" conservative groups like David Horowitz's Freedom Center, by pressuring credit card companies to close off donations to them.<br/><br/>State attorneys general and members of Congress want to prosecute and jail people for \"denying the reality\" of \"manmade climate cataclysms.\"</p><p>Worst of all, the callous organizations and policies that Big Tech supports cause millions of deaths every year, by denying impoverished nations and families access to the modern energy, insect control and agricultural technologies that its vocal, racist elements loathe.</p><p>Creating conservative competitors or finding ways around these social media and fake info behemoths is vital, but would be stymied by their sheer size, wealth and dominance. Trust busting by the FTC, other federal agencies, Congress and the courts, \u00e1 la Standard Oil Company, should certainly be considered.</p><p>These cyber-giant social media and information platforms may be private companies, but they wield massive power, especially with younger generations that get almost all their information online. They are entirely dependent on the internet \u2013 which was created by US government agencies and taxpayers. (\"You didn't build that,\" President Obama might tell Google.) They have become essential, dominant public forums for discussing and evaluating public policies that increasingly affect our lives.</p><p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump may not block hate-filled criticism from his Twitter account. Because it is a public forum, akin to a park or town square, for discussing important policy and personnel matters, it is protected by the First Amendment. Blocking unwanted tweets is therefore viewpoint discrimination, and Twitter is not beyond the reach of First Amendment public forum rules, she held. Her reasoning should not apply only to the President and his most obnoxious critics.</p><p>The right of free speech and free assembly \u2013 to participate fully in debates over important political and public policy matters \u2013 is the foundation for the other rights and freedoms that enable our vibrant nation to function. Banning, censoring and deliberately falsifying certain viewpoints deprive major segments of our population and electorate of the right to speak, be heard, become informed, examine all sides of an issue, and live in harmony, peace and prosperity.</p><p>Viewpoint censorship, bullying and silencing violates the basic rights of speakers, students, professors, voters and all people whose views an elite, intolerant, power-hungry few have deemed \"inappropriate\" or \"hurtful\" to the sensitivities of climate alarmist, pro-abortion, atheist and other liberal factions.</p><p>It's time to take action, demand investigations, and rein in the monopolistic cyber censors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-144467208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W41-8C41-JDJN-63D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1483\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

They want to control what we say and think, even what ideas and information we can find online and in print, television, radio and social media.</p><p>They loath and fear ideas, facts and questions that challenge their views and political power. Free speech and access to other people's free speech is a clear and present danger to their perceived and asserted wisdom on fossil fuels, capitalism, manmade climate chaos, Western culture, and who should make policy decisions on energy, economics, jobs, living standards, religion, civil rights and other matters.</p><p>Their version of \"free speech\" thus includes \u2013 and demands \u2013 that their critics have no free speech. On college campuses, in \"mainstream\" and social media, on search engines, in online information libraries, even in the arts, bakeries and K-12 education, thought control and electronic book burning are essential. Despite having a 12 to 1 ratio of liberal to conservative professors, leftist college faculty, administrators and students still ban, disinvite, disrupt and physically attack conservative speakers and their hosts.</p><p>They harass Trump administration officials in restaurants \u2013 and \"dox\" political opponents, revealing their names and home addresses, so that other radicals can harass, intimidate and attack them \u2026 thereby \"persuading\" others to stay silent. They assaulted North Korean escapees for wearing MAGA hats.</p><p>The Big Tech monopoly routinely implements electronic book-burning tactics. Google and other internet search engines systematically employ liberal biases and secret algorithms to send climate realism articles to intellectual Siberia and censor conservative thinking and discussion. GoogleYouTube blocks access to Prager University (PragerU.com) videos that its censors decree offer \"objectionable content\" on current events, history, constitutional principles, environmental policies and other topics.</p><p>Google helps the Chinese government deny its citizens access to \"dangerous ideas\" \u2013 and says nothing when China sends a million Uighur Muslims to \"reeducation camps.\" Its hard-left employees ostracize any conservatives they still find in their ranks \u2026 and claim helping the US Defense Department with Cloud computing or artificial intelligence surveillance would \"violate their principles.\"</p><p>Facebook \"shadow banned\" an ad promoting a Heartland Institute video that called on millennials to reject socialism and embrace capitalism. Facebook censors told Heartland they \"don't support ads for your business model\" (capitalism) and would not reveal \"red flags\" and trade-secret algorithms they use to \"identify violations\" of their policies and \"help preserve the integrity of our internal processes.\" Google suppressed Claremont Institute ads for a talk on multiculturalism and political speech restrictions.</p><p>Twitter routinely engages in similar cold, calculated censorship of views it opposes.</p><p>Wikipedia posts distorted or false bios for climate realist experts and organizations \u2013 labeling me an anti-environment lobbyist \u2013 and then pops up ads soliciting money for its biased \"educational\" material. Securing corrections is a long, often fruitless process. Even more totalitarian, the Southern Poverty Law Center uses phony \"hate speech\" claims to defund and \"deplatform\" conservative groups like David Horowitz's Freedom Center, by pressuring credit card companies to close off donations to them. <br/>State attorneys general and members of Congress want to prosecute and jail people for \"denying the reality\" of \"manmade climate cataclysms.\"</p><p>Worst of all, the callous organizations and policies that Big Tech supports cause millions of deaths every year, by denying impoverished nations and families access to the modern energy, insect control and agricultural technologies that its vocal, racist elements loathe.</p><p>Creating conservative competitors or finding ways around these social media and fake info behemoths is vital, but would be stymied by their sheer size, wealth and dominance. Trust busting by the FTC, other federal agencies, Congress and the courts, \u00e1 la Standard Oil Company, should certainly be considered.</p><p>These cyber-giant social media and information platforms may be private companies, but they wield massive power, especially with younger generations that get almost all their information online. They are entirely dependent on the internet \u2013 which was created by US government agencies and taxpayers. (\"You didn't build that,\" President Obama might tell Google.) They have become essential, dominant public forums for discussing and evaluating public policies that increasingly affect our lives.</p><p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump may not block hate-filled criticism from his Twitter account. Because it is a public forum, akin to a park or town square, for discussing important policy and personnel matters, it is protected by the First Amendment. Blocking unwanted tweets is therefore viewpoint discrimination, and Twitter is not beyond the reach of First Amendment public forum rules, she held. Her reasoning should not apply only to the President and his most obnoxious critics.</p><p>The right of free speech and free assembly \u2013 to participate fully in debates over important political and public policy matters \u2013 is the foundation for the other rights and freedoms that enable our vibrant nation to function. Banning, censoring and deliberately falsifying certain viewpoints deprive major segments of our population and electorate of the right to speak, be heard, become informed, examine all sides of an issue, and live in harmony, peace and prosperity.</p><p>Viewpoint censorship, bullying and silencing violates the basic rights of speakers, students, professors, voters and all people whose views an elite, intolerant, power-hungry few have deemed \"inappropriate\" or \"hurtful\" to the sensitivities of climate alarmist, pro-abortion, atheist and other liberal factions.</p><p>It's time to take action, demand investigations, and rein in the monopolistic cyber censors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-144462259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W41-8C41-JDJN-63JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1480\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 15, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Trade Secrets Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkE5RkIzRDg2MDIzNDY1Mjg0OURCRDlFNTQ3NkE0NDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTJFQzA3NTlEMzAyNDg1MThEMjQ2RkJDN0VDQjE0RDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkE5RkIzRDg2MDIzNDY1Mjg0OURCRDlFNTQ3NkE0NDA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000695</classCode><className>FAMINE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001588</classCode><className>SOCIAL JUSTICE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKC8</classCode><className>DICTATORSHIPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

You consult Google, where you find copious information about using compression bandages to stabilize your sprain. But you'd like some back and forth with someone who has experience. You post about your injury on Facebook, triggering a real-time conversation with volunteer first responders offering pro tips.</p><p>You then pop over to Amazon, because the nearest drug store is more than 16 miles away and you don't want to drive with a sprained right ankle. You've got too much debt riding on your credit card to add to it blithely, but no problem--you use PayPal to get a bandage delivered to you that same day. And if your sprain leads to hard-to-handle bills, you can put out a call for help using GoFundMe.</p><p>A totally banal incident, and unimaginable at every step just two decades ago. Our abilities to learn, discuss, buy, receive, and give have changed magnificently for the better because of the behemoth internet companies on which every step of that dull anecdote hinges.</p><p>Noam Cohen, author of The Know-It-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball, spent years covering the tech industry for The New York Times. His book is, in large part, a compact history of such companies, their founders, and the ideas that animated them. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, and Peter Thiel of PayPal all get their own chapters.</p><p>The analogy Cohen thinks best explains those companies--the analogy that starts his book and shapes his perspective--is the hoary old Damon Knight short story \"To Serve Man,\" as adapted on The Twilight Zone. You know, the one where technologically superior aliens fool us into thinking they're helping us when they actually intend to eat us. (\"It's a cookbook!\")</p><p>Cohen is a deft storyteller, and The Know-It-Alls reveals a lot of fascinating information about the business and technological contingencies that led his characters to their prominence. But as the book's title implies, Cohen thinks Silicon Valley visionaries have a hubristic sense that they know what's good for everyone else and are out to impose that vision on us. Yet their successes, as Cohen's own narrative shows, came from offering services that were eagerly and freely embraced by millions and that have constantly adjusted to keep audiences satisfied.</p><p>Although Cohen's policy prescriptions are thin and under-argued--and fortunately don't often mar his storytelling--they show far more signs of the know-it-all. Cohen laments what has largely been a free cultural choice to embrace these online services, and he prefers an (ill-explained) European model that gives the government more control over how people are allowed to use the internet.</p><p>AND THEN THERE'S his subtitle: The Rise of Silicon Valley asa Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball. Where is the evidence for that power, that wreckage? Not in this book.</p><p>Cohen claims his characters are pushing us toward \"a society in which personal freedoms are near absolute and government regulations wither away.\" But while he finds some evidence of libertarian leanings among some of his subjects/villains, there is little evidence here that they have done anything in electoral politics to shift America in that direction. Indeed, with the exception of Peter Thiel's leap onto the Trump train, he shows none of them publicly working against even the Democratic Party's agenda. Silicon Valley may be in some respects a \"political powerhouse,\" but it's not one dragging us toward \"absolute freedom\"--more's the pity. (He does call Amazon's Jeff Bezos to task for having donated to Reason Foundation, which publishes this magazine.)</p><p>Cohen writes that in the internet world, \"taxes are in effect replaced by monopoly profits--everyone pays their share to Google, Facebook, Amazon, and PayPal.\" Yet for three of those companies, users need pay nothing toward this profit. And the fourth case, Amazon, dominates by offering the lowest conceivable prices and better customer service than its competitors.</p><p>When it comes to the \"social wrecking ball\" part, Cohen tosses out crumbs of accusatory social critique. \"After so much Internet-based 'disruption,'\" he writes, America \"lack[s] the stabilizing influences of traditional news-gathering organizations and community groups, vibrant local businesses, strong labor unions, aggressive government regulations, and engaged political parties.\"</p><p>Those costs, and their connection to internet disruption, are casually asserted, not demonstrated. Only one--the damage to traditional news media--seems reasonable to blame on the web. What aggressive government regulations he thinks have disappeared, much less why it's the internet's fault, is never specified. As for the effect on local businesses and unions, online commerce still accounts for less than 9 percent of U.S. retail sales.</p><p>Cohen holds the internet and its ideological pioneers responsible for one social ill in particular: He indicts the early computer scientist John McCarthy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford for McCarthy's role in leading \"the fight against censorship of the Internet.\" Yes, Cohen thinks that's the foundational sin of the internet era.</p><p>Cohen believes it wrong to wave the flag of free speech to defend people's right to say things online that others might find offensive or hurtful. He disapproves, for example, of McCarthy's role in a mini--culture war over Stanford's attempt to cut off campus access to a UseNet humor group. The dispute involved, in Cohen's words, \"a dumb joke about a cheap Jew and a cheap Scotsman.\" McCarthy was appalled by the censorship effort in 1989, writing that \"newsgroups are a new communication medium just as printed books were in the 15th century...Setting up an index of prohibited newsgroups is in the same tradition as the Pope's 15th century Index Liber Prohibitorium.\"</p><p>Centuries of Western political and moral philosophy regarding the right to think and speak freely as a political and moral good--indeed, as a core part of human selfhood--is nothing more to Cohen than an excuse for cruelty. This was especially so in the late-'80s context of campus debates over multi-culturalism and its attendant \"racial tensions.\" Cohen doesn't hem or haw a moment in declaring that unrestricted internet chat that offends certain people shouldn't be allowed. The precise mechanisms by which he'd like to enforce such strictures on offensive expression are not described.</p><p>THE ROGUES' GALLERY in this book isn't limited to internet industrialists. Cohen sees two overriding problems with the internet age--\"hacker's arrogance and...entrepreneur's greed.\" He traces the first back to McCarthy, whom he criticizes for inculcating the pernicious hacker mentality whose \"individualistic, anti-authoritarian ideas would... spread across the globe,\" and the second to Frederick Terman, a former provost of Stanford. Terman is charged with forging an objectionable alliance between academic computer science and for-profit business, which led to the crisis of Zuckerberg, Brin, Page, and Bezos becoming enormously wealthy.</p><p>Cohen's brickbats frequently rely more on personal pique than social critique. Often he tells stories with blithe assurance that readers will get the point, not bothering to explain what's allegedly objectionable about his subjects' behavior. He sides, for instance, with those who prevented Mark Zuckerberg from providing free access to a limited version of the internet (including Facebook, of course) to millions in India. Such a move is problematic because, well, why should Zuckerberg be able to fool India's unwired poor with the idea that \"Facebook and the Internet are one and the same\"?

Not really supportive of the freedom to assemble, or to express yourself.\" But instead of an outright ban or moratorium, which would require member state backing, Vestager told reporters in Brussels she would recommend that authorities and companies use caution. </p><p>\"What we will say in the paper in a very lawyered up language is, let's pause and figure out if there are any... circumstances where facial recognition remotely should be authorised,\" she told reporters.\"Because if we do not pause, then it will... just be everywhere,\" she warned comparing it to the sudden rise of CCTV security in city centres.Describing the spread of cameras, she said: \"First you put up one, but then it has a blind angle and then you put up the other one... All of a sudden you have cameras everywhere.\"Caution is also needed because the uses of facial recognition are wide-ranging -- from unlocking smartphones to capturing criminals -- and often inaccurate and in need of development. The EU Commission's digital policy chief Margrethe Vestager compares facial recognition technology to the rise of CCTV security in city centres Photo: AFP / Tolga AKMEN The former Danish finance minister, who is also in charge of enforcing EU competition rules, underlined that AI was a vast subject and that any regulation should be mindful of not punishing smaller innovators, which would only benefit major players.Big tech firms familiar to everyday users -- such as Facebook or Tencent -- are mainly from the United States or China. Europe meanwhile is seen as a leader on regulation, notably with rules on data privacy that have been widely replicated elsewhere.But with AI, Vestager said Europe wanted to be a player and not just a sheriff.And if Europe is to develop tech giants, it will probably be in business services and network infrastructure, and not mass market sites or social media.\"If you want to have a say about things that we consider risky then you should be able to do it yourself,\" she said.Europe wants to be \"sovereign\" on AI and protect \"the integrity of our grids, of our infrastructure of our research,\" she said.But this was not against anyone, she insisted, amid talk of a high tech cold war between the US and China with Europe caught in the middle.\"It's about us, what we would like to be able to do.\"Other proposals on Wednesday will include a push to make data centres more energy-efficient and be carbon neutral by 2030.The EU will also offer a voluntary labelling scheme for companies that abide by EU rules and values on AI.\"We don't want to regulate anything that starts with A and ends with an I. That doesn't make any sense,\" Vestager said. \"But where there is risk, it will be for real.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767158195434897275776100196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7C-6YF1-JCMN-Y1Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"643\"/><timeReceived>3:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That's thanks in large part to Facebook's planned Libra cryptocurrency, a global payments network that lawmakers and regulators around the world see as a threat to the financial system's order.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Libra bust this way out into the open,\" said Karen Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics who advises executives on coming policy shifts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it's not just Facebook. The discussions are also taking on urgency as other countries consider creating their own digital currencies - another potential challenge to the primacy of the U.S. dollar. The head of the Bank of England has floated the idea that central banks could create a network of digital currencies to replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency.</p><p>Those discussions will land on the Fed's doorstep this week as the world's top financial policymakers gather in Washington for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p><p>Libra has forced the Fed to consider the issue because of a fear that private companies could establish their own currencies and take control over the global payments system. Some Fed officials share the concern about a new balkanized currency system outside government control that Facebook has threatened to unleash.</p><p>Even if Libra fails because of Facebook's political baggage - the blowback from lawmakers and regulators has been so fierce that the association tasked with running the cryptocurrency has lost a quarter of its initial members - central bankers worry that another major company could enter the space. If the Fed doesn't establish a digital currency, who will?</p><p>The flurry of recent moves by Facebook and the Fed's international counterparts has prompted members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to ask the U.S. central bank to lay out its options.</p><p>\"None of us know precisely how the digital world will evolve,\" said Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), who has asked Fed Chair Jerome Powell to report back on what the Fed can do. \"But it's important they undertake this kind of preparation work and analysis.\"</p><p>The growing pressure on the Fed is evidence of how rapid developments in technology are beginning to shake the foundations of the financial system, raising questions about whether policymakers are prepared. Some lawmakers want the Fed to take a more active role in fintech developments.</p><p>\"A consumer payments system is a natural monopoly, the same way Microsoft Word is a natural monopoly,\" said Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), who joined with Hill to ask the Fed to outline its options for creating a digital currency. \"No one wants to use some incompatible word processor. ... The question arises - shouldn't it be the U.S. taxpayer and the U.S. government that does it rather than any private firm?\"</p><p>The details of a possible Fed-developed digital currency are still vague. But advocates and experts say such an instrument could give consumers a new way to make payments without having to rely on banks and without incurring fees when they transfer money. The digital currency would likely take some inspiration from the technology that underpins other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.</p><p>\"It is inevitable,\" Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said at a recent conference, according to Reuters. \"I think it is better for us to start getting our hands around it.\"</p><p>But over the last couple of years, the Fed's leaders have been anything but enthusiastic. Members of its Washington-based board of governors have dismissed the idea that the central bank should create its own digital currency.</p><p>But that was before Facebook revealed its plans to become a huge player in the financial system. The social media giant's June announcement that it planned to spearhead a new digital currency jolted the Fed and other regulators around the world.</p><p>An array of powerful figures - Powell, President Donald Trump and House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) - quickly voiced concern about Facebook's vision for disrupting payments networks.</p><p>Officials took the threat so seriously because of Facebook's massive built-in user base. Trump immediately highlighted and dismissed concerns about it posing an existential threat to the dollar. \"It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World,\" he said of the greenback, \"and it will always stay that way.\"</p><p>Another radical proposal dropped in August, when Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, who leads monetary policy for the U.K., suggested that central banks join forces to create a network of digital currencies that would make up a \"synthetic hegemonic currency\" - similar in some ways to Libra, which is expected to be backed with a variety of existing currencies.</p><p>Carney framed it as a potential replacement for the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency - not to mention a way to address risks from a possible transition to China's renminbi as the next dominant currency.</p><p>Carney is one of many officials around the world who have been suggesting that governments create their own competitors to Libra.</p><p>Christine Lagarde, before leaving her post as managing director of the IMF to lead the European Central Bank, made a case for governments issuing their own digital currency, which she said was \"not science fiction.\"</p><p>The Bank for International Settlements, which represents the world's central banks, said early this year that most were conducting research into central bank digital currencies and many were progressing from conceptual work into experimentation and proofs-of-concept.</p><p>The IMF/World Bank meetings this week are likely to highlight the debate.</p><p>Facebook's lead executive on Libra, David Marcus, is scheduled to speak on Wednesday on a panel with Carney focused on \"Big Tech and the Future of Finance.\" Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who dismissed central bank digital currencies earlier this year, is expected to revisit the issue Wednesday at a think tank event in Washington on the future of money.</p><p>Petrou, who advises on regulatory issues through her firm, is warning banks that they need to view the discussions with a greater sense of urgency. Banks are key operators in the financial plumbing of today's U.S. payments system.</p><p>\"Many of your banks may think they're increasingly run by regulators,\" Petrou told a group of lawyers for large banks earlier this month. \"Soon, though, regulators may also run banking.\"</p><p>Sheila Bair, who led the FDIC during the 2008 financial crisis, is among those urging the Fed to act. She argued that a new Fed-developed digital currency could be used by the public to transfer money without the need for banks and fees. If based on distributed technology - allowing for a decentralized database of transactions across a network - Bair said it could be more secure, efficient and less costly.</p><p>\"We've got inefficient payments,\" Bair said in an interview. \"It's expensive. The retailers hate it. Bank customers hate it. ... With a cryptocurrency sitting on a distributed ledger, you could just go directly from point A to point B. You don't need an intermediary. That's how it's supposed to work in theory.

The firm's chief US equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, maintained a bullish year-end price target. Visit Markets Insider's homepage for more stories[2].The same worries keep eating at Jonathan Golub. The chief US equity strategist for Credit Suisse on Monday lowered his corporate earnings estimates for the second time this year. </p><p>The reasoning for his curbed expectations sounds a lot like what pushed him to cut his estimates back in March, and before that, last September. It was falling oil prices[3], along with softening outlooks at big tech companies like Apple, that led Golub to trim his 2019 and 2020 S...00 earnings-per-share forecasts earlier this year. \"Since then, oil prices have declined further, economic indicators (such as global PMIs[4]) have moderated, and the outlook for select TECH+ names (including Micron[5], Intel[6], Facebook[7] and Alphabet[8]) has weakened,\" he wrote in a note to clients on Monday. The New York-based strategist again reduced his 2019 and 2020 EPS estimates to $166.50 from $170, and to $176 from $180, respectively. That translates to forecasted annual EPS growth of 2.2% (from 4.4%) for 2019 and 5.7% (from 5.9%) for 2020.

Analysts and strategists up and down Wall Street[11] are voicing concerns that investors aren't properly weighing stock-market risks, like unresolved trade tensions rising against a slowing economic backdrop. Federal regulators' reported anti-trust regulation[12] against big tech companies like Alphabet and Facebook is another long-term risk to factor in, experts say. \"One important source of the weaker data is the trade war, and I'm getting a lot of client questions about potential scenarios for the G20 meeting and implications for markets and the economy,\" Torsten Sl\u00f8k, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a Sunday report. Despite the concerns from different corners of the market and the global economy, Credit Suisse's Golub remains firmly in the bull camp. He sees the S...00 rising about 2.5% from current levels by the end of the year, to 3,025. \"Decelerating economic data, as well as declining interest rates and inflation expectations, should weigh on multiples,\" he wrote. \"However, the backdrop remains non-recessionary, providing a floor to stock prices.\" Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider: Trump has been putting pressure on his Fed chief for nearly a year \u2014 and it's raising serious questions about how the central bank is supposed to function[13] 'Don't trust the US stock market at this level': One expert outlines a scenario that could send equities crashing with little notice[14] Stocks are fresh off all-time highs.

We don't have to look a long way back into our history to find evidence of the last time investors focused on immediate benefits without considering possible long-term consequences: the stock market mania that become the dot-com boom and bust and the rampant trade in collateralised debt obligations that led to the 2008 credit crunch are prime examples.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the global financial crisis, markets rose on the tide of quantitative easing and it wasn't difficult to access good returns by buying trackers such as exchange traded funds (ETFs). A decade on and the popularity of cheap passive strategies, especially in the US, could be inflating a bubble. The root of the problem is simple: passive investing in market-capweighted indices means larger companies receive the lion's share of capital. The biggest just get bigger. And the biggest companies of all are in technology.</p><p>Added to the fact that \"our greedy equities are concentrated in those areas of the market which have favourable dynamics\", according to well-known investor Jonathan Ruffer, and big tech has been a major beneficiary of passive momentum, particularly in the US. The sector accounts for 24 per cent of the US large-cap index, largely thanks to the dominance of Facebook (US:FB), Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - owner of Google. These titans (together known as the FAANG stocks), account for 12 per cent of the S&amp;P 500. They have a combined market capitalisation of $3 trillion and occupy the top three positions on the list of the world's largest companies. Thus, a passive play on the US stock market has, in effect, become a bet on technology and the popularity of ETFs has provided significant momentum for the sector's largest companies.</p><p>It may be unfair to say that day-to-day ETF trades distort the price movements of underlying shares, particularly as most of the ETF trading volume is done on the secondary market (providers vehemently oppose the notion that passive trackers adversely influence markets). But it is indisputable that a significant portion of the share capital of the world's largest companies is now concentrated in these vehicles.</p><p>The three largest US-listed S&amp;P 500 ETFs are managed by State Street Corp, BlackRock iShares and Vanguard. In total, these products are worth $510bn and account for about 2.24 per cent of the market capitalisation of the S&amp;P 500. These large funds aren't even the whole story. Add together all the passive strategies that hold S&amp;P 500 stocks, including global tracker funds (which are heavily weighted towards S&amp;P 500 stocks), ETFs listed outside the US and holdings in various smart-beta ETFs and the figure rises significantly. In July 2017, research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that 37 per cent of the S&amp;P 500 was managed passively.</p><p>What's worrying - but perhaps unsurprising - is that the largest ETF providers are also the biggest shareholders in major tech firms. For example, over 7 per cent of Facebook stock is held by Vanguard, 6 per cent by BlackRock and nearly 4 per cent by State Street. Of course, all of this isn't going to be in passive funds, especially in the case of BlackRock and Vanguard - although BlackRock's last quarterly statement shows that two-thirds of the assets it manages are in ETFs and other passive vehicles.</p><p>And the valuation of big tech stocks has continued to be driven higher still by passive funds allocating capital on the basis of size and not fundamentals - thus creating a feedback loop. During the good times, investors enjoy the momentum provided by higher passive demand, in turn attracting further inflows from investors keen to ensure they don't miss out on further upside. But the same could prove true in reverse - should sentiment turn, and if the belief that the tech giants will only ever get bigger weakens, then money could come rushing out, with wide-reaching ramifications. It is increasingly clear where this mood shift could come from: the FAANG companies are today being branded as anti-competitive, irresponsible or obstacles to innovation - investors are already rushing for the exit.</p><p>'The FAANG companies are being branded as anticompetitive, Big bad tech Murmurings of unease that bubbled out of the European Commission in 2017 have hardened into a full backlash against the tech sector. The prevailing mood among consumers, regulators and politicians is that Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google have grown too big for their boots.</p><p>irresponsible or obstacles to innovation - investors are already rushing for the exit' In 2017, the European Commission slapped Google with its biggest ever fine: $2.7bn for using its search engine to promote its own websites above those of paying customers'. Meanwhile, Facebook is being investigated by competition authorities in Australia who say it has too much dominance in the global advertising market; sharing 80 per cent of the digital advertising space with Google does indeed seem anti-competitive. George Soros thinks that the fact they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities, which \"should be subject to more stringent regulation\". He used his platform at the World Economic Forum in Davos to warn big US tech groups that \"their days are numbered\".</p><p>And Mr Soros is not alone in taking a stand. In November, Margrethe Vestager suggested the dominance of US tech companies had \"undermined democracy\" and allowed them to \"use fear and greed to drive anti-competitive behaviour\". As the EU's competition commissioner, she has had a hand in fining Google for allegedly abusing its dominance in search, Facebook for providing misleading information when it acquired WhatsApp and Amazon for its ebook practices. She also opened an investigation into Apple's tax practices following the publication of the Paradise Papers last year. FAANG founders are no longer being praised for creating conglomerates that are uncontested on the world stage. Now, Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned by the UK government to explain how the personal data of 50m Facebook users was mined by political communications company Cambridge Analytica (an invitation he has declined). Larry Page of Google has been called out for stifling competition. Meanwhile, a widely praised Yale Law Journal article, 'The Amazon antitrust paradox', accuses Amazon of covert anti-competitive practices: \"It is as if Bezos charted the company's growth by first drawing a map of antitrust laws, and then devising routes to smoothly bypass them,\" claims the article's author, Lina Khan.</p><p>The 100-year old US antitrust laws seek to protect the consumer purse, but that is irrelevant when services are free or lowering prices for consumers - in the short term at least. Users of WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube should probably note that their online activity is being collected and stored in the lower echelons of Google and Facebook. After all, if you're not paying for it, you are the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.product.No\">www.product.No</url> room for error So, as customers and regulators have become more vocal on the misuse of personal data, investors have every reason to be wary - because the business models of these companies are dependent on the free flow of customer data, and their valuations dependent on flawless execution.</p><p>Take Amazon. If you were to buy a share in the company today - a transaction that would set you back $1,544 - you would be betting on 193 years of profitable future growth. True, analysts are expecting earnings to rise at a compound annual rate of 37 per cent between 2017 and 2019, but a price to forecast earnings ratio of 193 times would, on a PEG basis, demand an even faster rate of growth.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, bullish analysts choose to base their investment cases not on the group's earnings forecasts, but on the sum of its parts. Revenues in its consumer retail business are expected to jump 65 per cent in 2018, giving it a potential market value of $501bn, while its highly profitable web services division is expected to be worth $310bn. Still, those valuations are predicated on the belief that recent growth rates will continue, and mean Amazon is a risky investment, even without looming regulatory pressures. It's a similar conundrum at Facebook and Google. Their valuations are far less inflated than Amazon's but are still based on growth forecasts that suggest the two companies will keep making substantial profits from other people's personal data for some time to come. If the result of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is a new wave of regulation that undermines these models, then the justification for exorbitant valuations in the sector will surely be called into question. Twitter (US:TWTR) and Snap (US:SNAP) have also suffered share price weakness in the wake of the Facebook scandal - their revenues are almost entirely reliant on the use of personal data.</p><p>Cut from a different cloth It is easy to see how changes in anti-trust and data protection laws could stunt the growth forecasts of companies that make their revenues almost entirely from personal data. But a regulatory overhaul would not have an equal impact on the operations of all the FAANG companies. Commentators and investors frequently discuss them as one homogenous group, but they make their money in different ways that mean any regulatory backlash will affect them to varying degrees.</p><p>Take Amazon again. Sure, it has amassed huge quantities of personal data, but it has so far kept largely on the right side of policymakers and customers. In fact, aside from its poor contribution to the US government wallet, it has hardly put a toe out of line in its 24-year history - at least on the basis of the existing antitrust rulebook. Even splitting it up - as Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and media theorist Douglas Rushkoffhave called for - would leave investors with two Amazons and potentially create rather than destroy value.</p><p>It's a similar story at Apple and Netflix, which have refrained from mega-mergers, have plenty of competitors and make money selling products, not data. World domination still seems a realistic prospect for these companies, whatever regulators throw at the broader technology industry - and partly explains why the recent technology sell-offhas left them relatively unscathed. In short, technology investors should approach the sector in a much more selective way than has been the trend in recent years, paying more attention to business models and financial fundamentals. On any metric, for example, Apple still looks cheap - although like many in the sector its profitability is flattered by sophisticated tax planning.</p><p>Beware the edge Even so, there remains the risk that these giant companies have been lifted together by the post-financial crisis boom in passive investing and could tumble together just as easily. We come back to that change in tech sentiment and the potential for wide-reaching ramifications in the US equities market. The reason? Active selling may, eventually, spark sales by passive investors and then, thanks to the quantity of tech stocks held in trackers, there is potential for a frightening selling loop. For example, if investors begin to sell out of the large passive funds, the knock-on effect could be more downward pressure on the FAANG stocks. In turn, the weighting of these companies could spark further selling of the ETFs. Thus far, passive investors have avoided shifting stock as their active counterparts have done amid the wave of doubt surrounding the growth prospects of the FAANG companies. But that is not to say they won't.</p><p>Market commentators have worried about the influence potential ETF selling could have in previous episodes. Speaking to Reuters about the 5 February volatility spike in US equity markets, JPMorgan flows strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou was concerned ETF outflows could exacerbate selling.</p><p>He has found that the worst recent sell-offs occurred when equity ETFs suffer the biggest outflows, and he told Reuters in February that he was worried by potential reversal in retail investor inflows into US markets, which were exceptionally strong at the end of 2017: \"If these equity ETF flows, which we believe are largely driven by retail investors, start reversing, not only would the equity market retrench, but the resultant rise in bond-equity correlation would likely induce derisking by risk parity funds and balanced mutual funds, magnifying the effect of a market sell-off.\"</p><p>Mr Panigirtzoglou's analysis might equally be applied to any serious selling activity, and a collapse in confidence for such a significant sub-sector as the FAANG stocks could spook retail investors and spark ETF outflows. The feedback loops he was discussing pertain to asset allocation strategies, but this is part of a wider acknowledgement that potentially dangerous dynamics exist in markets because of the automated and robotic way money has been allocated.</p><p>ETF providers can point to episodes such as the taper tantrum or February's spike in volatility as evidence they can resist the dangers we have set out in this article. But the fact remains these passive funds haven't yet been tested in a sustained market sell-off. The trading mechanisms that have enabled ETFs to track the value of underlying assets could be placed under severe strain and the spark to fuel that fire could well be a change in data protection laws. We are describing a nightmare scenario that may not come to pass. But just as Facebook users have sleep-walked into a situation where use of their personal data can get out of control, it is possible financial markets have stepped blindfolded into another dangerous bubble.</p><p>Anatomy of an ETF sell-off If, prompted by wobbles in the tech sector, ETF investors were to sell out of the S&amp;P 500 how would the fallout for the wider market materialise? Firstly, secondary market trading of ETF shares does provide a liquid and transparent way to buy and sell equities exposure. An issue may only arise if there are more sellers than buyers and ETF shares must be redeemed. If this were the case, how robust might the product structures prove? When ETF shares are redeemed, authorised participants like market makers, specialists and large institutions remove ETF shares from the market by purchasing enough to match the size of ETF creation units (typically 25,000 to 50,000 ETF shares), and delivering them to the ETF issuer. These are exchanged with the ETF issuer for the underlying securities of the fund.</p><p>If the value of ETF shares has fallen below NAV, then the market maker can take advantage of this discount to sell the underlying shares they receive from the provider for a profit. As more market makers compete for these risk-free profits, the ETF shares rise in price again to match the value of the underlying assets.</p><p>This arbitrage mechanism has worked well on the whole, but what if there was a large sell-off triggered by fears for a huge sector like tech? Could the market makers profit from selling the underlying stocks? It is possible that one of the reasons some tech stocks have become so expensive is because the true free float has been restricted by so many stocks being held in ownership by tracker funds. If many ETF shares were to be redeemed suddenly, the increased supply of tech stocks would suppress prices. ETF shares would have to fall faster than the tech stocks to restore the arbitrage, which would fuel selling and the speed with which everything unravelled might easily get out of hand.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-135998758</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S04-NDT1-DY9P-N041-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2594\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 29, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

We don't have to look a long way back into our history to find evidence of the last time investors focused on immediate benefits without considering possible long-term consequences: the stock market mania that become the dot-com boom and bust and the rampant trade in collateralised debt obligations that led to the 2008 credit crunch are prime examples.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the global financial crisis, markets rose on the tide of quantitative easing and it wasn't difficult to access good returns by buying trackers such as exchange traded funds (ETFs). A decade on and the popularity of cheap passive strategies, especially in the US, could be inflating a bubble. The root of the problem is simple: passive investing in market-cap-weighted indices means larger companies receive the lion's share of capital. The biggest just get bigger. And the biggest companies of all are in technology.</p><p>Added to the fact that \"our greedy equities are concentrated in those areas of the market which have favourable dynamics\", according to well-known investor Jonathan Ruffer, and big tech has been a major beneficiary of passive momentum, particularly in the US. The sector accounts for 24 per cent of the US large-cap index, largely thanks to the dominance of Facebook (US:FB), Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - owner of Google. These titans (together known as the FAANG stocks), account for 12 per cent of the S&amp;P 500. They have a combined market capitalisation of $3 trillion and occupy the top three positions on the list of the world's largest companies. Thus, a passive play on the US stock market has, in effect, become a bet on technology and the popularity of ETFs has provided significant momentum for the sector's largest companies.</p><p>It may be unfair to say that day-to-day ETF trades distort the price movements of underlying shares, particularly as most of the ETF trading volume is done on the secondary market (providers vehemently oppose the notion that passive trackers adversely influence markets). But it is indisputable that a significant portion of the share capital of the world's largest companies is now concentrated in these vehicles.</p><p>                      The FAANG companies are today being branded as anti-competitive, irresponsible or obstacles to innovation - investors are already rushing for the exit                    </p><p>The three largest US-listed S&amp;P 500 ETFs are managed by State Street Corp, BlackRock iShares and Vanguard. In total, these products are worth $510bn and account for about 2.24 per cent of the market capitalisation of the S&amp;P 500. These large funds aren't even the whole story. Add together all the passive strategies that hold S&amp;P 500 stocks, including global tracker funds (which are heavily weighted towards S&amp;P 500 stocks), ETFs listed outside the US and holdings in various smart-beta ETFs and the figure rises significantly. In July 2017, research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that 37 per cent of the S&amp;P 500 was managed passively.</p><p>What's worrying - but perhaps unsurprising - is that the largest ETF providers are also the biggest shareholders in major tech firms. For example, over7 per cent of Facebook stock is held by Vanguard, 6 per cent by BlackRock and nearly 4 per cent by State Street. Of course, all of this isn't going to be in passive funds, especially in the case of BlackRock and Vanguard - although BlackRock's last quarterly statement shows that two-thirds of the assets it manages are in ETFs and other passive vehicles.</p><p>And the valuation of big tech stocks has continued to be driven higher still by passive funds allocating capital on the basis of size and not fundamentals - thus creating a feedback loop. During the good times, investors enjoy the momentum provided by higher passive demand, in turn attracting further inflows from investors keen to ensure they don't miss out on further upside. But the same could prove true in reverse - should sentiment turn, and if the belief that the tech giants will only ever get bigger weakens, then money could come rushing out, with wide-reaching ramifications. It is increasingly clear where this mood shift could come from: the FAANG companies are today being branded as anti-competitive, irresponsible or obstacles to innovation - investors are already rushing for the exit. </p><p>                     Big bad tech                   </p><p>Murmurings of unease that bubbled out of the European Commission in 2017 have hardened into a full backlash against the tech sector. The prevailing mood among consumers, regulators and politicians is that Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google have grown too big for their boots.</p><p>In 2017, the European Commission slapped Google with its biggest ever fine: $2.7bn for using its search engine to promote its own websites above those of paying customers'. Meanwhile, Facebook is being investigated by competition authorities in Australia who say it has too much dominance in the global advertising market; sharing 80 per cent of the digital advertising space with Google does indeed seem anti-competitive. George Soros thinks that the fact they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities, which \"should be subject to more stringent regulation\". He used his platform at the World Economic Forum in Davos to warn big US tech groups that \"their days are numbered\". </p><p>And Mr Soros is not alone in taking a stand. In November, Margrethe Vestager suggested the dominance of US tech companies had \"undermined democracy\" and allowed them to \"use fear and greed to drive anti-competitive behaviour\". As the EU's competition commissioner, she has had a hand in fining Google for allegedly abusing its dominance in search, Facebook for providing misleading information when it acquired WhatsApp and Amazon for its ebook practices. She also opened an investigation into Apple's tax practices following the publication of the Paradise Papers last year.</p><p>FAANG founders are no longer being praised for creating conglomerates that are uncontested on the world stage. Now, Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned by the UK government to explain how the personal data of 50m Facebook users was mined by political communications company Cambridge Analytica (an invitation he has declined). Larry Page of Google has been called out for stifling competition. Meanwhile, a widely praised Yale Law Journal article, 'The Amazon antitrust paradox', accuses Amazon of covert anti-competitive practices: \"It is as if Bezos charted the company's growth by first drawing a map of antitrust laws, and then devising routes to smoothly bypass them,\" claims the article's author, Lina Khan.   </p><p>The 100-year old US antitrust laws seek to protect the consumer purse, but that is irrelevant when services are free or lowering prices for consumers - in the short term at least. Users of WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube should probably note that their online activity is being collected and stored in the lower echelons of Google and Facebook. After all, if you're not paying for it, you are the product.</p><p>                     No room for error                   </p><p>So, as customers and regulators have become more vocal on the misuse of personal data, investors have every reason to be wary - because the business models of these companies are dependent on the free flow of customer data, and their valuations dependent on flawless execution. </p><p>Take Amazon. If you were to buy a share in the company today - a transaction that would set you back $1,544 - you would be betting on 193 years of profitable future growth. True, analysts are expecting earnings to rise at a compound annual rate of 37 per cent between 2017 and 2019, but a price to forecast earnings ratio of 193 times would, on a PEG basis, demand an even faster rate of growth. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, bullish analysts choose to base their investment cases not on the group's earnings forecasts, but on the sum of its parts. Revenues in its consumer retail business are expected to jump 65 per cent in 2018, giving it a potential market value of $501bn, while its highly profitable web services division is expected to be worth $310bn. Still, those valuations are predicated on the belief that recent growth rates will continue, and mean Amazon is a risky investment, even without looming regulatory pressures. </p><p>It's a similar conundrum at Facebook and Google. Their valuations are far less inflated than Amazon's but are still based on growth forecasts that suggest the two companies will keep making substantial profits from other people's personal data for some time to come. If the result of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is a new wave of regulation that undermines these models, then the justification for exorbitant valuations in the sector will surely be called into question. Twitter (US:TWTR) and Snap (US:SNAP) have also suffered share price weakness in the wake of the Facebook scandal - their revenues are almost entirely reliant on the use of personal data.</p><p>                     Cut from a different cloth                   </p><p>It is easy to see how changes in anti-trust and data protection laws could stunt the growth forecasts of companies that make their revenues almost entirely from personal data. But a regulatory overhaul would not have an equal impact on the operations of all the FAANG companies. Commentators and investors frequently discuss them as one homogenous group, but they make their money in different ways that mean any regulatory backlash will affect them to varying degrees.</p><p>Take Amazon again. Sure, it has amassed huge quantities of personal data, but it has so far kept largely on the right side of policymakers and customers. In fact, aside from its poor contribution to the US government wallet, it has hardly put a toe out of line in its 24-year history - at least on the basis of the existing antitrust rulebook. Even splitting it up - as Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and media theorist Douglas Rushkoff have called for - would leave investors with two Amazons and potentially create rather than destroy value.</p><p>It's a similar story at Apple and Netflix, which have refrained from mega-mergers, have plenty of competitors and make money selling products, not data. World domination still seems a realistic prospect for these companies, whatever regulators throw at the broader technology industry - and partly explains why the recent technology sell-off has left them relatively unscathed. In short, technology investors should approach the sector in a much more selective way than has been the trend in recent years, paying more attention to business models and financial fundamentals. On any metric, for example, Apple still looks cheap - although like many in the sector its profitability is flattered by sophisticated tax planning.</p><p>                     Beware the edge                   </p><p>Even so, there remains the risk that these giant companies have been lifted together by the post-financial crisis boom in passive investing and could tumble together just as easily. We come back to that change in tech sentiment and the potential for wide-reaching ramifications in the US equities market. The reason? Active selling may, eventually, spark sales by passive investors and then, thanks to the quantity of tech stocks held in trackers, there is potential for a frightening selling loop.</p><p>For example, if investors begin to sell out of the large passive funds, the knock-on effect could be more downward pressure on the FAANG stocks. In turn, the weighting of these companies could spark further selling of the ETFs. Thus far, passive investors have avoided shifting stock as their active counterparts have done amid the wave of doubt surrounding the growth prospects of the FAANG companies. But that is not to say they won't.</p><p>Market commentators have worried about the influence potential ETF selling could have in previous episodes. Speaking to Reuters about the 5 February volatility spike in US equity markets, JPMorgan flows strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou was concerned ETF outflows could exacerbate selling.</p><p>He has found that the worst recent sell-offs occurred when equity ETFs suffer the biggest outflows, and he told Reuters in February that he was worried by potential reversal in retail investor inflows into US markets, which were exceptionally strong at the end of 2017: \"If these equity ETF flows, which we believe are largely driven by retail investors, start reversing, not only would the equity market retrench, but the resultant rise in bond-equity correlation would likely induce de-risking by risk parity funds and balanced mutual funds, magnifying the effect of a market sell-off.\"</p><p>Mr Panigirtzoglou's analysis might equally be applied to any serious selling activity, and a collapse in confidence for such a significant sub-sector as the FAANG stocks could spook retail investors and spark ETF outflows. The feedback loops he was discussing pertain to asset allocation strategies, but this is part of a wider acknowledgement that potentially dangerous dynamics exist in markets because of the automated and robotic way money has been allocated.  </p><p>ETF providers can point to episodes such as the taper tantrum or February's spike in volatility as evidence they can resist the dangers we have set out in this article. But the fact remains these passive funds haven't yet been tested in a sustained market sell-off. The trading mechanisms that have enabled ETFs to track the value of underlying assets could be placed under severe strain and the spark to fuel that fire could well be a change in data protection laws. We are describing a nightmare scenario that may not come to pass. But just as Facebook users have sleep-walked into a situation where use of their personal data can get out of control, it is possible financial markets have stepped blindfolded into another dangerous bubble.</p><p>                     Anatomy of an ETF sell-off                   </p><p> If, prompted by wobbles in the tech sector, ETF investors were to sell out of the S&amp;P 500 how would the fallout for the wider market materialise? Firstly, secondary market trading of ETF shares does provide a liquid and transparent way to buy and sell equities exposure. An issue may only arise if there are more sellers than buyers and ETF shares must be redeemed. If this were the case, how robust might the product structures prove?  </p><p>When ETF shares are redeemed, authorised participants like market makers, specialists and large institutions remove ETF shares from the market by purchasing enough to match the size of ETF creation units (typically 25,000 to 50,000 ETF shares), and delivering them to the ETF issuer. These are exchanged with the ETF issuer for the underlying securities of the fund.</p><p>If the value of ETF shares has fallen below NAV, then the market maker can take advantage of this discount to sell the underlying shares they receive from the provider for a profit. As more market makers compete for these risk-free profits, the ETF shares rise in price again to match the value of the underlying assets.</p><p>This arbitrage mechanism has worked well on the whole, but what if there was a large sell-off triggered by fears for a huge sector like tech? Could the market makers profit from selling the underlying stocks?</p><p>It is possible that one of the reasons some tech stocks have become so expensive is because the true free float has been restricted by so many stocks being held in ownership by tracker funds. If many ETF shares were to be redeemed suddenly, the increased supply of tech stocks would suppress prices. ETF shares would have to fall faster than the tech stocks to restore the arbitrage, which would fuel selling and the speed with which everything unravelled might easily get out of hand. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-42743518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S04-YDP1-JCJY-G3TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2636\"/><timeReceived>7:09 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0001O6F</classCode><className>STATE STREET CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>STT (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

It is significantly altering the ways people live and businesses operate. Recent examples of the use of disruptive technologies include financial technology (fintech), e-commerce and ride-sharing.</p><p>Because it is new and complicated, the policy responses of most countries, including developed ones, are often late compared to the actual development of the trend, which could be seen in perplexed regulations involving fintech and ride-sharing in many countries.</p><p>Cryptocurrency has emerged as an innovative product of digitalisation. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as an internet-based medium of exchange which uses cryptographical functions to conduct financial transactions.</p><p>Based on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies have high security, transparency and decentralisation. As they are\u00a0not controlled by any central authority, they are\u00a0immune to the old ways of government interference.</p><p>The technology uses peer-to-peer consensus to record and verify transactions without the need for custodians and clearing houses, which will reduce financial intermediary costs and transaction times.</p><p>Besides their advantages, fintech and cryptocurrencies, as part of the digital economy, have posed a challenge to monetary policy as well as policy sovereignty of many countries.</p><p>Among the concerns are questions of privacy, money laundering and the financing of terrorism as the result of the anonymity characteristic of blockchain technology.</p><p>The legal status (money or financial asset) of bitcoin or other digital currencies varies around the world. Some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade while others have banned or restricted them.</p><p>Japan is seen the world\u2019s most progressive regulative climate for cryptocurrencies; it recognises digital currencies as legal property under the Payment Services Act and gains on cryptocurrencies are taxable at rates of 15-55 per cent.</p><p>In fact, many experts have raised suspicions as to whether bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\u00a0should be considered currency when taking into account their high volatility, low degree of transactions, quite small community and not yet a real store of value.</p><p>For Libra, Facebook has advertised it as a way to improve financial inclusion for a vast pool of people without access to bank accounts.</p><p>Starting in 2020, Facebook\u2019s 2.4 billion users will be able to shop and send money overseas with almost zero transaction fees via its social platforms, including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, it said.</p><p>Moreover, Facebook\u2019s digital coin is anticipated to gain higher customer trust as the Libra is pegged to a basket of major sovereign currencies, including the US dollar and Euro (Libra Reserve), meaning it would fluctuate less than existing cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Facebook even established a subsidiary called Calibra to run its crypto dealings and promised to separate transaction data from social data. It and 27 other founding members in Libra Association (which could increase to 100 members) will share governance power.</p><p>However, US regulators are bristling and they have sent a clear message: they don\u2019t trust Facebook, especially since the tech giant has a poor track record of privacy and security. \u00a0</p><p>Its oversight capacity is also in question\u00a0following a slew of scandals including the Cambridge Analytica scandals for which the Federal Trade Commission ordered the company to pay US$5 billion for privacy violations.</p><p>The possibility that big tech groups such as Facebook could rapidly establish a dominant position in global finance could also pose a potential threat to competition, financial stability and monetary policy sovereignty, and\u00a0it may undermine the power of the US dollar.</p><p>US lawmakers are considering a ban to prevent big technology companies from functioning as financial institutions or issuing digital currencies.</p><p>In Vietnam, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is seen an important opportunity to shore up its economy, accelerate the process of modernisation and enhance its competitiveness.</p><p>In fact, disruptive technologies such as fintech, the\u00a0sharing economy and e-commerce are developing rapidly in Vietnam. The Government began to study and issue more regulations to meet actual development requirements of businesses and\u00a0encourage innovation.</p><p>However, taking into account the potential adverse impacts of disruptive policies on the economy and social welfare, this process is taking a slow\u00a0and\u00a0cautious view.</p><p>For cryptocurrencies, the official view of the State Bank of Vietnam is that it has not recognised them as legal ledger tender (a legal payment instrument) and exchanges and transactions of digital currency are illegal in Vietnam.</p><p>Nevertheless, mining and trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still happening in Vietnam and unclear regulations have hindered tax collection on such transactions for the State budget.</p><p>Libra and cryptocurrencies are part of disruptive technologies that are inevitable which are\u00a0associated with the development of fintech and digitalisation in the banking sector.</p><p>A working group of the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) has also studied the development of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and the newest Libra, providing policy implications.</p><p>From the experience of many countries, it is necessary to determine the scope of the issue to have appropriate policies. Caution is needed in terms of financial and macroeconomic stability, but it should also be treated in the context of actual development in both the world and domestic markets so as we\u2019re not passive in policymaking.</p><p>Research on policies of the other countries is also essential as Vietnam is integrating more deeply into the global economy.</p><p>Libra should not only be seen as a single cryptocurrency but as\u00a0a disruptive technology issue. It is associated with the status and development of social networks, global financial stability and policy sovereignty of major countries.</p><p>As Facebook said, blockchain technology is inevitable and the US should \u201cabsolutely\u201d lead the world in rule-making for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>This is also an unavoidable problem for Vietnam. We should not just wait to see when it is born but take advantage of this chance to push research and oversight of\u00a0disruptive technology to have in-time and appropriate policies.</p><p>* Vo Tri Thanh is a senior economist at the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council.

And what it means for Big Media<br/><br/>The partnership between Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited and Facebook as well as the reported interest of Google in Vodafone-Idea and Amazon starting early investment talks with Bharti Airtel (although both telecom companies denied the reports), are developments poised to blur traditional boundaries between technology, media and telecom companies to create unique new and disruptive business models in the media and entertainment industry.</p><p><br/><br/>This convergence of Technology-Media-Telecom is termed a natural order of evolution of the industry. A technology company which is well funded can extract more revenues, market-share and share of mind by actively participating in more than one part of this convergence chain, while the telecom firms are keen to build an ecosystem of services to engage, retain and derive value from their existing customers.<br/><br/>What better battleground can these strategic investors find than the burgeoning Indian telecom market with around 600 million Internet users? In the last few weeks, RIL's Jio Platforms received 11 investments from 10 global technology investors. As of June 18, 2020, RIL had divested 24.7% in Jio Platforms for Rs 1,15, 693.95 crore.<br/><br/>\"Jio's blitzkrieg launch in 2016 fostered the growth of online video in India. The late 2019 foray into home broadband is already altering the dynamics of the traditional pay-TV business in urban India. With e-commerce and a suite of scaled digital services (housed under Jio Platforms), the telco major will soon make a big splash in the vast digital advertising arena,\" says Mihir Shah, Vice President, Media Partners Asia.<br/><br/>Piggy-Backing on Telecom<br/><br/>The telecom companies have access to consumers, so the handshake is actually happening through them and with the concept of net neutrality, telecom operators are obligated to provide equivalent services to the consumer. The advantage that some of these big technology platforms bring by partnering with telecoms is that they will be able to get a better understanding of the customer. And depending on usage patterns, demographics, the geographical dispersion of the audiences they can define and customize better products to appeal to those audiences.<br/><br/>So, there is a value proposition in many segments like digital e-commerce, physical commerce, entertainment and news content consumption, where big technology companies can gain by actually riding piggyback on the telecom network.<br/><br/>\"There is an opportunity to disrupt a lot of existing business models, in logistics, distribution, pure play content consumption or even creating new forms of content that can be consumed by audiences in different ways. For example, a news app similar to TikTok, which provides 30-second bytes of news as a stream, continuously on a channel. It could be around sports, entertainment or music,\" says Pradeep Dwivedi, CEO-India, Eros International Media Limited.<br/><br/>\"It also provides a brilliant opportunity for a very large start-up ecosystem to flourish, because even though this combination provides a lot of vanilla services to the consumers, there will be opportunities for specialized solutions to emerge,\" adds Dwivedi.<br/><br/>Also, telecom companies in India are under various adjusted gross revenue (AGR) obligations and struggling due to huge financial liability. Investments in new business models could also allow them to perhaps defray and pay off some of the existing obligations and ensure their own survival and sustainability in the long run.</p><p><br/><br/>Content with Connectivity<br/><br/>The more content that each of these combined entities will have within their walls or gateway, the more successful they are likely to be. While the entire focus of the content right now is primarily entertainment content, it is going to go to the informational and educational learning content very quickly.<br/><br/>\"Content will become a baseline for these Tech-Telecom behemoths, like connectivity. The more subscribers a network would have, the more will be its likeliness to take those subscribers to the five Cs of Community, Content, Commerce, Currency and Capital. Customers slowly will start expecting content alongside connectivity and companies will need content to attract new customers and keep them. It is going to be a powerful combination,\" says Sanchit Vir Gogia, Chief Analyst, Founder &amp; CEO, Greyhound Research. \"The only difference right now is that a lot of these players haven't explored content out of the entertainment perspective. But soon, they will go to gaming, learning, music, news, entertainment and educational content. For example, it is only a matter of time that Network18, etc., become premium and are accessible to Jio customers,\" he adds.</p><p><br/><br/>It is going to be a two-way advantage in terms of content. \"If we look at just the OTT content space, big tech OTTs which haven't seen much success in terms of content, will get access to local and regional content and the local OTT players will get an advantage of technology and money to scale up and invest further in content,\" says Karan Taurani, VP - Research Analyst (Media), Elara Securities (India) Private Limited. \"However, it will have a negative impact on broadcaster OTTs, which have been struggling to bring in catchy fresh content and much of their success in terms of revenues so far have come from sports and catch-up content. With these deals, they may have to ally their content with partnership of telecom majors and large tech giants,\" adds Taurani.<br/><br/>Walled Gardens, Exclusivity...<br/><br/>Going forward, content partners will naturally have to take a particular side and ally with a telecom-tech player, because over the course of time, telecom players will have a greater say in the entire relationship. \"The deals will create walled gardens but not immediately. It may shift power in the hands of the tech giants and would not want local broadcasters to scale up,\" says Taurani.</p><p><br/><br/>However, Avinash Pandey, CEO, ABP News Network believes that the merger activities will allow broadcasters to achieve scale, acquire technology, talent, and new production capabilities. \"Internet will be the new electricity and therefore telecom will not dominate distribution, instead converge with media and technology companies to address the market opportunity holistically. For linear TV, this will be an opportunity to create an absolute direct-toconsumer relationship across multiple screens without the baggage of a linear distribution model. The merger activities will allow broadcasters to achieve scale, acquire technology, talent, and new production capabilities,\" he says.<br/><br/>\"The big tech companies are consumer tech companies in reality. Their product differentiation strategy depends on the innovativeness and uniqueness of three things - back-end technology driven by AI/ML, data analytics and user adoption. In contrast, pure content companies will always focus on creating news, stories and ideas that impact or influence end consumers' lives. This unique value proposition cannot be replicated by consumer tech companies,\" adds Pandey.<br/><br/>\"Given the new reality that the current pandemic has created, Digital is expected to be the dominant force going forward and in FY23, it is likely to be the second largest segment after TV and attract the highest marketing spends among all media formats. As Digital behaviour evolves, there seems to be a growing consensus that in the future, subscription models will have a greater role in monetisation of Digital platforms. The new tariff order and its impact on the industry is a prelude to the trend that is likely to emerge going forward - any increase in subscription fees for TV may result in some early adopters shifting to OTT for their entertainment needs. The virus outbreak has magnified the already apparent shift from laptop/ smartphones viewing to large screen TVs - providing a significant fillip to broadband Internet and Fiber to the Home (FTTH) companies,\" says Satya Easwaran, Leader- Technology, Media and Telecom, KPMG India.<br/><br/>Till date, entertainment applications, primarily video, have been a major driver for data traffic for telecom companies. The next wave will be centred around 'phygitization', connecting India's informal sectors to online platforms. This will give a major fillip to India's start-up, small and medium businesses (SMBs) and the Digital economy at large.<br/><br/>Feedback: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dipali.banka@exchange4media.com\">dipali.banka@exchange4media.com</email><br/><br/>'It's good to have shared ownership of the pipe'<br/><br/>\"Big tech acquiring stakes in Indian telecom companies has some broad objectives. The first one is access to their huge subscriber base. Jio, Airtel and Vodafone all qualify in that respect. Secondly, telecom companies probably are the best equipped on the payment backbone and hence that would be a good asset. Facebook is looking to launch its WhatsApp pay which can benefit substantially with the collaboration. Therefore, there is a definitive leg-up for their content monetisation. Lastly, each of the companies are good investments, though some of them are going through a trying time. If one has the money, it's good to take that punt. The future is Digital and it's good to have shared ownership of the pipe if you rely on it for access and content.\"<br/><br/>Timmy Kandhari, Founder and Managing Director, Sapphire Professional Services Pvt Ltd<br/><br/>Ground Reality<br/><br/>* Content which is focused on entertainment right now will move to educational and informational very quickly<br/><br/>* The big tech companies have been successful all over the world but India is a very fragmented market<br/><br/>* The big tech companies have been successful all over the world but India is a very fragmented market<br/><br/>* Local telcos get advantage of tech and liquidity<br/><br/>* Tech giants get advantage of local feel, local content and access to end consumer base that telcos have<br/><br/>* Indian OTTs still lack the user experience that multinational OTTs like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video deliver<br/><br/>How TV will Be Impacted<br/><br/>* Power will shift to the tech giants; broadcasters will not have much say<br/><br/>* Broadcast OTTs will see a negative impact, as they have not done a good job so far; consumption has been more in terms of catch-up TV content<br/><br/>* Broadcaster OTTs have tried new things, eg., Voot tried out AVOD first, now they are moving to Voot Select<br/><br/>* Capability-wise, they are relatively poor in terms of creating fresh or catchy content on Digital<br/><br/>* Most of the broadcaster OTTs are based on premium pay model; tech-user experience is poor<br/><br/>* The only success story is Hotstar, but it gets twothirds of its revenue from sports, mostly cricket. Apart from cricket, original webseries, movies have not been monetised in a big way<br/><br/>\"Tech-telecom mergers will bring complementary businesses together to enhance core business, enter high-growth markets, and aggrandize service offerings. Internet will be the new electricity and therefore telecom will not dominate distribution, instead converge with media and technology companies to address the market opportunity holistically. For linear TV, this will be an opportunity to create an absolute direct-2-consumer relationship across multiple screens without the baggage of a linear distribution model.\"<br/><br/>Avinash Pandey, CEO, ABP News Network<br/><br/>\"I foresee these big forces bringing in a lot of disruption in the whole media content and distribution landscape and possibly lead to newer models, whether it is in the content consumption space or even in the media buying space. Only thing we'll have to see is how do we keep the consumer at the core, especially with things like privacy laws and data regulations as they will become important from a consumer lens.\"<br/><br/>Vasuta Agarwal, MD, InMobi- APAC<br/><br/>\"Big tech majors and their desire to connect with consumers compounded by having access to the pipes that actually provide the handshake with consumers will transform and impact every sector right from media, healthcare, education, commerce to even banking. It will also provide a brilliant opportunity for a very large start-up ecosystem to flourish, as there will be opportunities for specialized solutions.\"<br/><br/>Pradeep Dwivedi, CEO-India, Eros International Media Limited<br/><br/>\"Jio's blitzkrieg launch in 2016 fostered the growth of online video in India.

Reuters/Dow Jones/<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 NEW YORK - US stocks soared after the European Central Bank announced a huge bond-buying stimulus program Thursday, with banks and big tech stocks leading the way helped by a sharply higher dollar.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Rumors that Google is interested in buying Twitter - which could portend one of the largest-ever mergers in tech stocks - also fed the buying frenzy.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 259.70 points (1.48 per cent) at 17,813.98.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The S&amp;P 500 surged 31.03 (1.53 per cent) to 2,063.15, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 82.98 (1.78 per cent) to 4,750.40.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 It was the fourth straight day of gains for Wall Street, a streak that erased losses that had mounted from the beginning of the new year.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The spark for Thursday's buying was ECB chief Mario Draghi's announcement of a 60 billion euro a month ($A85 billion) bond-buying program through at least September 2016 aimed at sparking more investment and growth in the eurozone.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The announcement sent the euro down more than two per cent against the dollar while boosting stocks across Europe.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The market appreciates the fact that the ECB has announced a program that is better than expected, said Peter Cardillo of Rockwell Global Capital.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We had expected something around 50 billion euros a month.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The ECB's actions will increase liquidity in the economy by giving bond holders liquid cash in place of less liquid bonds,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"What happens to this liquidity will determine the outcome of this exercise. It could go into stocks or bonds, or housing... or be spent on Blu-rays and cars.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 LONDON - European stocks have rallied on the ECB's announcement it will inject over 1.0 trillion euros of stimulus into the stagnant euro zone economy, while the euro sank against the US dollar.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The pledge by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi to buy 60 billion euros ($A85 billion) of bonds per month exceeded market expectations that the monthly pace of the quantitative easing, or QE program of asset-purchases would be 50 billion euros.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Frankfurt's DAX 30 climbed 1.32 per cent to a new record close of 10,453.62 points, while the CAC 40 in Paris shot up 1.52 per cent to 4,552.80 points.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Milan stock market jumped 2.44 per cent and Madrid 1.70 per cent in value.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In Britain, which is not part of the eurozone, the FTSE 100 index of top companies rose 1.02 per cent to end the day at 6,796.63 points.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In foreign currency trading, the euro sank against the dollar to $US1.1401, its weakest level since early November 2003, around 1700 GMT following the ECB announcement compared with $US1.1620 beforehand.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The program of sovereign bond purchases comes after eurozone inflation turned negative in December, stoking fears that the 19-nation eurozone is on the brink of a dangerous deflationary spiral of falling prices.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Mario Draghi has been left with little choice than to begin a more robust than expected quantitative easing program in a bid to awake the economies of the eurozone from their slumber,\" said Dennis de Jong, boss of trading site UFX.com.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"This play is seen by many as the last roll of the dice for the beleaguered euro. QE has had some success in the US and UK, but with such a patchwork of economies and banking systems in the eurozone, the jury is very much out.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"There will be a lot of people holding their breath over the coming months,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The ECB chief also kept the door wide open to further purchases.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"They are intended to be carried out until end-September 2016 and will in any case be conducted until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation,\" Draghi told a news conference.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The purchases, due to start in March, will thus total slightly more than 1 trillion euros.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Given the importance of market effects as a key aspect of QE, the initial market reaction could be a strong steer to its ultimate impact,\" said Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at research consultancy Capital Economics ahead of the decision.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 HONG KONG - Asian markets have extended their rally this week, while the euro dipped ahead of a much-anticipated European Central Bank policy meeting that is forecast to see it introduce more monetary easing measures.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Tokyo added 0.28 per cent, or 48.54 points, to end at 17,329.02 on Thursday and Seoul was flat, dipping a marginal 0.41 points to 1,920.82.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Hong Kong rose 0.70 per cent, or 170.05 points, to 24,522.63 and Shanghai gained 0.59 per cent, or 19.73 points, to 3,343.34. The mainland China index has recovered almost all the losses it suffered on Monday in reaction to a regulatory crackdown on margin trading.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Eyes were firmly on the meeting later on Thursday of the ECB.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 WELLINGTON - New Zealand shares have retreated, led by power companies Meridian Energy and Mighty River Power as they dropped from record highs with investors looking to crystallise recent gains.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The NZX 50 Index fell 25.707 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5647.145 on Thursday.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 SYDNEY - The Australian market looks set to open higher after strong gains on overseas share markets.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 At 0728 AEDT on Friday, the March share price index futures contract was up 58 points at 5,421.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 US and European equities were up more than one per cent overnight after the European Central announced its 60 billion euros ($A84.62 billion) a month economic stimulus plan, which was a bit larger than the market was expecting.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In Australia, the market on Thursday closed higher as mining companies, banks and energy producers performed strongly..<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 26.5 points, or 0.49 per cent, at 5,419.9 points.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The broader All Ordinaries index was up 23.1 points, or 0.43 per cent, at 5,390.5.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Locally, on Friday, Resmed will release its second quarter results, and the Santos fourth quarter production report is due out.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0ENERGY<br/>\u00a0\u00a0Oil prices slid Thursday on a jump in US petroleum stockpiles and the surge in the US dollar spurred by the European Central Bank's launch of a massive eurozone stimulus.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in March slid $US1.47 to close at $US46.31 a barrel.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Brent North Sea crude for March, the European benchmark, settled at $US48.52 a barrel in London, down 51 cents.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The latest news from the US Department of Energy was bearish. The DoE reported Thursday that crude stockpiles in the world's largest oil consumer jumped by 10.1 million barrels last week, about four times as much as analysts had expected.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Inventories were up 13.3 per cent from a year ago, and at a peak not seen in at least 80 years for this time of year.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The closely watched stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub, which serve as a reference point for WTI, rose by 2.9 million barrels to $US36.8 million ($A46 million).<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Refineries braked production, with the capacity utilisation rate falling to 85.5 per cent from 91.0 per cent the prior week.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The combination of the ECB and the inventories put pressure\" on the oil market, said Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group, who added it was the largest week-over-week increase in crude supplies since 2001.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 PRECIOUS METALS<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Gold prices have settled above $US1,300 an ounce for the first time in five months as investors anticipated weaker currencies on the back of the European Central Bank's bigger-than-expected bond-buying program.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The most actively traded gold contract, for February delivery, rose $US7, or 0.5 per cent, to $US1,300.70 a troy ounce Thursday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was the highest close since August 15.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Silver futures tracked gold higher, with the March contract rising 0.9 per cent to close at a fresh four-month high of $US18.36 a troy ounce.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The ECB will buy 60 billion euro ($A85 billion) of public and private sector debt a month, starting in March 2015 and continuing until September 2016.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Although the introduction of a bond-purchasing program was widely expected, analysts and investors said the size was toward the upper end of expectations.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"This was a little bit more than what the broad consensus was, so it was a bright surprise,\" said Bart Melek, senior commodities strategist with TD Securities in Toronto.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Melek said that for many investors, the ECB's policy shift - as well as moves by Canada, Denmark and India to cut interest rates in recent weeks - spurred concerns about currency values.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"These currencies are likely to lose a lot of their value, and they're moving into the US dollar and gold as safe havens,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Still, gold's gains Thursday were muted as the market had rallied in recent weeks in anticipation of the bond-buying program, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Chicago's Kingsview Asset Management.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Gold prices could soon drum a retreat, as much of the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook has been cleared away this week, said Frank McGhee, senior precious metals broker with Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The final hurdle will be Sunday's election in Greece. The leftist Syriza party is ahead in the polls, reviving talk of a possible exit by the country from the eurozone.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The election has also put on hold Greece's negotiations on further financial aid.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"This is the last near-term hurdle, you know what the landscape will be for the next few months, and it takes the uncertainty out of the market,\" Mr McGhee said, adding that this will likely curb investors' appetite for gold.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 BASE METALS<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Copper prices fell Thursday as investors reduced their holdings of the economically sensitive asset amid concerns about Europe's economy and the continued slowdown in China.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The most actively traded contract, for March delivery, fell 3.4 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to settle at $US2.5785 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Copper prices lost ground after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the central bank will buy 60 billion euros ($A85 billion) of public and private sector debt a month, starting in March and continuing until September 2016.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Although the introduction of a bond-purchasing program was widely expected, analysts and investors said the amount was toward the upper end of expectations.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Instead, investors appeared to focus on what prompted the ECB to launch a stimulus program, he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The copper market is thinking that they must have to do all this because things are so bad,\" Mr Epstein said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Europe as a region is the second-largest copper consumer after China, and slower business activity has had an effect on metal demand.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Copper prices slumped to five and a half year lows last week after the World Bank slashed its outlook on global growth, highlighting concerns about China.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Recent data showed China's economy expanded at its slowest pace in more than two decades last year, and authorities in Beijing have signalled plans for further slowing.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"They're talking about a soft landing, they're not talking about growth,\" Mr. Epstein said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 China accounts for about 40 per cent of global copper demand, with the bulk of metal imports feeding the country's manufacturing and construction sectors. Some copper traders worry a continued economic slowdown would crimp China's demand for copper.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 NEWS<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 FRANKFURT - The European Central Bank has begun 2015 with a much-anticipated stimulus, revealing plans for a massive trillion-euro bond purchase program to ward off deflation and end stagnation in the euro zone economy.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 WASHINGTON - International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has hailed the European Central Bank's decision to launch a massive stimulus program, but urged euro zone authorities to undertake needed economic reforms.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 WASHINGTON - New claims for US unemployment insurance benefits, an indicator of the pace of layoffs, fell last week after a surge the prior week, the Labor Department says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 BEIJING - China's luxury market shrank last year, a global consultancy says, attributing the decline - the first it has detected - to a national anti-corruption campaign, slowing economic growth and changing consumer tastes.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 LONDON - British plumbing giant Wolseley wants to sell its French building materials unit in a move that would herald its exit from France.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 PARIS - French regulators have cleared the way for Chinese conglomerate Fosun to buy the holiday resorts group Club Med and have set February 9 as the closing date for the offer.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 NEW YORK - Google is getting ready to sell wireless telephone services directly to US consumers after reaching deals with carriers T-Mobile and Sprint, US media report.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 MADRID - Spain's unemployment rate has fallen in 2014 for the second straight year, dropping by just over two points to 23.7 per cent, but still remains at one of the highest levels in the European Union, official data shows.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 STOCKS TO WATCH ON THE AUSTRALIAN STOCK EXCHANGE ON FRIDAY:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 AMC - AMCOR - down 52 cents, or 4.04 per cent, at $12.36<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Packaging giant Amcor's long-serving chief executive has announced his surprise resignation, but his replacement says it will remain business as usual.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 EVN - EVOLUTION MINING - up four cents, or 4.2 per cent, at 98.5 cents<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The head of gold miner Evolution Mining is confident about the year ahead but is warning the industry against losing its way again as the precious metal's value rises.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 RMD - RESMED - up six cents, or 0.82 per cent, at $7.38<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Resmed will release its second quarter results on Friday.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 STO - SANTOS - up nine cents, or 1.23 per cent at $7.42<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Santos will release its fourth quarter production report on Friday<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 SKE - SKILLED GROUP - down 7.5 cents, or five per cent, at $1.43<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 PRG - PROGRAMMED MAINTENANCE SERVICES - up one cent, or 0.4 per cent, at $2.43<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Australia's biggest workforce provider Skilled Group has rejected a takeover offer from rival Programmed Maintenance Services.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0</pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F4J-G211-JC0X-K0WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2566\"/><timeReceived>9:06 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Australian Associated Press Pty.

2,117.69, 0.3 point above the previous record on March 2.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Nasdaq surge came on the back of good data in the quarterly reports of the three big tech stocks: Amazon shares soared 14.8 per cent and Microsoft 10.5 per cent as they reported strong gains in cloud computing.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 LONDON - European stock markets closed higher on hopes embattled eurozone member Greece

The index lost 167.61 points to end at 20,020.04, with a stronger yen also hitting exporters.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Shanghai gave back 0.47 per cent, or 20.82 points, to 4,393.69, and Seoul fell 0.63 per cent, or 13.61 points, to close at 2,159.80.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 However, Sydney rallied 1.51 per cent, or 88.53 points, to 5,933.3 as energy firms were helped by higher oil prices.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 And Hong Kong jumped 233.28 points to 28,060.98 - the first time it has ended above 20,000 since December 2007 - boosted by ongoing hopes for more stimulus to boost the Chinese economy.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 WELLINGTON - The NZX 50 Index rose 7.45 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 5765.36.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 SYDNEY - The Australian market looks set to open higher after Wall Street gained on Friday with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both reaching new record highs.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 At 0808 AEST on Monday, the June share price index futures contract was up 24 points at 5,962.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 No major local economic news is expected on Monday.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In equities news, the Legg Mason Global Investment Survey on investments is slated for release while Airbus Pacific gives a market forecast and Atlas Iron posts March quarter production results.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In Australia, the market on Friday ended the week strongly, with gains on the back of a rally in iron ore prices from decade lows.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 88.5 points, or 1.5 per cent, at 5,933.3 points, while the broader All Ordinaries index was up 86.5 points, or also 1.5 per cent, to 5,906.68 points.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ENERGY<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 World oil prices have traded mixed after sharp gains in the previous session as traders weighed copious US supplies and Yemen unrest in the crude-rich Middle East.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 West Texas Intermediate for June delivery fell 59 cents to close at $US57.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In London, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in June, the global benchmark, settled at $US65.28, up 43 cents.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 On Thursday WTI had rallied $US1.58 and Brent advanced $US2.12.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 PRECIOUS METALS<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Gold hit its lowest level in more than a month, falling for the third straight week as strength in global equities diverted interest from the precious metal, although uncertainty over the timing of a US rate rise kept prices in a tight range.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Spot gold was down 1.4 per cent at $US1,177.03 an ounce at 2.34pm EDT (0434 Saturday AEST), while US gold futures for June delivery settled down $US19.30 an ounce at $US1,175.

This is FIRST MOVE. And here's your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From pivot to pirouette. Fed Chair Jay Powell basically says he'll do his job, stock investors love it. No bluffing. President Trump reiterate his Mexican tariff threats. And paying tribute. World leaders and veterans come together to commemorate 75 years since the D-Day landings. It's Wednesday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to FIRST MOVE once again, guys, it does feel like the policy doves have been let loose.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Once again, the market is behaving, or at least investors are like they've got a Jay Powell policy pivot mark two. I am asking and will be continuing to ask where the two pivots effectively make pirouette as you heard there.</p><p>Well, I can tell you, I do worry though that Jay Powell only really reiterated what his job is at this stage. If growth weakens, the Federal act. Don't we already know that? Perhaps, the market is just saying this time, unlike what we saw in December and January, perhaps they buy it.</p><p>But that was all the markets needed to launch the second best day of the year for stocks. All the majors gaining some 2 percent plus. We're up again premarket. We are off the highs. Just for comparison. The best day of 2019 was January the 4th, when Jay Powell made it clear he was ending his rate hike cycle and would be patient going forward.</p><p>So the thinking here, I think, is that the Fed could in the end make an insurance policy rate cut to mitigate any potential fallout from the trade war at this stage.</p><p>The logic of course if I use firefighting terms here is it's a bit too late to buy insurance once the fire has actually started here. Plenty of reasons to suggest that fire may have already started.</p><p>Let me walk you through some of the signals that we've seen. The World Bank lowering its global growth forecast once again today.</p><p>We've had U.S. manufacturing activity, weakening to the lowest level of the Trump presidency. Oil prices approaching bear market territory on demand. We've got key inventory data to watch for this morning, too, and on the corporate side, Tiffany providing a tariff-related sales warning yesterday; while overnight, just to add to it, Beijing said it will fine car maker, Ford's China subsidiary over a pricing dispute. Uniquely, interesting timing says the skeptic in me.</p><p>In just the past hour, we've also received what could be troubling news from the jobs market, too. ADP saying only 27,000 private sector jobs were added to the U.S. economy last month. That is way below expectations. It's also the weakest month for growth since 2010.</p><p>We will get the official payrolls numbers on Friday, too, that, if any is a signal, I think to President Trump, perhaps a warning here about the impact of concerns about a broader trade war.</p><p>We've also got, though the Global Central Bank is acting here as a potential backstop and front and center, Jay Powell, of course, if the Fed cuts rates, it will join a whole wave of global easing. Australia cutting rates this week. India might cut rates tomorrow and watch what the European Central Bank says on Thursday of this week, too.</p><p>Interesting. All right. Speaking of a wave of nations coming together, let's get to the drivers.</p><p>World leaders coming together in Portsmouth in the south of England to commemorate 75 years since the D-Day landings. President Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, the British Prime Minister, of course, Theresa May and the Queen -- all in attendance marking the 75 years since the Allied invasion of Normandy, a decisive battle that led to the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany.</p><p>Phil Black is in Portsmouth for us. As I mentioned, world leaders, Phil, but this is about commemorating those that fought, those that lost their lives 75 years ago in what was such a pivotal moment in World War II.</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Julia. Yes, so 15 world leaders from countries that took part in the D-Day landings traveled to be here today. But the event itself, the focus of this ceremony, which has unfolded here this afternoon has really been about those who stormed the beaches, who jumped from the planes, who provided the logistical and air and sea support that made this operation, this extraordinary military operation possible 75 years ago.</p><p>It was to honor their courage, sacrifice, and of course their loss as well.</p><p>[09:05:01] BLACK: The 130,000 plus soldiers who actually stormed the beaches, who ran towards the fortified German positions along the sands of Normandy, and of course, ultimately, the consequence of that extraordinary bravery, extraordinary organization, the turning of the tide of the war, ultimately contributing to the outcome, which was allied victory over Nazi Germany.</p><p>All of that was what we saw unfold here today in a very slick, poignant, and yet at times, upbeat production. We heard testimony, accounts, correspondence, firsthand tellings of what it was like, at that time from soldiers and so forth.</p><p>And at the same time, we heard really rousing performances from a military band of popular culture and music, from around that time, as well.</p><p>And then to draw it all to a close, there was the Queen who simply said, \"On behalf of the free world, we thank you.\" And so it was that really strong gesture of gratitude to the men who went on and through their bravery went on to essentially change the course of history 75 years ago here -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We've just seen images and we've got pictures for you. President Trump, of course, his third day of the State Visit in the U.K., saying goodbye to the Queen, of course, before they then head back home after a few more meetings here.</p><p>To your point, Phil, incredibly pivotal moment, I think more broadly for what we're seeing broader tensions in the world and the comparison of the time so long ago, where the Allies all came together here to work together, poignant, I think at this moment in time.</p><p>BLACK: Indeed, true and really taps into what I think has been one of the dominant themes of President Trump's State Visit here, particularly from the British side, repeatedly stressed really, and that is that what matters here is the relationship, the shared history, the shared values, the things that have been accomplished together now over such a long stretch of time who happens to be leading each country right now isn't really as important.</p><p>It is about what has been achieved and what can continue to be achieved through both the British and American Alliance and in terms of today's D- Day commemoration, in a broader sense, international cooperation, as well through multilateralism, through these alliances and close coordination essentially.</p><p>It is all about what can be done. That has been the overall theme that has what has really mattered, I think, from the British side, in particular, President Trump's State Visit, which as you say is now formally drawing to a close as the President says goodbye to the Queen, and moves on to the Ireland --Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Phil Black there, the power of unity, I think. Thank you so much for that. All right. Let's move on to our next driver, and now back to the markets and the apparent soothing words of the Fed Chief, Jay Powell resulting in the second best day of the year for U.S. stock markets. Listen in to what he had to say yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook, and as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Christine Romans joins us now. Christine, that's all it took -- the magic words. I mean, in my mind, all he said was that we're going to do our job as we've always done, no promises. And yet the market was like, well, we believe you, Jay, you're going to be there.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: \"I promise to do my job,\" and the stock market rallies. Look, it also gives the President cover to continue his trade wars. His trade wars now on multiple fronts. And this is a market that is perceiving those Powell comments to me that, \"Look, whereas a few months ago, we were we will wait and see, we don't know what we're going to do. We could raise we could cut. Now the next move would be a cut.\"</p><p>And that is how the markets are perceiving it a cut because the President's trade wars could be damaging to the global economy and to the U.S. economy and you will need the stabilizer, the shock absorber, if you will, of the Fed actually doing its job.</p><p>It's interesting because in political circles, there are those who are scratching their heads saying, \"This is a man, the Fed chief who has been criticized roundly by this President,\" who has said he regretted -- privately said he had regretted appointing him to the Fed Chief. He wanted rates to be cut because he thought that he deserved to have low rates because President Obama had low rates, and that helped the economy under him.</p><p>And now Jay Powell, in effect, because of the President's trade wars has to deal with the President who has been complaining about it all along.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I ask myself, who is in charge here? Is it the markets? Is it the Federal Reserve or is it President Trump?</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Because everyone is chasing everyone else's tails here, I think. Risks for me here, one, what happens if we do see a conclusion to the trade battles that are going on simply because the President does know how important the economy is to 2020 here, but even to bring it to the absolute short term, those ADP numbers today for me, Christine are warning, I think, particularly from small businesses that if they're unsure, they're going to cut spending, and they do it fast.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. So let's remind your viewers what those ADP numbers were, it was the weakest job growth in the private sector, according to this ADP payroll survey in nine years, and a really quick weakening there.</p><p>I mean, the dramatic reversal of how especially small and midsize businesses just put on the brakes, is something that I think is really important to watch.</p><p>Now, you don't always see the ADP perfectly reflect what happens in the jobs report. That jobs report comes out on Friday, but sometimes, sometimes they do. And that is definitely a warning signal here.</p><p>The other thing is, look if the President ends his trade wars overnight, what kinds of uncertainties are already baked in? What kind of -- as you pointed out earlier in your lead, what kind of fire is already starting to burn? Who knows where in the economy that could be a problem going forward?</p><p>So I think this is kind of a very tricky time here right now, especially for stock market investors. The other thing I would point out is that sometimes what's best for the economy isn't necessarily what's best for the stock market.</p><p>So right now, the stock market thinks that Jay Powell is going to be acting in its best interest all along. Well, I mean, at some point, you know, Jay Powell has got to do what's best for employment or what's best for inflation.</p><p>I think the resilience that we're showing you on the screen here, Julia, because I wanted to sort of remind viewers that the stock market has been very resilient this year, even with the threats of trade wars, and I think one of the reasons is because many investors have just never thought that the Fed would let -- wouldn't be there as a backstop if the President were to somehow wreck the American economy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, so many great points in there, Christine. Don't conflate the stock market with the economy. But if you look at small caps, the underperformance there, perhaps more closely tied to what we're seeing in the domestic economy. Christine Romans, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, we need to a cue that Queen song, \"Don't Stop Me Now,\" because the President Trump doubling down on his threats to Mexico.</p><p>Yesterday, he said that the threat of tariffs is no bluff. Mexican officials, of course in Washington to try and find a solution here. Paula Newton is in Mexico City for us, too.</p><p>Paula, great to have you with us. It is interesting, because I saw the comments from the Mexican Foreign Minister yesterday giving an 80 percent probability that a resolution would be found here. It's a marked contrast with the threats that we continue to get from President Trump here.</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: He sounds like a gambler, doesn't he, Julia? I mean, 80 percent, I can tell you from what I know from negotiators going into the Oval Office, they haven't given 80 percent to anything in terms of the President going through with what he has already been determined to do.</p><p>So this is great confidence from the Mexican government. I can tell you why, Julia. They, today will present not just to Mr. Lighthizer, the Trade Representative, but also to the Vice President Mike Pence. They will continue to present figures, new figures that CNN just got, which says that Mexico has been deporting migrants at a much increased rate, 2.5 times the rate that they had been late last year.</p><p>And they say they're doing all they can. Julia, the strategy here is to try and significantly delink the issue of tariffs to the issue of migration.</p><p>Mexico is trying to show that look, we are doing all they can. Work with us. Work was with us to try and work with those Central American countries to get people to stop going north through Mexico and to the U.S. border and we'll have a lot more luck in terms of trying to stem the significant numbers that we continue to see crossing that border from Mexico into the United States.</p><p>Julia, the issue is here. What will it take? And even Republican senators in the United States who have been very vocal in opposing these tariffs have said, \"What is it going to take? What do we have to show the President so that he'll be satisfied that Mexico is doing all it can?\"</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and that was going to be my follow up because there is a stark contrast here in the United States how Congress is acting towards the situation with Mexico versus China.</p><p>Congress, seemingly the Democrats and the Republicans on board with being firmer with China here, but alarm particularly from senior Republicans like Senator Grassley, John Kennedy all going, \"This is the wrong move here and it's going to compromise the NAFTA mark two deal, hereto.\"</p><p>NEWTON: And that's the issue. Remember that in trying to hold the line, to try and get China to change its behavior when it comes to trade, to deal with things like intellectual property, they thought great, we have that USMCA, that new trade deal -- Canada, the U.S. and Mexico -- it was on its way, Julia there with implementation and legislation.</p><p>In fact, Mike Pence was on Capitol Hill this week to talk about the USMCA not to try and get some kind of concessions from Mexico and everything else. And when you talk about those Republicans in their own constituencies, they want that trade deal with Mexico and Canada, and they do not want those tariffs and that's what the Trump administration will be hearing loud and clear.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, we'll see what comes of those talks. Paula Newton, thank you so much for that.</p><p>[09:15:08] CHATTERLEY: All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we are following around the world.</p><p>Police have caught the suspect behind a mass shooting in Darwin, Australia. Four people were killed when a gunman opened fire at several locations on Tuesday night. Local media reports say the 45-year-old suspect was on parole at the time of the shooting.</p><p>Cardinal George Pell's appeal hearing at an Australian court has wrapped up for the day. Pell is appealing his six-year prison sentence for molesting two choir boys. His lawyers argued the form of Vatican Treasurer didn't get a fair trial. If judges overturn his conviction, he could walk free. The hearing will continue on Thursday.</p><p>The U.S. clamping down on Cuba. You're looking at pictures of one of the last American cruise ships to leave Havana harbor as new travel restrictions come into force to include blocking access for organized tour groups and banning U.S. cruise ships from docking in the island.</p><p>Patrick Oppmann joins us now from Havana, Cuba. Patrick, what are people in Havana saying at this moment? And can you quantify the impact because I believe American tourists is second only to the Canadians actually visiting Cuba right now.</p><p>PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's absolutely correct, and it's something that's grown very quickly over the last few years, thanks in part to cruise ships.</p><p>And behind me is actually the last cruise ship in Havana. Royal Caribbean says that their ship, The Empress of the Seas is scheduled to depart this afternoon and starting midnight tonight that will no longer be allowed, that American cruise ships are now banned from coming into Cuba.</p><p>They've only been doing this kind of travel for the last few years, but it has grown exponentially. It has brought a lot of money to the Cuban government and that is why the Trump administration says that they're clamping down. They feel the Cuban government aid to the Maduro regime in Venezuela has kept Nicolas Maduro in power.</p><p>And that they feel by denying the Cuban government tourism dollars, that that will have some kind of impact for Savannah to change their behavior.</p><p>Of course, by doing that, by getting rid of the largest legal category that allows Americans to come here, the so-called people to people travel, they're also denying the Cuban people a lot of money.</p><p>And you know, I live here and over the last several years, everywhere you look, Cubans are fixing up their apartments or homes to either rent out or turn into restaurants to deal with the increased demand, really amazing growth of U.S. tourism, U.S. visitors to the island that is going to wind down starting today.</p><p>You'll still have U.S. airlines coming here, but we expect many less passengers because while there are other categories of legal travel, the people to people travel was the largest one that allowed large groups like the groups that come aboard cruise ships to come here.</p><p>Cuban officials were hoping to have as many as a million U.S. visitors this year. It would have been about a quarter of the market. They're building hotels all over the city and you just have to wonder what is going to happen to them now. All the same, though, despite the demands from the Trump administration for the Cuban government to change their policies across the region, the Cuban government says that they've endured U.S. sanctions for 60 years and nothing is going to change.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the question is will it? Patrick Oppmann, thank you so much for joining us there from Havana Cuba.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but coming up, how about adding a living wage to your shopping list? Bernie Sanders is taking on Walmart and certainly, will try.</p><p>And the tricks of the trade, venture capitalist Scott Kupor shares his pearls of wisdom. That's coming up. Stay with CNN.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE, live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange still looking like a solid higher open for U.S. stocks to add to the gains that we saw in yesterday's session, the second best session of the year, of course.</p><p>But we have seen the shine taken off by those payrolls numbers. The private payrolls from ADP this morning, only 27,000 U.S. jobs created last month, significantly weaker than expected. Some alarm it seems from some of the smaller businesses here in the United States.</p><p>Let's talk quickly what we're seeing right now. Julian Emanuel is the Chief Equity and Derivatives Strategist at BTIG and joins us now. Always a pleasure to have you on the show.</p><p>JULIAN EMANUEL, CHIEF EQUITY AND DERIVATIVES STRATEGIST, BTIG: Great to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Now the last time you were here, you were way out of consensus talking about two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. And now you're among the most optimistic.</p><p>EMANUEL: Well, and in fact, over the last several days, particularly given the Feds term in Chicago in their conference, we may be a bit conservative, as you mentioned. And the data that we saw this morning would lead us to believe that there are rate cuts coming.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I am going there next. Talk about the data and those jobs numbers from ADP in particular. But to your point about Jay Powell, I'm a bit confused. I made the point earlier on the show with the Christine Romans, didn't Jay Powell make no promises, only promised to do what his job is, which is if we see an impact on the U.S. economy, react. Why is the Fed so up -- the market here is so optimistic?</p><p>EMANUEL: Well, if you go back to the end of last year, and the turmoil in the markets, and the seeming lack of understanding of the market response from the part of Jay Powell, he pivoted very, very quickly to where there was no more hikes, you know, literally two weeks later. And that gave the markets confidence.</p><p>Obviously, we've seen that in the stock rally year-to-date. The market believes that the Fed is learning as it goes along and the Fed understands that the downside risks need to be mitigated here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay. So to your point on the jobs numbers this morning, if Federal Reserve is learning that it needs to signal, look, we get it, we understand the risks here. We're on top of this. What about the U.S. President learning that perhaps tariff threats have consequences and the small businesses in particular, when they're concerned about the upcoming risks, they cut spending, they cut hiring because that's kind of what we're seeing in these numbers.</p><p>EMANUEL: It's definitely a risk and if you look at the bigger picture macro over the last several months, obviously, inflation breakeven have been coming down, commodity prices have been coming down.</p><p>All of that tells you the trade war is not inflationary, it is disinflationary. And from that perspective, the jobs number really reinforces the fact that we probably need to find some sort of workable solution to our trade woes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'm glad you mentioned commodity prices here, too. I mean, oil prices have come right down in the last month. We've got inventory data to watch, too.</p><p>Talk to me about your energy sector call here because this is interesting for investors looking at a situation where there's unknown risks on trade. We've got the Federal Reserve indicating they may cut rates this year. Energy for me is an interesting one to be looking at. For you?</p><p>[09:25:00] EMANUEL: Yes, indeed. So it is predicated on the fact that between the Fed and reconciling trade wars, the economic recovery is going to continue. We're in a slowdown, absolutely. But we do think that growth will continue.</p><p>And from that perspective, this late in the cycle, energy tends to work well, particularly into Fed rate cuts. And we have to remember, there's been a lot of corporate activity in the sector, there's a lot of cash, and the stocks have not followed the oil price to the highs.</p><p>They've obviously moved down and tandem, but they still look relatively attractive and right for consolidation.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So there is catch up to be done in the stocks even now relative to oil prices.</p><p>EMANUEL: That's right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, what about for financials here, then to, particularly if we go from a situation where we're concerned about an inverted yield curve, do the Fed back to cutting rates again, that's got to be kind of nice for financials here as well.</p><p>EMANUEL Yes. And paradoxically, it's a little difficult to understand given the fact that rates have come in so much over the last several weeks. But the message this morning is that the slope of the yield curve is steepening.</p><p>The Fed is on watch. The Fed is going to cut. That's actually going to backstop the longer day to deals. Financials love a steepening yield curve.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And very quickly, you said slowdown, but no recession. So despite a lot of the big banks this week going, we could see a recession even in the next nine months to 12 months if we see an escalation of the trade war. You're saying, at this stage, no recession.</p><p>EMANUEL: Well, look, if we got a 25 percent tariffs worldwide on just about everything, all bets are off. But the assumption is that there is going to be some sort of workaround, and the fact is, even with this morning's weak payrolls data, the economy is still on good footing.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Julian, always a pleasure to have you on the show. Julian Emanuel there of BTIG. We've got the market open coming up after this. Stay with us. You're watching FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE, I'm Julia Chatterley live from the New York Stock Exchange this Wednesday morning.</p><p>We were anticipating a higher open for the U.S. stock markets adding to yesterday's proper gains and it looks like that's what we've got, despite, as we've mentioned already a couple of times now on the show that weaker than expected payrolls -- private payrolls numbers from ADP, just 27,000 jobs added last month.</p><p>Yes, it's still gains, but it was significantly weaker than expected. In fact, small cap firms slashed 52,000 jobs in May. That says to me there's some deep level of uncertainty in the smaller firms in the United States, an interesting morning there.</p><p>Also, the 10-year bond yields still moving lower down below 2.1 percent. Again, we did bounce off 20-month lows yesterday, but I think just reconfirming what we got from Jay Powell yesterday or the perception of what we got, which is if necessary, rates will come down.</p><p>All right, so let me walk you through some of our global movers. Stocks in focus in this session. Tesla in focus, the electric car maker, in fact, having its best day of 2019 yesterday, closing up more than 8 percent, it has added more than $2 billion to its market cap as a result.</p><p>Morgan Stanley also reiterating that equal weight rating and a $230.00 price target, so just for perspective, that's 20 percent higher than where the shares are trading today.</p><p>They're still down some 40 percent so far this year. The question is, as some investors are arguing, they now look a little bit over sold. Right now, what we are seeing, Tesla higher in the session so far.</p><p>Campbell Soup, also in focus, the quarterly earnings and revenues beating expectations. The soup maker also raised its full-year outlook. Sales jumping more than 12 percent. It boosted by high demand for it snack brands like Pepperidge Farm, and Goldfish.</p><p>Walmart also in focus. The CEO vows to keep prices as low as possible. It says the company wants to be a quote \"champion of the customer.\" The retailer warned last month that the U.S. trade wall will result in higher prices.</p><p>Those comments of course, ahead of the company's shareholder meetings today and will be looking to see if they say anything more on the prospect of higher prices right now.</p><p>But that's not the only thing in focus, because there's also going to be some pretty high profile attendees, including Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders. Some fiery tweets ahead of this meeting, too.</p><p>Coming into this meeting, he said, \"Walmart pays his employees so little that many are forced to go to Medicaid and food stamps to survive. Next week, I'm going to Bentonville, Arkansas to tell the Walton family of Walmart, the wealthiest family in America, 'Get off welfare, pay your workers a living wage.'\"</p><p>Ryan Nobles joins us now because he is there. Ryan, some really punchy words from Bernie Sanders though we've heard this time and time again, he simply wants them to raise the minimum wage here.</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Julia. And you know, this is not out of the ordinary for Bernie Sanders. The Walton family, which has the controlling interest in Walmart is a regular target for Bernie Sanders on the campaign trail.</p><p>What is different here today is that he is actually going to be in front of the CEO, in front of their Board of Directors and he is going to get the opportunity to speak for three minutes during their shareholders meeting today.</p><p>And we do expect him to talk a lot about paying their workers more, but the principal reason he is here to speak is because he has been given the opportunity, handed over this designation by a former associate who is asking for the Walmart Board of Directors to put a seat on their Board for their associates to allow employees to have a voice at the table.</p><p>And so what Sanders is going want to argue is that Walmart needs to listen to its employees more, and the best way to do that is by having someone sitting at the table. If that happens, and perhaps a working environment is better for these employees, they'll get paid more and in general, their lives will be better.</p><p>Of course, surely, Walmart pushing back on this in a big way saying that their associates are one of their top priorities. This is of course, is a big week of celebration for Walmart associates, which ends in really what is essentially a big party where they bring in around 5,000 different employees from all around the world here to Northwest Arkansas.</p><p>So this is a big showdown, Julia, and I think essentially what Bernie Sanders is attempting to show Democratic primary voters here in the United States is that this is the type of President he will be, not afraid to go face to face with corporate CEOs and demand that they do more for their workers -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great point, well and truly on the campaign trail, but to Walmart's point, though, here, they are facing increasing competition from the likes of Amazon who are raising the minimum wage. So it will be an interesting one to see the broader reaction, the reception that they get.</p><p>Ryan Nobles, you have a busy day ahead. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>[09:35:03] CHATTERLEY: All right, as politics and business, of course go hand in hand at Walmart, Washington has found a common enemy, it seems in the form big tech.</p><p>Yesterday, on \"Quest Means Business,\" I spoke to a former acting head of the Federal Trade Commission, Maureen Ohlhausen and she said it's too early to be calling for more regulation. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAUREEN K. OHLHAUSEN, FORMER ACTING HEAD OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: I disagree that we necessarily need more regulation. I think the question is, is there any competitive conduct happening in the markets today? Do the agencies have the right level of enforcement and the right tools to challenge it?</p><p>And then if there is a decision that there's any competitive conduct, and somehow it can't be reached. I think at that point is where the discussion is necessary to say, do the antitrust laws need to do something different?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: She was arguing, quite frankly, right now, she doesn't really see it. But she also agreed that if we do see more regulation, it could take years to come.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OHLHAUSEN: If there is an enforcement action, if any of these changes or signals lead to any kind of investigations, then complaints, then litigation through the courts, it will take several years.</p><p>Now Congress is considering -- some members of Congress, Mr. Cicilline in particular mentioned this, they are considering whether the antitrust law should be changed. I think that also would take several years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Matt Egan joins us now. Matt, that didn't stop investors wiping out what? $130 billion worth of wealth in this session when we got that news, was it two days ago? Even if we don't see immediate regulation, it doesn't mean that these big guys get away unscathed. Talk me through this.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Julia, these are alarming developments for investors and not just ones who own shares in big tech, you know, Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon -- these really are the stocks that represent the heart of the bull market.</p><p>If you look at their combined values, they represent 11 percent of the S&amp;P 500. So that means really, whatever happens here has broad implications for all investors. And so I think that the problem right now is no one really knows what's going to happen right now. This has just sort of opened up Pandora's Box for investors.</p><p>I mean, no one knows if this means that regulators are in fact going to try to break up some of these dominant companies. Does that mean that Congress is going to write tough new laws or maybe just mediocre or weaker ones? We don't know if maybe this will just all go away with a slap on the wrist such as a fine.</p><p>So I think that this does mean that the uncertainty will create an overhang on these stocks that might not go away for years. That means volatility, it means that earnings multiples are going to come down, even if earnings estimates don't.</p><p>But I do think it's important not to panic here, you know, these companies have amassed just an enormous amount of money. If you look at just Facebook and Alphabet. Alphabet alone, those are the two companies that maybe are at most risk here, they have a combined $150 billion in cash. That's money that they could use to pay, you know, even the biggest fines. They can use that money to buy the best legal defense that money can buy.</p><p>And, you know, some of the analysts that I spoke to, they're a little bit skeptical that regulators can prove an antitrust case, particularly around the issue of consumer harm. And one professor, even joked that, you know, rather than shorting big tech, right now, the best move for investors is to go long into law firms that have antitrust experience.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And that's exactly what my view was having had that conversation with Maureen Ohlhausen yesterday, it was, when we see $130 billion wiped out from the share prices, there is no way in our wildest dreams that any kind of fine will be that big. It is a buying opportunity.</p><p>Bigger question for me though here is about innovation. Listen to what Tim Cook had to say yesterday about whether or not Apple has monopoly power here. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: At this size, I think scrutiny is fair. I think we should be scrutinized. I don't think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple is a monopoly.</p><p>Our share is much more modest. We don't have a dominant position in any market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The challenge here, I think, for greater regulation going forward is it has got to be a balance between making sure they're not too powerful, but also not stemming innovation.</p><p>EGAN: Right. No, I think that's a great point. You know, when you look at these big four tech companies, they've all invested huge sums of money in artificial intelligence and quantum computing and machine learning. Next generation technologies that could fuel the economy of the United States for the decades to come.</p><p>So Washington needs to be careful here. If they crack down too much, if they come down too hard on big tech, you know, they risk stifling innovation, and that would come at a time when really the tech Cold War with China is escalating.</p><p>[09:40:10] EGAN: So we'll have to see whether or not regulators are able to find that balance between, you know, enforcing the laws and making sure that no one is too dominant but also not stifling innovation.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Fascinating to watch. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that. Now, speaking of innovation, how about getting the financing for some bright ideas. Coming up, we're going to be speaking to Andreessen Horowitz veteran spilling some at least of Silicon Valley's investment secrets. Stay with us, that's coming up.</p><p>[09:43:46] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and we are in the \"Chatt Room.\" Can't get my words out.</p><p>What Wall Street is to big finance, Sand Hill Road is to Silicon Valley, the whole Americas venture capital scene and joining us now is a veteran of that world. And importantly, a man willing to at least give some of his pearls of wisdom in \"The Chatt Room,\" Scott Kupor, author of \"Secrets of Sand Hill Road: Venture Capital, and How to Get it.\" And of course, managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz. Fantastic to have you here.</p><p>SCOTT KUPOR, MANAGING PARTNER, ANDREESSEN HOROWITZ: Thank you for having me.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Talk to me about the premise of the book, because it's -- from my understanding from reading it, I thought it was a great book, just pearls of wisdom about how best to go about raising money.</p><p>KUPOR: Right. Yes, you know, it's funny. I've been in the tech business for about 25 years now and we've been doing venture for 10. And I was amazed at -- I kept getting the same questions from entrepreneurs over time, you know, should I take venture capital money? What does it mean to do so? How do I work with them?</p><p>And you know, in some cases, how do I make sure I don't get taken advantage of? And so I felt like it was just time to kind of, you know, eliminate a lot of the information barriers that happen in this industry and hopefully, maybe that encourages more entrepreneurship, too.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What do you want to see from someone that they come into -- in the book you are saying, tell a great story, convince me that you deserve my money.</p><p>KUPOR: Yes, well, storytelling is a really big component, right? Because you can imagine, you're competing for talent, you're competing our customers. And, you know, by the way, storytelling in the good way, of course not you know, hoodwinking people but you know, really having a vision, you know, getting -- saying something that forces people to kind of want to line up behind you, and in some cases, it might not be rational for them to do so.</p><p>[09:45:12] CHATTERLEY: But when you look at a company or someone, a founder of a company that comes in, do you go, \"Look, is this a company that I can see going public one day? Can this have a three, four, five billion dollar valuation?\" Do you make that kind of assessment early?</p><p>KUPOR: Yes. When we're doing early stuff, we like to think of the question as it's kind of what if, right? Imagine if this is successful, what could it be? And you're absolutely right, we have to at least believe that it could be a standalone public company and that probably these days doesn't mean it has got to be a multibillion dollar company, because we know that the small cap IPO market just doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Why?</p><p>KUPOR: Yes, it's a long -- it's a long story, longer than we have. But I think what's happened is a lot of the changes that happen in the markets over the years were geared towards efficiency and efficiency is great, you know, kind of people pay lower costs than they've ever paid before.</p><p>But for stocks that are small volume, and don't trade as much, a lot of that efficiency is a problem. So most of the investors, most of the research analysts have all moved upstream.</p><p>And so if you're a small cap company, you probably don't have research, you probably don't have market makers, you probably don't have people like yourselves covering them, it's just a hard place to be.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting what we've seen just in the last few weeks, with Uber going public, with Lyft, to some degree as well. Asking big questions about whether or not there's a valuation problem in the private markets.</p><p>You're giving these companies too much money, they stay private longer and then when they try and go public, in the end, there's a sort of valuation mismatch between what the private market is willing to give them versus how the public perceives them. Is there a problem in the private markets right now in judging value?</p><p>KUPOR: I don't think so, and I think it is very company specific. And by the way, we are Lyft investors, so in full disclosure, so I think if you really look at kind of the IPOs we've had in tech, there's kind of, you know, traditional enterprise software IPOs.</p><p>So something like a Zoom, which is also -- it's not a company of ours, but you know, something like that is trading incredibly well. Beyond Meats has traded very well.</p><p>And so I think companies that are growing at reasonable rates, but also have near-term visibility towards cash generation, the market is really treating favorably.</p><p>I think when you have a backdrop of lots of the macro uncertainty that we have and you have companies like Uber and Lyft, where you know, the profitability is still deferred for a period of time, I think you should expect there probably will be more volatility there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is there a timing question here to like don't leave it too long. Is that the big takeaway here, too?</p><p>KUPOR: I think that's right. If you look, again, we're not Uber investors. But if you look at Uber, the core ride hailing business is actually not growing that well, right? Most of the growth is coming from Uber Eats and some of their ancillary businesses.</p><p>And so I think you're right, you're kind of -- if you're going to go public, you have to be at the right point of your product cycle, where you still have growth that's actually really attractive to the public markets.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Antitrust. Talk to me about action. Do you think it comes? Does it take years? And is it necessary in your mind?</p><p>KUPOR: I think it will take years probably. I do think there's a broader question, which is, I think, in the technology industry, we have not done a good job of kind of appreciating kind of the impact of technology, you know, in many areas.</p><p>You know, I live in Silicon Valley, and mostly what we see is just the benefits of technology, but you know, those benefits are perceived differently elsewhere.</p><p>And so I think as an industry, we have an obligation to spend more time to D.C., really spend time with regulators and quite frankly, better understand how we can get regulation that makes sense, and also kind of economic growth and entrepreneurship in a way that helps everybody.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How does Silicon Valley look at Facebook right now? Because that's a company that has had huge challenges. But advertisers aren't doing anything differently. Customers aren't switching off, users aren't switching off. But it has some challenges.</p><p>KUPOR: No doubt. Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is this just teething issues? Will they be fine in the end? Or do you look at this and go, actually, this is one where government is needed?</p><p>KUPOR: Yes, So my partner, Marc Andreessen is on the Board, so just in full disclosure. Yes, look, I think the Silicon Valley still has just tremendous respect and admiration for what they've built. I mean, it's amazing when you think about it, right?</p><p>It's basically a 14-year-old company or so. And, you know, they have what, two plus billion users, you know, incredible market cap? Yes, look, I think what they need to do is I think they have to also -- it goes back to the prior point, they just have to recognize and realize that look, all the wonderful things they've accomplished, you know, in all cases, maybe people do worry about, you know, things like privacy and other stuff that's out there.</p><p>And so, I think it will be a renewed call for a conversation between D.C. and Silicon Valley.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And final question, because this ties very much to the book as well. Seventy five percent of venture capital money focuses on three specific places -- California, New York, Massachusetts. That to me is crazy. How do we change that?</p><p>KUPOR: Yes, it is a real problem. And I totally agree with it. And one of the things that I hope the book will do is partly just educate more people about the system. And hopefully we get entrepreneurship that's more broadly distributed across the U.S.</p><p>We're already seeing it internationally. So you know, venture capital used to be almost entirely U.S., but 90 percent of venture capital dollars 20 years ago, was in the U.S. Now, that's about 50 percent.</p><p>So we are seeing international expansion. It'll be great to see kind of broader domestic expansion in the U.S., too.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you need to get more planes?</p><p>KUPOR: Exactly right. But that's a perfectly fine thing.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: More e-mails. It's a great book.</p><p>KUPOR: Yes, well, thank you so much. I appreciate you having me.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I really enjoyed it. Thank you, Scott Kupor, speaking there. All right. We're going to take a quick break from Russia with love. That is question as China's leaders visit his bosom friend, Vladimir Putin. We take a closer look at the trade ties that bind them. That's after this. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:52:22] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. China has hit Ford with a $24 million fine. The country's regulators say the car giant's main Chinese joint venture broke antitrust laws by setting minimum resale prices on some of its cars. That fine is just one of the latest measures that China has taken against U.S. companies in recent days.</p><p>On Tuesday, Beijing issued a travel advisory for Chinese citizens and companies planning to visit the United States. That came just after the Chinese government said it was investigating FedEx over a dispute the company has with Huawei.</p><p>And there have also been noises about Beijing preparing a blacklist of foreign companies and of course, using rare earth in its trade war with Washington, too.</p><p>Now Xi Jinping is meeting with a Russian leader Vladimir Putin, the man who China's leader recently called his quote, \"best and bosom friend.\" The pair are expected to cement their economic ties.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen joins us now from Moscow. Fred, great to have you with us. Talk to me about this relationship because these men have met many, many times over the years, but perhaps never more important than today with both countries under severe pressure from the United States and the tensions within that relationship for each.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via phone): Yes, I think you're absolutely right, Julia. And one of the things that the two men pointed out when they started their meeting, there was a short opportunity to see both of them. They said that yes indeed, the relationship they believe works almost better than ever before between Russia and China.</p><p>And you're absolutely right that Xi Jinping called Vladimir Putin one of his best friends. And what they really want to do is they want to keep in those economic ties obviously, if you can have those political ties as well.</p><p>This is the 29th time that the two of them are meeting and the Russians were saying that last year, 2018 trade between Russia and China for the first time exceeded over $100 billion.</p><p>Now, of course, that is a lot, especially for the Russian economy and China is by far Russia's largest trading partner.</p><p>For the Chinese, it's a little bit different. They obviously export still a lot more to the U.S. and to Europe as well. But of course with those very difficult relations with the U.S. really deteriorating for the Chinese, they're feeling some of the pressure that the Russians have been feeling for a very long time.</p><p>Of course, the Russians have been under U.S. and European sanctions for a while now. They've been making that pivot to the east for the past couple of years. It's part of Vladimir Putin's strategic economic plan. And now the Chinese looking to have better relations with the Russians as well.</p><p>Of course, they know that the Russians are not going to be able to make up for some of the losses that they might have because of that trade war with the United States.</p><p>[09:55:10] PLEITGEN: You can certainly see that the two of them are looking to further deepen those economic and political relations as well. They say they want to sign some 30 contracts here when a two men meet.</p><p>A lot of that is commodities. We've been talking about this in the past. A lot of what Russia exports to China, things like, oil, coal, gas becoming a major factor now as well. But the Chinese now really wanting those relations, of course sending a clear signal to Washington as well -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. And of course the head of the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum over the next few days and the United States not present of course.</p><p>Fred, fantastic to have you joining us there. Fred Pleitgen over in Moscow for us.</p><p>All right, so we're wrapping up the show, but let me just give you a look of what we're seeing right now for the U.S. markets. Continuing to add to the gains that we saw yesterday of course.</p><p>The best or the second best day for the U.S. market this year in light of words from Jay Powell power adding to those gains, but a bit of cautiousness as a result of that jobs number this morning, too.</p><p>Plenty to come throughout the day. We will keep you posted. But for now, you've been watching FIRST MOVE, time go to make yours.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019060501cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8R-8KN1-JB20-G1C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8118\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Foreign Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Market</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Holiday</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>D-Day</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>War</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tourism, Government, Politics,</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

This is FIRST MOVE and here is you need to know. Keep calm and cut along as Fed Chair Jay Powell cuts rates and leaves room for more to come. California Dreaming: The Trump administration overrides the state's strict car emissions policy. An All- Out War: Iran's Foreign Minister issues a warning to Saudi Arabia and the U.S. over future military action. It's Thursday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A warm welcome once again to FIRST MOVE and a jam packed show. I tell you, speaking of moves, first came the Federal Reserve's move and then a global central bank bonanza. More words, less action, perhaps on the whole and I'll walk you through that in just a second.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, take a look at features right now. We're pretty flat to a touch higher, a tenth of a percentage. As you can see, it follows a volatile session yesterday, though, net-net, majors ending at the session unchanged.</p><p>I think Jay Powell has to be happy with that. Views of course on what to do next are clearly split, but Powell stressed that the Fed will do more if it needs to, and I think the markets are seeing that right now -- it's a glass half full. Now maybe someone filled President Trump's glass a little hereto. He blasted the Fed, Thursday saying they had failed and they lacked guts.</p><p>But he said on TV today that Powell's job is safe. Good news, because today's job actually is more about plumbing than central banking for Jay Powell.</p><p>The Fed injecting a further $75 billion into the financial system today to keep bank-to-bank lending rates down. Jay Powell said yesterday that a further fix like perhaps bond buying might be needed. It's like a game of whack-a-mole here.</p><p>Let's move on swiftly. European markets are higher right now. We've had the Bank of England holding rates steady and Norway, well and truly swimming against the tide here. They hiked rates today for the fourth time in a year. The Governor said he wants normal, he wants a normal policy rate. What on Earth is normal in this day and age? What a luxury if he can find it.</p><p>Meanwhile, over in Japan, Governor Kuroda was asked whether the Central Bank will provide more support. He said, quote, \"We are eager to act given heightening global risks.\" The question here is, how? And what else do they do here?</p><p>I'll tell you what, in the meantime, Hong Kong not hanging around -- lowering rates once again in the face of those protests. I told you it was a bank bonanza.</p><p>Let's get to the drivers because we're going to talk about the Fed. Clare Sebastian joins us once again on this story. I think it's Powell the plumber to Powell the peacemaker here given the divides on the governing council here, Clare, but he did leave the door open to future cuts. And I think that was what investors at least wanted to hear here.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia. I think the artful dodger is another phrase that people are using to denote Powell today. He certainly made it clear that the Fed would do whatever it takes that they would look at the economy and keep watching the data, and if that prompted them to cut more, they would do that.</p><p>He said the same about the efforts they've been taking to stabilize the overnight lending market, injecting cash into the financial system, he said. While he didn't announce any kind of permanent facility to support that or any immediate rises to the Fed's balance sheet. He said they would continue to support that facility as and when it was needed.</p><p>But look, this is a man, this is a Fed Chair who has been very vocal on the power of forward guidance to actually serve as a tool in monetary policy. He didn't really use that so much today or yesterday when he gave that press conference. He was very kind of non-committal. He said this is all about the data. This is all about going meeting to meeting.</p><p>And this really is probably part of the strategy. He is dealing with a lot of variables here. A trade war, the potential for a hard Brexit. His strategy is not to move the market too far in one direction or the other, not to commit too far in one direction or the other to avoid disappointment and potentially wild swings in the market if one of those variables comes into play.</p><p>So this, you know, was a complex moment for him, and of course, juggling as well those dissenters on the committee complicates that task even further of justifying and explaining why he is making the moves that he is.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, three words. Less is more, as far as the inflammation is concerned. He was of course asked about the prospect of cutting rates below zero. This idea of negative rates that we see in many countries around the world and something that President Trump has also suggested, the Federal Reserve should be using here, just listen in to what he had to say on this point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date, again at the effect of lower bound, again, that's something we're expecting. Then I think we would look at using large scale asset purchases and forward guidance.</p><p>I do not think we'd be looking at using negative rates. I just don't think those will be at the top of our list.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:05:19]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Uh-uh to negative rates here, but Clare, it does underscore an important point that they have other options, unlike other countries around the world.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right. I think that's interesting. We're hearing a lot of concerns around at the moment, Julia that the Fed, you know is doing these insurance cuts that it might be weakening its capacity to act if the U.S. does enter a recession.</p><p>I think this debate around negative interest rates just reinforces the fact that the Fed does still have room -- 1.75 to two percent is not at zero.</p><p>We know that Central Banks in Europe, Denmark, Sweden, and Japan are already below zero. So the Fed, you know, is at an enviable position in some ways compared to them, and I think you know, it's also worth noting that the efficacy of negative rates as a tool for monetary policy isn't always guaranteed.</p><p>It can, for example, hurt banks' profits by, you know, forcing them to pay to park money at the Federal Reserve. So clearly, Jerome Powell making it clear that he would rather use the other tools first. The likes of quantitative easing, and indeed forward guidance to ease further if rates do get zero.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great point here. And I think the other thing to emphasize, I mean, we knew he had a delicate balancing act to find here.</p><p>It was the idea that he managed to incorporate the recent data that we've seen that has seen a bit of a pickup here for the domestic economy, but just emphasizing the sheer degree of uncertainty everywhere else in the world. And that's the balancing act that they've got to find here. Trade, of course, being one of the big risks.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, absolutely. You know, the balancing act, not just because of the very mixed data that we're facing at the moment, but because of that trade uncertainty and he has to create the appearance of not doing what the President wants, of not bowing to political brushes.</p><p>He was forced to answer questions on that again. But of course factoring in the trade war and cutting rates without using rates as a way to encourage the administration to continue the trade war. There are cynics and in fact, invite serious economists out there who've suggested that President Trump is perpetuating this trade war as a way of pushing the Fed into cutting rates.</p><p>So that kind of feedback loop is something that Jerome Powell is also dealing with. It is a hugely complicated situation, not only, Julia, in terms of setting monetary policy, but also in communicating why he is setting it and I think, you know, we saw that in play yesterday.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, managing this certainly takes guts. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much. Despite what the President says.</p><p>Okay, moving on. The Chinese tech giant, Huawei launching an Android smartphone right now and it has chosen the heart of Europe as the place to do it.</p><p>Germany hosting the launch of the Mate 30 and unlike Huawei's earlier handsets for the international market, this one will not have Google services preinstalled. Sherisse Pham joins us now on this story. Interesting location to choose, Sherisse, obviously given the importance of the international market.</p><p>But how excited are international customers going to be if it has the operating system from Android, but doesn't have access to the apps here?</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: As far as we know, it will not have access to the apps. Google Services will not come preinstalled on this very big flagship phone coming from Huawei.</p><p>This is a phone that the last year's version sold for upwards of $800.00, all the way up to more than $1,000.00 for a more professional version of the phone. So analysts are all saying across the board that it's got great hardware.</p><p>I was watching the launch event just before coming into this chair and I can tell you, there are lots of cameras. There are lots of bells and whistles on this phone, lighter battery and longer battery life, four cameras on the back. Kind of one-upping iPhone there. The iPhone 11 that just came with three cameras on the back. But analysts are saying without Google services, this phone will be really hard to sell in international markets and Julia, you kind of address that, right?</p><p>At the top of this launch saying, you know, this has been quite a challenging year for Huawei, a little bit of an understatement there. A couple of the details we got from the launch so far, which is still happening as we speak, is that Huawei is going to launch the Mate X fold, their foldable smartphone, something that's supposed to rival Samsung's foldable phone next month, but only in the China market, and that is a really interesting clue because there has been chatter and some reports that this Mate 30 series, this latest flagship phone from Huawei will not sell in key international markets -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And I mean, a lot of people were saying this was going to be a key challenger to the iPhone 11 here. Four cameras, not three, to your point as well. But yes, the difficulty without these apps. Sherisse Pham in Hong Kong. Thank you so much for the update there.</p><p>All right. Let's move on to our next driver. California's right to impose vehicle emission standards is being officially overturned today by the U.S. Federal government.</p><p>[09:10:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It says automakers can't meet the tough standards imposed by President Obama to combat climate change. Tom Foreman is in D.C. and joins us on the story. Tom, interesting one here and already being challenged by California, but it kind of had a domino effect here in that automakers' then created cars with standards that would comply with this for other states and other states also followed suit. So it's about far more than California here surely.</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. This is not something that these states, about 40 percent of the driving public represented in these various states have agreed to this sort of thing. They're saying that's fine with them. The automakers' have signed on to doing this.</p><p>But now the Trump administration is saying emphatically, no, this cannot happen. There can be only one Federal standard. It has to be the Trump standard which is less stringent in terms of emissions than the California standard.</p><p>But listen to what the Transportation Secretary says as they've announced this roll back on what California is doing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELAINE CHAO, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: No state has the authority to opt out of the nation's rules, and no state has the right to impose its policies on everybody else and our whole country. To do otherwise harms consumers and damages the American economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOREMAN: Now, the White House is arguing, the administration is saying that basically the California standards are unreachable and that they're going to put this huge burden on the auto industry and everyone else, and they're saying that by rolling it back, you will actually produce more cars at a cheaper cost. People will buy more of them and that will lower emissions overall.</p><p>But I must say, you have to understand politically in this country, for a Republican administration to do this is absolutely just 180 degrees opposite of what Republicans have argued for years.</p><p>Republicans here for years have said, states should be able to make their own choices about where they're going forward. The Federal government should not be this onerous hand reaching in saying it has to be our way. They've said that many times over Democratic proposals that tried to have won national standard for all sorts of things. And yet now, here is a Republican administration saying no, no, it's unthinkable that this would happen.</p><p>This fight is absolutely going to the courts, and we'll see what the courts have to say about it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, automakers and consumers aside, the lawyers here are rubbing their hands together. Well, we will watch this space. Tom Foreman. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>FOREMAN: You're welcome, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories making headlines around the world. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has told CNN that there could be quote, \"all-out war\" if the U.S. or Saudi Arabia launches strikes against it.</p><p>Those two countries are accusing Iran of being behind attacks on Saudi oil facilities last weekend. Zarif spoke exclusively to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What would be the consequences of a Saudi military strike on Iran now?</p><p>MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: An all-out war. An all- out war.</p><p>PATON WALSH: You make a very serious statement, Minister. A very serious statement there, sir.</p><p>ZARIF: Well, I make a very serious statement about defending our country. I'm making a very serious statement that we don't want war. We don't want to engage in a military confrontation. We believe that a military confrontation based on deception is awful, it will have a lot of casualties.</p><p>But we won't blink to defend our territory.</p><p>PATON WALSH: Put yourself in Saudi Arabia's shoes. If there was an attack on Iranian sovereign territory with cruise missiles launched from Saudi Arabia. What would Iran's response be?</p><p>ZARIF: Well, they are making that up. Why do they want to make that up that it was from Iranian territory? The Yemenis have announced responsibility for that. They have provided information about that. They have answered all the Saudi disinformation campaign about the fact that they launched this attack against Saudi Arabia in self-defense.</p><p>Now they want to pin the blame on Iran in order to achieve something and that is why I'm saying this is agitation for war. Because it's based on lies. It is based on deception. But you lie and deceive men, it serves your interest. It doesn't even serve their interest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You'll see more of this exclusive interview with the Iranian Foreign Minister in the next hour. John Defterios joins us now though, on this story. John, I'm just watching what's going on in oil prices today and we've had an incredibly volatile week.</p><p>The truth here is when we have a problem for Saudi Arabia that impacts oil in that country, it has global ramifications. Does a solution here ultimately, if you talk to the Saudis here have to be an international solution here because it's clearly going to be a hot topic at the UN next week?</p><p>[09:15:11]</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, it's a fantastic point, Julia, because you'd have to be numb not to feel what's been going on here in Saudi Arabia at every presentation, for example, the Ministry of Defense, it was mentioned, Abdulaziz bin Salman, the Minister of Energy said at the press conference last night, and then we even had Mohammad bin Salman, the Crown Prince says putting out transcripts of his calls with the President of South Korea and the Prime Minister of Japan saying it is a global response that's needed here, and why it is needed at this stage.</p><p>Now, even the French Foreign Minister was suggesting that it couldn't have been the Houthis doing an attack of that scale because the sophistication was way too high, and they're following the tracking that Saudi Arabia is presenting to them.</p><p>So you could see a case here, a win for Saudi Arabia and I'm not taking out a response into that conversation here and attack back on Iran. But a win would be not just maritime security, and there's a coalition already formed with the United States and the U.K., maybe the French joining that.</p><p>But to get the protection of the facilities in Dhahran, because the mother lode was hit, they knocked down 250 missiles or drone attacks over the last couple of years. But you can imagine that stretching all the way to the west right here in Jeddah, and going north to the Yanbu Port, which has a big refinery there on the Red Sea.</p><p>If they could get that narrative, the political support, and also the physical support going into the United Nations General Assembly, they would think that is a victory, because if you think about it, Julia, a year ago, Donald Trump was suggesting, why should we defend Saudi Arabia? We have our energy independence with this shale production, and total combined production of almost 13 million barrels a day.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's such a great point actually, in effect, uniting them all in tackling this problem. John, the other obvious thing here to point out as well and we talked a little bit about this yesterday was in the meantime, President Trump saying he is going to step up sanctions against Iran. What capacity here has the United States got to further step up sanctions? And what is that going to mean for Iran ultimately on an economic basis?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, not a lot, Julia, because they had been taking a squeeze and you can see it on any measurement for Iran. But I think this market in oil, and because of the narrative there on the Iranian sanctions could rally on rhetoric alone, right?</p><p>From Javad Zarif, Mike Pompeo is saying this is an act of war by the Iranians. Donald Trump leaving the option here open to say that we could have a very strong response, so that's putting up the pressure and you look at the volatility over the last week alone. We're in a $10.00 to $11.00 range. That says a lot and we were lulled into thinking that Aramco could get up to nearly 10 million barrels a day production by the end of September, and it's all solved.</p><p>But the spare capacity in the world is about 2 million barrels and we saw reports in \"The Wall Street Journal\" suggesting that Saudi Arabia may be taking oil in from Iraq. So in the last hour, I talked to sources here in Saudi Arabia, they're saying I wouldn't rule it out because they need different blends and they need the extra security as they start to build up.</p><p>So you can see it is a tight market, Julia and on pins and needles, particularly when you apply more sanctions to Iran.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, pins and needles. John Defterios, thank you so much for the update there.</p><p>All right, U.K. Supreme Court wrapping up the case brought against Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Opponents of Mr. Johnson are arguing that he unlawfully suspended Parliament in the run up to Brexit. The last legal arguments will be heard today and a ruling could come as early as this evening, so we'll watch for that.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a break here on FIRST MOVE, but still to come, Mark Zuckerberg leaving Silicon Valley for Capitol Hill in a bid to make a few more friends for Facebook. Stay with us, plenty more to come.</p><p>[09:21:56]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Take a look at futures right now for the U.S. majors. We have strengthened a little bit following a pretty much unchanged session despite the volatility yesterday following the Feds' move to cut rates and at least leave open the door to more cuts should they be required.</p><p>Let's talk this through. Joining us now, Binky Chadha, he is the Chief Global Strategist at Deutsche Bank. Thank you. Fantastic to have you on the show.</p><p>BINKY CHADHA, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Pleasure to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What do you make of the Fed yesterday?</p><p>CHADHA: I would argue they're essentially sitting, you know, on the fence. If growth slows, they will cut some more. If growth doesn't slow, they won't. Our view is a little different. Our view is very clear. Growth is slowing. Growth is going to continue to slow and so they will cut as growth slows and they will continue to cut for a little while longer after the growth bottoms out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you're far more worried than Jay Powell at least was letting on yesterday. How close to recession are we? Because I know you're one of those who think we're far closer perhaps than people realize.</p><p>CHADHA: Sure. You know, there's two or three very simple points to make. I mean, if you look at the manufacturing sector in the U.S., and you look at the ISMs, I mean, you know, we've been slowing from a peak back in September of last year. And it's a leap of faith to think that, you know, something that's going down to like this is suddenly going to stop here tomorrow and then start maybe to even, you know, going up, number one.</p><p>Number two, people say that, you know, they are sort of mixed signals and you look at the bounce in services. But I mean, if you do actually look at services, you look at the ISMs, I mean, they've essentially been coming down in a saw-tooth manner. So the last two bumps did not sustain.</p><p>I would argue, you know, the U.S. economy is slowing broadly. It is slowing unambiguously. And I would argue that the U.S. economy is dangerously close to sort of tipping over into a recession. What I would argue is, we are very, very close to what has historically been a stall speed for the U.S.</p><p>If you look at the labor market, for example, payrolls growth, you know, is running the six-month change at an annual rates, running at about 1.3 percent. That is, number one, the slowest pace that we've had in 10 years at any point in this recovery, going straight down.</p><p>CHADHA: It's bound to slow when the labor market gets so tight. And I guess back to your point about manufacturing, it's still only what? Fifteen to twenty percent of the U.S. economy. Are you saying actually, that you're worried about the consumer, too, despite things like retail sales, because of what you're saying about the jobs market?</p><p>CHADHA: So a consumption growth is always going to be over, you know, some period of time, tightly related, basically, the labor income growth, and the biggest component of that is jobs growth.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>CHADHA: Now, just one additional point that I would make is parallels growth in the U.S., you know, has slowed from two and a half percent in the middle of last year down to 1.3 percent. The services sector is much bigger than the manufacturing sector as you just said.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>CHADHA: And most that slowing has actually come from the services sector, not the manufacturing sector because it is much bigger. We are running at 1.3 percent. And I would argue that the stall speed or tipping point is around one percent.</p><p>[09:25:14]</p><p>CHADHA: If you look at private payrolls growth historically going all the way back in the 1960s, whenever we've gone through one percent, we've ended up in a full recession.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What does this mean for stock markets? Because you're also arguing that there's a gap here, a gap between the fundamentals that you're talking about here and where stock markets are. If you're right on the fundamentals here, what kind of pull back are you talking for stock markets potentially here?</p><p>CHADHA: So you know, the things that I would point out are number one, the U.S. stock market is about 15 percent expansive to where growth is currently.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Fifteen percent.</p><p>CHADHA: That's right, I would put -- where we should be on the basis of, you know, the ISMs and the like at 2,600 not at 3,000. Now, I do have a target for 3,250, and most people are confused by that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I am, too.</p><p>CHADHA: What I would argue is that because the U.S. -- because the US economy is slowing, and it's slowing pretty severely, I would argue, you know, we will get a relent on trade policy, and so my constructive view or V-turn in the stock market is predicated on getting a credible trade deal that would be very positive and 3,250 then will look to conservative.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Very quickly, how long are you going to leave it before you change that call, if we don't get a deal?</p><p>CHADHA: I mean, it's a call. We're very close to the end of the month. So I will accept, you know, whatever on my face.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We have to wrap it there. Binky Chadha, the Chief Global Strategist at Deutsche Bank. Thank you so much. We will get you back to discuss.</p><p>CHADHA: My pleasure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The market opens next. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE here for a very excitable opening bell. Ping Identity ringing the opening bell this morning. We did have a touch higher start for the market this morning, following the volatility yesterday. We are calling him Powell the appeaser, at least pleasing investors for now with that further insurance rate cut yesterday, and the door opened at least to further cuts if they are required in the future.</p><p>Though you have to say, you do feel the bar is higher here for action given a dissent on the governing council, also injecting another $75 billion as we mentioned earlier into the banking system today, too. Powell the plumber, in this case, the third straight day of emergency moves following the spike in bank to bank lending rates earlier this week.</p><p>Also U.S.-China trained negotiators getting back to work in Washington today. High level talks of course next month. Reports say the Chinese officials could even travel to the Midwest this week to meet with farmers. More agriculture buying ahead. Watch this space.</p><p>All right, let me take you through the global movers hereto. AT&amp;T in focus. A \"Wall Street Journal\" reports that the wireless carrier is considering the sale of direct TV. The satellite TV business losing subscribers as customers shift to streaming.</p><p>An activist investor recently pushed for the sale of direct TV. AT&amp;T, of course, the parent company of CNN and that report again in \"The Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>US Steel lower in the session. The company lowering its guidance for its second half of this year, citing lack of demand and falling U.S. steel prices. It said it will continue to idle two of its blast furnaces and reiterated plans to cut 2,500 jobs in Europe.</p><p>And finally, Alibaba the Chinese e-commerce company celebrating five years since it listed here on the New York Stock Exchange, a $25 billion IPO if you remember, the largest in history, still the largest. The stock has more than doubled from its IPO price of $68.00. The market cap today, a cool $465 billion.</p><p>All right, joining us now, I'm happy to say, Andrew Left, founder at Citron Research, and prominent activist short seller. Getting my tongue twisted today. Great to have you with us.</p><p>ANDREW LEFT, FOUNDER, CITRON RESEARCH: Good morning.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Now, a year ago, you said Alibaba looks like a good buy here. I have to say it's gone nowhere fast in the last year and it's become a sort of victim, I think of the trade war.</p><p>LEFT: Well, either is --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Aha.</p><p>LEFT: If you go 52 weeks, it's right on par with Amazon. It's definitely a victim of the trade war. I think the investors are not -- they're not rushing to buy any Chinese stocks right now. So there's so many of them. You know, we could make a list of all the stocks from JD.com -- there's so many of them. So it's not an outlier. It's just what's happening right now, a victim of the trade war.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I should correct myself, a victim of the perception of the trade war versus actually trade impacted.</p><p>LEFT: Very fair. A hundred percent.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Okay. So relative basis, then Amazon versus Alibaba, if we have to make the comparison. Very different beasts, very different animals, but --</p><p>LEFT: I like -- going forward, if you're looking for a year or five years, I think Alibaba. They still dominate the server market, not as much competition in China, as Amazon is facing in the U.S. with the data center business and e-commerce, the runway they have going forward in China, it's a lot greater.</p><p>Amazon is great. We all know it's great, and it's fully penetrated. No doubt they'll still grow. But if you look at the overall economy in China, and the growth of the middle class there, Alibaba is a beneficiary.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do we need to worry about a trade deal or not a trade deal or an escalation here? Because there are all sorts of risks here, perhaps the United States cuts China off completely as far as technology is concerned, for example?</p><p>LEFT: Well, everything is based on perception. Right?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>LEFT: So as you were saying, you know, we've had a perception of a trade war. So going forward, I think, yes, it is a concern. Absolutely. Until the China-U.S. thing completely gets ironed out, it seems as if all of these Chinese stocks are just all stuck in the mud right now.</p><p>But if that's the case, maybe they'll start looking at the possibility of relisting these stocks in Hong Kong or in China. And if that's the case, they go up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Really?</p><p>LEFT: I think so.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But that will basically mean they do an alternative in Hong Kong, right now, it is a bit hairy. But --</p><p>LEFT: I mean, there's no reason to be -- how crazy is the concept? Imagine if Amazon was only traded in China and not in the US. So you can only imagine the nationalism factor of wanting to bring Alibaba back home. And that would open it up to investors in China as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How high is that risk, do you think?</p><p>LEFT: I mean, it would be a good -- it is a risk. It would be a good thing if you can trade your shares of Amazon -- I'm sorry for Alibaba right now for Chinese Alibaba, it would probably have much higher multiples.</p><p>The reason why it wasn't done five years ago, and the IPO was done here is there were restrictions in China on what can go public, they have to be profitable. So this is like a breeding ground for stocks.</p><p>But I think if we have evolved past that right now, the Chinese people should have the opportunity to buy Alibaba and then the multiple would expand.</p><p>[09:35:04]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Are you exposed? Are you long Alibaba or --</p><p>LEFT: I was and I admit, I got a little bored out of it. You know, it just seemed like okay, I'm not going to forecast the government. I own some JD on a smaller position.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I do you think you're a much happier person -- much happier person, at least on television when you're buying things as opposed to short selling. There is a lot of criticism there.</p><p>Now, I'm being tough today. On April 5th, you said Lyft is an amateur short, shorting disruptor companies that dominated mega trends simply because they lose money. It's your way to go broke.</p><p>LEFT: It is. I am amazed. I'll tell you something. I own Uber and I'll tell you when I'm wrong. I own Uber and I own Lyft. I own them both. I'm down in both of them. Actually, I own them privately also and I own them on the public markets. For some reason, the market gives runway to some companies and not runway to these ride-sharing companies. They are really -- you know, they're really unloved despite the fact that Lyft and Uber operate a duopoly in what is no doubt a megatrend.</p><p>I mean, I have four children. I have two of them that are driving age, and none of them drive. They both take Uber and Lyft everywhere. Uber Eats Uber. If you look at alternative delivery systems for Amazon, that last mile, they're both Uber and Lyft. But people want the profitability right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's like that you have to show a viable business model. I guess that's the thing.</p><p>LEFT: I could show you 20 businesses listed on the NASDAQ, 30 businesses that have not shown profitability, but have shown top line growth.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So this comes to my point now, are perceptions changing? Are we having a sort of realization of the valuations that companies are being given in the private markets relative to the valuations that they're being given in the public markets?</p><p>WeWork, another one where we're suddenly going, hang on a second. One minute, we were talking about an IPO worth $46 billion or $47 billion, and now we're talking about maybe $18 billion to $20 billion.</p><p>LEFT: WeWork -- as a short seller, I was just hoping everyone was going to forget about WeWork and let it go public, so I can short it. I am quite upset about all the publicity it has taken. It's like, uh, okay. It's not what you're looking at with Uber or Lyft. These are not disruptive megatrend companies. It's a reputable business model. It's office space. It's what it is. It's didn't even own the offices.</p><p>So it's a complete opposite of what I look at as with an Uber and Lyft. But I think with the CEO, a little -- this completely brought attention to it, and I'll be surprised if it gets public.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay. Okay, I'm going to try again with this question, though Softbank, another company, Vision Fund 2. It's now putting a lot of money in it seems itself, it's also talking about potentially bringing its workers in. This is a massive technology investor. And I guess my question at this moment, given the sensitivity to loss-making companies, at least, as I see it, again, we're going, are the valuations in the private market is at a whack with the public?</p><p>LEFT: I mean, with all respect to Masa, he works -- Softbank has that hundred year vision. I don't think there's one investor out here that wants to invest on a hundred-year vision besides him.</p><p>So when it goes to a public marketplace, it doesn't hold. They have a slew of bad investments. You can look at Compass. You can just keep going on and on of things that have money invested by Softbank that they will never take out to the public markets.</p><p>That being said, they made a fair amount of money in other stocks. But I don't think that halo effect of Softbank by no means should translate it to, oh, we're going to be able to take it public.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting. So do you disagree with me then that there's a mismatch between the valuations in private markets right now and the valuations that public investors that are willing to give to these companies?</p><p>LEFT: Of course, also private markets, you don't get the same amount of scrutiny. You don't have short sellers. You don't have people in -- it's a private transaction, and you only need one buyer. It's like selling a piece of real estate, you need one buyer.</p><p>So if you find one buyer to come in and say, oh, we'll put X amount in at X valuation, and Softbank has been that one big buyer over the years and you take them out, the crazy part, what would happen is, what happens if Fidelity and all the major funds have to lower the way they mark their private investments? And if they lower -- then they have to start lowering their exposure in the public marketplace. So there could be a longer tail to this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's that coming?</p><p>LEFT: I wish I knew. I mean, it could be I mean. I'm sitting on $20 billion in private investments, and then all of a sudden, I realize, oh my god, I have to mark these to $13 billion or $14 billion, and how I want to completely lower my exposure. So it's kind of like the tail that wags the dog.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, Softbank has got deep pockets, but other perhaps --</p><p>LEFT: I mean, Fidelity is deeper.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting. We're going to come back to this conversation, I think. I just think with everything else that's going on in the world right now, maybe there's a reality check going on, but you don't feel it. You think these are specific issues.</p><p>LEFT: Yes, there are specific issues. There's still some wonderful companies doing some wonderful things and real disruption in this world. But I think profitability has to be involved at some time, but I've been saying this for years. So I think investors still with rates the way they are right now will still pay for their top line growth.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting, Andrew Left, always a pleasure to have you on the show. Andrew Left, founder of Citron Research and prominent activist short seller and buyer as well.</p><p>[09:40:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, we're going to take a quick break, but coming up after this. Soaring pork prices are a big problem in China. What is the government going to do about it? Well, we'll see what they're doing right now. Stay with us. We're back in two.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. China moving to stabilize its port prices by auctioning stocks in its national reserves. The country is in the midst of a swine fever crisis that's wiped out around a third of its pigs.</p><p>China's pork market is the largest in the world. The pig population has fallen by 100 million just in the last year and as prices soar, $452 million has been handed out in food subsidies to low-income families. In the government auction, each bidder can buy up to 300 tons of pork.</p><p>David Culver joins us now from Beijing. David, great to have you with us. I saw some data that suggested pork prices has risen as much as 46 percent over the last year. I mean, that's a huge price increase. What impact is this release of reserves actually going to have on the price? Will it help?</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Julia, it's incredible to think, 46 percent. But when you actually have even seen numbers go higher than that in some places, 70 percent, nearly 90 percent increase. So it depends on where you're looking. But certainly, it's being felt here.</p><p>And we really have to grasp what pork means to China, and you have to look at the numbers to see that. As far as consumption is concerned, let's get the 2018 numbers. They consumed 55 million metric tons here in China. Put that in perspective, that's more than the U.S. and Europe combined. In fact, it's nearly double what the U.S. and Europe consumed last year.</p><p>So we wanted to know, to your point, how is it being felt here? Not only in major cities like Beijing, but also in smaller towns. Here's what we found.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CULVER (voice over): Inside Beijing's Home Plate restaurant, American barbecue is king. Their specialty pork ribs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CULVER (on camera): How long will this take?</p><p>BILL CHEN, GENERAL MANAGER: It will take six to eight hours to smoke.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CULVER (voice over): General Manager Bill Chen touring us through the kitchen. He says China's growing pork crisis has had him paying about 20 percent more for the meat. He is about to print new menus to help ease the burden.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CULVER (on camera): Are you worried by raising the prices that you might push customers away?</p><p>CHEN: I'm a little bit worried about that, yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CULVER (voice over): The Chinese pork market, the world's largest has been ravaged by an outbreak of African swine fever. Demand is strong as ever, setting prices up nearly 90 percent in some places.</p><p>It's a reality felt in small towns, too. Despite the chill in the air, this inner Mongolian market bustling midweek. Among the raw offerings, pork. Butchers are eager to make a sale.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Compared to previous years, business is worse.</p><p>CULVER (on camera): The locals whom we've spoken within this small town market tell us they have noticed the price of pork going up, but their consumption has stayed the same. They're willing to pay more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I need to eat pork. It's a big part of our life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CULVER (voice over): Chinese people consume more pork than the U.S. and Europe combined. It is also the biggest supplier of pork, which explains why the swine fever outbreak is so devastating.</p><p>Since late last year, a third of China's pigs, more than a hundred million have been wiped out. To help replenish the supply, China has suggested they will ease tariffs on U.S. pork imports in the midst of the trade war. They're also trying to regulate the domestic market from within.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CULVER (on camera): The Chinese government has just released some 10,000 metric tons of pork. Is that going to help you guys at all?</p><p>CHEN: I think it will be good for the common people and the restaurants like us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CULVER (voice over); But Bill is hesitant about the long-term impacts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEN: The trade war between the two countries, the politics, I don't know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CULVER (voice over): For now, Home Plate keeps dishing up, bringing American customers a taste of home and serving local Chinese their staple meat with a Texas twist and a soaring price tag.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CULVER: How much of an impact has he seen with these rising prices, Julia, in the past few weeks? He said he has seen about a 20 percent increase. That's what he is paying. I asked him, so what in turn are you going to do with the menu prices, he is going to raise them about 10 percent. He doesn't want to put the entire burden and push off all his customer base. But that's the reality not only some of these restaurants are dealing with, but as you saw there, in the smaller towns, some of the consumers.</p><p>But they say they're going to be paying it. They're willing to put up with it for now. They're hoping this release from the Central Reserve will ease things a bit especially, Julia when you consider what's coming at the first of next month. October 1st is National Day here. It is a major holiday. It celebrates 70 years since the founding of Communist China and it's going to be about a week long of celebrations, folks getting together with their families, they're going to be having meals. What's going to be on the table? You can bet pork.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, absolutely. I mean, I'm just looking at the numbers here. We have a major math problem here. I mean, we're talking, as you said, 55 million tons. They've only released 10,000 from the strategic reserves here. I mean, it's nothing. It's peanuts compared to what's actually required here.</p><p>So I guess two questions. One, do we even have a sense of what they've got in the strategic reserves here for pork? Because even with a command economy, if you don't have the reserves, you can't help here and two, they simply have got to get the swine fever under control, haven't they? Are they making any progress there?</p><p>CULVER: It is frustrating when it comes to your second question as far as getting swine fever under control because there's no vaccination for this. So their solution as of now has been simply to essentially decimate more than a hundred million pigs all together.</p><p>And it seems like a lot of the farmers aren't nearly as willing to replenish those stocks right away. So in turn, they're having to import from the U.S., from Brazil and from other countries.</p><p>And as far as what they haven't the Central Reserve, China hasn't released those figures. The Commerce Ministry is not putting that out there. But one of the other things that I find interesting here is the timing of this with the trade war, Julia, and you've got recently the Chinese government suggesting that they will ease some of the tariffs on pork and soybeans.</p><p>Well, that's not only a goodwill gesture towards the U.S. and these negotiations, it's also something that they desperately need, so it benefits them, too.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, such a great point, David. Desperate measures here. Is pork the path to some kind of trade deal? David Culver in Beijing there. Thank you so much for that report.</p><p>All right. Coming up here on FIRST MOVE. Mr. Zuckerberg goes to Washington, again. Why the Facebook founder is meeting U.S. senators? We are live from D.C. with the latest. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:52:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Three former tech co-executives have been cleared of negligence over the Fukushima nuclear disaster.</p><p>The case against the former Tokyo Electric Power Company executives is the only criminal case to arise from the 2011 meltdown, the worst nuclear disaster in fact, since Chernobyl.</p><p>And what might have been. Disney's Chief Executive, Bob Iger believes his firm could have merged with Apple if Steve Jobs was still alive. The revelation comes in Iger's upcoming autobiography. He writes that he had a close relationship with Jobs who died in 2011 from cancer. Disney and Apple are set to launch rival streaming services in November. Yes, I'm still not ruling it out.</p><p>All right, let's move on. Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg meeting with U.S. senators today. The company telling CNN that they will be talking about future regulation of the internet. For more, let's talk to Brian Fung.</p><p>Brian, I have to say, I think self-regulation will be the words that Mark Zuckerberg is using, perhaps not the senators. What can we expect today?</p><p>BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Well, Facebook isn't releasing very many more details about these meetings. But we do know that Mark Zuckerberg had dinner last night with a number of senators, including Senator Mark Warner and Senator Richard Blumenthal, both very powerful Democratic senators to talk about things like election security, data privacy and competition issues.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg is planning to have meetings today with a number of senators as well with Senator Maria Cantwell, who has been working on Federal privacy legislation, as well as House Intelligence Chairman, Adam Schiff.</p><p>Now there may be others, we are trying to figure out who Mark Zuckerberg may be meeting with and what the topics will be. But it seems like a lot of the issues surrounding this have to do with how Facebook could be regulated in the future as it grapples with issues like data and security and privacy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, Brian, you raise such a great point there. Never mind, quite frankly, about future regulation, what about election security into 2020? This is such an important subject. And as far as I can see, even with the talks that we've seen between Congress or congressional members, and these big tech giants, we're simply not ready to stem the risk of interference here. Would you agree?</p><p>FUNG: Right, well, experts say you know, the, the potential for misinformation and deep fakes is greater than ever, and you have a lot of, you know, companies like Facebook trying to figure out how they're going to, you know, beat back some of this misinformation and malicious content.</p><p>Facebook has set up a Civil Rights Task Force to try and suss out some of this stuff before it really has an impact. But I think you know, a lot of lawmakers will say that's not quite enough and it'll be interesting to see what kinds of policies they try to come up with to, you know, put in place.</p><p>[09:55:13]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, talk is important, but we'd like let's talk and more action, perhaps. Brian Fung, thank you so much for bringing us that update there and we'll watch those talks and any announcements potentially later on from D.C.</p><p>All right, so let me give you a look at what we're seeing as far as the U.S. majors are concerned this morning. We are holding in positive territory four tenths of a percent higher from the NASDAQ, following of course, that rate cut decision from the Federal Reserve. Dissent of course on the governing council over what to do next, and indeed the rate cut that we got there, but Jay Powell reiterating, they will do more if required at this stage.</p><p>A quick look at oil markets as well. It's been a volatile week ever since the Saudi attacks, of course, this weekend. Right now we're adding as you can see one and a half percent higher there for Brent, 1.2 percent for WTI Crude in the United States.</p><p>All right, more to come in a couple of hours with \"The Express,\" but for now, that's it for the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019091901cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3B-1M11-DXH2-632P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8012\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Market, Economy, Federal Reserve, Mate 30, Huawei, California, Emissions Standards, Environment, Automobile Industry, Government, Politics, Policies, Iran, Saudi Arabia, War, Military, Agriculture, China, Food And Beverage, Pork, Senate, Facebook, Security, Elections</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Take a look at this, starting point (INAUDIBLE) session, lots of highs and lows, we did actually get Fed announcement today, the Fed will actually be raising interest rates, that has been priced in so the market had been expecting that but we did end the day down, ever so slightly because there are fears that the rate of interest rate hikes could actually be more accelerated than had been expected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All right, it is Wednesday, March 21st.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have a responsibility to protect your data and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" Marc Zuckerberg breaks his silence on the Facebook data scandal and he promises that lessons will be learned.</p><p>And the market rally says all after Jerome Powell Fed debut, we will have friend of the show Clare Sebastian will be joining us in a few minutes.</p><p>And fresh fears about self-driving cars, for the fleet, for the pace of autonomy has slow down.</p><p>Hello everyone, I'm Zain Asher and this my friend is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>All right, welcome everyone, I am Zain Asher.</p><p>Tonight, Marc Zuckerberg has broken his silence on the data scandal that has consumed his company over the past few days. We heard from Zuckerberg the man himself, he admitted that mistakes have been made - mistakes have been made with users' information and he promised, he made several promises that he was going to fix them.</p><p>In a statement posted in the last few hours Zuckerberg says that he takes responsibility, the buck stops with him, he takes responsibility for letting user data end up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica. He announced several new measures to tighten up Facebook's data policies including new restrictions on what data third-party companies can store.</p><p>Zuckerberg is also due to sit down with CNN's Laurie Segall for an exclusive interview on CNN later tonight, if you're in London that will be 1:00 a.m. your time; he said in his written statement on Facebook, he said, \"At the end of the day I am responsible for what happened on our platforms. I know it takes longer to fix all of these issues than we'd like but I promise you we'll work through this and build a better service over the long-term.\"</p><p>Right, so much to discuss here.</p><p>Joining me now is CNN Senior Reporter, Dylan Byers and Shelly Palmer, CEO of The Palmer Group so Shelly I want to begin with you since you're right in front of me.</p><p>So, I read this statement there were a few things that I myself - I want to get your take on this, that I myself found alarming and a lot of people have mentioned this before.</p><p>Number one the fact that third-party apps even had access to data of your friends in the first place, a lot of people would find egregious. Second of all, that Marc Zuckerberg actually knew about this scandal this debacle since 2015, we the users are only just finding out about it now. And third of all that when Cambridge Analytica said, hey, listen we've deleted all the data, Marc Zuckerberg instantly believed them only to find out later that may or may not have been true.</p><p>Is this forgivable?</p><p>SHELLY PALMER, CEO, THE PALMER GROUP: Well, well, that's a lot of questions that are all kind of well asked - and well - and they should be asked. Let's take them one at a time.</p><p>Should you have data available to third parties and should that data include not only your data but the data from your friends?</p><p>Whether that's right or wrong in 2014 that was Facebook's policy and they published that policy. We could argue with it that it's a bad idea or a good idea but that was what you agreed to when you click the user license agreement.</p><p>Now -</p><p>ASHER: I see.</p><p>PALMER: - I could morally say to you well, that sounds awful and I can make all kinds of personal comments about what we think in 2018 should have happened in 2014 but in 2014 that was their policy.</p><p>And so, Facebook is free. No, it's not. Facebook is nothing like free, you get to use -</p><p>ASHER: User information is -</p><p>PALMER: - the service because -</p><p>ASHER: - the product that is being -</p><p>PALMER: - Right.</p><p>ASHER: - sold.</p><p>PALMER: Your information is what you pay for Facebook with so back then it was not a very well understood business. They were trying to basically serve you the right ad at the right time and to get you engage and they felt that this was a way to do it.</p><p>We've really matured over the last four years and certainly through -</p><p>ASHER: That's right.</p><p>PALMER: - the elections but back in 2014 in a more innocent time that was their policy. It hasn't been their policy for quite some time and so we're talking about data prior to that.</p><p>The next question you asked was well Marc Zuckerberg new in 2015, what should he have said?</p><p>I can't answer for Marc Zuckerberg but I can tell you that everyone that I know at Facebook, people were very close, now that he is and have said to me in all honesty, 'he's beside himself,' with -</p><p>ASHER: I can imagine.</p><p>PALMER: - and wants to fix it and with an engineering brain like Zuckerberg has and he is first and foremost an engineer his first inclination is to fix it.</p><p>ASHER: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: Right and I thought his -</p><p>ASHER: And he outlined -</p><p>PALMER: - statement today.</p><p>ASHER: - several ways to do it -</p><p>PALMER: He did.</p><p>ASHER: - to try and (INAUDIBLE) is what he was trying to say.</p><p>PALMER: He actually -</p><p>ASHER: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: - did and what I believe in earnest is the right thing for him to have done is said, \"Look, the</p><p>buck stops with me.\" He's taken full responsibility. He knows this is super important.</p><p>[17:05:14]</p><p>So, you've got a guy who is an engineer at heart who wants to fix things who knows how to forensically look and fix things, knows that it needs to be fixed and has agreed to fix it.</p><p>I don't know what more they can actually do at the moment.</p><p>We can argue with him if it was a good idea or bad idea over the last few years.</p><p>Now the last question you asked was about Cambridge Analytica, how they get a hand - their hands on it - you know, the bad guys, and how they get their hands on it and what went down?</p><p>ASHER: And that they told Marc that they deleted it.</p><p>PALMER: That they deleted the data and that he believed them.</p><p>ASHER: Questionable(ph).</p><p>PALMER: I think Facebook is going to have to answer for that flat out. I think -</p><p>ASHER: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: - someone's going to have to go to Facebook and say, \"Wait, did they give you an affidavit did they - or like how, do you, know they deleted this data,\" I think that is a reasonable question that any reasonable person would ask and I think Facebook owes everyone an answer about that.</p><p>ASHER: Shelly standby, let me bring in Dylan Byers into the conversation.</p><p>So, you know, Dylan you know, we waited four days for this statement from Marc Zuckerberg. Apparently, he wanted to wait so that he could give a really detailed, thoughtful, response, certainly understandable, was this particular statement worth the wait do you think?</p><p>DYLAN BYERS, CNN MONEY, SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER &amp; AUTHOR, \"PACIFIC\" NEWSLETTER: Well you know, first of all everything that Shelly said is absolutely right and certainly it lines up with all of our reporting.</p><p>Look being the CEO of a company requires more than just sort of you know, going into hiding for four days and working on improving the product and then coming out. There's - you also have to be aware of the sort of public conversation and the narrative that's happening out there.</p><p>There is a lot of time for a very critical narrative about Facebook to develop and fester over the course certainly of Monday and Tuesday and today before Marc Zuckerberg came out with this statement.</p><p>You ask is it - is it enough, was it worth the wait?</p><p>I don't know. As - look all - everything - almost everything that happened in this scandal happened above board, it happened in line with Facebook policy. Users do go online and they do - or at least they did in the past agreed to share this data and to have - and to have your data shared if you were a friend of somebody who shared their data. All that is true.</p><p>But the problem is, is that I think Americans especially have been woefully naive about how much data they are sharing and what issues like this and issues like Facebook's role in Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign highlight is that Facebook's reach, of our data, the way that they follow us around whenever we are in line even when we're not on Facebook on platforms, that Facebook really has a lot of this data and that this data can always be exploited, can always be manipulated by third parties and that no matter what Facebook does, there is always the possibility of a violation like this.</p><p>They can monitor it better but they can never wholly prevent it and so the real question here -</p><p>ASHER: Yes.</p><p>Byer: - is, are people going to look and re-think about whether or not they want to be giving their data to a platform that they haven't been able to trust in the past, that certainly like you said took years to address this problem and are they - are they willing to continue trusting that platform when they know again that they can't wholly prevent this problem from happening again.</p><p>I'm not so sure that the case on the other hand, we're talking about over 2 billion users around the world that's a lot of (INAUDIBLE), it's you know, the - Facebook could see user declines of 2 or 3 percent and really ultimately it wouldn't hurt the bottom-line.</p><p>ASHER: OK. Fair enough.</p><p>But in terms of user responsibilities both of you brought up a very interesting point about user responsibilities because what is our responsibility, yes of course, we clicked \"Yes,\" to the terms and condition but if you talk to ordinary people who are on Facebook, many of whom are teenagers, many of whom are very young, the privacy policy is - of Facebook are so cumbersome and so difficult to understand.</p><p>A lot of people think Shelly that that is done by design what are your thoughts?</p><p>PALMER: It - it's neither done by design or not by design. We give up our privacy for the quality of our enjoyment of the intranet (ph). If you want to see relevant ads and relevant content, if you want to dynamically create an environment for you that is most - that you are most likely to want to engage with, then you have to give up your data in order for a computer, basically an algorithm to give you what you want.</p><p>If you want to see plain-vanilla ads and plain-vanilla content it will become an incredibly emotionally unsatisfying experience so we'll say oh that's - I could deal with that. No, you really couldn't. You'd find this to be an incredibly cumbersome environment.</p><p>Let's - let's break this down. We live in - we're living in a world where we create data everywhere, everything we do we create data points. When you say Facebook knows something about me, no, they don't. Facebook has a data set and if you actually data set, can I find Zain - or - people like Zain who are likely to buy this thing at this day, if you ask the right question it will give you back an answer. And that's how Facebook uses Facebook and that's how the data is rightly used.</p><p>What we are talking about is when data is used improperly or - by a bad actor.</p><p>Now Robert Mueller III, has a new job but in his old job as Director of the FBI, he had a great quote [17:05:16] my most favorite quote on the subject -</p><p>ASHER: What's that?</p><p>PALMER: - \"There's only two kinds of companies in the world, companies that have been hacked and companies that do not know they have been hacked.\"</p><p>ASHER: True (ph).</p><p>PALMER: And in this case, it wasn't even a hack, this was inside a policy because we were too young -</p><p>ASHER: It's completely above-board as -</p><p>PALMER: - we were -</p><p>ASHER: - you said.</p><p>PALMER: - That's right. We were too young as a society and too young in business to understand the ramifications of this much data.</p><p>So now we're coming to a world where we're living in a data-driven society and none of us - none of us can say we understand fully what the dangers are.</p><p>It might be worth a stronger look.</p><p>ASHER: (INAUDIBLE) -.</p><p>BYERS: Zain, I do want to go back - I would -</p><p>ASHER: - (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BYERS: - like to go back to your question. There's - there's - you know, Shelly, there's something really important there which is a question of you know, we agreed to these user agreements and they're really long and they're really cumbersome and ultimately, it's on us for just scrolling to the bottom and clicking, \"OK,\" and actually -</p><p>ASHER: Nobody reads -</p><p>BYERS: - thinking about -</p><p>ASHER: - those fully.</p><p>BYERS: - the data we're given up but there is regulation coming in the European Union, at the end of May that is going to make this a much clearer choice for Facebook users and other social media users in the European Union.</p><p>You're going to have clear options to say would you like to share your data and are you OK with that data being used for marketing purposes. You're also going to have the opportunity to take back your data and give it to another company.</p><p>That sort of regulation - look I don't have a great deal of faith in the - in the U.S. Congress' ability to impose that kind of regulation but if that works in Europe and if Europeans like that that could be an interesting test case for tech regulation here in the United States later down the line.</p><p>ASHER: That is certainly a valid point. A lot of people are saying that regulators have been at least five steps behind technology companies -</p><p>BYERS: They're always going to be.</p><p>ASHER: - but guys I'm running out of time, I'm so sorry.</p><p>Dylan Byers, thank you so much.</p><p>I want to remind our viewers that you can actually catch more from Dylan Byers in terms of his newsletter, \"PACIFIC\" that is available every single day.</p><p>And Marc Zuckerberg is actually going to give an exclusive interview to CNN's Laurie Segall in just a few hours from now, you can watch that on \"ANDERSON COOPER 360\" at - which airs at 1:00 a.m. if you're in London, that is local time, and it will be replayed throughout the day on Thursday as well.</p><p>After British and E.U. regulators told me they still want answers from Facebook, now Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner says she needs them to step up, earlier Helen Dixon told me companies like Facebook need to be held accountable.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HELEN DIXON, IRISH DATA PROTECTION COMMISSIONER: I suppose what the events of the last weekend have highlighted for us is this, even where Facebook have terms and policies in place for app developers it doesn't necessarily give us the assurance that those app developers are abiding by the policies that Facebook have set and that Facebook is active in terms of overseeing that there is no leakage of personal data and the conditions such as the prohibition on sending on data to further third parties is being adhered to by app developers.</p><p>So, I suppose what we want to see changed and what we want to oversee with Facebook now and what we're demanding answers from Facebook in relation to is first of all what preclearance and what preauthorization do they do before permitting app developers onto their platform.</p><p>And secondly once those app developers are operatives and have apps collecting personal data, what kind of follow-up and active oversight steps does Facebook take to give us all reassurance that the type of issue that appears to have occurred in relation to Cambridge Analytica won't happen again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: I'm joined now by Shelly Palmer again, thank you for sticking around so you know, what she's talking about is really this inherent trust of third-party apps just doesn't seem to fly.</p><p>I know that Marc Zuckerberg actually addressed in his post that he's going to make sure that third-party companies are going to agree to audits and if they don't agree to audits then they won't be allowed to work with Facebook.</p><p>Fair enough but are regulators also to blame somewhat as well because as you and I and Dylan were just talking about, regulators seem to be two, three, four, steps behind these big tech firms?</p><p>PALMER: First of all, let's break that down a little bit. What you need data for if you're a third-party app developer and what you should be entitled to, how is it that your app actually works and what do you really need.</p><p>Facebook does kind of go a little bit into that, they do and I think they've been - in their minds pretty good about looking at how you use data that you would take in from an app.</p><p>If they get too crazy in regulation, if - and I'm saying this as politely as I can, regulators are going to be using a blunt-force instrument on a very delicate situation because not all data that you use, that you give up to somebody is going to hurt anyone; it may really help you enjoy the app that - or get more use out of the app.</p><p>Ways, for example, if you don't tell it where you're going and it doesn't keep a record of how you like to travel and where you're going back-and- forth to work then it can't possibly ever learn enough about what you're doing, it will just need - time - just start from the beginning.</p><p>[17:05:15]</p><p>So, as we get into a world where we're using statistical Machine Learning and Neural Networks and Augmented and Artificial Intelligence to analyze data for things that you do to make your lives better, if we don't give the data to the apps -</p><p>ASHER: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: - can help us -</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>PALMER: - and so we're just -</p><p>ASHER: You have to strike the right balance though.</p><p>PALMER: - That's exactly right. And so, what we're hoping for and I'm saying that with all of my heart is that regulators don't have a knee-jerk reaction and go, \"Well they've done something bad therefore we must regulate this,\" to the point where you know, it's so strict you can't actually get the good actors to benefit.</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>PALMER: There is clearly a problem but Facebook has said they understand there is a problem -</p><p>ASHER: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: - now the question is, are - do people trust them well enough -</p><p>ASHER: Hm.</p><p>PALMER: - to give them a chance to fix it.</p><p>ASHER: We shall see.</p><p>All right, Shelly stick around, again.</p><p>PALMER: OK.</p><p>ASHER: We have another tech story because gosh, it - when it -</p><p>PALMER: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ASHER: - rains it pours, there is more bad news for Facebook and this time it's coming from the - Europe specifically, the E.U. is proposing sweeping tax changes that could cause tech firms like Facebook and Google over 6 billion, with a B, dollars per year. The new digital tax would force companies to pay a levy based on where they make money rather than where the companies' headquarters are actually located.</p><p>So, Shelly this is about - for the Europeans this is about basically leveling the playing field and sort of closing the legal loopholes that have existed for several years.</p><p>What will it mean financially for these - for these tech companies?</p><p>PALMER: The tech companies pay about 10 percent tax in Europe right now and normal businesses pay roughly, 22, 23, 24, percent tax and so the European regulators and the lawmakers are looking at that and saying what - why and how, how does this work, how are they paying less tax and the reason they've determined that they're paying less tax is the way that they are taxed by where their headquarters are versus where they are doing business throughout the 28 countries of the E.U.</p><p>ASHER: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: And so, the proposal is that they're going to tax businesses where the business is done at the point of the consumers' interaction with the business.</p><p>I think it's misguided but that's just me personally. I think they're going to have a very high bar. They're going to have to give a lot of buy- in, certainly there are small 'Dutches' (ph) and small countries like Estonia that are really benefiting from the way the tax laws are set up right now and then there's the rest of the E.U. who are - have different feelings about how the tax law should be.</p><p>They are looking right at tech companies because they are the easiest ones to look at although they claim in Europe that it's not just about tech.</p><p>ASHER: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: I have also heard that it has nothing to do with the new tariffs that were proposed here in the United States. On the other hand, I think, wink, wink, everybody thinks that they are heavily related to this trade war that's about to start because taxation is a way to sort of fight a battle in that war.</p><p>And so, we've got a bunch of moving parts here -</p><p>ASHER: But it will be interesting to see where - how the Europeans tax system works in conjunction with the new American taxes that are working here (ph), I'm curious to see how that - they work together.</p><p>All right, Shelly Palmer, thank you - thank you so much for sticking around.</p><p>PALMER: My pleasure.</p><p>ASHER: You were the perfect guest to -</p><p>PALMER: Oh.</p><p>ASHER: - have today.</p><p>PALMER: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: And also thank you for coming in on a snow day, I know it wasn't easy to get here today, thank you.</p><p>All right and later on in the program I'll be speaking to the former Facebook Product Manager, Antonio Garcia Martinez about where Facebook goes from here.</p><p>OK, still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, as the Fed chairman says, \"The economic outlook is improving\" but policymakers are concerned about something outside of their control, possible, Shelly was just talking about this, a possible trade war, the Trump administration is planning to hit China with new tariffs.</p><p>That story next.</p><p>[17:10:54]</p><p>ASHER: Welcome back everybody.</p><p>Stock see-sawed as the Federal Reserve announced a rate rise and the Fed chairman took questions, investors also reacted to the news that Trump administration is planning to hit China with new tariffs on Thursday.</p><p>Let's take a look here at the Dow's moves, you can see we were up pretty much in the red and the green all day - we were actually in the green around the time of Jerome Powell's announcement, it dipped - briefly dipped into the red by - in the 45-minute or so after. It recovered after that but could not hold the gains. It closed with a loss of 45 points, you can see it's down 44 points or so. The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ closed slightly in the red as well.</p><p>The Fed's decision pushed up government bond yields and pushed down the dollar. Now today's rate rise is the sixth since the financial crisis and Jerome Powell's first as Fed Chair. The Fed plans to stick to its schedule of three rate rises this year but rates are projected to rise more than expected in 2019 and in 2020 as well.</p><p>Now the pace of rate rises reflects the chairman's view that the U.S. economic outlook has improved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: Although the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have moderated early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals underpinning demand remained solid. Indeed, the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.</p><p>Several factors are supporting the outlook, fiscal policy has become more stimulative; ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence; foreign growth is on a firm trajectory; and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: All right, so Clare Sebastian joins us LIVE now so it's interesting Clare because we had expected a rate rise -</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: - today but what's in store for us for the rest of the year?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Where the rate rise today was really not the story, the stories this, this is what the Fed members think should be done about the fact that key line in his statement, you just heard Jerome Powell that - say that the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months so what does this tell us?</p><p>Well this tells us that they expect a median of three rate rises over the course of this year, another three, next year that's crucial and then another two in 2020 so the pace that they're looking at in terms of rate rises, if you're just here at (ph) December, over there you can see this is a steeper graph in March that we're seeing.</p><p>Go back to March for second?</p><p>ASHER: Which is this (ph).</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And you see also it's more disparate, it's more spread out and I was down on the floor of the stock exchange just a couple of hours ago, just after we got this, I took this down to the floor and I asked a couple of traders why are we seeing these so spread out this time round?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEITH BLISS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR OF SALES &amp; MARKETING, CUTTONE &amp; COMPANY: There's a lot of things factoring in to the calculus that they just don't know what's going to - how it's going to play out you know, what is going to be the effect of the - of the tax law longer-term especially in the 2019-2020, is this going to be a temporary, transitory type of bump, fiscal policy bump that we have here in the U.S.</p><p>And the - and the great unknown right now which I don't think the Fed has modeled at all, you see it in some private sector models is what could happen with tariffs you know, and whether there'll be some retaliation and retribution from our trading partners and what would that mean for domestic economics as well as global economics.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TED WEISBERG, PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES: The message was reasonably benign in the sense that it - there was - I didn't see any dramatic change from what we were getting from Janet Yellen and I think that's a positive.</p><p>Because I think what investors want is they want some clarity.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right.</p><p>WEISBERG: You know, what markets have trouble dealing with is uncertainty and we have plenty of uncertainty surrounding the markets, all we have to do is even look at today's volatility -</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Then you saw the markets today, you see it in the dot plot as well as despite the fact that the economy is doing really well, unemployment was revised down, quite dramatically by the Feds, give them - there's just so many unknown quantities out there, be it tariffs, be it -</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: - the effect of the tax cuts and I think that's why we're seeing this big spread in the dot plot today.</p><p>But just one word of caution this is a moment in time, these projections could change at any moment based on the data that's out there.</p><p>ASHER: And based on the headwinds that you just talked about.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much.</p><p>Now the Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell said, \"Members of the committee expressed concern about U.S. trade policy,\" that's what Clare was just mentioning over there, President Trump is expected to unveil tariffs against China on Thursday.</p><p>I want to go to Diane Swonk in Chicago, she's - she's a Chief Economist at Grant Thornton</p><p>[17:15:15].</p><p>So, Diane first of all just give us an overview, was this what you are expecting from Jerome Powell? Some people - actually most people are expecting three rate rises this year, some people thought there was a possibility for four?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, GRANT THORNTON INTERNATIONAL: Well we were just a sliver away from four in the forecast which was interesting and I think that really reflects the upgrade in the forecast and it also reflects the Fed sort of straddling this issue of they expect inflation to pick up, they expect wages to pick up, but it is still an expectation not a reality.</p><p>The Fed has been humbled many times by how they've expected inflation and it is not showing up. They thought it was transitory, the slowdown in inflation, they really won't find that out until the data comes out for the March inflation data which comes out in April so by June they'll have a much more firm footing on whether they are seeing the whites of the eyes on inflation which is I think what it takes to really move the whole committee to that four commitment in June.</p><p>ASHER: Now one of the things that Clare was talking about as well is this - is this idea of headwinds on the horizon. I think the looming headwinds especially because we might get an announcement, we will get an announcement tomorrow, President Trump is going to be announcing tariffs against China tomorrow. We expect China to retaliate as well, hitting agricultural exports.</p><p>How is that going to play into the economic headwinds that the U.S. economy might see?</p><p>SWONK: Well this is the great unknown and the uncertainty and I think you really saw J. Powell sort of dodged the questions, he did say - acknowledge that it was discussed and the minutes are going to be watched very closely because I think the precedence (ph) of the Feds which are all - which tend to be more economist, those economists that were around the table would have a different kind of scenario that they're going to be talking about and the destruction or the inflationary consequences of tariffs what that can mean, different scenarios.</p><p>Then the non-economists around the table which includes Chairman Powell and I think he was very artful at how we sort of balanced and diplomatic saying, \"Listen, this is something people are concerned about it, the business community has expressed concern but we can't as the Fed do anything about it until we know what they are,\" there is that uncertainty, they have to react.</p><p>And I think you really saw that in the present moment with Chairman Powell, he's also much more plain-spoken he had as many questions thrown at him but got done in half the time as Chair Yellen, that's because he doesn't do a deep dive on economics, he's really, 'colors within the line,' and this is what you're going to see from him as he stay - stay into his script; even though they have to deal with it, they can't deal with it until it happens.</p><p>And so even though the - it was discussed I think it really highlights how much the minutes will reveal and how the economists at the table felt versus the non-economists and that will come out in those minutes to the meeting.</p><p>ASHER: Yes. As Fed chair you have to be very, very, careful with every single word that comes out of your mouth because as we've seen, the markets are watching you very, very closely. We saw a lot of movement in the stock market today.</p><p>All right, Diane Swonk LIVE for us there, thank you so much.</p><p>All right still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS Facebook's Founder, finally faces up to his company's biggest challenge yet, we'll have much more on how Marc Zuckerberg is responding to him massive data breach.</p><p>After the break, don't go away</p><p>[17:25:18].</p><p>[17:30:00] ZAIN ASHER, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello everyone, I'm Zain Asher, coming up on the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'll speak to a former project -- products manager at Facebook as Mark Zuckerberg prepares to sit down for a Cnn exclusive interview.</p><p>And the CEO of Starbucks tells us about his plans with Chinese expansion we call that though, these are the headlines we're following for you at this hour.</p><p>All right, just a short time ago, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence on the Cambridge Analytica scandal that allowed the firm to harvest tens of millions of users data.</p><p>Zuckerberg admitted Facebook made a mistake, he vow to a strict, develop his data access and offered a tool that shows you his wish app debuts and how to revoke those apps data permissions.</p><p>British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Russia will look to boost its image by hosting the World Cup in the same way Adolf Hitler tried to use the 1936 Olympics in Nazi, Germany.</p><p>Those comments coming as he addressed lawmakers. Johnson also said the timing of the poisoning of a former Russian spy is likely connected to Vladimir Putin's re-election.</p><p>South Korea and the President Moon Jae-in suggesting a three-way summit is possible between himself, North Korea's Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump. He says it could happen if the planned separate summit go with Kim -- with Kim go well.</p><p>Meantime, North Korea is hailing witful, a sign of change in its relations with the United States. And more than 70 million people are under winter weather warning or watches as a powerful snow storm slams the U.S. northeast.</p><p>Schools are closed in several states and more than 4,700 flights have been canceled. The storm is disrupting Washington, the White House in fact canceled all public events and federal offices were closed.</p><p>And the suspect in the string of bombings in Texas killed himself on Wednesday by detonating a bomb in his vehicle as police approached. Police have identified him as a 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt.</p><p>Police say Conditt is responsible for five bomb explosions that killed two people and injured five.</p><p>OK, so we want to return now to our top story. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has broken his silence five days after a data scandal completely engulfed his company. In a Facebook post, Mark Zuckerberg admitted that the firm made mistakes with users data and pledged to restore -- guess he meant trust.</p><p>Samuel Burke is joining us live now from Miami. So Samuel, how much did this actually do? The statement by Zuckerberg actually do to restore trust in his company that has no doubt been just very much broken.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Zain, let's just go through these one-by-one, because there are still a lot of gaps here. He laid out three points. Number one, they're going to go back and investigate the apps, like this personality test that had access to large amounts of data.</p><p>But even in his letter here on Facebook, he admits that Facebook knew about this in 2015 and investigated it then. So how will this investigation be different and why didn't they notify us back in 2015. Number two, they're going to restrict the apps that are still on the platform.</p><p>But Facebook doesn't make most of its money this way, it makes most of its money through ads. So why even allow apps to have any of our data at all. And number three, they say they're going to have a new tool that's going to help people understand these apps better.</p><p>But Zain, this tool has really been around, why didn't they make it easier for people to find before, and how come so often when Facebook creates these tools, they're only available on the desktop, even though they pride themselves in being a mobile company.</p><p>More people use the Facebook app than use the desktop model. So how come these all important tools so often only are available on their desktops. There are still some very big gaps that need to be filled in here, Zain.</p><p>ASHER: So the biggest issues now for Facebook, I mean, in terms of where people are really concerned, are the biggest issues outright dishonesty? Is it lack of transparency or blatant carelessness?</p><p>[17:35:00] BURKE: I think especially the latter too. When you talk about the lack of transparency -- again, they knew about this in 2015 and never told us. And it does seem rather careless that people -- just a professor at Cambridge University originally before had to get off to Cambridge Analytica was able to get this type of information.</p><p>And really, people didn't realize that. So there needs to be much more transparency here. But then I really think this gets to a question that people at the core of Facebook, people inside the bubble have been asking not for days, not for weeks, but for months if not years.</p><p>We have been hearing people sound the alarm saying they're putting the cart before the horse. In this case, the cart being the money. They're focused on profit and they're not realizing that this is the first time a company has had access, direct access to $2 billion and they don't realize or they're choosing to willfully ignore the power of their platform.</p><p>This isn't a new story in a way. People have been saying, this could be a problem for ages, and now we know, and certainly now, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg know that it is a problem.</p><p>ASHER: Right, Samuel Burke live for us, thank you so much, appreciate that. OK, I'm joined now by former Facebook Products Manager Antonio Garcia Martinez; former Facebook Products Manager.</p><p>Somebody who used to work at Facebook yourself, how do you think Zuckerberg did?</p><p>ANTONIO GARCIA MARTINEZ, FORMER PRODUCTS MANAGER, FACEBOOK: You know, I think he did -- he did exactly what he needed to do. Basically, he needs to shut down platform.</p><p>Platform is a product that the company made a big bet on in 2011, 2012, it's kind of languished, frankly, nobody uses that much anymore. And he basically closed, you know, the hall on the data leak that produced this entire Cambridge Analytica fiasco.</p><p>And I think it's the right thing. It's a concrete technical step and it's what the company should have done.</p><p>ASHER: You know, what's interesting is that there have been so -- on this program and of course, from many networks, we've covered so many tech companies that have experienced crisis. It's certainly nothing new these days.</p><p>But this one I have to say, Antonio, this one feels different. Do you think the damage done is repairable?</p><p>MARTINEZ: Yes, I mean, I think -- look, you know, a lot of users have sort of a love-hate relationship with Facebook, and this is I think part and parcel of that. I know, I think the damage done might be repairable, it's actually more internal to Facebook.</p><p>I think the internal morale and sort of internal cohesion of the company that has gotten it, you know, to where it is today, I think that's taken a big hit. A lot of the leaks that are coming out of the company show a lot of policy intrigue happening, almost are involved in the part of employees.</p><p>The fact that you even have leaks is already significant. Facebook was a famously secretive company that never allowed leaks and now you're seeing those. So I think ultimately, the biggest damage the company might suffer might be purely internal.</p><p>In terms of the external damage, you know, Facebook is so addictive that at the end of the day, you know, users might say, oh, delete Facebook, they might do it today, but they'll reinstall tomorrow.</p><p>ASHER: Right, so you think that, you know, I guess this turmoil is somewhat short-lived. But you mentioned traditionally, Facebook hasn't really had that many leaks. The people that --</p><p>MARTINEZ: Right --</p><p>ASHER: You still know that work at Facebook, how is the morale right now?</p><p>MARTINEZ: I think it's pretty poor. You know, the way it works in Silicon Valley is, you know, your job is more than just a job, it's kind of your life. And you know, you wear a shirt with a Facebook logo on it or whatever company it is, and you feel kind of proud of that fact.</p><p>You like working for a cool world changing company. And if people will look at a name like Facebook and think, oh, you know, spying on you, something or well in, that's just not cool anymore.</p><p>And yes, I think people are not going to feel very good about that.</p><p>ASHER: OK, so I have Mark Zuckerberg's statement in my hand, I've highlighted a lot of it and made notes. But what I found very interesting is the comments from people who replied to Mark Zuckerberg and just reading to it what they said.</p><p>You know, some people were actually very positive, saying listen, Mark, you made a mistake, we forgive you, you've done so much good for the world, you've done so much to unite the world and we appreciate that.</p><p>But a lot of people, a lot of people had very negative things to say. You know, how can we trust you again? You've destroyed your credibility, you know, we're not buying the fact that you didn't know anything.</p><p>You know, it just felt as though, the balance of comments and the balance of opinion on this was far more negative than positive.</p><p>MARTINEZ: I mean, maybe. You know, maybe I'm too much of a tacky, but you know, the reality is, this is the nature of having a platform opened to third party developers. I mean, most of those people with those negative comments may not realize it, but the Apple app store for example or you know, the Android app store is exactly the same.</p><p>If developers -- you know, when you download one of those apps, you consent to sharing your data to those apps, and that is outside of Apple or Google or in this case Facebook's control, and they can do anything with that data.</p><p>I mean, that's kind of the world that we live in --</p><p>ASHER: Antonio, I get what you're saying, I get what you're saying, but you know, we sign up to it, we click yes, I agree, I accept on the user agreement. But really, a lot of people find those user privacy agreements so cumbersome, so difficult to understand, so difficult to read.</p><p>So it's unfair to say that, you know, the -- maybe users do that, some responsibility. But Facebook has far more responsibility, especially because Mark Zuckerberg actually admitted in his statement that he knew about what went wrong since 2015 and we're only --</p><p>[17:40:00] MARTINEZ: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: Finding out about it now.</p><p>MARTINEZ: Yes, I know, I think you put your finger on the part of it. You know, I think the part where the company I think actually deserves a fair deal of criticism is exactly what you just said.</p><p>You know, this came out over the weekend for a couple of reasons. They booted Cambridge, there's a leaker or some sort of a face to the company. But the reality is, this has been reported for something like two years, right?</p><p>And yes, I do think the company should have acted earlier. The company that I remember was really aggressive about protecting user data, and I just don't understand how you know, once it was revealed that Cambridge was doing what it was doing, why didn't it act faster?</p><p>Yes, I think you're right, yes, absolutely --</p><p>ASHER: OK, Antonio, very quickly because I'm out of time. Mark Zuckerberg is going to appear on Cnn tonight in just a few hours from now --</p><p>MARTINEZ: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: What do you want to hear from him?</p><p>MARTINEZ: Well, I think, you know, part of what he said in his post, I want him to take some responsibility, right? Like he said in his post, I find that he's complaining, ultimately I'm responsible for it. And you know, I think that will clear the air.</p><p>Because the reality is, his absence has been pretty conspicuous for the past week which is really unusual. He actually comes out and actually speaks with the employees directly every week, and he hasn't even for this scandal.</p><p>So yes, I think he needs to show in a face and saying, I accept responsibility for this and I apologize, I think will go a long way to regain user trust.</p><p>ASHER: Gosh, it was so fascinating having your perspective, especially given that you used to work inside the company, so you understand what is going on inside the company right now. Antonio, thank you so much for being with us, I appreciate that.</p><p>MARTINEZ: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: All right, let's talk about Facebook stock, because shares actually did rise, interestingly enough, did rise slightly on Wednesday, it ended up three-quarters of 1 percent. There wasn't that much movement though after the Zuckerberg statement came out.</p><p>As I mentioned, they closed up ever so slightly, but they are still down, they are still down more than 8 percent this week so far. Although several analysts on Wall Street say they're not necessarily worried about the long term share price.</p><p>So and then -- this could just be a blip on the radar. Now as I mentioned, Mark Zuckerberg is going to be giving an exclusive interview tonight to our Lori Siegel in just a few hours from now. You can watch that on \"ANDERSON COOPER AC 360\" which airs -- if you're in London, that will be 1 O'clock in the morning your time.</p><p>But then don't worry, the interview will be played throughout the day on Thursday as well. OK, still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, when a test-base turns deadly, a fatal crash involving a self-driving car sparked questions for our amazing(ph) industry, that story next.</p><p>ASHER: A fatal crash in Arizona is sparking debate over the safety of testing self-driving cars on public streets. Police say the self-driving Uber was going 14 miles an hour and a 30 mile -- 35 mile an hour zone when it hit and killed pedestrian Elaine Hertzberg.</p><p>A test driver was behind the wheel, but the car was in autonomous mode, it was in self-driving mode. Uber and Toyota have stopped U.S. protesting of their self-driving vehicles after the crash. Google's Waymo and Apple, Tesla, GM Intel all appear to be continuing.</p><p>[17:45:00] To discuss these safety concerns, I'm joined now by Jason Levine; executive director of the Center for Autosafety. Jason, thank you so much for being with us. So I mean, given this fatal crash that we've seen, what changes do you want to see in the self-driving car industry.</p><p>JASON LEVINE, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR AUTOSAFETY: Thank you for having me. I think what we want to see is lots of focus on this particular incident, though obviously tragic and more of an understanding that there's really no regulation or safety guidelines in place, that either the federal or the state level when it comes to self-driving vehicles at the moment.</p><p>One of the reasons that Uber is in Tempe and Waymo is in Chandler, Arizona, which is just down the road is because Arizona has basically opened itself up as a state where they are saying, please come in and we're not going to regulate you in any particularly strong fashion.</p><p>And arguably, not in any fashion at all as long as you self-certify that what you're doing is going to be saved. There's no demonstrated safety mechanism ahead of time before these vehicles should be put on the road. So I think what will be smart to come out of this horrible strategy is an understanding of how our communities are going to be made safe prior to this product coming on the road.</p><p>Because it's brand new technology, it's exciting, but has the potential to save a lot of lives. But we're told at the beginning and the question is who is making sure that it's safe before it's getting on the road, not afterwards.</p><p>ASHER: Right, their argument would be that self-driving cars are extremely safe because the technology is in place -- normally, I guess it didn't happen this time, but normally the technology is in place to detect any sort of moving person, any other vehicle on the road, plus, would be self- driving cars.</p><p>You also have testers inside the vehicles as well. Obviously, something went wrong this time. Would a possible solution be to continue testing self-driving cars that limit the number of tests on public roads for now?</p><p>LEVINE: That would certainly be an excellent start, and I think what's important to understand is, the expectation can be that we're going to go from 40,000 or -- it's actually 37,000 traffic crash test in the United States a year, down to zero overnight.</p><p>That is obviously the goal, that's where we all, all want to get to. But the technology is certainly not perfect yet, and who knows it will ever be perfect. But I think what we're getting a little bit of a false sense security. You know, we have a safety driver in these vehicles and he or she can take over when the problems occur.</p><p>Well, as we see and what happened in Tempe, that isn't necessarily always going to be the case. Is it important to make sure that the product, the technology has been tested in a way that make sure it works before there's wide deployment.</p><p>Of course it is, you can't just do that in a lab. That said, we don't introduce drugs to our senior citizens, we don't issue toys to our children without some level of a demonstration of safety before it gets into the main stream.</p><p>And even more so, we don't do it with the cars that don't have autonomous technology on them right now. Right now, you know, if you want to go buy a 20 --</p><p>ASHER: All right --</p><p>LEVINE: Fifteen car --</p><p>ASHER: Yes --</p><p>LEVINE: It's got a lot more standards around it.</p><p>ASHER: Jason, I have to leave you, I'm afraid because we're running out of time, but thank you so much. Jason Levine live for us, thank you, appreciate that --</p><p>LEVINE: Thank you for having me.</p><p>ASHER: You're welcome. OK, so on a day of a major snowstorm here in New York, all I can do is dream of the beats that I pulled in one second. Let me have a little peek, a little peek at the condition this morning on Australia's Bondi Beach, gorgeous, I'm so jealous.</p><p>More than a 2.7 million tourists are visiting Bondi every single year. One photographer is saying how he turned his love of Bondi into a global business on this week's \"TRADERS\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a story about how one man combined his love of surfing, photography and the web to create a multi-million dollar business enjoyed by people across the world.</p><p>Meet Eugene, the creator of Aquabumps. He's been taking photos of Australia's iconic Bondi Beach almost every day for the past 18 years.</p><p>EUGENE TAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AQUABUMPS: Aquabumps was born out of a hobby essentially. I love taking photographs. I see that (inaudible) in the '90s, take the photo, aim out to friends. The aim out grew in popularity and then people asked to purchase the photographs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That is when he started his online business. After that, came a permanent gallery situated only a few hundred meters from the beach.</p><p>TAN: We got a million with e-commerce, we were selling online back when it was kind of cave man day. We have such a big a market than just little old Bondi Beach and (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today, Aquabumps trade globally, selling on average, 100 prints a week.</p><p>[17:50:00] TAN: We shoot prints all over the globe. Obviously, Cinemac(ph) is huge to us, that'd be about half of all prints sold in this gallery. That should change the time we go to the USA, another few changes then we go to the U.K. and actually with my account -- the rest of the volume.</p><p>We sell pictures to mainland China, Poland, you know, all over the place, Africa, you name it, we send prints there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Key to the business is building his online presence. Since day one, Eugene has been sending daily e-mails with his photographs to subscribers in Australia and abroad.</p><p>He's also tapped into social media channels to strengthen his brand and to increase his following.</p><p>TAN: The core group is our e-mail subscription. We have 40,000 on that, Facebook, 120,000 at the moment, Instagram is 117,000.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Social media platform, Instagram currently has more than 800 million monthly active users. With many expecting it to reach a billion in 2018. That's more than doubled the monthly active users of Twitter and over three times the many users on WhatsApp and Facebook messenger.</p><p>But at 25 million businesses on Instagram, today, 200 million Instagramers actively visit the profile of the business. When he first began capturing his favorite corner of the world, Eugene never expected such a global response.</p><p>But now, as he seeks to share his images even more widely, he's realized what makes his photos so appealing.</p><p>TAN: I think it's attractive to people, in that it gives them escapism, unlike the two minute escape guy who looks at my work and he's like, oh, that's where I want to be today.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: Welcome back everybody. Facebook says it's reached pay equity in the United States when it comes to gender and race. It's a milestone for the employer with more than a 150,000 Americans.</p><p>CEO Kevin Johnson told Maggie Lake where Starbucks is going next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN JOHNSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, STARBUCKS: Starbucks today, we're announcing a 100 percent pay equity across the United States for any one in similar jobs by gender or race, we've achieved 100 percent pay equity --</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNNMONEY: Means a lot of applause on that, I'm sure --</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, and we've worked -- we've worked hard for a couple of years. Now to ensure, we could get there. But we are now there, and I think that's another example of us taking care of our partners.</p><p>And by being able to make that statement allows us to continue to attract the kinds of talent and the kinds of great people that help us build this brand.</p><p>LAKE: China, we know that your investors are laser-focused on that as real area of growth. The numbers have been good, is it sustainable?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I think certainly we believe it is. And here is why? Economists project that the Chinese GDP will grow to over $15 trillion dollars by the year 2021. That growth in GDP is doing a massive expansion in the middle class in China.</p><p>The middle class now is estimated at about 300 million people, they anticipate that doubling to 600 million people in the next three to four years.</p><p>[17:55:00] That doubling of the middle class, 600 million people in the middle class nearly doubled U.S. population.</p><p>So for us, we've grown from about 700 stores in China five years ago to 3,200 stores today. So we just are now integrating each China and acquisition of the joint venture in east China. And as we do that, we're going to be able to accelerate new store growth in China.</p><p>So China is the second largest and fastest growing market for Starbucks. And there are, you know, decades of growth opportunity ahead for us in China.</p><p>LAKE: I have my friends and colleagues who are really struck by the fact that you're not just in the big cities, you're in the smaller, second, third-tier cities. But they wonder about brand loyalty. In the west, especially in America, we're very brand aware.</p><p>There's a sense that they go to Starbucks, but if there's one closer, maybe they'll go there too. How do you -- how do you engage a Chinese consumer on loyalty?</p><p>JOHNSON: I think in China, no other western consumer brand has established affinity with the Chinese consumer in the way that Starbucks has. We've been in China for 18 years now, and we enter China in a way where we focus on being respectful to the culture and the people in China.</p><p>We've invested in our partners in China, and we've done it in a way to create Starbucks as an aspirational brand for the Chinese consumer. We're introducing them to premium coffee in a market that's -- you know, a tea forward sort of society.</p><p>And as a result, we continue to see significant growth in our relationships with the Chinese consumer. And I think the brand is very strong in China. We just opened a Starbucks reserve glossary in Shanghai, you know, a 30,000 square foot, the largest Starbucks in the world.</p><p>And the number of customers that we are serving, not only in that store, but in our stores in China just continues to grow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: All right, my friends, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'm Zain Asher in New York, news continues right here.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018032101cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXP-4M91-DXH2-60PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Happy Thursday, everybody, thanks for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, July 11th, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Federal Reserve chairman, Jay Powell, driving global markets higher this morning, and late yesterday, futures pointing to more gains after Powell signaled a rate maybe on the way, the Dow, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ hitting new intraday highs yesterday, after Powell spoke, only the NASDAQ managed to end the day at a new record high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Escalating tensions with Iran, Iranian gun boats tied to -- tried to seize a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, but the attempt thwarted after a British warship intervened. We've got the very latest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And severe storms hitting the Gulf of Mexico, a state of emergency declared in Louisiana, as oil rigs are evacuated and New Orleans is hit with massive flooding, we've got the forecast.</p><p>Then, Bitcoin, plunging this morning, the cryptocurrency takes a hit after Fed chair Powell expresses concern about Facebook's new offering, MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>All right, we've got a big program this morning. Coming up, Philadelphia Federal Reserve president, Charles Plosser, in the studio this morning, undersecretary -- former Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, Bob Hormats, joining us this morning, along with Tennessee senator Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee member, Marsha Blackburn.</p><p>Plus, \"THE FIVE\" co-host Juan Williams, weighing in as well, don't miss a moment of it. Big three hours coming up, right now.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman, and Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes, great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, great to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Steve and I jumped into each other at the McDonald's on 6th Avenue, so we're fueled up with the breakfast of champions. We're ready to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that right?</p><p>FREEMAN: It's going to be a big morning.</p><p>FORBES: Make Maria great again --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, good. OK.</p><p>FORBES: -- even greater.</p><p>FREEMAN: We declined the healthy options in the green room.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God. It's hilarious.</p><p>FORBES: You don't go to McDonald's for a -- go to a fat farm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I would've expected you to go to 7-Eleven on this slopey day, by the way, 7/11. Anyway, markets this morning are higher, we had the Powell conversation yesterday and, of course, the testimony hit markets on the upside, and we got that optimism once again this morning, the chairman, Jay Powell's comments about the rate cuts and the backdrop for the economy.</p><p>The Central Bank sounded dovish on future rate cuts, citing global and domestic economic conditions, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: We look at a broad range of data, so let's start with a broad where, I think, since the June meeting and for a period before that, the data have continued to disappoint. Let's go to trade, we have agreed to begin discussions again with China, well, that's a constructive step. It doesn't remove the uncertainty that we see as overall, weighing on the outlook.</p><p>So, I would say that the bottom line for me, is that the uncertainties around global growth and trade continue to weigh on the outlook, in addition, inflation continues to be muted and those things are still in place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: He talked about cross currents weighing on the outlook as well, Steve, what did you think of that yesterday?</p><p>FORBES: Well, he certainly has learned his lesson from President Trump, although he never admit it, and I think, too, though, one of the things that did not get much attention yesterday was he's opened the first shot against Judy Shelton. He planted question on the gold standard, they don't want her on the Federal Reserve board.</p><p>They're going to try to do to her what they did to Stephen Moore and Herman Cain. And so, I think you're going to see some fireworks there. The empire does not want dissidents on its board.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, so you -- so that was all planned in terms of the response making -- putting the stake in the ground on that.</p><p>FORBES: As they use to say, there are no coincidences, comrade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess so.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I want Judy Shelton on the Fed.</p><p>FORBES: So do I.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think Americans should want her on the Fed. And I think she's going to prove a more formidable dissident than maybe some of the others with due respect to her friends.</p><p>FORBES: She knows how to ask the right questions.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: And knows she's got all the economic credentials, so they can't say, oh, you don't have PhD, she does, and that's what they fear, an informed critic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they don't want -- yes, they don't want dissidents.</p><p>FORBES: You bet.</p><p>FREEMAN: And as you said, very dovish, and we are seeing that in the minutes too. This is a group that kind of likes inflation. It's weird when you, sort of, study the history of monetary policy to see how much -- I don't want to say obsessed with making sure we have inflation, I don't know why from a saver consumer point of view, you want to ensure that you have inflation.</p><p>FORBES: Yes. Well, two percent inflation, making $60,000 a year that means an extra $1,200 you have to spend extra, that's supposed to stimulate the economy, not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>FORBES: And they still worship this idea that prosperity causes inflation, a little Phillips curve (INAUDIBLE) low unemployment, you have to have high inflation. We have low inflation, low unemployment, but at the Fed, they ignore reality.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We're finally getting wages - -</p><p>FORBES: obsolete theories.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're finally getting wages growing north of three percent for the first time in this expansion under the Trump administration, and they want to foul it up.</p><p>FORBES: And those wage increases are coming especially for low-income workers, nonsupervisory workers, the people you want to have moving up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Greg Ip has a column in the Wall Street Journal about that very thing today. The -- a record expansion surprise winners are the low- skilled workers in this country. But it was surprising what happened, there was no chance for half-point cut before the testimony yesterday, now there is a 29 percent chance based on the future's market of a half point rate cut in July.</p><p>A half point rate cut in July, frankly, would signal that there are much bigger weaknesses on the horizon because that's exactly what the Fed did in 2001 and 2007, it was when they started, they initiated half-point cuts rather than quarter point cuts when there was clear signs of weakness in the economy, so I'd be careful what you wish for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he did say that manufacturing and housing are the two weak spots right now, and then there was the cross currents of uncertainty over trade. But when you look at the economy today, I mean, today, things look pretty good, I mean, you've got these uncertainties on the horizon, but 50 basis points seems a little harsh even if it's just an uncertainty.</p><p>FORBES: I think they'll go for 25, they are very shy --</p><p>BARTIROMO: In July?</p><p>FORBES: Yes, 25 basis points, not 50.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't see the case for any cutting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know either.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: There is one.</p><p>FREEMAN: You are concerned about these trade negotiations, capital expenditures not what we would like them to be, but that was a great jobs report. He basically dismissed it yesterday. And you look at where the Federal funds rate is versus inflation, still historically very low.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right? I don't hear businesses saying we need a quarter point, lower interest rate, and then we'll borrow (INAUDIBLE) about trade.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We look back to '95 and '98, where the Fed was doing -- initiated quarter point cuts as the so-called insurance policy against a recession, and that did seem to work, '98 was the Russian debt -- the Russian debt crisis, long-term capital management collapsed and we also had the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and the star report coming out all of the same time.</p><p>And the Fed did prevent a recession, quite frankly, that you -- that they cut rates, boo with the market, boo with asset prices and we didn't get a recession until 2000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We should --</p><p>FORBES: My monetary --</p><p>MCDOWELL: 2001</p><p>FORBES: -- policy is not going to be a substitute for getting these trade disputes out of the way.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point. And that's where the cross currency of the trade come in. Let's talk Middle East tensions for a minute, because Iranian ships attempted to block a U.K. tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, only to be turned around by a British warship.</p><p>This area has been rocked recently by a string of confrontations, including the downing of an American drone by Iran and attacks on oil vessels, which the U.S. is blamed on the Islamic Republic. This is in the latest escalation, James, your reaction?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, it's still a wait-and-see in terms of how Iran is really going to react to the president ordering and then rescinding the retaliatory attack, this was another, I don't know if you want to call it, shot across the bow, threatening but then retreating when the U.K. warship was there, but probably does emphasize the need for those ships to be there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about Nancy Pelosi, taking on her own caucus, for a second, the House speaker in a war of words with new congressional members. Freshman congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, sounds off on the spat, telling the Washington Post this, but the persistent singling out. It got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful, the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.</p><p>FORBES: Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO: This comment is basically -- AOC is calling Nancy Pelosi a racist.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome to our world, welcome to -- if you criticize any individual who's a liberal, who's a left-wing socialist liberal on their ideas, on them, saying something that you find repugnant or offensive, this is what happens, to shut you down and shut you up. They call you a racist and a bigot. And she's trying to pull the same thing with the leader of the Speaker of the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Who's been around a lot longer than you have, long before social media, and she knows how to govern.</p><p>FORBES: And when you have to play that card, it shows she's being isolated, AOC, because Pelosi wouldn't attack her and her colleagues like that if she wasn't worried about the 20 to 30 moderate Democrats who are in seats that they could lose in 2020. She wants to keep the house rather than apiece the extremist in her party.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Using your gender, using your ethnicity, using your gender, as a crutch that you lean on, and then they will turn around and whack you with it --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's pretty incredible.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- rather than standing on ideas, rather than standing by what you say, if somebody finds it offensive, then defend it. They can't.</p><p>FORBES: She can't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't forget, she's trying to get people to replace all of the people who have been in there for so long. I mean, AOC is trying to primary a lot of these guys and gals out.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. And Nancy Pelosi may someday regret signing on with the resistance in early 2017. But I think your social media point is right on here, because it's not that they have a difference of opinion, and AOC is further to the left, Nancy Pelosi is saying, I don't think all your Twitter followers add up too much. I don't think you actually represent many people in the country.</p><p>BARTIROM: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: She's questioning the authority of AOC, and I think that's what is driving AOC, crazy, here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Speaker Pelosi did the right thing in getting the Democrats together and voting for the $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid, the majority of that going to Health and Human Services to take care of children, who didn't vote for it? Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she didn't vote for it the first time, or the second time, the senate bill.</p><p>Instead, she goes down to the border and creates a social media scene to benefit one person, not the women, not the children, but herself. And if you're Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, the leader of the Democrats in Washington, in the House of Representatives, you would be, you know what, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then she came out with misinformation, I mean, that was --</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- all misinformation, telling people that they were telling migrants to drink water from the toilet bowl, absolutely not true.</p><p>FORBES: No. And I think there's a classic case where Pelosi let AOC hang herself, do at her own words, and public opinion is going on the side of the president and the whole border issue.</p><p>But that raises what's going to happen next week with these ICE raids, not going after MS-13 gang members, or go after them, but when you have the pictures of the women and children being deported, that's going to be a tough one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, we'll take a quick break. When we come back, Lockheed Martin stayed in Pennsylvania, another victory for the president. We're going to talk about that. Coming up, though, a tropical storm, building strength in the Gulf of Mexico, parts of Louisiana, already dealing with widespread flooding, the latest developments, coming up.</p><p>And then Bitcoin is under pressure this morning, the digital coin takes a hit after the Fed Chairman Jay Powell warns Congress about the cryptocurrency coming out of Facebook, his remarks, straight ahead. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Hurricane watches posted for parts of Louisiana, ahead of a tropical storm, Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. Louisiana is under a state of emergency as severe flooding stuns New Orleans already, flash flooding turned streets into rivers, some residents had to cut across town in their kayaks.</p><p>This is Tropical Storm Barry, which has gained strength over the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters are warning now that heavy downpours are still going to be a threat over the next several days.</p><p>Oil industry is bracing for what's expected to be the first hurricane of the season (INAUDIBLE) about a third of production in the Gulf. And as you can see, oil is up about half a percent right now, $60.74 a barrel, right now, WTI.</p><p>Well, Labor secretary Alex Acosta is defending how he handled convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking case in 2018. Acosta blamed the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office and he said it was ready to let Epstein walk free.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX ACOSTA, SECRETARY OF LABOR, UNITED STATES: Facts are important, and facts are being overlooked. What is the value of a secured guilty plea with registration versus rolling the dice?</p><p>And I know that in 2019, looking back on 2008, things may look different, but this was the judgment of prosecutors with dozens of years of experience. In our part, we were trying to do the right thing for these victims.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: And there's more, the NYPD reportedly did not check in with Epstein once -- one time at all since he was labeled a level three sex offender back in 2011. Epstein should have reported to the police 34 times. This is according to a report this morning in the New York post.</p><p>All right, Deutsche Bank is under investigation by the Justice Department, officials are looking into whether the bank violated anti-money laundering laws when it worked for Malaysian Development Fund, 1MDB.</p><p>The fund has been at the center of a fraud scandal but the justice department says led to, at least, $4.5 billion being stolen and even led to down fall of the former Malaysian prime minister. There is Deutsche Bank in the premarket, down almost a percent.</p><p>Then, there is this, Lockheed Martin is staying in Pennsylvania, the defense giant keeping open a helicopter plant there after President Trump had called for it.</p><p>The president tweeted on that news, \"I was just informed by Marillyn Hewson, CEO of Lockheed Martin, of her decision to keep the Sikorsky Helicopter Plant in Coatesville, Pennsylvania open and humming. We are very proud of Pennsylvania and the people who work there. Thank you to Lockheed Martin, one of the USA's truly great companies.</p><p>So, more jobs are staying in the U.S., Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl. Thanks so much, another good job story there. Coming up, Bitcoin is under pressure this morning, the digital coin takes a hit after the Fed chairman warn congress about Facebook's cryptocurrency, we've got his remarks coming up next.</p><p>And then, it is raining money, an armored truck spills cash, stopping traffic, police now warning those who cashed in, they want the money back, later this hour, stay with us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Federal Reserve would use (INAUDIBLE) some postponement and they're implementing Libra.</p><p>POWELL: There are deep, important serious questions across a range of issues here that will need to be addressed. It does have, potentially, systematic scale. And for all the reasons we discussed, it needs a careful look.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Federal Reserve chair, Jay Powell, set for a second day of testimony this morning, on Capitol Hill. Yesterday, he spoke with the House Financial Services Committee, warning congress of the risks from Facebook's planned cryptocurrency, Libra.</p><p>Now, Bitcoin prices are down, as a result, joining us right now is technology analyst, managing partner at Starship Capital, John Meyer, and John, it is good to have you on the program this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>JOHN MEYER, MANAGING PARTNER, STARSHIP CAPITAL: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your reaction to, first, the Facebook Libra product, because Bitcoin has been trading on it ever since the announcement?</p><p>MEYER: You're right. My reaction to Libra is that, it is really a natural next step. I mean, Bitcoin has been around for about 10 years now. It's seen extreme problems and it's also rightfully so, it's evolved quite a bit since then.</p><p>I think Libra is a step beyond Bitcoin, taking Bitcoin's technology, underlying technology block chain and applying it to pretty much most mainstream software you can get, which is now Facebook. And so, what Libra is trying to do is make it extremely easy to basically be able to send the money around the world, to your friends and families with very little fees.</p><p>And with very little of the problems that you normally have today in banking, such as the fact that you can only do it on workdays, the fact that you have the substantial fees to transfer money. And so Libra is taking that up a notch and making banking fully digital, the problem is, and what, you know, our government rightfully points out, is that this is a-- it's a very colossal step forward.</p><p>It's a big difference from what we have now with traditional banking. And it technically does allow a citizen in the U.S. or a citizen let's say, in Germany, really, anywhere around the world, to go around our traditional banking system.</p><p>And I -- and I respect the fact, as a technology analyst, that that does require a careful look on our government's side.</p><p>FREEMAN: John, James Freeman here at the Wall Street Journal, that sounds kind of cool in a lot of ways if you can around what could be a highly- regulated expensive traditional banking system, sounds like more choice for consumers.</p><p>MEYER: Definitely more choice for consumers and you know, what's beautiful about this is, again, I remind you that even Bitcoin was created on the back of the 2008 financial crisis and it was created for the reason of providing a more safe and fair financial system.</p><p>And, you know, Facebook has fixed some of Bitcoin's biggest issues, and actually adding a bit more transparency for, let's say, regulators and transparency for government agencies to actually have some control over this unlike Bitcoin, which is very, very much, I'd say, untouchable, in many ways by regulators.</p><p>FORBES: John, Steve Forbes here (INAUDIBLE) one of the big down falls of a Bitcoin are shortcomings, is its volatility, you know, steak one day, dog food the next, and Libra is promising stability, going to tie it to currencies or something not to gold, which they should, but if they get that kind of stability, you could use this as money, this could break the monopoly of governments on money.</p><p>And no wonder the Fed is concerned, is this sort of like Uber or BNB, kind of like blast away the old way of doing things?</p><p>MEYER: Right. Yes, I think -- I think this really has the potential to be something like that. And what's so interesting about this is that Facebook is absolutely pegging Libra directly to the U.S. dollar, which is fantastic, and that means that you're right, Steve.</p><p>The volatility issue of Bitcoin is gone with Libra, and this makes it incredibly easy for you to send money around the world, as a business or as an individual, with very little fees and that in itself could help economies all over the world and it could help some of the more, you know, second and third-world countries who actually struggle with immense inflation.</p><p>Because this is a currency that will be pegged to the U.S. dollar that will prevent all of that, and all you need is an internet connection, which, you know, as we know now, is absolutely the top priority in many third-world countries over even, let's say, finding food.</p><p>And so that's what's so incredible about this, is it solves some of the biggest issues that actually threaten democracy around the world and that are why I'm a fan of it. However, I still think the U.S. government needs to really know how it's actually working and what the exact repercussions are, which I'm not so confident in, right now.</p><p>And so, I think, the fact that they will be taking their time to delve into this, is smart on them, because this will have a huge impact on the U.S. financial system and on the global financial system full stop.</p><p>FORBES: But there's no way to predict that in the -- in the future, what the impact it's actually going to be, and you've got this digital wallets which is where handhelds were 35 years ago, which are now just being used for transfer of payments, they could replace the banking system when you look down 5 or 10 years down the road.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you believe that, Steve?</p><p>FORBES: I do. I think this has got enormous potential, and not entirely tongue-in-cheek, I suggested an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, don't be bashful, why call it the Libra, which is a measurement for the Roman empire and we know what happened to that.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) call it the Mark, the Germans gave up the Mark, so called it after himself, the Mark.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like it. Look, let me switch gears, ask you about the social media summit going on at the White House today, President Trump hosting prominent conservatives today at the White House to talk about how they can stop the suppression of their views on Facebook, Twitter, Google, other platforms. The president told me last month, tech companies may need more regulation, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would you rather see competition or do you want to see legislation coming down to actually --</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, you may need legislation in order to create competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is what technology companies are doing, what they did that to you, is that legal? Are they breaking the law, Mr. President?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I don't know whether or not. But I tell you what, they should be sued.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: They should be sued. Now, I know a number of these guys have testified in front of congress, it should be noted that the White House is not inviting any tech companies to this event today, but you've got a lot of people there that have been shadow banned, that have complained about censorship, what's your reaction, what comes out of this today?</p><p>MEYER: You know, I think what comes out of today is a bit of a stronger sense of centralized message on the Trump side of things, especially as it relates to his views towards the social media giants, Twitter and Facebook. And so, I do think it'll give him a bit more of an established presence with his arguments that there is shadow banning happening, that there is some sort of manipulation happening.</p><p>However, I do think it'll be extremely important to have the actual tech companies at the table and, you know, maybe they do another summit for that, but that's going to be incredibly important, because there's going to be -- go ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, please finish.</p><p>MEYER: Because if there's going to be a disconnect between, you know, the actual problems that Trump is raising and these natural tech companies who believe that they are following, you know, a bit of a standard protocol across all accounts, you know, these issues are still going to be up there.</p><p>And so, what I'd like to see is just a reasonable resolution on both sides, where both sides are heard and we can move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MEYER: And not be so stressed about --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was just going to point out that some of these executives have already been to the White House, so you know --</p><p>MEYER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- Jack from Twitter, met with the president, a number of the others, Eric Schmidt, they've testified in front of congress and have also been at the White House as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's not going to be -- there's not going to be anybody there today to defend the claims that will be aired.</p><p>FORBES: Well, and but though -- but those executives have not followed through on the removing crazy things like going after (INAUDIBLE) University for crying out loud. They're political -- they're -- politically, they're brain dead in terms of they should fix this right away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, you look at something like a -- like a Twitter. Devin Nunes -- Congressman Nunes, suing Twitter because he keeps getting shadowed in and his posts are taken down.</p><p>And meanwhile, AOC, she doesn't -- you know, she says whatever she wants, and her posts don't get taken down.</p><p>FORBES: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, this is the argument that Devin Nunes has been --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, so the natural opponent's regulation now wanted too. So, consumers, beware, there's a big consensus with big government and big companies to have regulation here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why doesn't somebody come along and open more and more social media networks? Again, that's the free market work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: People are upset by the way that they get treated by the -- this oligopoly of social media companies then, bring on the competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, you heard what the president just said two weeks ago when he was on this program, we might need legislation to spark competition. I found that interesting.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, its --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the --</p><p>FORBES: It's a -- it's a warning shot to those companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Fix your problem before you get the political fix.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. John, thanks so much. Great conversation. We appreciate you joining us this morning.</p><p>MEYER: Live, well, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see you soon, sir. Coming up, trade is in focus. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expected to meet with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill today. More on the push to get USMCA passed. It's going to be important.</p><p>Then, McDonald's franchise is climbing foul. A burger giant urging to focus on chicken later this hour. All of that ahead, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, July 11th. Your top stories right now 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, driving global markets this morning and they are higher.</p><p>As you see, Futures indicating a gain of 45 points on the Dow this morning. Up 17 on the Nasdaq, adding to gains after Powell signaled a rate cut is on the way. The Dow, the S&amp;P, and the Nasdaq getting new intraday highs after the chairman spoke yesterday. The S&amp;P crossing 3,000 before pulling back. Only in the Nasdaq ended the day at an all-time record high up 60 points at 8202 on the Nasdaq.</p><p>In Europe this morning, though momentum continues. Gains, well, look at this, the FTSE has just moved into negative territory, down two points actually. The CAC Quarante is up just a fraction and the DAX Index is lower by 40 points. So, you've got some negative performance this morning in Europe.</p><p>Checking Asia this morning overnight, markets were higher across the board. Best performer was the Korean Index, KOSPI up better than one percent.</p><p>Trade is in focus. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer expected to meet with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill today, we've got the preview there.</p><p>And then, this fast food battle to report. McDonald's franchising is asking for a chicken sandwich to compete with Chick-fil-A.</p><p>Plus, the big money grab. An armored truck sprays money across the Georgia highway. Eddie likes that. People jumped out of their cars to scoop up some currency. The incredible video, what police are doing about it now, needless to say, they want the money back.</p><p>All those stories coming up, this Thursday morning. But first, our top story this half-an-hour. Jay Powell back in the hot seat this morning on Capitol Hill. The Federal Reserve chairman will speak in front of the Senate today.</p><p>Yesterday, he signaled a possible interest rate cut, citing global and domestic economic conditions. Powell weighed in on economic and trade uncertainties and inflation worries. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL: Many FOMC participants saw that the case for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy stance had strengthened. Since then, based on incoming data and other developments, it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook. Inflation pressures remain muted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve president, Charles Plosser. And it is always a pleasure to see you, sir. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CHARLES PLOSSER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF PHILADELPHIA FEDERAL RESERVE: Good morning, great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, your reaction to what we're seeing today in the economy. We know as a backdrop, we're at a 51 year low on unemployment. We've got growth in the first quarter or better than three percent. And yet here we are talking about rate cuts. What's your take?</p><p>PLOSSER: Well, I don't find that there's a compelling case for rate cuts at this point. The stock markets, they're at an all-time high. As you said, unemployment's low, inflations low -- you know, what -- what's so bad about where we are?</p><p>It's true though, there's a lot of uncertainty out there and that certainly hinges around policies for the most part. Trade policies perhaps and other things that may happen in around the world, slowing in the global economy or Europe and other places.</p><p>But you know, monetary policy can't fix those. The Fed cutting rates now is not going to resolve trade uncertainties. It's not going to (INAUDIBLE) resolve policy problems. And --you know, if we end up in a trade war this serious, yes, the economy is going to take a hit. But the Fed can't do anything about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's very important --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PLOSSER: And I'm really -- I'm really concerned that we are expecting the Fed to do things that it really can't do. And you've heard me talk about this before over the years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely.</p><p>PLOSSER: And putting the onus on the Fed to take responsibility for things that it doesn't have much control over.</p><p>And I think that's a very bad place for -- and by the way, Jay Powell, in his language about the Fed will act to sustain the recovery. I think that's very bad language. He can't sustain the recovery in the face of some types of shocks. So, I think we -- I think we're just expecting too much and we need to tone it down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, when he says sustain the recovery, that's all on anticipation. Anticipating that things are going to slow down because of the uncertainties around trade. He said these new crosscurrents have to do with trade uncertainties.</p><p>PLOSSER: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that largely China or are you talking about other countries? I mean, it's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PLOSSER: Well, I think certainly China is a big part of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PLOSSER: But you know, the president has threatened put -- has threatened to put tariffs on Mexico, more tariffs on Europe. So I mean, I think -- is that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So the uncertainty is that where he's going to go next?</p><p>PLOSSER: Where is it going to be next?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes.</p><p>PLOSSER: And how is this all going to get played out? And the Fed can't resolve that, it has to react to that. But as you know, you read the newspapers and the headlines and one week a trade agreement is on, the next week a trade agreement is off.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PLOSSER: The next week there's a new trade -- and the Fed can't deal with that. And it shouldn't be reacting to that kind of volatility in the news about policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Congresswoman has really been sort of the loudest voice in the room in terms of questioning current policy. Yesterday, she questioned Powell. She's on the Financial Services Committee. She talked about the Phillips curve, unemployment, and inflation.</p><p>Listen to this question. I want to see if you know what she's talking about. I was really perplexed. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I've been seeing lately that economist are increasingly worried that the idea of a Phillips curve that links unemployment and inflation is no longer describing what is happening in today's economy. Have you been considering on that? What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>POWELL: Very much that we spend a great deal of time on that. The connection between slack in the economy or the level of unemployment and inflation was very strong if you go back 50 years and it's gotten weaker and weaker and weaker to the point where it's a faint heartbeat that you can hear now.</p><p>It's still there, you can see it at state level data and things like that. But I think we really have learned though that the economy can sustain much lower unemployment than we thought without troubling levels of inflation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, this was the Phillips curve. She also talked about decoupling in the economy which is really what I was questioning. It's a different sound bite, but what's your reaction to that?</p><p>PLOSSER: Well, I think the Phillips curve is dead, it's been dead for 40 years. And I think the Fed is mistaken in thinking it can base its ability to stabilize the real economy, that is unemployment, by using control of inflation and vice versa.</p><p>And I think that's very problematic for the whole idea of Fed policy and monetary policy being a stabilization tool. And if the Phillips curve isn't there, then the Fed needs to find another way to meet its dual mandate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you expect the economy to slow down later this year? We're talking about so far, three percent in the first quarter, maybe a little lower for the first half of the year. But we know that the global economy is slowing. Europe is having a hard time generating any growth. Do you think things slow down?</p><p>PLOSSER: Right. Well, I think if you look to go back to the forecast for 2019 last fall, 2018 was coming in close to three percent, almost everyone was forecasting something between two and 2-1/2 percent for 2019.</p><p>Is that a good number? Probably still is. And by the way, trend, potential growth is less than two or just under two. So, there's still the forecast that we're going to be at or near trend for 2019. And so, I find the notion that you know, there's this panic that we need to react to, troubling. And the fact that last December, when the markets hit a lot of volatility, I think the Fed overreacted.</p><p>They sent a signal that they were going to be dovish and cut rates and they doubled down on that over the course of the spring. And now they're in a position where I think to some degree the Fed's probably afraid that if they don't now deliver on the rate cuts, they're going to -- they're going to cause another bout in volatility, and they don't want to do that.</p><p>That's the curse of paying too much attention to financial markets when you do monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Financial markets and maybe the president's criticism.</p><p>PLOSSER: Maybe the president's criticisms too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's -- there is that as well.</p><p>PLOSSER: So, getting above that fray and not reacting to short term volatility and short term reactions is a dangerous place for the Fed to be, but that's a failure that they been -- they gotten into over the long -- of all the years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: To be clear, we could have prosperity and growth without inflation.</p><p>PLOSSER: Of course. Of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so, you know, why are we so worried that inflation is not meeting the target?</p><p>PLOSSER: I don't know. I'm perfectly happy with between 1-1/2 and two percent inflation. What's so bad about that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>PLOSSER: I think what's bad about it -- the only thing that's bad about it is the Fed has set a target of two percent. That's -- and, but you know, we can only measure these things so precisely.</p><p>The difference between -- I mean, the public doesn't know the difference between 1.8 and two percent inflation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, exactly.</p><p>PLOSSER: Who cares?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and real quick on trade because there's so much uncertainty. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expected to meet with the House members to discuss the USMCA.</p><p>We know that USMCA is really important. Do you think it passes? Is it going to come to the floor? How does that work its way into the economy, do you think?</p><p>PLOSSER: Well, I think that the good thing about that if it passes is that it resolves one more uncertainty out there, and I think that's important. So getting the uncertainty resolved is an important step to sort of re- stabilizing and bringing thing -- calming things down a bit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Charles, it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>PLOSSER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Charles Plosser, joining us there.</p><p>President Donald Trump just tweeted this morning about today's social media summit and the census. He writes this, \"The White House will be hosting a very big and very important social media summit today. Would I have become president without social media? Yes, probably. At its conclusion, we will also go to the beautiful Rose Garden for a news conference on the census and citizenship.\"</p><p>The president is setting off the day this morning and telling us on Twitter.</p><p>We'll take a break. When we come back, McDonald's is feeling the heat. The burger chain urged to off its chicken game. Why Chick-fil-A is causing some stress there. Back in a moment with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America this morning. The American Renews reporting federal judge orders PG&amp;E to respond point by point to newspaper article about safety. The utility knew for years its aging transmission lines could spark fires, but apparently ignored it according to an article in the journal. PG&amp;E now is forced to file \"a fresh forthright statement.\" A utility spokesman says PG&amp;E's most important responsibility is the safety of customers and communities.</p><p>The Chicago Tribune this morning writes, McDonald's franchisees are pleading for better chicken sandwich to fend off Chick-fil-A threats. McDonald's feeling the heat from Chick-fil-A franchisees are calling on the Chicago-based burger giant to focus more on chicken so that they can compete better. Chick-fil-A's sales soar last year; flying past rivals. It's now the nation's third largest restaurant chain behind McDonald's and Starbucks.</p><p>And then, the Atlanta Journal Constitution this morning writes this: \"Drivers begin to return money after $175,000 in cash storm on I-285. It was the scene right out of a Hollywood movie. An armored car door swings open, spills cash all over the busy highway, drivers hit the brakes to grab and go. Police now are asking those who took the money and ran to return it or possibly face charges. What would you do if an armored truck door opens up and all the money starts spilling out?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'd save 50s and 100s. I would be in the middle of the street for some singles.</p><p>FREEMAN: Are they really going to charge someone for picking up a 50 off the road? I didn't know that was a crime.</p><p>FORBES: Is the IRS going to ask for photos to see, report the income?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Right. I don't think they're going to be able to get that money back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Given how bad drivers are in that state, I don't think -- you better stay in your car. It's dangerous when you're in your automobile, much less standing in the middle of the road.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is funny. All right, have you seen the new Gatorade sports drink, for the first time in years, Gatorade has new sports drink out; what it is and why the brand is standing out? That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Gatorade taking hydration around clock. Bolt 24 -- it is a new, low-calorie, electrolyte-packed drink aimed at athlete, says no artificial sweeteners or flavors. It's part of a new platform for the sport's beverage giant and marks the company's first major product launch in 20 years. Joining us right now is the Senior Vice President of Gatorade, Brett O'Brien. Brett, it's great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRETT O'BRIEN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, GATORADE: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you brought the new Bolt here. Tell us why did you decide to come out with this new product after 20 years?</p><p>O'BRIEN: Yes, sure did. This is a really awesome time for Gatorade. It allows us to think about athletes in a whole different way. For years in 1965, Dr. Cade invented Gatorade because he wanted to make athletes better, so that's great. Love it. When you're sweating in your own accord and you're -- or you're in the field of play, you want to drink Gatorade. What happens when you're not in the court? What happens throughout the day as an athlete? How do you best prepare your body and get ready for that moment of participation, for that moment of performance when you've got to be your best? And that's where Bolt plays an amazing role. And we call it Bolt 24, because it's set 24 hours of day of athlete preparation, that's where Bolt comes and really does an amazing job.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm doing the natural southern shake, might not need that but it is watermelon base which I found really interesting.</p><p>O'BRIEN: Yes, it is, and it's totally clean. It's a really interesting way to get -- to get electrolytes. Whereas in the past, electrolytes took different forms especially in salt. Sea salt and watermelon provide the electrolytes on this product.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why are electrolytes so important?</p><p>O'BRIEN: It's extremely important for athletes to stay hydrated. So, electrolytes continue to make sure that your body doesn't lose it's -- all of its hydration that's already in your body, and so that salt maintains the hydration that you need.</p><p>FORBES: What does it do for us non-athletes?</p><p>O'BRIEN: Well, actually, similarly it keeps you hydrated. It's what you want to be able to have in your body, so that you don't get dehydrated and you don't start to feel lethargic and -- but as an athlete, man, how important that is and how important it is to make sure as a coach or as a trainer or as a manager, your athletes, especially young athletes throughout there in the field, and this heat, maintaining proper --</p><p>MCDOWELL: 80 calories a bottle, so it's very low calorie for the volume.</p><p>O'BRIEN: It is. It's a low calorie, because the proposition is not about that heavy carbohydrate moment, it's about making sure that what you're putting in your body throughout the day is maintaining that level without having to push that -- the energy in the moment of impact, so to speak.</p><p>FORBES: Can't wait to show it to my grandchildren.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: As avowed Red Bull drinker, this is incredibly tasty -- and Red Bull is not for hydration, it's just for --</p><p>O'BRIEN: But I like -- thank goodness, you like the taste, that's awesome.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's important though.</p><p>O'BRIEN: It's extremely important.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- for the non-athletes.</p><p>O'BRIEN: It is. And you know, if you didn't like the taste, it all goes back to the hydration element of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And less sugar, because sugar -- everybody knows has become evil, right?</p><p>O'BRIEN: Well, it depends on the functionality, right? Sugar within Gatorade, if you need to be out there participating in heavy weather and putting your best, you need that carbohydrate and energy store to get you going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Brett, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>O'BRIEN: Thank you. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Brett O'Brien. Gatorade. Still ahead, Delta earnings out of top of the hour, we'll bring you the number.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Importantly, these experts don't just see monopoly as a problem; even basic economic courses show in toy models that they increase prices and decrease output. They also acknowledge that stagnant wages, rising profit share of GDP and escalating wealth concentration are bad outcomes economically and societally. A new paper by Fed economists Isabel Cair \u0301o and Jae Sim describes how they developed a model to simulate the impact of companies' rising market power[1], in conjunction with the assumption that the owners of capital liked to hold financial assets (here, bonds) as a sign of social status. </p><p>They wanted to see it it would explain six developments over the last forty years: Real wage growth stagnating and lagging productivity growth Pre-tax corporate profits rising rapidly relative to GDP Increasing income inequality Increasing wealth inequality Higher household leverage Increased financial instability And it did! For a model to have pretty decent fit for so many variables is not trivial. The first are what the model coughed up, the second, in parenthesis, are the real world data:We've embedded this readable paper at the end of the post. The authors did quite a few sensitivity test and also modeled some alternative explanations, as well as showing panels that compared model outputs over time to real economy outcomes. They also recommend wealth distribution as a way to dampen financial crises, or even just taxing dividends at a healthy level. Bloomberg wrote up the paper[2], an early indicator that it might get traction in official circles, and quoted Matt Stoller:  Matt Stoller, the author of 'Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy,' said both parties are culpable for the concentration of market power. Change is afoot because lawmakers realize they've ceded too much authority to large companies, he said. 'What you are seeing in the last five years is a shift where lawmakers think democratic institutions should be making more of the decisions,' Stoller said. The anti-monopolists are on a roll. Matt's colleague, the founder and head of Open Markets, Barry Lynn, wrote the cover story in the current Harpers Magazine, The Big Tech Extortion Racket: How Google, Amazon, and Facebook control our lives. [3] I strongly urge you to read the article in full. Lynn describes how America first grappled with monopoly power with the development of railroads and the telegraph. Their answer was regulation: For a century and a half, Americans used common carrier policies to ensure the rule of law in activities that depended on privately held monopolies. These rules served as a pillar of American prosperity through much of the twentieth century. By neutralizing the power of all essential transport and communications systems, the regulations freed Americans to take full advantage of every important network technology introduced during these years, including telephones, water and electrical services, energy pipelines, and even large, logistics-powered retailers. Citizens did not have to worry that the men who controlled the technologies involved would exploit their middleman position to steal other people's business or disrupt balances of power. Lynn explains how this has all gone pear shaped in the Internet era. The tech giants' access to personal information enables them to connect individuals to services they are presumed to like with enough success to drive more and more activity, transactions, and ad revenues through their platforms. Recall that tailoring also allows for price discrimination. Users of Apple devices have been shown higher airline ticket prices than PC/Android customers.  Amazon has preyed on third party sellers by copying their goods, as well as demanding more and more of the end sales price. This isn't a new trick. One of my former lawyers, who represented some beauty, cosmetics and dietary supplements entrepreneurs, warned them never to take orders from Walmart. The Bentonville giant would attempt, usually successfully, to place bigger and bigger orders so as to become the little company's biggest customer, by a large margin. Walmart would then squeeze the vendor to lower its price, which had the effect over time of wiping out profits and often leading to business failure. Walmart didn't care. To them, the world is awash in products. But Lynn sees Amazon as more predatory: Back in the day, Walmart's goal was simply to force manufacturers to offer it lower prices in order to undersell and bankrupt rival retailers. Now that Amazon has effectively killed off all its online rivals, its model is to pit every seller and trader on its website against one another in a carefully orchestrated scramble to be placed first before the eyeballs of the busy buyer. Amazon gets to sell both access to the market and protection from its own thuggish behavior. Having said that, it's disappointing to see Lynn demonstrate such a complete misunderstanding of Uber that he includes it as one of his monopoly villains. The fact that Uber has done damage to local taxi companies has zero to do with monopoly power or network effects. Uber's app isn't special and Uber has no cost advantages over traditional cabs; in fact, it is high cost provider. Nor are there meaningful barriers to entry to operating a local transportation business. Uber is a pure and bizarre case of predatory pricing funded by very deep Silicon Valley pockets.  Unfortunately, the discussion of Uber suggests an intellectual blindness to the anti-monopolists, that they have such a strong idee fixe that they wind up in 'If the only tool you have is a hammer, then every problem is a nail' mode.  A final development, and I must confess to needing to read the court filings to do it justice, is the brazen effort by Apple and now Google to crush games giant Fortnite for trying to go around the app store choke points. 'Tying,' or requiring the buyer of one product (like Apple products) to buy other products (apps only through them) is a per se violation of anti-trust laws. Fortnite would seem to have a very strong case, but Apple has just said it is also cutting Fortnite off from developer tools by August 28.  Even big player like Fortnite can't afford to wage this legal war unless it gets an emergency injunction. But this sort of thuggery usually happens less visibly and with companies too small to do anything other than capitulate.

Importantly, these experts don\u2019t just see monopoly as a problem; even basic economic courses show in toy models that they increase prices and decrease output. They also acknowledge that stagnant wages, rising profit share of GDP and escalating wealth concentration are bad outcomes economically and societally.    A new paper by Fed economists Isabel Cair \u0301o and Jae Sim describes how they developed a model to simulate the impact of companies\u2019 rising market power , in conjunction with the assumption that the owners of capital liked to hold financial assets (here, bonds) as a sign of social status. They wanted to see it it would explain six developments over the last forty years:    Real wage growth stagnating and lagging productivity growth    Pre-tax corporate profits rising rapidly relative to GDP    Increasing income inequality    Increasing wealth inequality    Higher household leverage    Increased financial instability    And it did! For a model to have pretty decent fit for so many variables is not trivial. The first are what the model coughed up, the second, in parenthesis, are the real world data:       We\u2019ve embedded this readable paper at the end of the post. The authors did quite a few sensitivity test and also modeled some alternative explanations, as well as showing panels that compared model outputs over time to real economy outcomes. They also recommend wealth distribution as a way to dampen financial crises, or even just taxing dividends at a healthy level.    Bloomberg wrote up the paper , an early indicator that it might get traction in official circles, and quoted Matt Stoller:    Matt Stoller, the author of \u201cGoliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy,\u201d said both parties are culpable for the concentration of market power. Change is afoot because lawmakers realize they\u2019ve ceded too much authority to large companies, he said.    \u201cWhat you are seeing in the last five years is a shift where lawmakers think democratic institutions should be making more of the decisions,\u201d Stoller said.    The anti-monopolists are on a roll. Matt\u2019s colleague, the founder and head of Open Markets, Barry Lynn, wrote the cover story in the current Harpers Magazine, The Big Tech Extortion Racket: How Google, Amazon, and Facebook control our lives.    I strongly urge you to read the article in full. Lynn describes how America first grappled with monopoly power with the development of railroads and the telegraph. Their answer was regulation:    For a century and a half, Americans used common carrier policies to ensure the rule of law in activities that depended on privately held monopolies. These rules served as a pillar of American prosperity through much of the twentieth century. By neutralizing the power of all essential transport and communications systems, the regulations freed Americans to take full advantage of every important network technology introduced during these years, including telephones, water and electrical services, energy pipelines, and even large, logistics-powered retailers. Citizens did not have to worry that the men who controlled the technologies involved would exploit their middleman position to steal other people\u2019s business or disrupt balances of power.    Lynn explains how this has all gone pear shaped in the Internet era. The tech giants\u2019 access to personal information enables them to connect individuals to services they are presumed to like with enough success to drive more and more activity, transactions, and ad revenues through their platforms. Recall that tailoring also allows for price discrimination. Users of Apple devices have been shown higher airline ticket prices than PC/Android customers.    Amazon has preyed on third party sellers by copying their goods, as well as demanding more and more of the end sales price. This isn\u2019t a new trick. One of my former lawyers, who represented some beauty, cosmetics and dietary supplements entrepreneurs, warned them never to take orders from Walmart. The Bentonville giant would attempt, usually successfully, to place bigger and bigger orders so as to become the little company\u2019s biggest customer, by a large margin. Walmart would then squeeze the vendor to lower its price, which had the effect over time of wiping out profits and often leading to business failure. Walmart didn\u2019t care. To them, the world is awash in products. But Lynn sees Amazon as more predatory:    Back in the day, Walmart\u2019s goal was simply to force manufacturers to offer it lower prices in order to undersell and bankrupt rival retailers. Now that Amazon has effectively killed off all its online rivals, its model is to pit every seller and trader on its website against one another in a carefully orchestrated scramble to be placed first before the eyeballs of the busy buyer. Amazon gets to sell both access to the market and protection from its own thuggish behavior.    Having said that, it\u2019s disappointing to see Lynn demonstrate such a complete misunderstanding of Uber that he includes it as one of his monopoly villains. The fact that Uber has done damage to local taxi companies has zero to do with monopoly power or network effects. Uber\u2019s app isn\u2019t special and Uber has no cost advantages over traditional cabs; in fact, it is high cost provider. Nor are there meaningful barriers to entry to operating a local transportation business. Uber is a pure and bizarre case of predatory pricing funded by very deep Silicon Valley pockets.    Unfortunately, the discussion of Uber suggests an intellectual blindness to the anti-monopolists, that they have such a strong idee fixe that they wind up in \u201cIf the only tool you have is a hammer, then every problem is a nail\u201d mode.    A final development, and I must confess to needing to read the court filings to do it justice, is the brazen effort by Apple and now Google to crush games giant Fortnite for trying to go around the app store choke points. \u201cTying,\u201d or requiring the buyer of one product (like Apple products) to buy other products (apps only through them) is a per se violation of anti-trust laws. Fortnite would seem to have a very strong case, but Apple has just said it is also cutting Fortnite off from developer tools by August 28.    Even big player like Fortnite can\u2019t afford to wage this legal war unless it gets an emergency injunction. But this sort of thuggery usually happens less visibly and with companies too small to do anything other than capitulate. If Fortnite can get the courts to restrain Apple and Google while they duke it out in court, expect this to be a very important case. Let\u2019s hope Fortnite can afford to proceed.   00 Market Power, Inequality, and Financial Instability - 2020057pap    This entry was posted in Banana republic , Economic fundamentals , Free markets and their discontents , Income disparity , Legal , Politics , Regulations and regulators , Technology and innovation , The destruction of the middle class , The dismal science on August 19, 2020 by Yves Smith .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42873729543</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-WB11-F07F-82BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1248\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>naked capitalism</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But how we get there, that\u2019s the hard part.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In two hearings this week, legislators from the Senate and the House of Representatives grilled representatives from industry groups and consumer advocacy organizations about what federal privacy legislation should look like and how comprehensive it should be. The clock is ticking\u2014tech companies and industry groups are eager to see a federal bill passed before the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), a comprehensive data privacy rule that is slated to shake up businesses operating in the state, goes into effect in January 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tuesday\u2019s hearing was the first major one focusing on the tech industry\u2019s practices since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, and legislators from both sides of the aisle signaled the importance of implementing a federal privacy bill that would protect consumers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time that we move past the old model that protects the companies using our data, and not the people,\u201d Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat from New Jersey who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Tuesday.</p><p>Republican lawmakers have voiced support for a federal rule that would preempt state-level legislation on privacy, something that big tech companies and other industry groups have supported. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, said consumers should not have different privacy and security protections depending on where in the country they are.</p><p>Denise Zheng, the vice president for technology and innovation at the industry group Business Roundtable, voiced the industry line that varying state legislation could pose \u201cmassive barriers to investment for innovation\u201d that would be \u201cunworkable\u201d for businesses.</p><p>Democrats, on the other hand, have voiced concern over federal preemption, saying that a federal bill could water down more stringent state-level privacy protections. Rep. Darren Soto, a Florida Democrat, chastised the House\u2019s \u201clack of action in legislating that has created this vacuum in which states have decided to act\u201d on passing privacy laws, he said.</p><p>Some lawmakers have pointed to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation or the CCPA as a model for federal rules, and witnesses representing the tech and advertising industry pleaded against using those regulations as a blueprint. Roslyn Layton, the visiting scholar at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute,\u00a0 implored House members not to follow the path of the European Union, asserting that the legislation put a strain on small- and medium-sized businesses, and both Dave Grimaldi, evp for public policy at the trade association IAB, and Randall Rothenberg, IAB\u2019s CEO, voiced concerns with modeling legislation off GDPR and the CCPA.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee held another session focused on data privacy, asking questions of preemption, more FTC enforcement authority and the scope of federal data privacy rules. Rothenberg testified before the Senate, as did representatives from industry groups for tech and software companies, retailers and telecom companies. The telecom giant AT&amp;T hosted a fundraiser for Sen. Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the committee, the night before the hearing, according to The Hill.</p><p>During the Wednesday hearing, Wicker said a preemptive federal framework need not be weaker than state-level legislation, and he encouraged the drafting of regulations that were not burdensome to companies and which provided room for \u201ccontinued investment and innovation and for the flexibility for U.S. businesses to compete domestically and abroad,\u201d he said. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat who serves as ranking member of the Senate Committee, warned against passing a weaker federal law at the expense of states, and expressed support for an overhaul of the existing privacy norms.</p><p>\u201cJust notice and consent are no longer enough,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that transparency is the only solution.\u201d</p><p>Representatives from industry groups and trade associations on Wednesday echoed many of the same issues raised on Tuesday: The industry is in favor of a federal privacy law that preempts state-level rules, offers incentives for good behavior and does not put in place the same requirements as legislation like GDPR. And they want it to happen\u2014fast.</p><p>\u201cWe support getting this kind of legislation to the president\u2019s desk and signed into law this year,\u201d Michael Beckerman, the president and CEO of the Internet Association, a tech industry group, said Wednesday.</p><p>Consumer groups bemoaned the number of industry representatives at the hearings this week, and organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation said they worried that the sheer number of tech company representatives would drown out other perspectives on the issue. But there were a few voices less affable to industry talking points who voiced their concerns during the hearings. On Tuesday, two consumer advocacy groups implored House members not to squander an opportunity to develop rules that would protect consumers. Brandi Collins-Dexter, the senior campaign director of the social justice group Color of Change, and Nuala O\u2019Connor, the president and CEO of the advocacy group Center for Democracy and Technology, implored lawmakers to consider digital civil rights, stressing that rules around notifying customers and providing more transparency were not enough.</p><p>\u201cThe goal should be to define our digital civil rights,\u201d Connor said. \u201cWhat reasonable behavior can we expect from companies that hold our data? What rights do we have that are so precious they cannot be signed away?\u201d</p><p>Woodrow Hartzog, a law and computer science professor at Northeastern University, told senators Wednesday that current privacy norms \u201casks too much of people and too little of those entrusted with our data.\u201d He urged legislators not to give consumers the \u201cillusion of choice\u201d through terms-of-service agreements, and said federal legislation should \u201cact as a floor, not a ceiling\u201d for state-level rules.</p><p>\u201cWhile consistency is nice, I think the patchwork actually has been not something that has been insurmountable insomuch that I teach my students to deal with 50 state patchworks all the time,\u201d Hartzog said.\u00a0 \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s what we\u2019ve been dealing with all along.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1026712</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHS-7TM1-DYRK-H0HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1063\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 27, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The big picture: The Trump administration, Congress and state attorneys general are all investigating tech companies, including Google and Facebook, for antitrust violations. </p><p>But they're also acknowledging that the laws governing competition may not be enough to rein in powerful online platforms.Driving the news: Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Monday the Department of Justice's review of tech platforms could reach beyond antitrust issues and the department does not view antitrust law as a \" panacea for every problem in the digital world.\" \"We will not ignore any harms caused by online platforms that partially or completely fall outside of the antitrust laws,\" Rosen said in a speech at the American Bar Association's antitrust forum in Washington. \"We are keeping in mind other tools in areas such as privacy, consumer protection, and public safety as part of a broader review of online platforms.\"Meanwhile, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joe Simons said the agency will take a \"fresh look\" at the consumer welfare standard and \"alternatives\" to the standard. Antitrust law considers[1] consumer prices as a key metric in that standard, which makes evaluating \"free\" online services more challenging. Details: Here's who is investigating what... FTC: In addition to the agency's antitrust probe of Facebook, Simons said Monday the agency has multiple investigations into major platforms underway. The agency has reportedly interviewed Amazon's third-party sellers.DOJ: The antitrust division is investigating both Google and Facebook, with antitrust chief Makan Delrahim telling Congress last week the competitive dynamics around personalized advertising is an area of focus.State attorneys general: Multi-state coalitions are also investigating Google[2] and Facebook[3].Congress: The House Judiciary Committee launched a probe of competition in digital markets earlier this year. And both federal antitrust agencies are staffing up to add more resources to their tech probes. Simons said the FTC is hiring two technologists for its technology enforcement division, and said he would double the size of the team if Congress provided more funding.Delrahim said the antitrust division just posted five openings for attorneys to work on its tech investigations.

President Trump wants $5 billion, but Democrats are unwilling to agree to that and any spending bill needs bipartisan support to pass Congress. A federal judge in Texas said on Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law, therefore, cannot stand. The invalidation of the landmark health care law popularly known as Obamacare throws into doubt the future of health coverage for millions of Americans on the Obamacare exchanges and in Medicaid expansion. North Korea is lashing out at the U.S. decision to level sanctions against three of its senior-most government officials. In an editorial over the weekend, Pyongyang warned the sanctions pressure could very well block the path to denuclearization forever. The Israeli army began Operation Northern Shield along the border with Lebanon to uncover and disable tunnels built by Hezbollah, which could be used by fighters to enter Israel secretly and mount attacks against civilians. A CNN camera goes inside one of the tunnels, the first broadcaster anywhere to get permission to do so.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[05:31:42] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEPHEN MILLER, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER FOR POLICY: We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN.

It is 32 minutes past the hour this Monday morning.</p><p>It is now less than five days until a partial government shutdown unless President Trump and Congress could reach a deal on funding for a border wall. The White House demanding $5 billion for the wall which, remember, the president said Mexico would pay for.</p><p>Congressional Democrats rejecting that request.</p><p>White House senior adviser Stephen Miller taking a hard line on \"FACE THE NATION,\" echoing the president's demand.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MILLER: We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration. This is a --</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN, MODERATOR, CBS NEWS, \"FACE THE NATION\": And that means a shutdown?</p><p>MILLER: This is a very -- if it comes to it, absolutely. This is a very fundamental issue. At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country -- whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: But, \"The New York Times\" reports House Republican leaders have a more immediate problem. Members who are retiring or were defeated in November just don't want to show up to vote any longer. Many have been skipping votes since the midterms and GOP leaders are unsure if they'll ever return.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the president just doesn't have the support to get billions for his wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: President Trump should understand there are not the votes for the wall in the House or the Senate. He is not going to get the wall in any form.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: If a partial shutdown happens at the end of the week, the consequences could ripple across the U.S. economy.</p><p>But, of course, nothing concentrates minds in Washington like a holiday. The president scheduled to leave this week for his Christmas vacation in Florida.</p><p>BRIGGS: Not just any vacation, a 16-day vacation at Mar-a-Lago, so the optics could be interesting.</p><p>Joining us this morning, Princeton University historian and professor, Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst. Good to see you, sir. JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, AUTHOR, \"THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW\": Good morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: Now, the House isn't even back until Wednesday afternoon, so that gives them less than three days. Are we likely to have a shutdown? And what about those optics of the president kicking back and playing golf for 16 days with a partial government shutdown?</p><p>ZELIZER: They're terrible. I think the only people who like the shutdown is President Trump and his base, which still supports him fighting --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>ZELIZER: -- for the wall.</p><p>The problem is there's a disconnect between that and many Republicans, at this point, who don't want this to happen, who aren't even voting, and who are thinking exactly of that -- images of the president vacationing while the government is shut down. And I think a lot of Republicans really don't want this to go through now.</p><p>[05:35:04] ROMANS: Although, there are Trump supporters in the Midwest, who I know, who say why do we need the government? We should shut down the government. Perfect to shut it down.</p><p>I mean, they --</p><p>ZELIZER: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- really think that the president is on a moral high ground in some cases here, and I think some of the polling we saw this weekend from the \"Des Moines Register\" shows that.</p><p>But here's what the president -- a year ago this week, he was signing his signature -- legislative achievement into law -- the tax cuts, right? This is something that he really was proud of.</p><p>And now, fast-forward a year. The stock market is lower than it was at that time and Trump is under investigation on all fronts -- the Trump Organization, his foundation, the campaign, the transition, the inauguration, the administration.</p><p>How boxed in is he here?</p><p>ZELIZER: He's very boxed in. He doesn't necessarily mind being boxed in. I think this is a president who, in some ways, likes being in an adversarial position. He can pit himself as fighting -- but it's not good.</p><p>Going in, Democrats control the House. You have multiple fronts of investigations at this point and tremendous instability within the White House. So I think the people working around him are worried.</p><p>And again, it's a question between Trump and his base and the rest of the Republican Party at this time, and everyone is worried about where these investigations lead.</p><p>BRIGGS: Instability may also be the word that sums up health care in this country --</p><p>ZELIZER: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- after this ruling by a federal judge in Texas, ruling the entire thing unconstitutional. And the president celebrated this on Twitter as great news for America.</p><p>Susan Collins, Republican senator, not so fast -- listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: There's no reason why the individual mandate provision can't be struck down and keep all of the good provisions of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Another Republican senator, Roy Blunt, told \"MEET THE PRESS\" it has no immediate impact.</p><p>Are Republicans concerned at this ruling? The president may be celebrating it -- are Republicans fearing it?</p><p>ZELIZER: Republicans wanted this issue to go away at this point. When they pushed for repeal and replace, they lost -- and they lost really badly.</p><p>And then in the midterms, this was a big issue for Democrats running on it. So the last thing they want now is this case and the potential for the whole program, all of the sudden to shut down -- which would be a crisis of health care for millions of Americans.</p><p>So I don't think a lot of Republicans are celebrating right now but it's not necessarily in their control anymore -- it's in the courts.</p><p>BRIGGS: You could argue preexisting conditions was the central issue --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- that Democrats ran on. It gave them 40 additional seats.</p><p>ROMANS: Let's talk about the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani --</p><p>ZELIZER: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- this weekend. I mean, he's trying to reframe what -- the legal jeopardy of this president in more political terms. Let's listen to how he explains these payments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: It's not a crime. It's not a crime, George. Paying $130,000 to Stormy whatever and paying $130,000 to the other one is not a crime.</p><p>The Edwards case determines that. She was paid a $1.1 million to be a no-show in his campaign.</p><p>If there's another purpose, it's no longer a campaign contribution -- if there's a personal purpose.</p><p>Now, think about this. Supposed he tried to use his campaign funds to pay off Stormy Daniels. It would be totally illegal.</p><p>If it's not a campaign expense it can't be a campaign contribution. These are not campaign contributions.</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST, ABC \"THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS\": But the corporate campaign --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: We're also learning more about how long into the campaign the president was -- or into the -- when the president was involved in the Trump Tower Moscow issue.</p><p>What do you make of that and Rudy Giuliani's performance yesterday?</p><p>ZELIZER: It's a total mess. I mean, it's interesting. Usually, in a scandal like this administrations are disciplined, they are focused. Everyone's on the same page as they fight back against the accusations.</p><p>This is the opposite of that. Giuliani is saying a million things -- he's saying them at the same time. And I think what you see is no one really has the same story, everyone isn't on the same page.</p><p>And, Giuliani, himself, is throwing everything out there trying to protect the president, even basically changing what the law is on television in describing what happened. And I think it reflects the chaos and the tone that the president has set in the Oval Office, and that's what the advisers are reflecting.</p><p>ROMANS: Does Mick Mulvaney, the new chief of staff -- acting chief of staff -- does he fix it?</p><p>ZELIZER: Absolutely not. That's an easy prediction. He will be like John Kelly, like Priebus -- the chiefs of staff that came before him. It's the same structure that he is going into and it's even worse because now, he is facing House Democrats coming at the administration.</p><p>We'll see if Mulvaney even keeps the job for a few months, at best.</p><p>BRIGGS: If he wants the job --</p><p>ZELIZER: If he wants the job. BRIGGS: -- should be the question ahead. It will be an interesting couple of days.</p><p>Julian, good to see you, sir.</p><p>ZELIZER: Yes, thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: Thanks, Julian.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right, also in the Russia probe, a damning new report due this week claiming Silicon Valley may have done the bare minimum to help the Senate's Russia investigation.</p><p>The Intelligence Committee commissioned a report from an online intel firm. The report claims social media companies could have done a better job providing data about Russian accounts that posed as Americans.</p><p>[05:40:05] ROMANS: And, \"The Washington Post\" has obtained a separate report prepared for the Intel Committee. It finds the Russians used every major social media platform to influence voters -- millions of voters -- to elect President Trump and worked even harder to support him once he was in office.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. Coming up, new U.S. sanctions on North Korea could block the path to denuclearization forever. Strong new words overnight from Pyongyang. We'll have a live report, next.</p><p>BRIGGS: North Korea lashing out over the U.S. decision to level sanctions against three of its senior-most government officials. In an editorial over the weekend, Pyongyang warned the sanctions pressure could very well block the path to denuclearization forever.</p><p>Will Ripley has reported many times for us from Pyongyang, live in Hong Kong with the latest.</p><p>[05:45:02] Will, these sanctions -- were they more symbolic?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. It was -- you know, to add three more names to an already long list of North Koreans who are under sanctions doesn't have, necessarily, a tangible impact.</p><p>But to publicly shame, essentially, three officials who I've seen standing on stage next to Kim Jong Un at events in Pyongyang -- the head of the state security, organization guidance, propaganda and agitation -- it certainly is enough to irritate the North Koreans.</p><p>And you're seeing, in their messaging through state media, increasingly strong warnings not necessarily about these individual sanctions but the overall issue of sanctions pressure over North Korea's nuclear program.</p><p>And this really sensitive issue for them of human rights, which they say is nonexistent despite reports from the U.N. of thousands of people in labor camps and essentially, people being imprisoned or severely punished for simply speaking their mind if their views somehow don't match identically with what the government thinks they should be.</p><p>And, North Koreans have said that if the sanctions pressure continues from the United States that this is their red line. This could bring a return, potentially, to what we saw just a year ago -- North Korea launching missiles and conducting nuclear tests.</p><p>I don't think they want to do that. I don't think they want to see that happen. But at the same time, they are trying to tell the United States that if there isn't some movement, that's exactly what could happen.</p><p>But very interestingly, they continue to praise President Trump, Dave. Over and over again, they say that the sanctions are going against the will of the White House. They're clearly trying to play to President Trump's ego ahead of potentially that second summit, which could happen early next year, January or February.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, still has not ruled it out.</p><p>Will Ripley live for us in Hong Kong, thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, now to a CNN exclusive -- a firsthand look at Israel's Operation Northern Shield along the border of Lebanon. Israel is trying to uncover and disable tunnels built by Hezbollah. There are fears the underground passageways could be used to mount attacks against civilians, as they were from Gaza.</p><p>CNN is the first broadcaster anywhere to go inside and our Ian Lee is live in Jerusalem with this extraordinary access. What did our team see?</p><p>IAN LEE, CNN FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Christine.</p><p>The Israeli military took us right up next to the border and that's where we found this hole that they drilled down to the tunnel going down, dozens of yards past solid limestone that opens up into this tunnel. And, Israel says they wanted to be so close to the border so they could show how it originated inside of Lebanon and crossed into Israel. They are going to neutralize these tunnels as they find them.</p><p>But it wasn't what they saw that tipped them off to this tunnel but, rather, what they heard, and that's the vibration of digging through solid rock that tipped them off. They also have other sophisticated technology to locate tunnels along this roughly 75-mile border.</p><p>What Israel wants, though, is action within the U.N. Security Council. They say it violates U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.</p><p>The U.N. says they're aware of the tunnels, they're investigating, and they'll present their results to the Security Council. Also, Christine, we've reached out to Hezbollah previously. They have not commented on it and they have neither confirmed nor denied that they are behind the tunnels, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Ian Lee with some amazing access there -- Operation Northern Shield. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>Let's get a check on \"CNN Business\" this morning.</p><p>Global stock markets are mixed right now. You can see Tokyo and Shanghai were higher, but Hong Kong closed lower. Friday's economic data release missed expectations in China and that is still reverberating.</p><p>European markets slightly lower in early trade there.</p><p>On Wall Street, futures are higher after Friday's losses. Did you see what happened Friday? The Dow closed 497 points lower. The Dow is down almost three percent since the president's historic tax cuts, exactly a year ago.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500, Friday, declined almost two percent. Now it's at the lowest level since April this year.</p><p>The Nasdaq fell 2.3 percent. The Nasdaq really the only one that's higher on the year, and barely. The Dow and the S&amp;P are lower on the year.</p><p>Now, usually at the end of the year investors look forward to something called the Santa Claus Rally. Well, you've only got a few more trading days for that to happen and it doesn't look so hopeful, at least not yet.</p><p>All right, all eyes will be on Johnson &amp; Johnson today after a Reuters investigation found it knew about asbestos in baby power for decades. And today, the company -- that's what the stock did on Friday. Today, the company has a full-page ad in the paper saying, \"Science, not sensationalism\" -- saying that its baby powder is safe.</p><p>That stock, though, really got hit -- the worst day since 2002 on Friday, on this Reuters report.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson has been dealing with lawsuits alleging some of its talcum powder products cause cancer. But, the Reuters report cites documents that indicate company executives, scientists, mining experts, and others knew about the problem and failed to disclose it to regulators or the public.</p><p>In a statement, Johnson &amp; Johnson said this. \"The Reuters article is one-sided, false and inflammatory. Johnson &amp; Johnson's baby powder is safe and asbestos-free.\"</p><p>[05:50:07] I would encourage people to read the Reuters report, however. The Reuters reports is going back all the way to company --</p><p>BRIGGS: The early 70s. ROMANS: -- documents -- even as far back as the 50s, too.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: So this is about decades in the past.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes. It doesn't look like sensationalism. It looks live very detailed journalism.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BRIGGS: A new report shows vaping among America's teens soaring this year. For high school seniors, the number is up some 50 percent in the last 30 days alone. That's compared to the same time period last year.</p><p>[05:55:00] The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research found vaping was the second-most common substance in 2018. Officials say vigilance is needed because vaping could lead teens to other drugs. Use of other substances like alcohol and opioids has declined in recent years.</p><p>ROMANS: A congressional delegation heads to Lordsburg, New Mexico tomorrow. The group is getting a firsthand look at the Customs and Border Patrol facility where a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl was taken before she got sick and died this month.</p><p>The father of Jakelin Caal says he has no complaints about the treatment of his daughter by CBP. The father, though, is disputing a Homeland Security official's claim that his daughter had gone days without food and water. He says she was properly fed on their journey.</p><p>BRIGGS: California has dropped plans to tax text messages. The state hoped to add new monthly fees to increase funds for programs that bring connectivity to underserved residents, but the California Public Utilities Commission says a recent FCC ruling prevents the state from imposing that tax. The ruling determined text messages are an information service, not a telecommunications service.</p><p>The proposed tax faced strong opposition from industry trade groups which called it harmful to consumers.</p><p>ROMANS: A driver escapes unscathed after crashing his car into a home in Alabama -- oh, my goodness. Montgomery Fire and Rescue responded to this unbelievable wreck Sunday where a car ended up nearly vertical. Amazingly, neither the homeowners nor the driver were injured.</p><p>BRIGGS: Wow.</p><p>Co-founder and CEO of the hit gaming app HQ Trivia, Colin Kroll, found dead in his New York apartment Sunday morning. Police discovered Kroll in his bedroom after his girlfriend called police asking for a wellness check. Multiple reports say he overdosed.</p><p>Kroll became a big name in the tech world after co-founding Vine, the looping app that launched the careers of numerous social media stars. Twitter bought Vine in 2012.</p><p>Kroll was only 34 years old.</p><p>ROMANS: Expressions of love and support pouring in for \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\" cast member Pete Davidson. New York City police conducted a wellness check on the comedian after he posted an alarming note on Instagram Saturday that said: \"I really don't want to be on this earth anymore.\" Now, that Instagram account was later deleted.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETE DAVIDSON, CAST MEMBER, NBC \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\": Once again, Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: A lot of relief for fans when Davidson made that brief appearance late on \"SNL\" this weekend.</p><p>It's been a rough year for the 25-year-old. He went through that painful breakup with Ariana Grande in October, and had to apologize last month for mocking the appearance of Texas congressional candidate Dan Crenshaw, who lost his eye serving in Afghanistan.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Imagine, if you will, a world where Donald Trump is not president. \"SNL\" tried with a takeoff on the classic \"It's A Wonderful Life.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEC BALDWIN, ACTOR, PORTRAYING DONALD TRUMP, NBC, \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\": Wow, everyone looks so different. What are those things on their faces?</p><p>KENAN THOMPSON, CAST MEMBER, NBC \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\": Those are called smiles.</p><p>BALDWIN: Brett Kavanaugh, how's the Supreme Court.</p><p>MATT DAMON, ACTOR, PORTRAYING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, NBC, \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\": Me, on the Supreme Court, with my temperament? Are you insane? No, no, they went with that nerd, Merrick Garland.</p><p>But on the plus side, when I tell people I like beer, they find it charming and not like I'm threatening violence.</p><p>BALDWIN: I've had an epiphany. I guess the world does need me to be president after all.</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes, that was not the lesson at all.</p><p>BALDWIN: I want to be president again. I want to be president again.</p><p>KATE MCKINNON, CAST MEMBER PORTRAYING KELLYANNE CONWAY, NBC \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\": Listen, Donald. Every time a bell rings, someone you know quits or goes to jail.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: That's Kellyanne Conway.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>The next morning, the president lumped \"SNL\" in with news shows and criticized what he called it's one-sided coverage, suggesting without any basis that it was defamation -- even going so far as to call it collusion there in the end.</p><p>TEXT: \"A real scandal is the one-sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC and Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live. It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts, can't be legal? Only defame and belittle! Collusion?\"</p><p>BRIGGS: Interesting tweet.</p><p>ROMANS: He once appeared on \"SNL,\" I think. I think he used to be a fan. Now, he's not -- all right.</p><p>Thanks for joining us this Monday morning. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs. Here's \"NEW DAY.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIULIANI: Paying $130,000 to Stormy whatever and paying the other one is not a crime.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The president has continued to weed these stories. He does not tell the truth.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The public needs to know exactly what happened.</p><p>SCHUMER: President Trump is not going to get the wall in any form.</p><p>MILLER: We're going to do whatever is necessary to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration.</p><p>COLLINS: We have to prevent a government shutdown.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is NEW DAY with Alisyn Camerota and John Berman.</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. This is NEW DAY. It's Monday, December 17th, 6:00 here in New York.</p><p>You ready for this?</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: I'm ready. I'm ready for a little ditty --</p><p>BERMAN: All right.</p><p>CAMEROTA: -- that you are about to share.</p><p>BERMAN: Here we go. 'Twas the week before Christmas and all through the house, everything was under investigation, including the mouse.</p><p>CAMEROTA: What?</p><p>BERMAN: So, mouse was all I could rhyme with house.

A Texas judge scraps the entire law, but would this ruling stand on appeal?</p><p>BRIGGS:  And a big spike in the number of teens vaping nationwide, even as alcohol and other drug use decline.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START on a Monday, everybody.  I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS:  I was glad to see the opioid use declined but, boy, that vaping spike is really interesting.</p><p>BRIGGS:  Yes, a huge spike in the last 30 days, in particular.</p><p>ROMANS:  I'm Christine Romans.  It is 32 minutes past the hour this Monday morning.</p><p>It is now less than five days until a partial government shutdown unless President Trump and Congress could reach a deal on funding for a border wall.  The White House demanding $5 billion for the wall which, remember, the president said Mexico would pay for.</p><p>Congressional Democrats rejecting that request.</p><p>White House senior adviser Stephen Miller taking a hard line on \"FACE THE NATION,\" echoing the president's demand.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MILLER:  We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration.  This is a --</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN, MODERATOR, CBS NEWS, \"FACE THE NATION\":  And that means a shutdown?</p><p>MILLER:  This is a very -- if it comes to it, absolutely.  This is a very fundamental issue.  At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country -- whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS:  But, \"The New York Times\" reports House Republican leaders have a more immediate problem.  Members who are retiring or were defeated in November just don't want to show up to vote any longer. Many have been skipping votes since the midterms and GOP leaders are unsure if they'll ever return.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the president just doesn't have the support to get billions for his wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER:  President Trump should understand there are not the votes for the wall in the House or the Senate.  He is not going to get the wall in any form.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  If a partial shutdown happens at the end of the week, the consequences could ripple across the U.S. economy.  </p><p>But, of course, nothing concentrates minds in Washington like a holiday.  The president scheduled to leave this week for his Christmas vacation in Florida.</p><p>BRIGGS:  Not just any vacation, a 16-day vacation at Mar-a-Lago, so the optics could be interesting.</p><p>Joining us this morning, Princeton University historian and professor, Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst.  Good to see you, sir. JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, AUTHOR, \"THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW\":  Good morning.</p><p>BRIGGS:  Now, the House isn't even back until Wednesday afternoon, so that gives them less than three days.  Are we likely to have a shutdown?  And what about those optics of the president kicking back and playing golf for 16 days with a partial government shutdown?</p><p>ZELIZER:  They're terrible.  I think the only people who like the shutdown is President Trump and his base, which still supports him fighting --</p><p>ROMANS:  Yes.</p><p>ZELIZER:  -- for the wall.  </p><p>The problem is there's a disconnect between that and many Republicans, at this point, who don't want this to happen, who aren't even voting, and who are thinking exactly of that -- images of the president vacationing while the government is shut down.  And I think a lot of Republicans really don't want this to go through now.</p><p>[05:35:04]  ROMANS:  Although, there are Trump supporters in the Midwest, who I know, who say why do we need the government?  We should shut down the government.  Perfect to shut it down.</p><p>I mean, they --</p><p>ZELIZER:  Yes.</p><p>ROMANS:  -- really think that the president is on a moral high ground in some cases here, and I think some of the polling we saw this weekend from the \"Des Moines Register\" shows that.</p><p>But here's what the president -- a year ago this week, he was signing his signature -- legislative achievement into law -- the tax cuts, right?  This is something that he really was proud of.</p><p>And now, fast-forward a year.  The stock market is lower than it was at that time and Trump is under investigation on all fronts -- the Trump Organization, his foundation, the campaign, the transition, the inauguration, the administration.</p><p>How boxed in is he here?</p><p>ZELIZER:  He's very boxed in.  He doesn't necessarily mind being boxed in.  I think this is a president who, in some ways, likes being in an adversarial position.  He can pit himself as fighting -- but it's not good.  </p><p>Going in, Democrats control the House.  You have multiple fronts of investigations at this point and tremendous instability within the White House.  So I think the people working around him are worried.</p><p>And again, it's a question between Trump and his base and the rest of the Republican Party at this time, and everyone is worried about where these investigations lead.</p><p>BRIGGS:  Instability may also be the word that sums up health care in this country --</p><p>ZELIZER:  Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS:  -- after this ruling by a federal judge in Texas, ruling the entire thing unconstitutional.  And the president celebrated this on Twitter as great news for America.</p><p>Susan Collins, Republican senator, not so fast -- listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE:  There's no reason why the individual mandate provision can't be struck down and keep all of the good provisions of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS:  Another Republican senator, Roy Blunt, told \"MEET THE PRESS\" it has no immediate impact.</p><p>Are Republicans concerned at this ruling?  The president may be celebrating it -- are Republicans fearing it?</p><p>ZELIZER:  Republicans wanted this issue to go away at this point. When they pushed for repeal and replace, they lost -- and they lost really badly.  </p><p>And then in the midterms, this was a big issue for Democrats running on it.  So the last thing they want now is this case and the potential for the whole program, all of the sudden to shut down -- which would be a crisis of health care for millions of Americans.  </p><p>So I don't think a lot of Republicans are celebrating right now but it's not necessarily in their control anymore -- it's in the courts.</p><p>BRIGGS:  You could argue preexisting conditions was the central issue --</p><p>ROMANS:  Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS:  -- that Democrats ran on.  It gave them 40 additional seats.</p><p>ROMANS:  Let's talk about the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani --</p><p>ZELIZER:  Yes.</p><p>ROMANS:  -- this weekend.  I mean, he's trying to reframe what -- the legal jeopardy of this president in more political terms.  Let's listen to how he explains these payments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI:  It's not a crime.  It's not a crime, George.  Paying $130,000 to Stormy whatever and paying $130,000 to the other one is not a crime.  </p><p>The Edwards case determines that.  She was paid a $1.1 million to be a no-show in his campaign.</p><p>If there's another purpose, it's no longer a campaign contribution -- if there's a personal purpose.</p><p>Now, think about this.  Supposed he tried to use his campaign funds to pay off Stormy Daniels.  It would be totally illegal.  </p><p>If it's not a campaign expense it can't be a campaign contribution. These are not campaign contributions.</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST, ABC \"THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS\":  But the corporate campaign --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  We're also learning more about how long into the campaign the president was -- or into the -- when the president was involved in the Trump Tower Moscow issue.</p><p>What do you make of that and Rudy Giuliani's performance yesterday?</p><p>ZELIZER:  It's a total mess.  I mean, it's interesting.  Usually, in a scandal like this administrations are disciplined, they are focused. Everyone's on the same page as they fight back against the accusations.</p><p>This is the opposite of that.  Giuliani is saying a million things -- he's saying them at the same time.  And I think what you see is no one really has the same story, everyone isn't on the same page.  </p><p>And, Giuliani, himself, is throwing everything out there trying to protect the president, even basically changing what the law is on television in describing what happened.  And I think it reflects the chaos and the tone that the president has set in the Oval Office, and that's what the advisers are reflecting.</p><p>ROMANS:  Does Mick Mulvaney, the new chief of staff -- acting chief of staff -- does he fix it?</p><p>ZELIZER:  Absolutely not.  That's an easy prediction.  He will be like John Kelly, like Priebus -- the chiefs of staff that came before him. It's the same structure that he is going into and it's even worse because now, he is facing House Democrats coming at the administration.</p><p>We'll see if Mulvaney even keeps the job for a few months, at best.</p><p>BRIGGS:  If he wants the job --</p><p>ZELIZER:  If he wants the job. BRIGGS:  -- should be the question ahead.  It will be an interesting couple of days.</p><p>Julian, good to see you, sir.</p><p>ZELIZER:  Yes, thank you.</p><p>ROMANS:  Thanks, Julian.</p><p>BRIGGS:  All right, also in the Russia probe, a damning new report due this week claiming Silicon Valley may have done the bare minimum to help the Senate's Russia investigation.  </p><p>The Intelligence Committee commissioned a report from an online intel firm.  The report claims social media companies could have done a better job providing data about Russian accounts that posed as Americans.</p><p>[05:40:05]  ROMANS:  And, \"The Washington Post\" has obtained a separate report prepared for the Intel Committee.  It finds the Russians used every major social media platform to influence voters -- millions of voters -- to elect President Trump and worked even harder to support him once he was in office.</p><p>BRIGGS:  All right.  Coming up, new U.S. sanctions on North Korea could block the path to denuclearization forever.  Strong new words overnight from Pyongyang.  We'll have a live report, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRIGGS:  North Korea lashing out over the U.S. decision to level sanctions against three of its senior-most government officials.  In an editorial over the weekend, Pyongyang warned the sanctions pressure could very well block the path to denuclearization forever.</p><p>Will Ripley has reported many times for us from Pyongyang, live in Hong Kong with the latest.</p><p>[05:45:02]  Will, these sanctions -- were they more symbolic?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely.  It was -- you know, to add three more names to an already long list of North Koreans who are under sanctions doesn't have, necessarily, a tangible impact.  </p><p>But to publicly shame, essentially, three officials who I've seen standing on stage next to Kim Jong Un at events in Pyongyang -- the head of the state security, organization guidance, propaganda and agitation -- it certainly is enough to irritate the North Koreans.  </p><p>And you're seeing, in their messaging through state media, increasingly strong warnings not necessarily about these individual sanctions but the overall issue of sanctions pressure over North Korea's nuclear program.</p><p>And this really sensitive issue for them of human rights, which they say is nonexistent despite reports from the U.N. of thousands of people in labor camps and essentially, people being imprisoned or severely punished for simply speaking their mind if their views somehow don't match identically with what the government thinks they should be.</p><p>And, North Koreans have said that if the sanctions pressure continues from the United States that this is their red line.  This could bring a return, potentially, to what we saw just a year ago -- North Korea launching missiles and conducting nuclear tests.  </p><p>I don't think they want to do that.  I don't think they want to see that happen.  But at the same time, they are trying to tell the United States that if there isn't some movement, that's exactly what could happen.</p><p>But very interestingly, they continue to praise President Trump, Dave. Over and over again, they say that the sanctions are going against the will of the White House.  They're clearly trying to play to President Trump's ego ahead of potentially that second summit, which could happen early next year, January or February.</p><p>BRIGGS:  Yes, still has not ruled it out.</p><p>Will Ripley live for us in Hong Kong, thank you.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right, now to a CNN exclusive -- a firsthand look at Israel's Operation Northern Shield along the border of Lebanon. Israel is trying to uncover and disable tunnels built by Hezbollah. There are fears the underground passageways could be used to mount attacks against civilians, as they were from Gaza.</p><p>CNN is the first broadcaster anywhere to go inside and our Ian Lee is live in Jerusalem with this extraordinary access.  What did our team see?</p><p>IAN LEE, CNN FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Christine.</p><p>The Israeli military took us right up next to the border and that's where we found this hole that they drilled down to the tunnel going down, dozens of yards past solid limestone that opens up into this tunnel.  And, Israel says they wanted to be so close to the border so they could show how it originated inside of Lebanon and crossed into Israel.  They are going to neutralize these tunnels as they find them. </p><p>But it wasn't what they saw that tipped them off to this tunnel but, rather, what they heard, and that's the vibration of digging through solid rock that tipped them off.  They also have other sophisticated technology to locate tunnels along this roughly 75-mile border.</p><p>What Israel wants, though, is action within the U.N. Security Council. They say it violates U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.  </p><p>The U.N. says they're aware of the tunnels, they're investigating, and they'll present their results to the Security Council. Also, Christine, we've reached out to Hezbollah previously.  They have not commented on it and they have neither confirmed nor denied that they are behind the tunnels, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right.  Ian Lee with some amazing access there -- Operation Northern Shield.  Thank you so much for that.</p><p>Let's get a check on \"CNN Business\" this morning.</p><p>Global stock markets are mixed right now.  You can see Tokyo and Shanghai were higher, but Hong Kong closed lower.  Friday's economic data release missed expectations in China and that is still reverberating.</p><p>European markets slightly lower in early trade there.</p><p>On Wall Street, futures are higher after Friday's losses.  Did you see what happened Friday?  The Dow closed 497 points lower.  The Dow is down almost three percent since the president's historic tax cuts, exactly a year ago.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500, Friday, declined almost two percent.  Now it's at the lowest level since April this year.  </p><p>The Nasdaq fell 2.3 percent.  The Nasdaq really the only one that's higher on the year, and barely.  The Dow and the S&amp;P are lower on the year.</p><p>Now, usually at the end of the year investors look forward to something called the Santa Claus Rally.  Well, you've only got a few more trading days for that to happen and it doesn't look so hopeful, at least not yet.</p><p>All right, all eyes will be on Johnson &amp; Johnson today after a Reuters investigation found it knew about asbestos in baby power for decades. And today, the company -- that's what the stock did on Friday.  Today, the company has a full-page ad in the paper saying, \"Science, not sensationalism\" -- saying that its baby powder is safe.</p><p>That stock, though, really got hit -- the worst day since 2002 on Friday, on this Reuters report.  </p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson has been dealing with lawsuits alleging some of its talcum powder products cause cancer.  But, the Reuters report cites documents that indicate company executives, scientists, mining experts, and others knew about the problem and failed to disclose it to regulators or the public.</p><p>In a statement, Johnson &amp; Johnson said this.  \"The Reuters article is one-sided, false and inflammatory.  Johnson &amp; Johnson's baby powder is safe and asbestos-free.\"</p><p>[05:50:07]  I would encourage people to read the Reuters report, however.  The Reuters reports is going back all the way to company --</p><p>BRIGGS:  The early 70s.

It looks live very detailed journalism.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRIGGS:  A new report shows vaping among America's teens soaring this year.  For high school seniors, the number is up some 50 percent in the last 30 days alone.  That's compared to the same time period last year.</p><p>[05:55:00]  The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research found vaping was the second-most common substance in 2018.  Officials say vigilance is needed because vaping could lead teens to other drugs.

The state hoped to add new monthly fees to increase funds for programs that bring connectivity to underserved residents, but the California Public Utilities Commission says a recent FCC ruling prevents the state from imposing that tax.  The ruling determined text messages are an information service, not a telecommunications service.</p><p>The proposed tax faced strong opposition from industry trade groups which called it harmful to consumers.</p><p>ROMANS:  A driver escapes unscathed after crashing his car into a home in Alabama -- oh, my goodness.

President Trump wants $5 billion, but Democrats are unwilling to agree to that and any spending bill needs bipartisan support to pass Congress.  A federal judge in Texas said on Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law, therefore, cannot stand.  The invalidation of the landmark health care law popularly known as Obamacare throws into doubt the future of health coverage for millions of Americans on the Obamacare exchanges and in Medicaid expansion.  North Korea is lashing out at the U.S. decision to level sanctions against three of its senior-most government officials.  In an editorial over the weekend, Pyongyang warned the sanctions pressure could very well block the path to denuclearization forever.  The Israeli army began Operation Northern Shield along the border with Lebanon to uncover and disable tunnels built by Hezbollah, which could be used by fighters to enter Israel secretly and mount attacks against civilians.  A CNN camera goes inside one of the tunnels, the first broadcaster anywhere to get permission to do so.] [Spec: Politics; Donald Trump; Government Shutdown; Congress; Border Wall; Funding; White House; Mexico; Democrats; Stephen Miller; Illegal Immigration; House of Representatives; Republicans; Votes; Chuck Schumer; Economy; Christmas Vacation; Mar-a-Lago; Florida; Obamacare; Texas; Supreme Court; Individual Mandate; Tax; Affordable Care Act; Susan Collins; Roy Blunt; Rudy Giuliani; Hush Money Payments; Stormy Daniels; Karen McDougal; Trump Tower Moscow; Mike Mulvaney; Acting Chief of Staff; Silicon Valley; Russia; Investigation; Senate Intelligence Committee; Social Media; Data; North Korea; United States; Sanctions; Pyongyang; Denuclearization; Human Rights; Israel; Operation Northern Shield; Lebanon; Tunnels; Hezbollah; Attacks; Civilians; U.N.

Well, Michael Cohen may disagree.  Rudy Giuliani at odds with prosecutors.</p><p> Now, word big tech may not be doing enough to help the Russia probe.</p><p> ROMANS:  Health care, once again, in limbo for tens of millions of Obamacare users.  A Texas judge scraps the entire law, but would this ruling stand on appeal?</p><p> BRIGGS:  And a big spike in the number of teens vaping nationwide, even as alcohol and other drug use decline.</p><p> Welcome back to EARLY START on a Monday, everybody.  I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p> ROMANS:  I was glad to see the opioid use declined but, boy, that vaping spike is really interesting.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes, a huge spike in the last 30 days, in particular.</p><p> ROMANS:  I'm Christine Romans.  It is 32 minutes past the hour this Monday morning.</p><p> It is now less than five days until a partial government shutdown unless President Trump and Congress could reach a deal on funding for a border wall.  The White House demanding $5 billion for the wall which, remember, the president said Mexico would pay for.</p><p> Congressional Democrats rejecting that request.</p><p> White House senior adviser Stephen Miller taking a hard line on \"FACE THE NATION,\" echoing the president's demand.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MILLER:  We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration.  This is a --</p><p> MARGARET BRENNAN, MODERATOR, CBS NEWS, \"FACE THE NATION\":  And that means a shutdown?</p><p> MILLER:  This is a very -- if it comes to it, absolutely.  This is a very fundamental issue.  At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country -- whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  But, \"The New York Times\" reports House Republican leaders have a more immediate problem.  Members who are retiring or were defeated in November just don't want to show up to vote any longer. Many have been skipping votes since the midterms and GOP leaders are unsure if they'll ever return.</p><p> Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says the president just doesn't have the support to get billions for his wall.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SCHUMER:  President Trump should understand there are not the votes for the wall in the House or the Senate.  He is not going to get the wall in any form.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROMANS:  If a partial shutdown happens at the end of the week, the consequences could ripple across the U.S. economy.  </p><p> But, of course, nothing concentrates minds in Washington like a holiday.  The president scheduled to leave this week for his Christmas vacation in Florida.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Not just any vacation, a 16-day vacation at Mar-a-Lago, so the optics could be interesting.</p><p> Joining us this morning, Princeton University historian and professor, Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst.  Good to see you, sir. JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, AUTHOR, \"THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW\":  Good morning.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Now, the House isn't even back until Wednesday afternoon, so that gives them less than three days.  Are we likely to have a shutdown?  And what about those optics of the president kicking back and playing golf for 16 days with a partial government shutdown?</p><p> ZELIZER:  They're terrible.  I think the only people who like the shutdown is President Trump and his base, which still supports him fighting --</p><p> ROMANS:  Yes.</p><p> ZELIZER:  -- for the wall.  </p><p> The problem is there's a disconnect between that and many Republicans, at this point, who don't want this to happen, who aren't even voting, and who are thinking exactly of that -- images of the president vacationing while the government is shut down.  And I think a lot of Republicans really don't want this to go through now.</p><p> [05:35:04]  ROMANS:  Although, there are Trump supporters in the Midwest, who I know, who say why do we need the government?  We should shut down the government.  Perfect to shut it down.</p><p> I mean, they --</p><p> ZELIZER:  Yes.</p><p> ROMANS:  -- really think that the president is on a moral high ground in some cases here, and I think some of the polling we saw this weekend from the \"Des Moines Register\" shows that.</p><p> But here's what the president -- a year ago this week, he was signing his signature -- legislative achievement into law -- the tax cuts, right?  This is something that he really was proud of.</p><p> And now, fast-forward a year.  The stock market is lower than it was at that time and Trump is under investigation on all fronts -- the Trump Organization, his foundation, the campaign, the transition, the inauguration, the administration.</p><p> How boxed in is he here?</p><p> ZELIZER:  He's very boxed in.  He doesn't necessarily mind being boxed in.  I think this is a president who, in some ways, likes being in an adversarial position.  He can pit himself as fighting -- but it's not good.  </p><p> Going in, Democrats control the House.  You have multiple fronts of investigations at this point and tremendous instability within the White House.  So I think the people working around him are worried.</p><p> And again, it's a question between Trump and his base and the rest of the Republican Party at this time, and everyone is worried about where these investigations lead.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Instability may also be the word that sums up health care in this country --</p><p> ZELIZER:  Yes.</p><p> BRIGGS:  -- after this ruling by a federal judge in Texas, ruling the entire thing unconstitutional.  And the president celebrated this on Twitter as great news for America.</p><p> Susan Collins, Republican senator, not so fast -- listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE:  There's no reason why the individual mandate provision can't be struck down and keep all of the good provisions of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  Another Republican senator, Roy Blunt, told \"MEET THE PRESS\" it has no immediate impact.</p><p> Are Republicans concerned at this ruling?  The president may be celebrating it -- are Republicans fearing it?</p><p> ZELIZER:  Republicans wanted this issue to go away at this point. When they pushed for repeal and replace, they lost -- and they lost really badly.  </p><p> And then in the midterms, this was a big issue for Democrats running on it.  So the last thing they want now is this case and the potential for the whole program, all of the sudden to shut down -- which would be a crisis of health care for millions of Americans.  </p><p> So I don't think a lot of Republicans are celebrating right now but it's not necessarily in their control anymore -- it's in the courts.</p><p> BRIGGS:  You could argue preexisting conditions was the central issue --</p><p> ROMANS:  Yes.</p><p> BRIGGS:  -- that Democrats ran on.  It gave them 40 additional seats.</p><p> ROMANS:  Let's talk about the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani --</p><p> ZELIZER:  Yes.</p><p> ROMANS:  -- this weekend.  I mean, he's trying to reframe what -- the legal jeopardy of this president in more political terms.  Let's listen to how he explains these payments.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI:  It's not a crime.  It's not a crime, George.  Paying $130,000 to Stormy whatever and paying $130,000 to the other one is not a crime.  </p><p> The Edwards case determines that.  She was paid a $1.1 million to be a no-show in his campaign.</p><p> If there's another purpose, it's no longer a campaign contribution -- if there's a personal purpose.</p><p> Now, think about this.  Supposed he tried to use his campaign funds to pay off Stormy Daniels.  It would be totally illegal.  </p><p> If it's not a campaign expense it can't be a campaign contribution. These are not campaign contributions.</p><p> GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST, ABC \"THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS\":  But the corporate campaign --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROMANS:  We're also learning more about how long into the campaign the president was -- or into the -- when the president was involved in the Trump Tower Moscow issue.</p><p> What do you make of that and Rudy Giuliani's performance yesterday?</p><p> ZELIZER:  It's a total mess.  I mean, it's interesting.  Usually, in a scandal like this administrations are disciplined, they are focused. Everyone's on the same page as they fight back against the accusations.</p><p> This is the opposite of that.  Giuliani is saying a million things -- he's saying them at the same time.  And I think what you see is no one really has the same story, everyone isn't on the same page.  </p><p> And, Giuliani, himself, is throwing everything out there trying to protect the president, even basically changing what the law is on television in describing what happened.  And I think it reflects the chaos and the tone that the president has set in the Oval Office, and that's what the advisers are reflecting.</p><p> ROMANS:  Does Mick Mulvaney, the new chief of staff -- acting chief of staff -- does he fix it?</p><p> ZELIZER:  Absolutely not.  That's an easy prediction.  He will be like John Kelly, like Priebus -- the chiefs of staff that came before him. It's the same structure that he is going into and it's even worse because now, he is facing House Democrats coming at the administration.</p><p> We'll see if Mulvaney even keeps the job for a few months, at best.</p><p> BRIGGS:  If he wants the job --</p><p> ZELIZER:  If he wants the job. BRIGGS:  -- should be the question ahead.  It will be an interesting couple of days.</p><p> Julian, good to see you, sir.</p><p> ZELIZER:  Yes, thank you.</p><p> ROMANS:  Thanks, Julian.</p><p> BRIGGS:  All right, also in the Russia probe, a damning new report due this week claiming Silicon Valley may have done the bare minimum to help the Senate's Russia investigation.  </p><p> The Intelligence Committee commissioned a report from an online intel firm.  The report claims social media companies could have done a better job providing data about Russian accounts that posed as Americans.</p><p> [05:40:05]  ROMANS:  And, \"The Washington Post\" has obtained a separate report prepared for the Intel Committee.  It finds the Russians used every major social media platform to influence voters -- millions of voters -- to elect President Trump and worked even harder to support him once he was in office.</p><p> BRIGGS:  All right.  Coming up, new U.S. sanctions on North Korea could block the path to denuclearization forever.  Strong new words overnight from Pyongyang.  We'll have a live report, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BRIGGS:  North Korea lashing out over the U.S. decision to level sanctions against three of its senior-most government officials.  In an editorial over the weekend, Pyongyang warned the sanctions pressure could very well block the path to denuclearization forever.</p><p> Will Ripley has reported many times for us from Pyongyang, live in Hong Kong with the latest.</p><p> [05:45:02]  Will, these sanctions -- were they more symbolic?</p><p> WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely.  It was -- you know, to add three more names to an already long list of North Koreans who are under sanctions doesn't have, necessarily, a tangible impact.  </p><p> But to publicly shame, essentially, three officials who I've seen standing on stage next to Kim Jong Un at events in Pyongyang -- the head of the state security, organization guidance, propaganda and agitation -- it certainly is enough to irritate the North Koreans.  </p><p> And you're seeing, in their messaging through state media, increasingly strong warnings not necessarily about these individual sanctions but the overall issue of sanctions pressure over North Korea's nuclear program.</p><p> And this really sensitive issue for them of human rights, which they say is nonexistent despite reports from the U.N. of thousands of people in labor camps and essentially, people being imprisoned or severely punished for simply speaking their mind if their views somehow don't match identically with what the government thinks they should be.</p><p> And, North Koreans have said that if the sanctions pressure continues from the United States that this is their red line.  This could bring a return, potentially, to what we saw just a year ago -- North Korea launching missiles and conducting nuclear tests.  </p><p> I don't think they want to do that.  I don't think they want to see that happen.  But at the same time, they are trying to tell the United States that if there isn't some movement, that's exactly what could happen.</p><p> But very interestingly, they continue to praise President Trump, Dave. Over and over again, they say that the sanctions are going against the will of the White House.  They're clearly trying to play to President Trump's ego ahead of potentially that second summit, which could happen early next year, January or February.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes, still has not ruled it out.</p><p> Will Ripley live for us in Hong Kong, thank you.</p><p> ROMANS:  All right, now to a CNN exclusive -- a firsthand look at Israel's Operation Northern Shield along the border of Lebanon. Israel is trying to uncover and disable tunnels built by Hezbollah. There are fears the underground passageways could be used to mount attacks against civilians, as they were from Gaza.</p><p>CNN is the first broadcaster anywhere to go inside and our Ian Lee is live in Jerusalem with this extraordinary access.  What did our team see?</p><p> IAN LEE, CNN FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Christine.</p><p> The Israeli military took us right up next to the border and that's where we found this hole that they drilled down to the tunnel going down, dozens of yards past solid limestone that opens up into this tunnel.  And, Israel says they wanted to be so close to the border so they could show how it originated inside of Lebanon and crossed into Israel.  They are going to neutralize these tunnels as they find them. </p><p> But it wasn't what they saw that tipped them off to this tunnel but, rather, what they heard, and that's the vibration of digging through solid rock that tipped them off.  They also have other sophisticated technology to locate tunnels along this roughly 75-mile border.</p><p> What Israel wants, though, is action within the U.N. Security Council. They say it violates U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.  </p><p> The U.N. says they're aware of the tunnels, they're investigating, and they'll present their results to the Security Council. Also, Christine, we've reached out to Hezbollah previously.  They have not commented on it and they have neither confirmed nor denied that they are behind the tunnels, Christine.</p><p> ROMANS:  All right.  Ian Lee with some amazing access there -- Operation Northern Shield.  Thank you so much for that.</p><p> Let's get a check on \"CNN Business\" this morning.</p><p> Global stock markets are mixed right now.  You can see Tokyo and Shanghai were higher, but Hong Kong closed lower.  Friday's economic data release missed expectations in China and that is still reverberating.</p><p> European markets slightly lower in early trade there.</p><p> On Wall Street, futures are higher after Friday's losses.  Did you see what happened Friday?  The Dow closed 497 points lower.  The Dow is down almost three percent since the president's historic tax cuts, exactly a year ago.</p><p> The S&amp;P 500, Friday, declined almost two percent.  Now it's at the lowest level since April this year.  </p><p> The Nasdaq fell 2.3 percent.  The Nasdaq really the only one that's higher on the year, and barely.  The Dow and the S&amp;P are lower on the year.</p><p> Now, usually at the end of the year investors look forward to something called the Santa Claus Rally.  Well, you've only got a few more trading days for that to happen and it doesn't look so hopeful, at least not yet.</p><p> All right, all eyes will be on Johnson &amp; Johnson today after a Reuters investigation found it knew about asbestos in baby power for decades. And today, the company -- that's what the stock did on Friday.  Today, the company has a full-page ad in the paper saying, \"Science, not sensationalism\" -- saying that its baby powder is safe.</p><p> That stock, though, really got hit -- the worst day since 2002 on Friday, on this Reuters report.  </p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson has been dealing with lawsuits alleging some of its talcum powder products cause cancer.  But, the Reuters report cites documents that indicate company executives, scientists, mining experts, and others knew about the problem and failed to disclose it to regulators or the public.</p><p> In a statement, Johnson &amp; Johnson said this.  \"The Reuters article is one-sided, false and inflammatory.  Johnson &amp; Johnson's baby powder is safe and asbestos-free.\"</p><p> [05:50:07]  I would encourage people to read the Reuters report, however.  The Reuters reports is going back all the way to company --</p><p> BRIGGS:  The early 70s. ROMANS:  -- documents -- even as far back as the 50s, too.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes.</p><p> ROMANS:  So this is about decades in the past.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes.  It doesn't look like sensationalism.  It looks live very detailed journalism.</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BRIGGS:  A new report shows vaping among America's teens soaring this year.  For high school seniors, the number is up some 50 percent in the last 30 days alone.  That's compared to the same time period last year.</p><p> [05:55:00]  The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research found vaping was the second-most common substance in 2018.  Officials say vigilance is needed because vaping could lead teens to other drugs.  Use of other substances like alcohol and opioids has declined in recent years.</p><p> ROMANS:  A congressional delegation heads to Lordsburg, New Mexico tomorrow.  The group is getting a firsthand look at the Customs and Border Patrol facility where a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl was taken before she got sick and died this month.</p><p> The father of Jakelin Caal says he has no complaints about the treatment of his daughter by CBP.  The father, though, is disputing a Homeland Security official's claim that his daughter had gone days without food and water.  He says she was properly fed on their journey.</p><p> BRIGGS:  California has dropped plans to tax text messages.  The state hoped to add new monthly fees to increase funds for programs that bring connectivity to underserved residents, but the California Public Utilities Commission says a recent FCC ruling prevents the state from imposing that tax.  The ruling determined text messages are an information service, not a telecommunications service.</p><p> The proposed tax faced strong opposition from industry trade groups which called it harmful to consumers.</p><p> ROMANS:  A driver escapes unscathed after crashing his car into a home in Alabama -- oh, my goodness.  Montgomery Fire and Rescue responded to this unbelievable wreck Sunday where a car ended up nearly vertical.  Amazingly, neither the homeowners nor the driver were injured.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Wow.</p><p> Co-founder and CEO of the hit gaming app HQ Trivia, Colin Kroll, found dead in his New York apartment Sunday morning.  Police discovered Kroll in his bedroom after his girlfriend called police asking for a wellness check.  Multiple reports say he overdosed.</p><p> Kroll became a big name in the tech world after co-founding Vine, the looping app that launched the careers of numerous social media stars. Twitter bought Vine in 2012.</p><p> Kroll was only 34 years old.</p><p> ROMANS:  Expressions of love and support pouring in for \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\" cast member Pete Davidson.  New York City police conducted a wellness check on the comedian after he posted an alarming note on Instagram Saturday that said:  \"I really don't want to be on this earth anymore.\"  Now, that Instagram account was later deleted.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PETE DAVIDSON, CAST MEMBER, NBC \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\":  Once again, Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  A lot of relief for fans when Davidson made that brief appearance late on \"SNL\" this weekend.  </p><p> It's been a rough year for the 25-year-old.  He went through that painful breakup with Ariana Grande in October, and had to apologize last month for mocking the appearance of Texas congressional candidate Dan Crenshaw, who lost his eye serving in Afghanistan.</p><p> ROMANS:  All right.  Imagine, if you will, a world where Donald Trump is not president.  \"SNL\" tried with a takeoff on the classic \"It's A Wonderful Life.\"</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ALEC BALDWIN, ACTOR, PORTRAYING DONALD TRUMP, NBC, \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\":  Wow, everyone looks so different.  What are those things on their faces?</p><p> KENAN THOMPSON, CAST MEMBER, NBC \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\":  Those are called smiles.</p><p> BALDWIN:  Brett Kavanaugh, how's the Supreme Court.</p><p> MATT DAMON, ACTOR, PORTRAYING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, NBC, \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\":  Me, on the Supreme Court, with my temperament?  Are you insane?  No, no, they went with that nerd, Merrick Garland.</p><p> But on the plus side, when I tell people I like beer, they find it charming and not like I'm threatening violence.</p><p> BALDWIN:  I've had an epiphany.  I guess the world does need me to be president after all.</p><p> THOMPSON:  Yes, that was not the lesson at all.</p><p> BALDWIN:  I want to be president again.  I want to be president again.</p><p> KATE MCKINNON, CAST MEMBER PORTRAYING KELLYANNE CONWAY, NBC \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\":  Listen, Donald.  Every time a bell rings, someone you know quits or goes to jail.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROMANS:  That's Kellyanne Conway.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes.  </p><p> The next morning, the president lumped \"SNL\" in with news shows and criticized what he called it's one-sided coverage, suggesting without any basis that it was defamation -- even going so far as to call it collusion there in the end.</p><p> TEXT:  \"A real scandal is the one-sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC and Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live. It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts, can't be legal?  Only defame and belittle! Collusion?\"</p><p> BRIGGS:  Interesting tweet.</p><p> ROMANS:  He once appeared on \"SNL,\" I think.  I think he used to be a fan.

President Trump wants $5 billion, but Democrats are unwilling to agree to that and any spending bill needs bipartisan support to pass Congress.  A federal judge in Texas said on Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law, therefore, cannot stand.  The invalidation of the landmark health care law popularly known as Obamacare throws into doubt the future of health coverage for millions of Americans on the Obamacare exchanges and in Medicaid expansion.  North Korea is lashing out at the U.S. decision to level sanctions against three of its senior-most government officials.  In an editorial over the weekend, Pyongyang warned the sanctions pressure could very well block the path to denuclearization forever.  The Israeli army began Operation Northern Shield along the border with Lebanon to uncover and disable tunnels built by Hezbollah, which could be used by fighters to enter Israel secretly and mount attacks against civilians.  A CNN camera goes inside one of the tunnels, the first broadcaster anywhere to get permission to do so.] [Spec: Politics; Donald Trump; Government Shutdown; Congress; Border Wall; Funding; White House; Mexico; Democrats; Stephen Miller; Illegal Immigration; House of Representatives; Republicans; Votes; Chuck Schumer; Economy; Christmas Vacation; Mar-a-Lago; Florida; Obamacare; Texas; Supreme Court; Individual Mandate; Tax; Affordable Care Act; Susan Collins; Roy Blunt; Rudy Giuliani; Hush Money Payments; Stormy Daniels; Karen McDougal; Trump Tower Moscow; Mike Mulvaney; Acting Chief of Staff; Silicon Valley; Russia; Investigation; Senate Intelligence Committee; Social Media; Data; North Korea; United States; Sanctions; Pyongyang; Denuclearization; Human Rights; Israel; Operation Northern Shield; Lebanon; Tunnels; Hezbollah; Attacks; Civilians; U.N.

Meanwhile, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed creating a \"data dividend\" that would require large tech companies to pay users for their data, which requires an understanding of how much the data is worth to companies such as Google and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Other lawmakers are trying to outsource the math problem to tech companies, asking them to put a price on user data and regularly report that number to regulators.</p><p>It's a new challenge in the digital age to measure and value consumer data, fed to tech giants by tracking us via our many devices, including work computers, phones and even smart TVs.</p><p>Using Facebook or Google's search engine is free. But consumers are trading their data--and the ability for those companies to help target them with ads--in exchange for those services. That's one reason that pair of sneakers you eyed online on one website might appear to chase you in ads around the Internet.</p><p>Google's ad arm brought in $32.6 billion in advertising dollars for the second quarter, while Facebook took in $16.6 billion in the same period. Facebook said its 2.41 billion monthly active users generated an average of $7.05 each in revenue during the quarter, between ad activity and other payments and fees.</p><p>In Powell's speech, he referenced research by MIT and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. They found that people would have to be paid $17,530 per year to stop using search engines. Another group of researchers studied how much average users would need to be paid to deactivate their Facebook account for one year. The result: more than $1,000.</p><p>Consumers have their own ideas. To help fuel the multimillion-dollar advertising businesses of Google and Facebook, Joshua Rivera, an avid Twitter user, said he guesses his personal data is worth about $10,000 a year.</p><p>\"Those companies take the same data and can use it for really good purposes or really bad purposes,\" said the Albuquerque-based software engineer. \"There's nothing you can really do about which one they choose.\"</p><p>For years, consumers have been willing to turn over their data in exchange for ads. But new concerns have surfaced about the type and volume of data collected, plus the way outside parties may abuse it.</p><p>Facebook, which has borne the brunt of public scrutiny over data privacy, said in September that it had suspended tens of thousands of apps for possibly mishandling user data. The announcement came a year after reports that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of 87 million Facebook users and targeted them with political ads.</p><p>State attorneys general have launched antitrust investigations into Facebook and Google, questioning the industry's access to vast amounts of data, while lawmakers and regulators are probing tech companies for potential antitrust violations.</p><p>Tech companies are responding to those concerns. Facebook launched a tool that allows users to limit the data they share with apps, businesses and other groups. Google has rolled out ways for users to automatically delete certain data.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment. In a statement, Google spokesman Aaron Stein said the company is \"constantly investing in tools that help users control their data and automatic protections that secure it.\"</p><p>How officials choose to value user data and internet-powered economic gains will affect how regulators police some of the world's most-profitable companies, including the fines and taxes imposed upon those organizations. Plus, data that more adequately captures the digital age could allow economists to explain why U.S. productivity has slowed in recent years.</p><p>In remarks this week, Powell said some at the Fed have proposed valuing the services customers derive from their digital devices based on data volume. The research is in the early stages, he said.</p><p>\"Good decisions require good data, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like,\" Powell said.</p><p>Others say the value shouldn't be measured at all.</p><p>In a statement, analyst Karen Gullo of the not-for-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said privacy is a human right, and valuing data could trigger more problems. Gullo said the foundation opposes anything that could threaten to create a situation in which privacy is seen as \"property that can be bought and sold,\" even if users get paid in the process.</p><p>Newsom, California's governor, is behind a proposal that would require big tech companies to pay users for their data.</p><p>\"Giving out handfuls of dollars in exchange for data just lets companies' invasive data collection remain unchecked,\" Gullo said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INBUJO-605790418</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 605790418</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHG-HMR1-JCBJ-K0KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433198</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Indianapolis Business Journal Corp.

The agreement also seeks to remedy other highly publicized abuses at Facebook, including a March 2019 incident where hundreds of millions of users' passwords had been stored in plain text. Now, Facebook must encrypt them, and scan its databases to ensure that they are, the FTC said.</p><p>The company will still be able to make product decisions as it always has, and will still be able to collect the same data from users.</p><p>But the punishment does amount to a major, formal rebuke for chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in the eyes of Facebook users, workers and investors. Zuckerberg and his fellow executives maintained for more than a year that Facebook never violated the consent decree it struck with the FTC in 2011.</p><p>What's next</p><p>Facebook must submit to 20 years of oversight from an independent committee on the board. During that time, any violations could result in more fines and punishments, and Zuckerberg could be held personally responsible for future infractions. A third-party organization will be tasked with reviewing Face-book's data-collection practices and those of its other services, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>--The Associated Press, Washington Post and The New York Times contributed to this report</p><p>(Box)</p><p>MORE DEVELOPMENTS Things Facebook must do</p><p>The U.S. government's $5 billion fine and other requirements of Facebook for its widespread violation of consumers' privacy is a major rebuke for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who had long denied any such violation.</p><p>NIALL CARSON / TNS</p><p>Antitrust investigation</p><p>The FTC's order doesn't add any significant new items for the company to fix, and many of the broad stipulations in the settlement require Facebook to do things the company is already doing or has promised to do.

On Thursday, a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction to Airbnb in its lawsuit against the New York City Council over a law that would have required Airbnb and other short-term rental companies to disclose details about hosts and the units they rent that was set to take effect in February.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move throws a wrench in city and statewide efforts to curb practices that critics say cut into the availability of affordable housing in New York City. City Councilwoman Carlina Rivera, a sponsor of the bill, said that while some New Yorkers use Airbnb simply to make ends meet, many are landlords taking rent-regulated units off the housing market by renting them at higher prices through Airbnb or its competitors like HomeAway, which also sued the city over the law.</p><p> When the City Council passed the disclosure bill unanimously and Mayor Bill de Blasio signed it into law over the summer, proponents considered it a way to add transparency and accountability to Airbnb's more than 50,000 New York City listings, cracking down on those that don't comply with state or city law.</p><p> But Thursday's decision suggests that the fight to regulate tech giants like Airbnb will be more contentious than previously thought. The city having access to renters' names and the addresses of rental units \u2013 as the City Council law would require \u2013 may not seem like an extraordinary overreach. After all, individuals are required to register similar information with the state when they do something like apply for a driver's license, and any hotels operating within the city have to provide even more information. But in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Judge Paul Engelmayer granted Airbnb's request for an injunction based on the fact that it would likely violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Unlike applying for a driver's license or registering a hotel, in which individuals disclose their own information, the law would put the burden on Airbnb to turn over troves of data about its hosts.</p><p> \"The city has not cited any decision suggesting that the governmental appropriation of private business records on such a scale, unsupported by individualized suspicion or any tailored justification, qualifies as a reasonable search and seizure,\" Engelmayer wrote in the ruling.</p><p>Rivera, the bill's sponsor, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p> The preliminary injunction gives both Airbnb and city lawyers more time to gather evidence before a final decision is made, but the ruling represents an initial victory for Airbnb and other home-share companies.</p><p> \"Today's decision by the court to grant a preliminary injunction demonstrates what Airbnb has long been saying - all Americans (including businesses) have a right to privacy in their records,\" Robbie Kaplan, an attorney representing Airbnb in the lawsuit, said in a statement. \"No government can force a company to simply turn over its entire hard drive every month without any form of precompliance review. Judge Engelmayer's cogent and comprehensive opinion takes old world concepts which inspired the founders to enact the Fourth Amendment in the first place and applies them to today's modern, high-tech world.\"</p><p> Lawmakers do face a challenge in regulating \"today's modern, high-tech world,\" and not just at the city level. Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal introduced a similar bill to the City Council law which would require Airbnb to disclose hosts' information, and it was backed by the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council. And while Rosenthal's legislation was already facing roadblocks \u2013 including a competing Airbnb-backed bill from Assemblyman Joseph Lentol that would focus on regulations like limiting the number of listings renters can have in the city and barring hosts with repeated city or state violations \u2013 Thursday's decision does not bode well for Rosenthal's bill advancing in the new session.</p><p> Still, this doesn't mean the end of the discussion for Big Tech regulation. For Airbnb, and for tech companies in general, legislation is almost certainly forthcoming. Julie Samuels, executive director of the tech network Tech:NYC, praised Judge Engelmayer's decision without ignoring the need for regulation. \"Today's ruling creates a welcome pause in the homesharing debate, and proves a point many already knew: that the existing law has flaws, and should be discussed further,\" Samuels said in a statement. \"Judge Engelmayer's ruling gives us time to revisit the law, offering stakeholders an opportunity to have a positive conversation about crafting more sensible, 21st century rules.\"</p><p> In December, Rosenthal told City &amp; State that she intends to continue advancing legislation to hold short-term rental companies to stricter standards in the new session. \"Airbnb is basically stealing units of housing that have now become places for tourists to rent rather than permanent New Yorkers,\" Rosenthal said at the time. \"With Airbnb's expansion and continued disregard of the law, our efforts and my efforts have just increased because there's a lot to do to make sure that we keep these units for regular New Yorkers.\"</p><p> If the fate of the City Council's Airbnb legislation is any indication, those efforts will be an uphill battle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Airbnb supporters and detractors at a City Council hearing in 2015.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-30592b7385bf8630e922c7651e302a906a14c22e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CBD98D19EA5 NWBKNY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V43-S021-DXVP-V0C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Manhattan Media LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Tulsi Gabbard Alex Wong/Getty Images</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In July 2019, Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii filed a lawsuit against Google, alleging that the tech giant violated her First Amendment rights when it briefly suspended her presidential campaign's ad account. But on Wednesday, March 4, a California judge <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.yahoo.com/judge-rejects-tulsi-gabbards-free-003614204.html\">dismissed the congresswoman's case</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/technology/google-tulsi-gabbard-lawsuit.html\">rejected her arguments</url>.</p><p>Gabbard, in her lawsuit, asked for $50 million in damages because of \"serious and continuing violations of Tulsi's right to free speech\" and alleged that Google \"helps to run elections\" with its search engine and advertising platform. But Judge Stephen Wilson of California's Central District Court vehemently disagreed, asserting that what Gabbard's case \"fails to establish is how Google's regulation of its own platform is in any way equivalent to a governmental regulation of an election.\"</p><p>Wilson ruled that because Google is an \"undisputedly private company\" - not an agency of the government - Gabbard's claims of censorship did not hold up.</p><p>On July 25, 2019, Gabbard tweeted, \"In the hours following the 1st debate, while millions of Americans searched for info about Tulsi, Google suspended her search ad account w/o explanation. It is vital to our democracy that big tech companies can't affect the outcome of elections.\" And her lawsuit argued, \"Since at least June 2019, Google has used its control over online political speech to silence Tulsi Gabbard, a candidate millions of Americans want to hear from.\"</p><p>It was also in July 2019 that Google representative Riva Sciuto, in response to Gabbard's complaints, said that her account was <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/827bbf753dd24970b5c8a79bdf7dc5ba\">flagged by its automated system</url> for what looked like unusual activity but that the mistake was quickly corrected - and the account was restored.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1154444505090629633\">https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1154444505090629633</url></p><p>Despite low poll numbers, Gabbard remains in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary as of Thursday morning, March 5. The congresswoman hasn't qualified for the last five Democratic presidential debates; the last one she appeared in was in November 2019. But Gabbard <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/why-tulsi-gabbard-still-2020-presidential-race-after-better-polling-democrats-dropped-out-1490135\">has yet to drop out</url> of the race and is among the four candidates who remains after Super Tuesday.

This is a damning condemnation, and, in my view, an untenable situation in a country governed by the rule of law.\"</p><p>While there is consensus in Ottawa that something needs to be done about the country's privacy laws, just what to do and whether those laws can be enacted in 2020 remains up in the air.</p><p>Therrien argues that to adequately regulate technology companies, his office needs the ability to levy fines and the ability to make legally binding orders requiring companies to change their practices.</p><p>\"Privacy is so much more than consenting or not to terms and conditions dictated by companies,\" Therrien told reporters at a news conference in Ottawa. \"It is a human right, and it must be explicitly recognized as such in privacy laws.\"</p><p>The report pointed to investigations around the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, which resulted in minimal action despite the fact that Therrien's office determined that several companies broke Canadian law.</p><p>\"The fact that Facebook said it would not implement recommendations to address those issues leaves a high risk that the personal information of Canadians could be used in ways that they do not know or suspect, exposing them to potential harms,\" Therrien wrote. \"This is extremely worrisome given the vast amount of sensitive information people have entrusted to Facebook.\"</p><p>In response to Therrien's report, both Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner and New Democrat Charlie Angus called for action from the governing Liberals.</p><p>\"Today's Privacy Commissioner's report underscored the Liberal government's lack of action to protect the value of data and the privacy of Canadians,\" Rempel Garner said. \"In his press conference, he (Therrien) stated that nearly every Canadian's data has been the subject of a privacy breach at some point.\"</p><p>Angus accused the Liberals of being too cozy with big tech.</p><p>\"I'd say the government needs to explain why they're continuing to protect Facebook and the digital giants,\" he said.</p><p>At this point, even tech companies are generally calling for more regulation, with the caveat that any new rules need to be carefully crafted in a way to avoid stifling innovation.</p><p>\"It can't simply be the privacy commissioner as judge, jury and executioner without due process,\" said Andre Leduc, vice-president of policy at industry group ITAC.</p><p>\"Industry has some concerns with the concept of the privacy commissioner having broad order-making powers, because there has to be an element of due process included.\"</p><p>Earlier this year the federal government published a Digital Charter, which lays out 10 principles that will guide future policy on data and privacy issues. The Digital Charter calls for tougher penalties for companies that violate the rules, and giving some additional powers to the privacy commissioner's office.</p><p>Innovation Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains was not available for an interview in response to the privacy commissioner's report, but in an email Dani Keenan, a spokeswoman for Bains, highlighted the Digital Charter as the government's key policy document.</p><p>\"Our government takes the protection of Canadians'personal information very seriously. Trust is the foundation on which our digital and data-driven economy is built,\" Keenan wrote in an email.</p><p>But in his report, Therrien argued that the Digital Charter's approach is too limiting, by requiring the privacy commissioner to get approval from the attorney general to take action.</p><p>\"At the moment, as we saw in our Facebook investigation, an organization that we have found in contravention of the law can simply ignore our recommendations and 'wait it out'until the courts have come to the same conclusion as my office,\" Therrien wrote.</p><p>\"In the government's proposal under the Digital Charter, a further step would be added, in the form of a review by the Attorney General.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Sun Media Corporation.

The California Consumer Privacy Act, which came int...</p><p>The Golden State has long been a trendsetter in creating and then regulating technology. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which came into force last month, set a new standard for US data protection. It achieved something else too: it has galvanised tech companies, previously opposed to regulation, to call for a new national law. The tech giants\u2019 conversion to the merits of rules is welcome; a federal approach has clear benefits over a patchwork of state-level initiatives. But lawmakers need to resist tech industry lobbying aimed at reducing legislation into a vehicle for protecting their interests. </p><p>A unified federal law would prevent the dangers of regulatory fragmentation. A proposed privacy act introduced this month in the Washington state senate, for example, goes further than California\u2019s in some respects. Other state legislatures may adopt different standards on data storage or customers\u2019 rights. A legislative patchwork is more difficult and costly for smaller companies to comply with than for deep-pocketed Big Tech companies.</p><p>Yet regulators have good reason to be wary of Silicon Valley\u2019s new-found belief in legislation. Its support for a federal privacy law is at least partially rooted in concerns about how far Europe has become the standard-setter with its General Data Protection Regulation. Despite its numerous flaws, GDPR has been a force for good. By illuminating the grubby underbelly of the data economy, it helped to inspire efforts in other jurisdictions to crack down on the way tech companies use data, particularly in so-called surveillance capitalism, or harnessing mass data in pursuit of profit.</p><p>The lobbying directed at the California and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/how-lobbyists-rewrote-washington-state-privacy-law-microsoft-amazon-regulation/\">Washington state</url>laws by the tech firms may be only a shadow of what they would target towards a US equivalent of GDPR. They might attempt to shape the law to ensure it held them to less onerous standards than the Californian or EU versions, or use it to further market dominance.</p><p>Making a federal privacy law effective, however, means not just rejecting industry pressure on standards, but improving on those adopted elsewhere. The California law has been criticised for the wording of some provisions \u2014 most notably on a consumer\u2019s right to opt out of the sale of their data to third parties. The term \u201csales\u201d is ill-defined, with data often traded rather than sold.</p><p>Europe\u2019s GDPR should also be overhauled before being used as a blueprint for a US counterpart. Despite its lofty aim of ensuring that data processing requires meaningful consent, users often still have to battle through reams of legal jargon to try and understand their data rights. A federal privacy law should shift the onus away from individual users to the companies that are profiting from their data. Experts also say that a loophole in GDPR allows companies surreptitiously to <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/CBLR/article/view/3424\"> infer </url>potentially sensitive information, such as ethnicity or sexual orientation, from data collected with prior user consent.</p><p>A federal law should go further than GDPR does in tailoring the burden of compliance to companies of different sizes. The scale and resources of leviathans such as Alphabet or Facebook mean they should face tighter standards, and can afford to do so. Protecting privacy and encouraging competition should not be mutually exclusive.</p><p>Finally, lawmakers should address some of the risks posed by emerging technologies. Last week, Facebook settled with users in Illinois for $550m over its use of facial recognition. A draft white paper from the European Commission suggests a moratorium on the technology. A federal privacy law offers US legislators a chance to develop similarly bold measures.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-80d235323eac11eab232000f4477fbca</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y48-BDM1-DXP9-939Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><timeReceived>6:57 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0IyMDJBNDQ2RTlCNEFGREI3RjM5NzYwMzc2OEEwQTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTdFNjU4OEFCQURDNEE0RkJFNjUxNjZCNTk4MzY3QTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

An FTC investigation of YouTube that is now underway originated with complaints from consumer groups, which argued the Google-owned streaming site violates COPPA through its large number of highly popular channels featuring content for young children, such as nursery rhymes and simplistic cartoons. YouTube says the site is not intended for children.</p><p>COPPA prohibits companies from collecting children's data in most circumstances or targeting them with personalized advertising, but the law applies only to websites or apps that are directed at children or have \"actual knowledge\" that users are younger than 13. Consumer and privacy groups long have complained that this has allowed YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, the game Fortnite and others to avoid the legal restrictions of COPPA, despite polling and other evidence showing they are popular with preteens.</p><p>In response, the FTC is seeking comment on how it might update its rules for enforcing COPPA to address the potential gap. The commission also seeks to determine whether COPPA sufficiently covers newer technologies, including smart televisions, educational technologies and interactive games, which could include such new, massively popular titles such as Fortnite. The issues count among the 29 questions the agency posed for public comment in the Federal Register, the first step in what could be more than a year of work that leads to an update in the way COPPA is enforced.</p><p>The FTC's five commissioners - three Republicans and two Democrats - voted unanimously to initiate the review, which came as a surprise to some consumer advocates but illustrates that their complaints about the limits of COPPA have garnered attention at the FTC.</p><p>\"I can only speculate that in trying to determine whether companies were violating COPPA, it became clear that there were many situations where the rules were ambiguous, did not clearly cover privacy-invasive conduct or were simply ineffective,\" said Angela Campbell, a law professor at Georgetown University who represents a coalition of consumer advocates and privacy groups that have filed FTC complaints about alleged COPPA violations by several technology companies.</p><p>Mark Eichorn, an assistant director at the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection's division of privacy and identity protection, said the commission has heard the \"frustration from [privacy] groups that the statute and the rule don't really account for those sites that certainly are not directed to kids, they're not intended to be directed to kids, but they know they have a significant number of kids on there.\"</p><p>The FTC's new efforts to update COPPA come as lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to push for an overhaul of the law. Legal experts say that COPPA has limitations built into the statute that could make meaningful expansion of its reach difficult without action from Congress.</p><p>One bill by Sens. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), for example, would expand it to cover children up to age 15 and also broaden the definition of covered companies to include those with demonstrably large numbers of underage users - even if there is not \"actual knowledge\" about a particular user's age. In a statement Thursday, Markey said an FTC update \"will not eliminate the dire need for Congress to pass\" the bill.</p><p>\"But if the Commission is truly serious about protecting young people online, it will enforce existing protections, hold violators accountable no matter how powerful they are, and act as a forceful check against the ever-increasing appetite for children's data,\" Markey added.</p><p>Under Simons, the FTC has sought to step up its enforcement of child-privacy rules. In February, the commission took aim at the social media app Musical.ly - now known as TikTok - over allegations that it illegally collected the names, email addresses, pictures and locations of children younger than 13. The settlement included a $5.7 million financial penalty, a record for a COPPA violation at the FTC. TikTok is also now under investigation in Britain.</p><p>\"Our recent enforcement action involving TikTok, which is a rapidly growing social media product in this country and throughout the world, demonstrates our focus on new trends we're seeing and our desire to protect children consistent with COPPA,\" said Noah Phillips, a Republican FTC commissioner.</p><p>\"My view is that we are hearing enough from all sorts of stakeholders, and we're seeing changes in the market,\" Phillips added, \"and so expedited review of this rule is warranted.\"</p><p>When COPPA first passed, there was no YouTube, no Facebook and no iPhone, and the commission has struggled to keep pace with advancing technology while applying a law more than two decades old. The FTC did extensive updating to its rules regarding COPPA enforcement beginning in 2010, expanding several definitions of personal data to include videos, photos or voice clips.</p><p>News that the FTC was considering another overhaul to COPPA prompted some anxiety among consumer and privacy advocates, who expressed worry that the process could lead to the weakening of enforcement or other accommodations to technology companies.</p><p>\"The biggest problem with COPPA is not the rules - it's the lack of enforcement, a problem which could be solved immediately without a lengthy comment period and proceeding,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, an advocacy group based in Boston. \"In addition, many of the questions the commission is asking suggest they are considering loosening the rules to the benefit of Big Tech.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-7c38240cb1034963b24f084294d14628</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKR-6V91-DXKP-J38X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1076\"/><timeReceived>2:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

An FTC investigation of YouTube that is now underway originated with complaints from consumer groups, which argued the Google-owned streaming site violates COPPA through its large number of highly popular channels featuring content for young children, such as nursery rhymes and simplistic cartoons. YouTube says the site is not intended for children.</p><p>COPPA prohibits companies from collecting children's data in most circumstances or targeting them with personalized advertising, but the law applies only to websites or apps that are directed at children or have \"actual knowledge\" that users are younger than 13. Consumer and privacy groups long have complained that this has allowed YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, the game \"Fortnite\" and others to avoid the legal restrictions of COPPA, despite polling and other evidence showing they are popular with preteens.</p><p>In response, the FTC is seeking comment on how it might update its rules for enforcing COPPA to address the potential gap. The commission also seeks to determine whether COPPA sufficiently covers newer technologies, including smart televisions, educational technologies and interactive games, which could include such new, massively popular titles such as \"Fortnite.\" The issues count among the 29 questions the agency posed for public comment in the Federal Register, the first step in what could be more than a year of work that leads to an update in the way COPPA is enforced.</p><p>The FTC's five commissioners - three Republicans and two Democrats - voted unanimously to initiate the review, which came as a surprise to some consumer advocates but illustrates that their complaints about the limits of COPPA have garnered attention at the FTC.</p><p>\"I can only speculate that in trying to determine whether companies were violating COPPA, it became clear that there were many situations where the rules were ambiguous, did not clearly cover privacy-invasive conduct or were simply ineffective,\" said Angela Campbell, a law professor at Georgetown University who represents a coalition of consumer advocates and privacy groups that have filed FTC complaints about alleged COPPA violations by several technology companies.</p><p>Mark Eichorn, an assistant director at the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection's division of privacy and identity protection, said the commission has heard the \"frustration from [privacy] groups that the statute and the rule don't really account for those sites that certainly are not directed to kids, they're not intended to be directed to kids, but they know they have a significant number of kids on there.\"</p><p>The FTC's new efforts to update COPPA come as lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to push for an overhaul of the law. Legal experts say that COPPA has limitations built into the statute that could make meaningful expansion of its reach difficult without action from Congress.</p><p>One bill by Sens. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), for example, would expand it to cover children up to age 15 and also broaden the definition of covered companies to include those with demonstrably large numbers of underage users - even if there is not \"actual knowledge\" about a particular user's age. In a statement Thursday, Markey said an FTC update \"will not eliminate the dire need for Congress to pass\" the bill.</p><p>\"But if the Commission is truly serious about protecting young people online, it will enforce existing protections, hold violators accountable no matter how powerful they are, and act as a forceful check against the ever-increasing appetite for children's data,\" Markey added.</p><p>Under Simons, the FTC has sought to step up its enforcement of child-privacy rules. In February, the commission took aim at the social media app Musical.ly - now known as TikTok - over allegations that it illegally collected the names, email addresses, pictures and locations of children younger than 13. The settlement included a $5.7 million financial penalty, a record for a COPPA violation at the FTC. TikTok is also now under investigation in Britain.</p><p>\"Our recent enforcement action involving TikTok, which is a rapidly growing social media product in this country and throughout the world, demonstrates our focus on new trends we're seeing and our desire to protect children consistent with COPPA,\" said Noah Phillips, a Republican FTC commissioner.</p><p>\"My view is that we are hearing enough from all sorts of stakeholders, and we're seeing changes in the market,\" Phillips added, \"and so expedited review of this rule is warranted.\"</p><p>When COPPA first passed, there was no YouTube, no Facebook and no iPhone, and the commission has struggled to keep pace with advancing technology while applying a law more than two decades old. The FTC did extensive updating to its rules regarding COPPA enforcement beginning in 2010, expanding several definitions of personal data to include videos, photos or voice clips.</p><p>News that the FTC was considering another overhaul to COPPA prompted some anxiety among consumer and privacy advocates, who expressed worry that the process could lead to the weakening of enforcement or other accommodations to technology companies.</p><p>\"The biggest problem with COPPA is not the rules - it's the lack of enforcement, a problem which could be solved immediately without a lengthy comment period and proceeding,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, an advocacy group based in Boston. \"In addition, many of the questions the commission is asking suggest they are considering loosening the rules to the benefit of Big Tech.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-4eb0419e-a973-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKV-Y821-JBFW-C195-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

An FTC investigation of YouTube that is now underway originated with complaints from consumer groups, which argued the Google-owned streaming site violates COPPA through its large number of highly popular channels featuring content for young children, such as nursery rhymes and simplistic cartoons. YouTube says the site is not intended for children.</p><p>COPPA prohibits companies from collecting children's data in most circumstances or targeting them with personalized advertising, but the law applies only to websites or apps that are directed at children or have \"actual knowledge\" that users are younger than 13. Consumer and privacy groups long have complained that this has allowed YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, the game \"Fortnite\" and others to avoid the legal restrictions of COPPA, despite polling and other evidence showing they are popular with preteens.</p><p>In response, the FTC is seeking comment on how it might update its rules for enforcing COPPA to address the potential gap. The commission also seeks to determine whether COPPA sufficiently covers newer technologies, including smart televisions, educational technologies and interactive games, which could include such new, massively popular titles such as \"Fortnite.\" The issues count among the 29 questions the agency posed for public comment in the Federal Register, the first step in what could be more than a year of work that leads to an update in the way COPPA is enforced.</p><p>The FTC's five commissioners - three Republicans and two Democrats - voted unanimously to initiate the review, which came as a surprise to some consumer advocates but illustrates that their complaints about the limits of COPPA have garnered attention at the FTC.</p><p>\"I can only speculate that in trying to determine whether companies were violating COPPA, it became clear that there were many situations where the rules were ambiguous, did not clearly cover privacy-invasive conduct or were simply ineffective,\" said Angela Campbell, a law professor at Georgetown University who represents a coalition of consumer advocates and privacy groups that have filed FTC complaints about alleged COPPA violations by several technology companies.</p><p>Mark Eichorn, an assistant director at the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection's division of privacy and identity protection, said the commission has heard the \"frustration from [privacy] groups that the statute and the rule don't really account for those sites that certainly are not directed to kids, they're not intended to be directed to kids, but they know they have a significant number of kids on there.\"</p><p>The FTC's new efforts to update COPPA come as lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to push for an overhaul of the law. Legal experts say that COPPA has limitations built into the statute that could make meaningful expansion of its reach difficult without action from Congress.</p><p>One bill by Sens. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), for example, would expand it to cover children up to age 15 and also broaden the definition of covered companies to include those with demonstrably large numbers of underage users - even if there is not \"actual knowledge\" about a particular user's age. In a statement Thursday, Markey said an FTC update \"will not eliminate the dire need for Congress to pass\" the bill.</p><p>\"But if the Commission is truly serious about protecting young people online, it will enforce existing protections, hold violators accountable no matter how powerful they are, and act as a forceful check against the ever-increasing appetite for children's data,\" Markey added.</p><p>Under Simons, the FTC has sought to step up its enforcement of child-privacy rules. In February, the commission took aim at the social media app Musical.ly - now known as TikTok - over allegations that it illegally collected the names, email addresses, pictures and locations of children younger than 13. The settlement included a $5.7 million financial penalty, a record for a COPPA violation at the FTC. TikTok is also now under investigation in Britain.</p><p>\"Our recent enforcement action involving TikTok, which is a rapidly growing social media product in this country and throughout the world, demonstrates our focus on new trends we're seeing and our desire to protect children consistent with COPPA,\" said Noah Phillips, a Republican FTC commissioner.</p><p>\"My view is that we are hearing enough from all sorts of stakeholders, and we're seeing changes in the market,\" Phillips added, \"and so expedited review of this rule is warranted.\"</p><p>When COPPA first passed, there was no YouTube, no Facebook and no iPhone, and the commission has struggled to keep pace with advancing technology while applying a law more than two decades old. The FTC did extensive updating to its rules regarding COPPA enforcement beginning in 2010, expanding several definitions of personal data to include videos, photos or voice clips.</p><p>News that the FTC was considering another overhaul to COPPA prompted some anxiety among consumer and privacy advocates, who expressed worry that the process could lead to the weakening of enforcement or other accommodations to technology companies.</p><p>\"The biggest problem with COPPA is not the rules - it's the lack of enforcement, a problem which could be solved immediately without a lengthy comment period and proceeding,\" said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, an advocacy group based in Boston. \"In addition, many of the questions the commission is asking suggest they are considering loosening the rules to the benefit of Big Tech.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-4eb0419ea97311e99214246e594de5d5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKV-TB21-DYX1-H0PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1085\"/><timeReceived>GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 81 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0016: Unparseable date: \"0016\"EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, September 10th, your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump is doubling down on the China trade fight. He is touting how the tariffs are hurting China's economy, also talking about the need for a fair deal with the United States. The president is getting praise for his handling of China from an unlikely source this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Billionaire and Democratic supporter, George Soros, writes an op-ed in the Journal this morning, praising the president's stance on China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning, look like this, Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading. We are off of the worst levels of the morning. Nonetheless, Dow is down 22 points, S&amp;P down 5, and the NASDAQ down 24, after modest moves on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow was up for a fourth straight session yesterday, but the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ, well, they finished slightly lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this, European indices this morning are mixed, ahead of the ECB meeting on Thursday, the FT-100 is up 5, the CAC Quarante is down 3, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 28. We have the European central bank policy decision, on Thursday of this week.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets finished like this, mostly higher, with the exception of China. In China, you had lots of economic data. The Producer Price Index for August fell eight-tenths of a percent year-over-year. That was the worst contraction since August of 2016.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index in China was above expectations. The price of pork is up 47 percent year-over-year, due to the swine fever outbreak, and the CPI, Consumer Price Index, was up 2.8 percent in China.</p><p>It's Apple's big day, the technology giant is set to announce new iPhones today. We're going to take you live to Apple Park, get a look at what to expect from Apple this morning. Then, \"Jeopardy!\" on the go, how you can play the game, Alex Trebek and all, while driving your car.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, and joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, commentary writer with the Washington Examiner, Tiana Lowe, and associate editor of Barron's, Jack Hough is here. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JACK HOUGH, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, BARRON'S: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, not a lot happening, in terms of macro news, although, the economic data out of China was one, and of course, we got all these central bank meetings happening. You got the Fed next week, September 18th, the ECB this week, Thursday. Any takeaways, what you are anticipating, Dagen, on the Fed, coming on Thursday the 18th -- Wednesday, the 18th, pardon me.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The Federal Reserve's going to cut by a quarter of a point, but we do have some data coming out later this week. You got the JOLTS report today, when in term of job openings. You still have a vast number of many more -- I think it's almost a million and half more job openings than there are unemployed in this country.</p><p>And also, CPI, out later in the week, and retail sales, to go right to the health of the consumer and how much more we're paying in prices in this country because of the tariffs. Those will be interesting to watch.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the question is, are we going to see an impact through these numbers, about an economy that is slowing down, over uncertainty over the global slowdown, or uncertainty around the trade conversation.</p><p>HOUGH: Yes, but not going into recession slowing down. The economy will look good not great. Stocks will move higher because bonds are bad alternative, right now, at these -- at these yields. And I don't think, you know -- the retail numbers will be pretty good. Retail is a bright spot in America despite --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is.</p><p>HOUGH: -- the bankruptcies and store closings in retail. Consumers are spending, it's just that we have too many stores, right now, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's important, two-thirds of economic growth. Joining the conversation this morning is the Arkansas attorney general, Leslie Rutledge is here, on the Google anti-trust case.</p><p>Former National deputy -- National Security adviser for President Trump, K.T. McFarland joining us this morning, on North Korea and Afghanistan, and the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney weighs in, as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big hour, coming up.</p><p>President Trump is talking up the economy, while taking a swipe at Democrats, during a packed rally last night, in North Carolina, Blake Burman is live at the White House this morning with the details. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you, as well. President Trump slamming Democrats last night, as he went to North Carolina, ahead of today's special elections, special congressional election in the Fayetteville area, giving a bit of a preview as to what his message could be like at this point, next year.</p><p>The president saying radical Democrats, as he described it, want to dismantle and destroy progress that's been made and said it won't take long. He also tried to link Democrats to socialism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion and socialism. They're socialists. A vote for any Democrat in 2020, and a vote for any Democrat tomorrow in North Carolina, is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: However, new poll out this morning from ABC News and The Washington Post shows that the president has some convincing to do, that he is steering the economy in the right direction, while 56 percent of Americans view the economy in a positive light, more than 43 percent view it, negatively, and the marks take a dive when it comes to trade.</p><p>Fifty-six percent of Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the trade negotiations with China, while only 35 percent approve.</p><p>Confidence in the economy appears to be taking a hit as well, as 43 percent say the president's handling of trade in the economy has increased the chance for a recession, only 16 percent say it's less than a chance, and about a third of Americans, Maria, say it hasn't moved the needle.</p><p>Sixty percent of Americans, Maria, in that poll, feel that a recession is likely, at some point, over the next year. The same amount say that they are concerned that the trade war with China will lead to higher prices. The president's approval rating in that one poll, Maria, from ABC News and the Washington Post dropped 6 points, the approval rating, down to 38 points. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Blake, thank you. Blake Burman is at the White House. Pushing back on big tech, meanwhile, 50 attorneys general from 48 U.S. states and territories, announcing a wide-ranging anti-trust investigation into Google. The probe is largely looking at advertising practices. Here's what several of them had to say, yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEN PAXTON (R), ATTORNEY GENERAL, TEXAS: While many consumers believe that the Internet is free. Certainly, we know from Google's profits of 117 billion, that the Internet is not free. And this is a company that dominates all aspects of advertising on the Internet. This investigation is not a lawsuit. It is an investigation to determine the facts.</p><p>KARL RACINE (D), ATTORNEY GENERAL, WASHINGTON D.C.: Attorneys generals really care about where the rubber meets the road. And that is for the residents of their states and consumers. We also care about businesses, especially small businesses, that may be locked out as a result of what may be monopolistic power.</p><p>LESLIE RUTLEDGE (R), ATTORNEY GENERAL, ARKANSAS: Most Americans think it's free to Google something. But it comes at a cost. A cost that the freedom to choose the best products from the best companies.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The only states not onboard, California and Alabama. Joining us right now is Arkansas attorney general, Leslie Rutledge. Ms. Attorney General, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>LESLIE RUTLEDGE (R), ATTORNEY GENERAL, ARKANSAS: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us, really, what the big issues are from where you sit, in this lawsuit, around Google. Because there's a lot conversation whether it be the way they say that their algorithms deal with searches or the fact that the company has 90 percent market share in search, or the other argument, that they are actually censoring certain speech, censoring conservatives because of their own liberal ideology.</p><p>RUTLEDGE: Well, thank you. I think it's important to note that this is an investigation. That, right now, we are -- these 50 attorneys general, we have launched this investigation and we will go where the facts lead us.</p><p>Our concerns with Google being the online search engine juggernaut that it is, has to do with whether or not we are adequately protecting American consumers, protecting the free market in America to ensure that, again, Google is not violating any anti-trust laws, because as you just noted, aptly 90 percent of the market on the online search engines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And there's also this issue about Google working with China, and I wonder what your -- what your thoughts are here, because I've been working on a lot on Artificial Intelligence and looking at the issues around A.I.</p><p>And, of course, we know that Google walked away from a contract, Project Maven, with the Pentagon. They said that they didn't want to be involved in anything that it was used in the military, and that is Artificial Intelligence. And yet, they are working with China, and they've got their A.I. lab in Beijing.</p><p>Is there any way that the Chinese might try to infiltrate or meddle in the U.S. election, try to take Trump down through Google?</p><p>RUTLEDGE: Well, I don't think that we should underestimate any of our foes across the globe who are looking to infiltrate and impact elections, and to use American companies to do so. Whether or not Google would have a hand in that, one would hope not, and we would ask they not.</p><p>The investigation that we launched yesterday, has to do with digital advertising of this company. And so, we're going to remain focused on that. However, if other issues arise, whether it's Google or another company, we will certainly look into that and work very closely and cooperatively with the Department of Justice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you're going to look at other companies then, not just Google.</p><p>RUTLEDGE: Absolutely. It's -- you know, this is a beginning. Google is one that we are launched investigations yesterday. However, it's imperative that we protect all Americans and that we protect our free market, and perhaps, you know, when Americans go to conduct a search, that they understand, as I stated, that a search is not free.</p><p>We want to make sure when we are looking for help with a sick child on the Internet, late at night, that you are getting the best services and the best advice, and not simply those who paid the highest price. Each and every one of us when we look at our smartphones, we are brought a Super Bowl ad to us, powered by Google.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Attorney General, it's Dagen McDowell, but what are you going to find that the FTC did not? Google has faced, I think, three multi-billion- dollar fines from the European Union.</p><p>But the FTC decided against suing Google back in 2013, because it found it was basically divided between making innovative products with the clear desire to hobble would be competitors, in the words of the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>So, what are you, as attorneys general, going to find now that, basically, the U.S. government has not yet?</p><p>RUTLEDGE: Well, I think, Google would be the first to admit that quite a bit has changed since 2013, and it's 2019, and perhaps their business practices have changed. Again, this is an investigation. And as the attorneys general for the states, we will go where the facts lead us.</p><p>And so, this is not an outcome determinative investigation. We are simply wanting to protect the American consumer in doing so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Ms. Attorney General, good to see you this morning, thanks so much. We'll be watching the developments.</p><p>RUTLEDGE: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Leslie Rutledge, joining us there. Coming up, Apple is hitting the reset button. The technology giant expected to unveil a brand-new version of its iPhone. We are taking you to Apple Park, live, getting a look at what to expect out of Apple today, big announcements.</p><p>Then, take a joyride with \"Jeopardy!\". How fans can now test their trivia knowledge in the car, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, more evidence seized in the deadly California boat fire investigation, Cheryl Casone on headlines now. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Maria, federal agents say that they have recovered a trove of information after they searched the offices of the diving boat company that owned the boat for two days. That information includes training records and business documents. That massive fire last week killed 34 people on board off the Southern California coast.</p><p>Investigators are working to determine that the captain and boat owners followed safety requirements. Well, Elliot management is now calling for major changes in AT&amp;T. The activist shareholder who has invested $3.2 billion into that company says a restructuring could boost its stock to more than $60.00 a share by the end of 2021. Now, Elliott says AT&amp;T needs to be more like Verizon, the competition, aggressively cutting their cost, investing heavily in wireless networks across the world. There is the AT&amp;T premarket read, up more than three-quarters of a percent right now.</p><p>And finally, there is this, some good news. Alex Trebek is back, hosting another season of \"Jeopardy\" after being treated for stage four pancreatic cancer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY: Today, Jeopardy begins its 36th season on the air. And I'm happy to report I'm still here. Our champion --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: He's still there to celebrate the 36th anniversary of the show. He's introducing a new app that's called \"Drive Time.\" Fans can answer trivia questions on the road from the last 35 \"Jeopardy!\" seasons, Maria. And I know that you were part of one of those seasons many years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. I would be so nervous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I will by now. But I was and then I bummed horribly, but I would do it again.</p><p>CASONE: You're going to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was so much fun to be in \"Jeopardy!\" Let's talk AT&amp;T for a second. We know that Elliott Management has taken a stake in AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T is hiring Goldman Sachs. The company is talking about the Time Warner acquisition, Elliot management is, Jack. Your thoughts on AT&amp;T.</p><p>HOUGH: Look, AT&amp;T is not a total mess. The phone business is quite strong, the T.V. business is a little bit of trouble, especially the DirecTV, which is losing subscribers. There is a path here, and the path is streaming. I think they're going to announce some plans to shift customers from, you know, satellite T.V. towards streaming the future. The bottom line is you get a dividend yield of five percent and change at a time when the 10-year Treasury has given you 1.6 percent. There's enough free cash flow to support that dividend long-term. As investors become more comfortable with that fact, I think they're going to move into the stock.</p><p>BARTIROMO: At one point, AT&amp;T was the most -- the single-most widely held stock in America. I don't know if it's still the case in terms of -- but it certainly is very widely held in portfolios. Elliot is saying that this stock could go to 60.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what it said. Elliott Management said we want to drive this stock to $60.00. And I'm wondering --</p><p>HOUGH: Yes, but you own the stock, you say, it can go to 60.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, sure. But what do you think about some of the moves it is talking about tot get it to 60? Would that do it if it were to, in fact, make some changes on the Time Warner deal?</p><p>HOUGH: I think the only move they need is stop the bleeding at DirecTV and show that no matter what you do in the future, that there is going to be the free cash to support that dividend payment. As long as I know that those dividends are going to come, I'll be comfortable with the stock. I think that's what people feel about AT&amp;T.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm sure -- I'm sure that's right because that's why one of the key reasons people buy the stock because of that deal.</p><p>HOUGH: They're not buying it for the growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>HOUGH: At this point, they want the income.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. All right, a quick break. And then, Apple is getting a refresh. The technology giant gears up to unveil a brand new iPhone. When you can expect it on store shelves, coming up. And then, a new era for Alibaba, founder Jack Ma officially steps down as head of one of the world's largest e-commerce companies. We're breaking it down. What comes next? Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are in focus this morning. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, down about 28 points. But really, the news is going to happen later on in the week when the ECB meets on Thursday and the Federal Reserve meets next week. Stocks are back near record levels after weeks of turmoil. Investors still on edge though over trade. Last year, the S&amp;P peaked in late September, only to fall almost 20 percent the rest of the year.</p><p>Joining us right now is Federated Investor Senior Equity Strategist Linda Duessel. And Linda, it is good to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>LINDA DUESSEL, SENIOR EQUITY STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTOR: Well, good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: September can be a tough month for markets. And we've seen the big blow ups in October, as well. What are you expecting rest of the year from this market?</p><p>DUESSEL: Well, we -- as you suggested, we've had some volatility and through the summer here, but we've taken a break. Lots of people are looking more and more positive. And you know, we had some rotation just in the last couple of days into the more value-oriented stocks that maybe indicate that we've been oversold, we piled into the defensive stocks. And now, maybe we're going to go the other way because things are looking perhaps a little bit better. So, we still think we're going to get our 3100 year-end figure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, when you say things are looking a little better, we still have the uncertainty around trade. What in your standpoint is looking better?</p><p>DUESSEL: You know, I personally think that we blame trade for every good day and every bad day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point.</p><p>DUESSEL: And I think -- you know, and I think that -- I really think that our administration would like to kick this can down the road, much as Brexit is getting kicked down the road. Kicking the can down the road is pretty much all the market needs to say, let me look over at earnings. What we're bullish about is earnings. We think that there is no recession on the horizon. And we think that as we make our way to the end of this year, the markets will say, actually, I don't see a recession into next year. And we could continue to build up this market on a reasonable earnings growth, and maybe get that 18 P.E. multiple, which might get us closer to even 3300 next year, if all goes according to plan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well -- go ahead, Jack.</p><p>HOUGH: Linda, hi, it's Jack Hough from Barron's magazine.</p><p>DUESSEL: Hello.</p><p>HOUGH: I could have sworn I heard you use the V word earlier, value. It's been a decade that growth stocks have beaten up on value stocks with very low interest rates, and low interest rates look like they're here to stay. Why wouldn't I just put everything in Amazon and Netflix and forget it right now? Are we going to see a return to value stocks anytime soon?</p><p>DUESSEL: Well, the value stocks are simply a rotation. As we know, the market itself hadn't really gone up. People selling out of growth to go into value as a short-term potential rotation that will unwind itself because it was overdone. I'm not suggesting that I think value -- it's not the time for value. You buy value in the midst of a recession when you think that there's enough -- that there's enough stimulus to get you out of the recession, and we're not in a recession.</p><p>As you suggested, we've been in a growth regime for some time. I see no reason to think that we won't stay in a growth regime. As far as value is concerned, that type of value that where you get the high-quality dividend stocks in the search for yield anywhere, that I think can continue to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even where rates are, you're not seeing any recession then?</p><p>DUESSEL: No, I don't see a recession. What I see is a global deflationary bust potential. And here in the United States, the beautiful thing about the United States is we're a consumer-led economy. And the consumer is doing just fine. I insist to people, you know, go to any restaurant that's very busy and wonder how many people are debating, try to buy that new pair of shoes, because I don't know how this trade war is going to work out. I don't suppose they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I know. I'm just asking --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUESSEL: At least that's not my view.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's got to be a reason that all these central banks that are easing, you got the European Central Bank set to finish its latest policy meeting on Thursday. Many expecting a rate cut there, stimulus measures there at the Federal Reserve meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. Chairman Powell saying that the Fed will continue to act as appropriate to sustain the economy. So, Dagen, here you have all of these central banks stimulating, even if we're not in -- facing off a recession.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And -- but will it do any good, though, Linda? Particularly, maybe you were talking about the U.S. consumer, maybe the U.S. consumer doesn't need it. But with all this stimulus being -- flooding the world economy with money, will it bolster these economies? We talked about the trade fight, but we have the whole of Europe struggling? Will it help?</p><p>DUESSEL: Right. Now, of course, Europe, I've thought for many years, Europe is a basket case, they've got some really big structural issues over there. Cutting interest rates, doesn't seem like it's going to work, or it hasn't really worked at all. And that that is this deflationary bust that I am concerned about. Here in the United States, there's no reason to cut interest rates except for looking at what's going on around the whole wide world. But there, again, I think that we're just attached to this story so very much.</p><p>What I see in terms of growth around the globe is, you know, you may be slipping below that 50 line of demarcation, or you may be toggling around it, or you may be getting lots of stimulus from China, which very well may help the global economy. Maybe we don't have a big trade war with Europe, and things are OK. Why are we panicking here with we need to keep reducing interest rates into more further negative territory? I don't really think that we even need to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So, you're still buying stocks?</p><p>DUESSEL: Stocks are the only place to go, yes. And particularly in the United States, I've said for some time, I'm Team USA. We like U.S. stocks. We like the growth stocks, small cap growth, it looks really, really good, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Linda, good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>DUESSEL: Hey, thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Linda Duessel from Federated. Coming up, Apple's recess. The tech giant expected to unveil its latest iPhone. We're going to take your live to Apple park at a look at what's ahead and coming out of Apple. Then, hit the brakes, Ford's credit rated down -- credit rating has been downgraded this morning to junk, where the automaker fell short, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, September 10th. Your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is Apple's big day today. The technology giant set to announce new iPhones. We're going to take you live to Apple Park at a look what to expect out of Apple this morning. Markets are lower today. Take a look at futures indicating a decline at the start of trading. We're not at the lows of the morning, down just 35 points on the Dow, but the S&amp;P is down 6- 1/2 and the NASDAQ lower by 26.</p><p>We're all waiting on the ECB on Thursday and the Federal Reserve next week Tuesday and Wednesday. Global markets this morning are mixed, European indices mostly lower. FT-100 down 11 points, CAC Quarante in Paris down nine, the DAX Index is up, it is up at 21 points. We are looking forward to the European Central Bank policy decision on Thursday this week. That will move markets.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets finished like this mostly higher, better tone, although China was lower, the producer price index for the month of August fell eight-tenths of a percent year over year. That was the worst contraction since August of 2016.</p><p>Meanwhile, the price of pork soared 47 percent year over year due to the swine fever outbreak and consumer prices in China were up 2.8 percent overnight. North Korea fired off two projectile missiles, this just after saying that it is willing to restart nuclear talks with the United States.</p><p>Alibaba's founder steps down. Why Jack Ma has given up his title of Chairman at one of the world's largest online retailers. And Ford this morning is under pressure. Take a look, the company's credit rating was cut to junk status, it was down better than four percent. This is raising new questions about CEO Jim Hackett's turnaround plan at Ford. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, Apple's annual iPhone event is happening today. The technology giant is expected to release new iPhones, Apple Watch, and other things as well. Susan Li is live at Apple Park in Cupertino, California this morning.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: With more in the day ahead. Susan, good morning to you.</p><p>LI: It's going to be busy out here, Maria. Good morning to you. So, in just about 4-1/2 hours, we do have the big event kicking off at the Steve Jobs Theater behind me here in Apple Park today and it's a very crucial time for the company since we know that iPhone sales have been slowing, so what is the next driver and what'll be the next callous for one of the biggest companies in the world.</p><p>But let's get to the event today, you know, there's been so many rumors flowing here about, it seems like it's expected we're going to get three new iPhone models, longer battery life maybe, more waterproofing hopefully in future, and upgraded cameras as well. Maybe we'll get a new bigger MacBook, maybe we'll get some waterproof AirPods and maybe we'll get a new Apple Watch as well.</p><p>But what we're also looking for is the services since Apple has pointed us to services picking up some of the slack given that people aren't upgrading their phones as much as they used to. Will we get a pricing maybe on their streaming service and when will it actually launch? Since Disney has already given us more of the detailing.</p><p>We (INAUDIBLE) with one of the more bullish analysts on the street, Dan Ives, and he says that this refresh cycle, he says, is being positive for Apple.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH: I think ultimately, this upgrade cycle is extremely significant for Apple and really Cupertino going forward because you have a third of the installed base, about 350 million users today that are in the window of and upgrade opportunity. And when you get iPhone 11 in terms of the camera technology and the pent up demand, we believe this is going to be a significant upgrade that the street is underestimating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LI: Apple's hoping for that as well since we know that there are 1-1/2 billion iPhones around the world. The installed base is at around 900 million phones. And as we know Apple, seeing some iPhone sales slip in the past, a few quarters over the past year with China being a problem, and coxed in this U.S.-China trade war, back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Susan. Thank you so much. Susan Li is in Cupertino this morning. I want to turn to foreign policy and in particular, Afghanistan first.</p><p>President Trump speaking out yesterday on his decision to end peace talks with the Taliban.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We had a meeting scheduled, it was my idea. When I heard very simply that they killed one of our soldiers and 12 other innocent people, I said, \"There's no way I'm meeting on that basis. There's no way I'm meeting.\" They're dead as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The president called off the meeting after the group claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack that killed a U.S. service member.</p><p>And joining me right now is former Deputy National Security Adviser under President Trump, K.T. McFarland. And K.T., it's good to see you again.</p><p>K.T. MCFARLAND, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction to this.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Yes, sure, absolutely, call those talks off.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Why were they scheduled in the first place?</p><p>MCFARLAND: Well -- I mean my assumption is they thought they had a deal, that Trump thought he had a deal, and unless you have a signed, sealed, and delivered deal, you don't do anything in the United States with the Taliban, you particularly don't do it at Camp David.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCFARLAND: But I think he was right to cancel it, because number one, let them think, you know, why should they think they've got the upper hand?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCFARLAND: And then the second thing is let's have them think about what life is going to be like when the United States pulls out and we pull out all of our aid. Then they're just going to go at it with each other, the Afghan Government, every tribe, the Taliban.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's the thing, I mean do we want that to stoke even more upset and more, you know, issues on the ground? Maybe the Taliban wants the U.S. out.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Of course they do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCFARLAND: They want to go at it. Now look, what's our interest? I'm not -- I don't care about the Taliban, I don't even care about the Afghan Government. I mean they've been corrupt and incompetent for 20 years. What I care about is killing Americans and if they all agree, if the Taliban says, or we should say to the Taliban, \"Do whatever you want, kill each other, that's fine, make peace, that's fine, too, but don't you dare kill Americans in Afghanistan, do not kill Americans overseas, and certainly do not come and kill Americans in the United States homeland and don't let any of your buddies do it either because if that happens, you will not get another dime of American aid under any circumstances any time any place and we are going to come after you.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears, ask you about this op-ed in the Journal, \"Will Trump sellout the U.S. on Huawei?\" This is a piece by George Soros in The Wall Street Journal, and George Soros is basically praising the president. I was pretty surprised at this. He's been a detractor of the president for a long time and he writes this, \"Will Trump sell out the U.S. on Huawei,\" writing, \"the administration rightly declared Beijing a strategic rival and placed Huawei, China's multinational telecom giant, on the Commerce Department's so-call entity list as a national security threat.</p><p>This prevents U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei, but it -- he appears desperate for a deal with President Xi to bolster the stock market and the economy to improve his chances at reelection, putting his electoral interests ahead of America's interests. He urges the president not to let Huawei off the hook or use it as a bargaining chip like he did with Huawei's rival, ZTE, last year. You think the president's doing that?</p><p>MCFARLAND: No. I think that what's -- Soros, I almost never agree with, but the beginning of his article, I do agree with, we shouldn't give that up because that is the crown jewel. But he's right in that the most important relationship the United States has is with China and it's one that finally having a president who stood up to the Chinese.</p><p>We've been betting ripped on for 20 years by the Chinese over trade and tariff agreements, subsidizing their economy at the expense of outs, and all in the hopes that once China got modernized and wealthy, that they would be our best friends, they would be an open society and they would trade fairly. None of that has happened and so finally a president's standing up and it's the right time to do it, and it may be the last time to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what should be done at this point? Because, I mean obviously, markets want a deal, the economy seems to be slowing around this uncertainty over a deal, and yet the president has changed his conversation on China. He has been very articulate in terms of the national security risks, so should we forget a deal?</p><p>MCFARLAND: I think we go for the tough -- this is the moment to have the deal. The Chinese economy is slowing, Xi Jinping has problems in Hong Kong with those demonstrators and he finally has an American president who doesn't back down. We are in the best position we've been in for decades, the economy is terrific, Trump already has trade deals with Canada, with Mexico, South Korea, now Japan, and potentially Britain.</p><p>I think Trump should take all of those trade deals he has in his pocket, and take all those countries to the Chinese and say, \"We want a new deal. We are all getting ripped off from you and we have for decades, and we now want another relationship. Now we don't want to screw you, we want a fair and reciprocal relationship, but the days of the United States subsidizing your economy are over.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You make a good point but, you know, do we have enough allies on this subject against China? Because last time I checked, Huawei infrastructure was all over Europe.</p><p>MCFARLAND: That's right. OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do the Europeans not get it that there are back doors in Huawei equipment where data is their going right back to the -- to the Beijing government?</p><p>MCFARLAND: If China controls the technologies of the future, which is their goal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCFARLAND: By 2025, they want to be dominant at -- in all 10 technologies of the future. If we allow Huawei to be the dominant platform for internet transactions and the way we all now communicate with each other, we might as well send it all to the Chinese government because that means the Chinese will control all communications with anybody everywhere in the world, and what does that allow them to do? To do exactly what they're doing to their own people, which is listening to everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I mean, that's what's happening with artificial intelligence, the Chinese are tracking their people --</p><p>MCFARLAND: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- you know, tracking their citizens with facial recognition and using A.I. to do it. A.I.'s being used in the military as well.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are your thoughts about A.I. in the military and China being perhaps ahead of the U.S. in that regard?</p><p>MCFARLAND: OK. Two things. One, the Chinese are using all of this facial recognition software algorithms. They're using it to track every one of their own people because they need it. They want to have a complete authoritarian state.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But -- and they have it.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Everybody's at Big Brother and they have it now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they've got it, yes.</p><p>MCFARLAND: Now what they do to their own people, they're -- they would happily do to the rest of the world. As far as the United States and our A.I. technology or any of those advanced technologies, I think we've dropped the ball for 20 years because we've been fighting wars in the Middle East that we couldn't win, they have consumed our attention, and our resources.</p><p>I think it is time to turn around and invest like a Manhattan project, invest in American technologies, because unless we are the leader in these technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence, all these different technologies that the Chinese are trying to beg, borrow, or steal from us, then we're in a very difficult position 10 years from now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Well, that's just the -- this is the issue. K.T. it's great to see you.</p><p>MCFARLAND: It's great to see you, too. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. K.T. McFarland joining us there. Coming up, Brexit uncertainty as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffers another setback. Stuart Varney will weigh in. And then Ford flashing its hazards, its credit rating was downgraded to junk status. Where the automaker fell short coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump and British Prime Boris Johnson have a chance to put their stamp on the special relationship. Joining me right now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Yes, it's a good point, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I suspect you're laughing at me under the surface there, Maria. But I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No. I think you're right.</p><p>VARNEY: It's not the same as the old special relationship Margaret Thatcher-Ronald Reagan, it's more of a parallel which I hope continues, quite frankly. Have you noticed that on both sides of the Atlantic, the media detests the Prime Minister and the President of the United States? There's a parallel.</p><p>Have you noticed that on both sides of the Atlantic, the elites detest the Prime Minister, Boris, and the President, President Trump? And both sides of the Atlantic have the commonality of a very strong economy. Most of our viewers probably don't know this, but the Brits just reported a 3.8 percent unemployment rate and a four percent gain in wages, it's almost exactly the same as the United States, they share something in common right there.</p><p>And I -- look, they both have super powerful rivals, Boris Johnson's going up against the European Union, President Trump's going up against China, there's all these parallels going on, which suggests a special relationship. And as I said, I hope it continues because if the Brits can get out of Europe, we can then have a special trade deal with the United States. I keep saying \"we.\" I mean they can have a special trade deal with the United States.</p><p>You think -- I think there is a parallel here, maybe not a special relationship but definitely a parallel worth pursuing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and I think that that's in the conversation right now. I mean you know --</p><p>VARNEY: I think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- the president has talked much about the U.K. being at the top of the line --</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- when they are ready.</p><p>VARNEY: Unlike the Obama years when America -- Britain would be in the back of the line, if they went through with Brexit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>VARNEY: My, how time's changing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Stu, I know you'll have more in 10 minutes. We'll see you top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY: See you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins every day 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Join Stuart after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, it is a new era for Alibaba. The founder, Jack Ma, officially steps down as the head of the one of the world's largest e-commerce companies, we'll break down that, what's the impact.</p><p>Then rough roads ahead, Ford's credit rating was downgraded to junk status. Where the automaker fell short after this break. Back in minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are watching shares of Ford down better than four percent in the premarket after bad credit rating. Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details there. And a market that looks like it's opening flat this morning, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, so who knows what'll happen? But that's what it's looking like right now. Let's talk about Ford taking a big hit. You said down almost four percent, that's worse than it was even 30 minutes ago. Why Moody's downgrading Ford credit to junk status, they say weak EPS, cash generation, as ford restructures the company's spending about $7 billion on that restructuring and taking $11 billion in charges.</p><p>Ford for its point of view says that their business and balance sheet is solid, we did not get a response to our questions to Ford or Moody's this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jack Ma, the richest man in China is going to retire, step down from Alibaba, the empire he built. You can see shares of that company are down this morning. It was a long planned succession scheme.</p><p>And Facebook, big problem here, they're facing massive damages in a lawsuit in San Francisco over the Cambridge Analytica embarrassment, what you want to say, breach of all of our personal data. The judge in that case in San Francisco saying that Facebook's interpretation of this is that they can use their information pretty much any way they want to, that they gather on the social media web site. He disagrees.</p><p>And also Treasury U.S. Undersecretary for Terrorism saying that Facebook will have to comply with U.S. laws regarding money laundering and terrorism as it gets ready to launch Libra cryptocurrency. You can see those shares down as well today. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you so much. We will watch that as well. And, Jack, your thoughts on these tech companies in terms of this big antitrust fight.</p><p>HOUGH: Yes. Step back for a minute on big tech. The five biggest companies in America, they're all tech companies, they're all really software companies when it comes right down to it, and it's not -- I don't see a price bubble there because they're not so expensive, but they're 28 percent of U.S. profit, that's close to the peak for the financial sector during the height of the housing bubble.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOUGH: Bank of America points out that's a level that can often signal major market peaks. I don't know how the -- how the burst -- if that's a bubble, I don't know how it bursts for tech because some of these are still growing their top lines by 20 percent, that profit bubble, if you want to call it that, it's interesting that that's happening in a time when these companies are under the gun from regulators in all sorts of directions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, a lot of conversation about this rotation going on on Wall Street right now and whether or not the valuations in tech are going to mean the rotation skips over tech.</p><p>HOUGH: Yes. I'm looking for what could slow the profit growth for some of these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. All right. We'll take a break. When we get back, we've got final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are going to open lower this morning. You just saw futures, we are -- we are waiting on the ECB Thursday and the Fed next week, down 38 on the Dow. We'll see what comes out of it. Couple of name stocks though are actually moving much more than the averages. Let's get some final thoughts from this all-star panel. Jack Hough.</p><p>HOUGH: Well, we're going to -- we're going to get lower rates. Who benefits from that? I don't -- maybe we don't have any more stimulative effect anymore, but I'm looking at home builders. Mortgage rates are attractive but, millennials are reaching these peak years when they might be moving out of the parents' house, buying houses. I see good signs that millennials could drive home building. I'm looking at D.R. Horton which I think has a good entry level product.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you --</p><p>HOUGH: For homebuilders.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You think these rock-bottom mortgage rates, actually they haven't kept up with other rates, but still, they're low, is that going to provide some stimulus for the housing market?</p><p>HOUGH: I think the general homebuyer, a quarter point is not going to make a difference, but I think it's happening at just the right time for millennials who could be the next big driver for the homebuilder market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tiana, what are you looking at?</p><p>LOWE: So we spoke with Senator David Perdue earlier. Late breaking news last now is that he's a primary -- or he's a Democratic challenger for his re-election. Jon Ossoff, you may remember, because he spent six times the amount that Karen Handel did and still lost to her despite raising $24 million. I would say that Stacey Abrams would be a compelling candidate for the senate race except that would mean that she'd have to abdicate her slot as governor of Georgia. But she still maintains that she won.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you -- what do you think happens?</p><p>LOWE: I think Perdue wins re-election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>LOWE: We keep on hearing about Georgia's going to go blue. It hasn't happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, it has not happened. I'll point out that the story about the e-cigarette makers and Juul in particular with the Food and Drug Administration going after Juul, saying you can't claim that e-cigarettes are safer than traditional cigarettes, also feeling the heat from the Federal Trade Commission and even the first lady tweeting about the danger of e-cigarettes and the nicotine addiction. I would pay attention to that because it's getting -- that company it is getting it from all sides.</p><p>And I think Rob Gronkowski's on Stuart's show coming up, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and by the way, we also had a warning from the FDA saying while we investigate this, stop vaping.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean this is a serious stuff. Great show, everybody. Great to see you. Thanks for joining us. Have a good day, everybody. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now. Stu, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: Good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019091003cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1D-SKC1-JB20-G2M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7631\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DEWA</classCode><className>ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

And we at Georgetown Law are very pleased to be hosting this event. a And I think it's very fitting that we're here. Georgetown Law's connection to antitrust and consumer protection is longstanding and very deep. Dean Robert Pitofsky served as Bureau Director, commissioner, and then Chair of the FTC over his long distinguished career. </p><p>Numerous agency leaders have been graduates of Georgetown Law; most recently, our current FTC chair, Joe Simons, we'll be hearing from him shortly. Also commissioner Nominees Christine Wilson, former DOJ Assistant Attorney General, Christine Varney. Monique Fortenberry, Deputy Executive Director of the FTC. </p><p>We're very proud of having educated so many of the leaders of the FTC. And among our current faculty, David Vladeck, who is at the end of our panel today, was director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection.</p><p>Howard Shelanski was director of the Bureau of Economics. Professor Steve Salop was both a senior official of the FTC's Bureau of Economics and a mentor to Chairman Simons and Christine Wilson. </p><p>Actually, the chair, the chair and I were just talking about how his time in Georgetown had really prepared him in every way that you had. We're just very proud. </p><p>And it's appropriate and it's particularly appropriate I think because in some ways these hearings are intended to follow the path that was set by the FTC's global competition and innovation hearings which were held in 1995 when Bob, Bob Pitofsky, was the FTC's chair. </p><p>So we can look forward over the course of these hearings to a serious, insightful, and interesting set of discussion, some of the most pressing questions facing antitrust and consumer protection policy.</p><p>FURMAN:  And don't take my thunder, okay?</p><p>TREANOR:  Okay. Let me just kind of -- don't expect too much until you hear from the chair who will bring up your expectations. The FTC will be continuing its hearings and locations across the country. And over the next several months, it'll be exploring new ideas and approaches to its historic statutory mission. </p><p>And for those of you who want to hear more about the antitrust issues of today right here at Georgetown Law, our global antitrust symposium which is now in its 12th year and is one of the most prominent antitrust conferences outside of the ABA Spring Meeting will take place this room in about two weeks, so.</p><p>Thank you all for coming. I want to congratulate the FTC for its initiative and hard work in organizing these public hearings. And now, I'd like to call to the podium the director of the Office of Policy Planning, Bilal Sayyed.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SAYYED:  Okay. I won't take long except to thank everybody for coming and to tell people a little bit about what we'll do today. We'll turn to the chair in just a minute. But I just want to tell everybody this event is being webcast. The webcast will be posted to the FTC's website shortly after we conclude. This session is being transcribed and the transcript will be posted quickly. </p><p>Tomorrow's planned session -- excuse me -- tomorrow's planned session has been cancelled because of concern about the weather, but it will be rescheduled and the, we'll make the effort to reschedule it here at Georgetown fairly, fairly quickly.</p><p>Some of my FTC colleagues will be passing out question cards. If members of the audience have questions that they'd like to put to the panel, they should write them on the card and raise their hand, and we'll come collect them. </p><p>We have an open comment process. And so we encourage people to continue to comment. That comment process will be open through probably the end of February. </p><p>But we encourage people to comment on what they hear today, both what is presented and what is discussed. And then, all presentations made here will be posted on the website. And as I noted, the transcript of the session will be posted, so I'd say with that, I'll turn it over to the chairman and he'll kick us off to get started. </p><p>SIMONS:  All right. Thank you so much, Bilal. Good morning, everyone and welcome. </p><p>On behalf of all of us at the Federal Trade Commission, I want to thank you for coming to the opening of our Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century. Our goal is to make these hearings as informative, insightful, and consequential as possible, covering some of the most important competition and consumer protection policy and enforcement issues of the day. We believe we are situated to do just that. </p><p>These hearings, as has been discussed already, are modeled on the ones that were held back in 1995 by then-Chairman Bob Pitofsky, who in his opening remarks said at the time, \"These hearings are designed to restore the tradition of linking law enforcement with a continuing review of economic conditions to ensure that the laws make sense in light of contemporary competitive conditions.\" We intend to continue that same tradition with these hearings. </p><p>We are very fortunate to have a large group of highly respected participants representing a diverse range of views, including academics, practitioners, enforcement officials and representatives from public interest groups. </p><p>And I am proud that we are opening the hearings at the Georgetown University Law Center, where Chairman Pitofsky spent much of his career when he was not otherwise at the FTC, and where I received my initial antitrust education to a significant extent from Professor Pitofsky. </p><p>So, today, I want to talk about why the commission is holding these hearings. Almost 30 years ago, I came to the FTC, the first of my three times here at the tail end of the commission's adoption of a significantly revised approach to antitrust enforcement. This change, which began in 1981, and was implemented to a large extent by Tim Muris who is two or three people to my left here. </p><p>This change, which began in 1981, reflected new learning that had begun to influence the Supreme Court antitrust doctrine. It was primarily driven by the scholarship of academics; the most prominent -- Phil Areeda, Don Turner, Frank Easterbrook, Richard Posner, and Robert Bork, were associated with either Harvard University or the University of Chicago. </p><p>They applied microeconomic principles to antitrust questions and paid attention to empirical work, which led them to conclude that a lot of pre-1970s antitrust case law was inconsistent with rational, pro-competitive, and economically beneficial behavior. </p><p>By the time I left the agency for the first time in 1989, application of microeconomic principles and simple economic models was routine and encouraged. Notwithstanding some initial criticism, the Clinton administration's antitrust leadership, including Bob Pitofsky, Anne Bingham, and Joel Klein, largely adhered to the same principles. </p><p>So, when I returned to the commission as director of the Bureau of Competition in 2001, there was substantial support for and acceptance of the antitrust reforms that had been initiated 20 or so years prior. In other words, there was a general consensus on how we ought to think about antitrust enforcement and policy. </p><p>But now, at the beginning of my third stint at the commission, things have shifted. The broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged in at least two ways. </p><p>First, some recent economic literature concludes that the U.S. economy has grown more concentrated and less competitive over the last 20 to 30 years, which happens to correlate with the timing of the change to a less enforcement-oriented antitrust policy beginning in the early 1980s. These concerns merit serious attention, and they will be part of today's discussion. </p><p>Second, some are debating the very nature of antitrust itself, calling for antitrust enforcers to take account of policy goals beyond consumer welfare. Inequality, labor issues, and excessive political power are perhaps the main examples. </p><p>We will discuss some of these suggestions during later sessions. These concerns raise a challenge for antitrust agency leadership, the courts, and legislators to think hard about whether significant adjustments to antitrust doctrine, enforcement decisions, and law would be beneficial to our country, in order to accommodate these concerns.</p><p>As I noted in announcing the hearings, it is important that the antitrust enforcement agencies be at the forefront in thinking about these issues, not bystanders to this debate. To that end, today and continuing through the fall and early winter, we have invited interested parties to discuss these issues, both through public comment and public sessions, with us and each other. </p><p>We do this with the goal of understanding whether our current enforcement of policies are on the right track, or on the wrong track or on the wrong track, and if they're on the wrong track, what should we do to improve them.</p><p>I approach all of these issues with a very open mind, very much willing to be influenced by what I see and hear at these hearings. I am old enough to have witnessed in my own career dramatic changes in antitrust policy and enforcement. These changes have largely been driven by developments within the economic community, which were then adopted by the legal community. The movement by the economists, however, has not always been in the same direction. </p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, a substantial body of empirical economic work purported to show significant anticompetitive effects at relatively low levels of concentration. In 1968, the DOJ issued merger guidelines based on these studies. But just about the time the guidelines were issued, the economic studies on which they were based were being substantially discredited. </p><p>As a result, the agencies over time raised the concentration levels at which mergers were seen as problematic. A more recent example where developments in economics increased the level of successful merger enforcement involves hospitals. </p><p>In the 1990s, the government lost a large number of hospital merger cases in a row, and the agencies considered whether to give up on hospital merger enforcement. Fortunately, we did not. Instead, we engaged in empirical economic studies that demonstrated the anticompetitive effects of hospital mergers, and we revitalized our hospital merger enforcement program. </p><p>So the developments in economics can suggest, depending on the circumstances, that our enforcement has either been too aggressive or too lax. This episode involving hospital merger enforcement really drove this point home for me personally. The use of economics should not be thought of as a one-way ratchet, only driving down the level of antitrust enforcement. </p><p>Good economics might point us toward more or less enforcement, depending on the facts and the analysis in front of us at the time. In my view, basing antitrust policy and enforcement decisions on an ideological viewpoint, whether from the left or the right, is a mistake. Whether or not we expand antitrust beyond the consumer welfare standard, I would rather make policy and enforcement decisions based on the best evidence and analysis, including in particular, empirically grounded economic analysis that enables the analysts to weigh the costs and benefits broadly defined to help determine the best approach. </p><p>My hope is that these hearings will significantly improve our ability to do so, and help to bring about a new and improved consensus among our antitrust stakeholders.</p><p>But we are not focused solely on competition issues today or throughout the hearings. The strength and direction of the agency's consumer protection mission is also something that we are going to explore at some length at these hearings. </p><p>Today, our most significant and difficult consumer protection issues often revolve around the use and abuse of technological capabilities not likely imaged during Bob Pitofsky's chairmanship. </p><p>As a result, we will be having multiple sessions on data security issues. And our upcoming hearings on platforms, big data, and artificial intelligence will address consumer protection issues, including privacy, as well as competition issues. </p><p>Before closing, I want to thank not only the participants in these sessions, but the many groups and individuals who have filed comments in response to our initial hearings notice. We have received over 500 non-duplicative comments, many of substantial length and thoughtfulness. We are reading them and considering them carefully. We expect more comments as we proceed, and I encourage those interested to comment on what you hear today and throughout the hearings. </p><p>I also want to thank our co-sponsor and host, the team at the Georgetown University Law Center, for helping us pull this initial effort together. I also want to recognize the staff of the FTC for their efforts in both preparing for the substance of this event and undertaking all the logistics to bring us together. </p><p>I, and all the commissioners, are grateful for the work of so many people both within the FTC and outside the FTC, who are engaged in making this a successful effort. Thank you for attending, and I hope you enjoy the hearings. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll turn it over to Bilal.</p><p>SAYYED:  Okay. So, I'll just take a few minutes the panelists and then try to get out of the way, in no -- in no particular order, or maybe some particular order.</p><p>Jason Furman will speak first. Jason is presently a professor at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, and was formerly the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.</p><p>Tim Muris, just to Jason's left, it was most -- is presently a senior counsel at Sidley Austin but was also chairman of the FTC from 2001 to 2004. And previously, director of both of the Bureau of Competition and the Bureau of Consumer Protection but not of course at the same time. </p><p>Just to the left of Tim is Alysa Hutnik. She's a partner at Kelley Drye, and really an expert in consumer protection law. </p><p>Immediately to my left is Jim Rill. Jim is senior counsel at Baker Botts presently, but was head of the Antitrust Division for about 1989 to 1992. </p><p>And then we also have Janet McDavid, who was not a head of the either agency but certainly is one who has been considered to head either, maybe even both agencies, had in the past. Jan is a partner at Hogan Lovells. </p><p>And, finally but by no means least, Professor Vladeck, who serves as director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection just a few short years ago. And, of course, is a professor here at Georgetown.</p><p>So, with that I'm going to turn it over to Jason. And just remind everybody if they have questions, raise your hands, pass your questions over to some of my colleagues who are collecting question cards.</p><p>FURMAN:  Thank you so much. And I thought Chairman Simons' remarks were perfect in three respects. One is you want somebody to be open-minded coming to this question, because thinking really is evolving very rapidly. </p><p>Second, he had a really excellent capsule history of antitrust thinking, and third, I think he made it clear that he was deferring completely to economists in how he was proceeding on this matter.</p><p>I'm a little bit of an interloper on this panel. I think I'm one of the only economists. And anyone that knows any economics would know I'm even more of an interloper than that, because my main focus has been on macroeconomic issues, labor market issues, inequality, not on industrial organization and antitrust narrowly defined. </p><p>When I was chairing the Council of Economic Advisers, I came to this issue partly out of what I'll now admit was paranoia. There was a crime that had been committed and we were looking for suspects. </p><p>The crime was low productivity growth and high inequality, something clearly going wrong in the economy. Productivity growth being about a percentage point lower over the last decade than it had been previously; at the same time, high levels of inequality continued to move higher. </p><p>And those were the two factors that were underlying the slowdown of the growth and income for the typical families that I think is the central challenge for economic policy. So, what can you do to raise productivity growth, to reduce inequality?</p><p>And we were looking around a lot of different suspects. And just to be clear, there is more than one cause of this set of phenomena. But one thing we alighted on was this area. Part of what motivated it was a few sub-facts under those two big ones. And let me just list a few of them. </p><p>One, a number of economists had documented that throughout the economy, there was less churn and dynamism. Fewer businesses being created, fewer older businesses, larger businesses increasingly dominating the economy, fewer people moving from job to job. So, a little bit more of a sclerosis than we like to think is the case for the U.S. economy. </p><p>There was, in terms of inequality -- I'm sorry -- reduction in investment, a trend down in investment. Partly, that's shift to intangibles, but not completely, and trying to understand that. </p><p>On the inequality side, there was a rise -- fall in the reduction. I'm sorry. A fall in the share of income going to labor. And, finally, an increase in markups in the rate of return to capital relative to the safe rate of return. And an increasingly skewed rate of return to capital, with some very successful companies having persistently very high returns, much higher than the median, relative to the median than they had before. </p><p>So, this was a fact pattern about aggregate data that made us to look beneath the aggregates in terms of what was going on at the firm and the industry level. </p><p>Now, one way to look at what's going on in the firm and the industry level is to use aggregate industrial data, and to divide up the economy into 10 industries, into 800 industries, and look within each one of those what's going on in concentration.</p><p>And then, numbers did that -- a number of people did that. Grion et. al., Archer et. al. -- we did at the Council of Economic Advisers, and you saw it in the press as well and places like The Economist. And we generally find that in about 75 percent of industries defined in this way concentration increased. </p><p>Now, as the antitrust community was quick to point out, there is some dispute as to whether it was 35 years ago people realized this was an idiotic procedure, or 50 years ago that people had realized this was an idiotic procedure. But that these aren't antitrust markets.</p><p>Now, the people that put this forward from the very beginning, including ourselves, understood that. No one would bring in an antitrust case based on these types of aggregate data. Everything has pluses and minuses. </p><p>But we're trying to look at economy-wide phenomenon and really needed to use economy-wide data because the type of relevant antitrust market analysis we have for some parts of the economy -- and I'll talk about it in a moment, but we don't have it for all of them, and can't really aggregate up, synthesize, and add it all together. </p><p>When looking at this macro data, I think the question is not ex ante, what do we think about it? Of course, these are the relevant markets for antitrust. It's does it work, does it help explain some of what we're trying to explain. </p><p>And subsequent research by Gutierrez [ph] and Philepon [ph], among others, has found actually that as this aggregate level, increases in concentration are tied to reductions in business investment, are tied to reductions in R&amp;D by business, and also are associated with rising markups in those industries and rising rates of profit in those industries. So, you see these different measures seemed to, in a broad sense, work and explain some of what we are interested in.</p><p>The next set of measures that one could look at aren't the aggregate macro data but are doing what you would do in an antitrust case, which is looking at a particular relevant market properly defined, and asking is the level of concentration high? Has the level of concentration increased? </p><p>There have been a range of studies, some done by the FTC, a number done by economists for a whole lot of markets. Ad services, health insurers, hospitals, refrigerators, airlines, telecommunications, beer, all of which have consistently found very high levels of concentration, and in many cases, rising levels of concentration well in excess of the levels that would trigger a review if there was a merger under the merger guidelines. </p><p>Moreover, a new strand of research, one that is still very new, I wouldn't necessarily go and make policy on it with certainty tomorrow, but one that so far as turning out to be empirically more convincing than, frankly, I would have expected on common ownership finds that when the same few companies own all of the airlines and own all of the banks that that increases concentration above and beyond what you would measure if you thought that American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta were three different companies, when you realized they're all owned by the same companies. </p><p>And you see that in a variety of data including remarkably at sort of a root by root level in terms of the pricing, so there's a wealth of microeconomic, more traditional antitrust evidence for this. </p><p>So the question now is why have we seen this increase in concentration? And what are its consequences? I don't think there's any single answer to the why question. </p><p>In some cases, the increase in concentration may be for good reasons and reflect increases in efficiency, increases in competition that weed out some of the less effective firms, globalization, and the like. This is an explanation that's been stressed by economists including David Ardor [ph], et al. </p><p>That's the story that probably works pretty well in the retail sector where it wasn't that there were a few big mergers. It wasn't that there was some collusive common ownership. But the company Wal-Mart figured out how to have better supply chain management and grew. And then Amazon did the same online. And as a result, there's more concentration in that sector, and it reflects that increase in efficiency. </p><p>For a lot of the economy, though, the story is much less benign than that one, and it gets to -- has its roots in what Chairman Simons described as a large change in the way we thought about antitrust. </p><p>Kwoka has documented for example the FTC's oversight challenge looking into mergers, used to look at six to five, now we'd never look at something like that. So you have changes in antitrust enforcement. Some of it may be grounded in other parts of the economy. </p><p>We should be looking also at things like regulations and rent-seeking that allow companies to create rules that benefit themselves at the expense of others; certainly, in questions like intellectual property. And I think a lot of these competition issues are about antitrust, but they go more broadly. </p><p>And then if you look at labor markets, you want to look at occupational licensing, something the FTC has been at the forefront of for a long time, land use restrictions and a whole bunch of ways that reduce competition in the economy.</p><p>So, I think you have this combination of good reasons, bad reasons. And then you have some that are ambiguous. If you look at something like the tech sector, you've seen a lot of innovation, but you also have platforms with network effects that lend themselves to scale that might say that it's efficient to have a single producer at scale. </p><p>It's also efficient to have a single municipal water company, but that doesn't mean we would want to let it go off and charge whatever it wanted to charge. I'm not saying that we want to regulate technology the same way we regulate municipal water. It's much more complicated. And it's an issue that I'm currently looking at as head of an expert panel for the UK government reviewing digital competition by trying to understand the combination of good reasons that you've seen companies grow with innovation and competition and bad.</p><p>I want to talk about why we care about this. Traditionally in economics, this is just about prices, and it's about prices being higher. I think that issue matters. Airlines prices and cellphone bills are higher in the United States than they are in Europe, because European competition enforcers have been more vigorous. They have more players in those industries than we do. So, I think the price issue matters. The price issue may be a lot smaller than some of the others I talked about. One is innovation, what this does to the incentives for business investment for R&amp;D, for productivity growth. </p><p>There's a longstanding debate between a review of Arrow and Schumpeter in economics about the impact of competition on innovation. But there's a number of ways in which it could be deleterious.</p><p>And then, finally, inequality. And there's been, at the same time that there's been this increase thinking about these types of macro issues in competition, there are also has been in labor markets as well. And that's grounded in the observation that every employment relationship has a bit of monopoly power a and a bit of rent that's being divided between the two because there's a cost of finding a new job and shifting a job, and so market power matters a lot.</p><p>If you have one hospital in town, it's a lot harder for a nurse to threaten to move to another hospital to get a pay raise. If you have two hospitals in town, it's much easier for the two of them to collude tacitly or even illegally to hold down the pay of nurses.</p><p>Even in the fast-food industry, there's evidence that anti-poaching and non-compete agreements have a deleterious impact on workers' bargaining power, help to hold down wages, and have been part of the reason that the labor share has been reduced. </p><p>In summary, I think this evidence is coming from a variety of different places, and a variety of different perspectives. If you're trying to ask a question about the economy as a whole, you're not going to have one definitive data source or one definitive study that's going to answer that question. You have to take a collage of views. And I think that collage involves looking at the pattern of what we've seen in the data that I talked about in terms of falling labor share, falling investment, rising markups.</p><p>Looking at the industry level and seeing whether those phenomenon are industry by industry tied to concentration, and they are. Looking in a deeper, more careful way where we can, and we can -- we've done that in a lot of different industries. </p><p>And then no single story comes out of this, but on balance and on average, this does seem to add up to a reduction in competition, a reduction in dynamism. And one that I think that we need to be concerned about and think about what ways we need to update our policies to address if we want to have more investment, more dynamism, more productivity growth, less inequality, in addition of course to the traditional focus on lower prices for consumers. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SAYYED:  Well, thank you, Jason. We're going to turn to Tim Muris now. I will note that although Jason is the only economist on this panel, we have if I count correctly, five economists; 100 percent of the panel, on our second panel in the afternoon. So, we are trying to balance just about everything in these hearings. Right. Okay. </p><p>MURIS:  Well, thank you, Bilal. I'm honored to be here, once again following in the giant steps of my friend and predecessor, Robert Pitofsky.</p><p>We first met in 1976. But it was 1988 working on this second Kirkpatrick Commission that we realized we shared a vision for the FTC. </p><p>Not that Bob and I always agreed, of course. Minutes after being sworn in as chair, I announced to a somewhat nervous reaction that there was indeed a new majority. I said there was no longer majority of New York Yankee fans on the commission. </p><p>The FTC has enjoyed great success for decades. And I'll address a few topics here. First, what durable success means for an agency like the FTC; then the vision that Bob and I shared that has led to the agency's success.</p><p>Next, I consider recent challenges from two Ps, paternalism in consumer protection, and populism in antitrust. Because both of these isms once dominated FTC work particularly in the 1970s. I discuss history. I lived through the 1970s, and the decade was disastrous for the FTC. Nostalgia expressed explicitly in recent literatures is misplaced. I have no desire to relive those years and neither should you.</p><p>I'm submitting a longer paper with lots of footnotes, like lawyers do. And I'll make a lot of assertions for which those footnotes provide support. But starting with success, it has to be built on something more ephemeral than headlines. A definition that is less ephemeral starts with the recognition that an agency needs a clear understanding of and support for its core mission among its constituents. </p><p>Second, this core must derive from a vision clearly shared not just today but enduring -- enduring through electoral cycles. Over time, perhaps, decades, stakeholders adjudge favorably the core mission of successful agencies. </p><p>Finally, a successful public institution needs a coherent strategy. The positive agenda must direct the institution at all levels from the staff to the managers to agency leaders. Without a general strategy and positive agenda, an agency merely reacts.</p><p>The FTC has such an agenda, the heart of which is to attack practices that harm consumers by hampering the competitive process and violating the basic rules of exchange. The FTC's success in large part reflects this shared vision. </p><p>Take antitrust first. Until recently, antitrust reflected bipartisan cooperation. Disagreements existed in close cases but there was widespread agreement that antitrust should protect consumers, that economic analysis should case selection, and that horizontal cases were central to enforcement.</p><p>Regarding cases, Robert Bork once remarked that firms either make war on each other or they make peace. This framework reflects the consensus that the most harmful practices occur when firms stop competing vigorously; making peace to hurt consumers. Horizontal mergers with likely anti-competitive effects are one fertile area for firms to make peace. Firms also make peace through non-merger conduct. As with mergers, of course, collaboration is not itself sufficient to assess consumer welfare.</p><p>Many collaborations are beneficial. And the peacemaking of most concern lacks offsetting efficiencies, what antitrust lawyers call naked horizontal agreements. The FTC has pioneered development of the law here, especially among professions, generic drugs, and the process to analyze collaboration. </p><p>In rare instances, a single firm with market power can exclude competition to harm consumers. The 2001 Microsoft case, probably the most famous recent example, it's, those kind of cases are important to any antitrust program. </p><p>A particularly fruitful category of troubling single-firm conduct involves misleading the government. Misuse of courts and government agencies is effective way, this rent-seeking, to stifle competition. Such strategies are not limited to single firms, of course. They're the cheap exclusion which is a felicitous phrase that the people at the FTC have invented. </p><p>Two antitrust immunities helped protect this rent-seeking, NOR and state action. Some courts have broadly interpreted these immunities for -- and for decades, 40 years in fact, the FTC has sought to circumscribe both with three Supreme Court victories and state action. </p><p>On NOR, the agency saved consumers billions of dollars at the gas pump in Unocal and provided large benefits for pharmaceutical consumers in Bristol-Myers Squibb among many other successes. </p><p>The vision for consumer protection is identical to that in antitrust. When competition alone cannot defer dishonesty, private legal rights help, there's government-developed common law. When the market forces are insufficient and common laws ineffective, there's a role for a public agency. And consumer protection and the antitrust naturally complement each other. Under the FTC's positive agenda, robust competition is the first and most important way to protect consumers. </p><p>And the FTC's role is crucial but it's a referee, not the star player. The foundation and core of consumer protection is the systematic attack on fraud begun in 1981. And the FTC has continued to expand in each administration the fraud program.</p><p>The commission has long evaluated advertising by legitimate businesses, and in this century has expanded into privacy, and with many successes. The National Do-Not-Call Registry being one of the most popular government initiatives in history.</p><p>But yesterday's success has become today's challenge with robocalls clogging our phones. In terms of robocalls, the FTC has been aggressive and ingenious but ultimately, robocalls are like spam. </p><p>Spam was, ultimately, the most effective way to deal with spam was when the ISPs developed tools to be able to screen out the majority of spam. And in the same way, robocalls I think will be best dealt with when those who deliver phone services and others develop the legal and technical tools to block unwanted calls. </p><p>Now, I've written and with Howard Beales that we criticized the Obama FTC on occasion. But compared to the paternalism of the CFPB to which I turn next, the FTC has been a paragon of virtue. </p><p>Let me turn to those two P's and their contrary vision for the FTC. The first is the return of the paternalism of the 1970s. The FTC of that era sought to become the second most powerful legislature. </p><p>In one 15-month strength, the FTC issued over a rule a month seeking to transform the entire industries along the vision of the then-very young people in charge of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, as proposed most of these rules were market supplanting with adverse consequences. </p><p>There was an exchange in the 1972 National Commission of Consumer Finance which is illustrative, and I'm not making this up. There was a debate about whether poor and middleclass people should borrow money to buy color televisions. With some people saying they shouldn't do it because they didn't need such luxuries, and other people defending their right to buy on credit color televisions. That, unfortunately, was illustrative. </p><p>This paternalism has returned with a vengeance in the CFPB. And by this, I mean the Obama CFPB. Whatever one thinks about what's going on, the powers of the CFPB are there. They haven't been touched when President Warren comes in in a few years. If she or someone likes her -- like her comes in, the incredible power of the CFPB which is insulated from any effective control will still be there. </p><p>Substantively, the CFPB has broad undefined powers to regulate. It adds the word \"abuse\" to the more defined FTC termed of deceptive and unfairness. And abuse is akin to the FTC use of unfairness in the 1970s. And like the FTC, the CFPB -- like the FTC in those days, the CFPB prefers to use its discretion as opposed to a definition. </p><p>You can look at the effects of the CFPB on consumer credit and they've been significant, in the paper, I discuss the qualified mortgage rule and the criticism of the Federal Reserve on that rule in slowing the return of the housing market, and the adverse effect particularly on minorities.</p><p>Now, those who defend the CFPB sometimes raise behavioral economics, which is a recent challenge to the benefits of markets. In its extreme version, it's based on the idea that errors that -- and people, obviously, sometimes make mistakes. But the idea is that those errors are systematically irrational.</p><p>Now, some people will tell you that normal economics assumes that consumers have perfect knowledge in their economic calculators. Well, I was schooled by those normal economists, and I learned about transaction cost and imperfect information from those individuals. So, I think that that parody of economics is simply inaccurate. </p><p>Moreover, there are numerous problems with using behavioral economics. For one thing, the behavioralists don't agree on which biases they talk about are relevant. For another thing, there is not empirical evidence to support what they want to do. For yet another problem is that consumers invest in various ways to improve decision-making. </p><p>Now, I'm not saying there aren't important papers and empirical work here to be done. I cite an example in the paper of the credit card market, where people do choose accurately and are learning from their mistakes. There are lots of papers like that in the healthcare market. I mean, in the credit market. </p><p>In the healthcare market, on the other hand, Fiona Scott Morton has written a very good paper where there are systematic -- there are systematic mistakes. Now, I believe that healthcare markets are different, but I would hope these hearings and the FTC pay attention to those empirical issues. </p><p>The second P, populism, is reflected in calls -- and Chairman Simons mentioned this -- on the left and the right to use antitrust to dismantle the highly successful companies, or at least the so-called tech companies, or at least regulate them as public utilities.</p><p>These are misguided calls. For one thing, what a tech or digital company is, is hard to know. We have new technologies but they're being diffused through the economy. Moreover, these companies have different positions in the market. Some have big market shares; some don't. </p><p>Equally important, we've been down the populist road before with disastrous consequences. John Nuechterlein and I discuss some of this history in a new paper that John will discuss in detail later. And let me talk about the highlights.</p><p>Before Wal-Mart and Amazon, another company used the same kind of tools to become the largest retailer in the United States for over 40 years. This company was so important, the company was the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company that John Updike, the young John Updike, used the company as the title in the setting for his iconic short story which every one of my generation had to read in high school. And what happened was A&amp;P success triggered a backlash, and the government went after A&amp;P for two decades. </p><p>First, they passed the Robinson-Patman Act which embarrassed the antitrust world for much longer than two decades, and took a long time for the antitrust world from which to recover.</p><p>This new legislation was not enough. First, the government prosecuted the A&amp;P successfully criminally. They still weren't done. They sued to break the A&amp;P up. Finally, a new administration came in, the Eisenhower Administration, and settled for some vertical divestiture. </p><p>The problem was this long war of attrition caused the leadership of the A&amp;P to focus on fighting the government, not on its new competition. And today, all that's left of the A&amp;P are the coffees. Eight O'clock, I think it's called Eight O'clock. And the company itself is gone. </p><p>Now, it's true that the FTC largely abandoned RP in the 1970s, but there are two vestiges of populism that were strong at the FTC in the 1970s and the first was predatory pricing.</p><p>There were three important cases, probably the most prominent of which was the coffee case. In the -- in the early -- in the mid-1970s, Proctor &amp; Gamble, then the most feared marketer of consumer goods had Folgers Coffee. Folgers Coffee expanded into the heartland, into the East, into the heartland of Maxwell House.</p><p>Maxwell House General Foods responded, massive price war, benefiting consumers enormously. How did the FTC respond? It sued General Foods for responding against the best marketer in the world. I'm not making that up either. And there were -- and there were other such cases. And a call for return to predatory pricing is an important plank of the new populist agenda. </p><p>Another bulwark of the 1970s antitrust was reliance on the simple market concentration doctrine. And the concentration levels were levels that no one today would regard as significant. </p><p>The prominent example was four firms with 50 percent share. This theory was sometimes married to a populist animus toward bigness, which led the commission to seek vertical disintegration of the then very unconcentrated oil industry. </p><p>And through 1980, the FTC was pursuing de-concentration long after the majority of the economics profession had dominated or had abandoned extreme versions of the market concentration doctrine.</p><p>Well, let me conclude. With the creation of the CFPB, the FTC has another federal agency performing each mission. The original CFPB model, mirroring the 1970s FTC, contrasts to the modern FTC. Perhaps the regulatory world runs in cycles. But one hopes that the FTC will not be in a future Groundhog Day where it awakes each morning to 1975.</p><p>In contrast, consider the current, in antitrust -- I'm sorry -- consider the impact of the current reformers who which to return antitrust to focus less on consumers and more on protecting less efficient businesses. </p><p>Imagine how the companies they would now punish would have fared in their desired legal environment. Once the newcomers had grown beyond a certain size, perhaps by the late 1990s, their lawyers would have counseled them to be cautious about expansion, innovation, and price cutting, lest they face antitrust liability for disadvantaging their less efficient rivals. </p><p>Luckily, because this advice would have badly misstated antitrust law, lawyers did not give it. Let us pray for the sake of American consumers that such advice never becomes sound. Rather than condemn innovation, whether in the 1930s or today, we should applaud.</p><p>Companies like the so-called tech giants have been built from the ground up in the United States rather than in Europe or China, largely because the U.S. legal environment is stable, predictable, and uniquely hospitable to vigorous paradigm-shattering competition by all businesses. That legal environment is a hallmark of American exceptionalism, long may it continue. Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SAYYED:  Okay. Thank you, Tim. And we'll turn to Jim Rill now. </p><p>RILL:  Thank you, Bilal. It's indeed an honor to be here, the commemoration of the work that was done by Bob Pitofsky and the leadership of the commission in 1995. And a particular honor to me. I go back relationships with Bob in 1969 when he was basically the author of the first Kirkpatrick Report on the Federal Trade Commission, and we worked together in the ABA. </p><p>In 1992, he was a very important and direct consultant on the 1992 horizontal merger guidelines. So, it's indeed an honor to be a participant in these, in these programs. </p><p>I want to talk today about the developments in the antitrust world that's created by the globalization of antitrust, which I think is one of the most significant developments in the competition world in the last decade since the first Pitofsky hearings. </p><p>I think the most important thing we can see is there's been a cascade, a tsunami of antitrust agencies across the world. In the 1995, there was a handful of agencies that had antitrust, and some agencies that had an antitrust law -- Japan, a gift of 1946, really didn't enforce it. </p><p>Now, we see something like 130 or more agencies with an antitrust regime. And those agencies that have had an antitrust regime are increasingly engaged in enforcement, often with a very controversial, very controversial, very controversial results. </p><p>So, what we need to think about, what I think needs to be thought about at the commission and the other antitrust agencies is what is the response of the antitrust agencies to this global tsunami of antitrust agencies around the world. And I don't want to suggest that that's a bad thing. I think it's a good thing, properly founded, property principled, properly directed, because I think a sound competition policy is essential to the operation of a market economy. </p><p>So, what have the agencies done, and what is the challenge facing them in the future? The agencies were responsible, I think particularly the FTC and the Department of Justice in the formation of the International Competition Network in 1990 -- in 2001, following on the report of the Department of Justice International Competition Policy Advisory Committee, the ICPAC that was put together in 1997 and reissued its report in 2000. </p><p>The International Competition Network was founded on the platform of the Fordham Program in 1991 with 12 members. Tim Muris was very instrumental in putting that together. Now, we have well over 100 members, 100 agencies that are members of the International Competition Network. And the ICN has been extremely important in producing guidance that's based on market economics and due process for its member countries and for other countries around the world, essentially soft guidance, but nonetheless effective and responsible guidance. </p><p>The ICN has produced merger notification and procedure guidelines, has put out through its unilateral conduct working group of guidelines on predatory pricing, guidelines on dominance. Most interestingly I think the work that the ICN has done in the area of procedural due process and the antitrust, the working group -- excuse me, the working group on agency effectiveness which was headed -- task force was headed by the Federal Trade Commission, the work of Randy Tritell and Paul O'Brien has been extremely effective in putting out guidelines on due process, guiding principles, annotated guidance and similar documents. </p><p>These are extremely important contributions that are made towards convergence, if not harmonization in the antitrust world. Similarly, the OECD again under U.S. leadership has put out a protocol on hardcore competition. Also, documents on the merger notification and procedure really anticipating ahead of time the ICN's work in that area. The OECD has also issued a very monumental report under the leadership of then-Chairman and then Assistant Attorney General Varney on due process and procedural fairness. </p><p>So, most recently, in 2017, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission issued revised guidance for international enforcement. This guidance document I think broke some new ground. And providing for the government's involvement in advocacy across the globe, that it would attempt to foment adherence to sound principles of not only process, but substance and would advocate decisions as the occasion rose in particular situations. </p><p>It extolled the benefit of bilateral agreements which the United States antitrust agencies have several, calling for cooperation in particular cases, it set forth principles of comity, and establish a principle that criticized extraterritorial reach of antitrust enforcement where that extraterritorial reach was not based on the immediate impact, substantial reasonably foreseeable direct, immediate impact on the host nation, consistent with our legal principles in that particular area. </p><p>On the question of its advocacy, what we have is a fairly general statement, however, not one that gets into the specificity of when and how that advocacy might be best advanced and effected and implemented. And I think that's a challenge as we will indicate going ahead. The ICN, the International Competition Network, is continuing its effort towards promoting convergence in substance and procedure through workshops and similar efforts to bring about convergence and harmonization and sound principles. </p><p>Non-governmental agencies as well since the last time, since the 1995 hearings increased their efforts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has issued a so-called expert report -- I say \"so-called\" because I was on it, so therefore I've got to be modest -- expert report on due process and the way forward, somewhat controversial in that it advocated the establishment of a cabinet-level coordinating committee for dealing with international antitrust. </p><p>I think one head issue that I personally had some -- it was on the report, had some skepticism as to its efficacy although there should be more coordination among the agencies of the federal government. The American Bar Association has had several task forces, several reports in this area, a due process report and currently a program going forward, soon to be I think finalized on sort of a, if you will, not a report card but an analysis of the implementation of due process, task force headed by my partner, John Taladay and Melanie Akin (ph). Also, the ABA is soon to present a paper on the use of public policy issues in antitrust globally. </p><p>That is the extent to which non-antitrust factors flying under the flag of antitrust tend to adulterate -- that's my pejorative, not theirs, I expect -- tend to adulterate the efficacy and substantial foundation for antitrust enforcement. The ICC, International Chamber of Commerce has issued a report in this area that is of significance and extols again the need for global consensus and fair procedures. The private sector is active -- is it enough active? No, but increasingly active in this particular area. </p><p>So, what are the challenges going forward? There are limits I think to the efficacy of soft guidance, of soft convergence. It's necessary, essential, but is it enough? Is it sufficient? My answer to that is I think you need to go beyond it. There are -- there's no structured mechanism right now for establishing, if you will, ambassadors (ph) for evaluating the extent to which the guidance of the various international organizations and national organizations that I referenced are being actually implemented and then can -- then followed in the nations around the world, including sometimes I might say the United States. </p><p>We see action in China involving a merger by Coca-Cola which I think has questionable economic foundation, the denial of a transaction involving NXP which had been approved by every other agency in the world on grounds that are difficult to discern any kind of link through it to sound antitrust. We seeing in Korea in expanded reach for extraterritoriality, in an area where there may be no effect, whatever on consumer welfare in Korea. We see in Taiwan enforcement actions with no printed, published and maybe not even any practiced sound standards for due process. </p><p>All of these issues I think are a challenge, a huge challenge to global antitrust including the United States going forward. And sometimes, frankly, the United States has been criticized for its use of CFIU.S., criticized overseas by its use of CFIU.S. to in effect undermine sound antitrust analysis and engage in national championship work. I'm not trying to agree. I don't agree with that in many respects, but I know that has been criticized overseas and recently. </p><p>In a speech, former Director General -- former commissioner for competition of the European Union Mario Monti said that Europe has much sounder antitrust leadership, foundation, correctness than the United States. We have to be aware of that and be sensitive to it. </p><p>So, what should be the response going forward? And I don't pretend that I have any particular wisdom here, but throw out some ideas and actions that I've seen. First, there is an increasing, I think, demand, interest for the United States agencies to become directly involved in individual enforcement actions overseas where the effectiveness on important interests of the United States, not to protect the U.S. champion but where there's an important interest to the United States that bears on effective competition policy. </p><p>We have in our agreements and then in other international principles, mechanisms for cooperation, notification, and transparency. These I suggest should be implemented. They have been implemented by the United States. In BoeingMcDonnell Douglas for example, the U.S. was very much involved in attempting to I think put on -- I'll say put on the right track the European Commission's analysis of that transaction even to the point where this guy was an antitrust professor at Arkansas, I think named William Clinton got involved in the lobbying before the European Commission on that transaction. </p><p>The actions of the Federal Trade Commission in certain circumstances have been salutary. I think in discussing a matter involving Intel in Japan, it was effective outcome. Press reports indicate there was effective outcome involved in U.S. involvement with Qualcomm, a principal issue in China. And of course the -- I'm not sure how, I think effectively about greater convergence in understanding and consultation, the U.S. criticism of the European and the commission's action in G.E. Honeywell. </p><p>We must respect foreign agencies' interpretation of their own law. We don't necessarily need to surrender to it. In our efforts to converge, to consult, I think the decision by my classmate, Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the vitamin C case sets a good principle for the question of respect, but not total deference to foreign law. </p><p>So, I think what we need to do going forward, what I suggest would be an appropriate role for the Federal Trade Commission and consider the really excellent work it's done and the work that the Department of Justice has done. I think the Federal Trade Commission under the guidance of Randy Tritell has made great strides in this area. But the question is testing the implementation. </p><p>And I'd like to close with reference to the initiative that's recently been announced and promoted by Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim to establish a multilateral framework for procedure in antitrust cases. He recently spoke at the Fordham Conference indicating that there's significant progress in that area, that some 12 or so countries are signing on. We haven't seen what they're singing on to in detail yet, but signing on to the principle. It's a major first step by a national antitrust agency to attempt to persuade other countries that there needs to be some system -- joint system for assisting in the implementation and review, not a scorecard, but a review of the extent to which the guidance document for the so-called soft guidance is actually adopted and fomented in the international arena. </p><p>I think that is the challenge going forward to the FTC, to the Department of Justice, and I think it's a challenge of enormous importance for international antitrust and international competition policy. And so, with that, thank you very much. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SAYYED:  All right. Thank you, Jim. </p><p>And, Alysa, (inaudible) I note that I'm very envious of the ICPAC, that they had apparently three to four years to do their report. </p><p>HUTNIK:  So, switching gears to consumer protection and privacy, and like most consumer protection lawyers, I have pictures. </p><p>So, I do want to first strongly support the commission's objectives for these hearings. I'm a firm believer in that there is value in self-examination and being willing to both solicit and consider constructive feedback from constituents and practitioners inside and out. And indeed, from a similar process, the 1995 hearings positively shaped subsequent FTC policy and approach and one would expect similar outcomes from these hearings. </p><p>So, taking the time machine, let's see if we can get there, back to the 1990s and while some of us might have had Mariah Carey on the radio, hopefully no one is going to raise their hands on that, here at the FTC in 1995 hearings had technology front and center in the focus. </p><p>And there, the focus was innovative changes and convergence happening with the online marketplace, television, cyberspace, even radical new technology issues such as purchasing compact disks over your telephone. And notably even then, the FTC was already anticipating issues with the amount and the type of data collected online, who was accessing that data, how many people who were accessing that data, cyber security issues with the data and the associated other consumer protection considerations. </p><p>The resulting Pitofsky Report from those hearings provided an effective roadmap for consumer protection business guidance and policy for over 20 years. Tim Muris mentioned durability. This policy has been extremely durable. That report centered on several key tenets:  one, consumer sovereignty. This is a point that's been echoed in the 1980 FTC policy on unfairness and in decades before in adjudications and business guidance, the idea that we would give consumers access to material information and allow them to make their own choice without regulatory intervention, to do it conveniently. </p><p>Two, the agency would prioritize enforcement to fight fraud and deception and unfair business practices that caused consumers harm. The agency also would support industry self-regulation as a way to make limited agency resources go further and to provide businesses with greater clarity on compliance expectations. And finally, the commission would provide consumer education to empower consumers to navigate through emerging marketplaces. </p><p>And while some might argue that the application of these concepts has ebbed and flowed over the years, they're viewed by many as the successful foundation to the FTC's approach in consumer protection. It's an approach that is largely consensus-based. It's not largely political. It's measured and it intentionally considers competition concerns with those of consumer protection. It's also a framework that supports our nation of innovation. We are experiencing and witnessing a technology revolution that has no end in sight and a robust marketplace that provides feedback when a line has been crossed. Through both consumer choice, a vibrant press and government enforcement. </p><p>And while there may be growing pains from time-to-time and sometimes criticisms that the FTC does not act fast enough to prevent unlawful business conduct, it is the flexible nature of the FTC's Section 5 authority that is such a critical part of our country's economic success. </p><p>Now, like any balanced framework, we should continue to ask tough questions to determine if and what changes may be warranted so that the agency's consumer protection mission can continue to be fulfilled for the next 20 years. </p><p>And in looking at the comments filed in response to these hearings, these certainly raise several themes. One of the main themes that Chairman Simons started out with was the concept of technology, whether the technology marketplace of today and tomorrow requires the change to the FTC's organizational structure and allocation of resources. And just as the 1996 Pitofsky Report following those hearings observe that there would be challenges to the agency's consumer protection mission with the evolving technology marketplace, today's cyber threats and technology changes and innovations will absolutely test the FTC's expertise and its resources. </p><p>Technology plays an integral part of the consumer experience whether at work, at home, in educational settings, healthcare, facilitates the way we interact with each other and with the world around us. So, it's no surprise then that technology should play such a key role in most of the FTC's consumer protection enforcement cases. And given the technology emphasis of commerce today and tomorrow, does the current FTC's organizational structure and investment of resources in technology expertise reflect the present and foreseeable needs in order to fulfill the consumer protection mission. </p><p>One of the second themes and many might call it a pain point reflected in the comments is the ever-growing patchwork of consumer protection and privacy laws around the globe and here in the United States. The 1996 Pitofsky Report recognized the obstacles that a multitude of conflicting laws would pose for commerce, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses and new entrants. Today, these compliance obstacles have only grown, particularly in the area of privacy where there appears to be a race to become the most comprehensive in regulating data practices. </p><p>And given the examples that we are seeing in Europe, California and elsewhere, it remains an open question on whether the commission's risk-based approach will have to yield to a national and uniform approach to privacy. But that may be easier said than done with respect to passing federal legislation particularly in an election year. </p><p>So, in the near term and in the absence of a uniform federal standard, what type of guidance and policy leadership can the agency provide that could be helpful to the national and global discussion on the costs and the benefits of more prescriptively regulating business practices? </p><p>And the third theme from the comments underscored a point that this agency has always faced, where to focus its enforcement efforts, what shall be the priorities given finite and limited resources. And with lots of shiny objects and headlines to choose from, the agency has most advanced its consumer protection mission when it's focused on business practices causing real harm. </p><p>Financial and physical harm have rightly had the agency's attention, but importantly, given the role of technology in our lives, the agency under then-acting Chairman Ohlhausen has also explored how informational injury can cause real harm and how the agency can measure such harm and seek to deter and to remedy unlawful business practices with such results. </p><p>Doing more with less also might involve all aspects of the commission's in-house expertise with more visible collaboration with the bureaus of competition and economics. Indeed, the unfairness prong of Section 5 requires that competition be taken into account and more transparency on this involvement in the competition analysis in consumer protection cases would provide helpful guidance to businesses, which in turn will help consumers. </p><p>The last theme that was raised that I'll touch on by the comments and which played an important role in the Pitofsky Report as well is how important the FTC's supporting and incentivizing company participation and meaningful self-regulatory programs is. They're not a substitute for government oversight, but they can enhance the agency's consumer protection mission with a lot less cost. History has shown that self-regulation is more nimble and able to move more quickly to address innovation and technology changes. </p><p>And when the FTC promotes the use of self-regulation and incentivizes companies to embrace such standards, industry responds time and time again and consumers benefit directly from this carrot rather than stick approach, incentivizing rather than purely focusing on punitive deterrence. </p><p>So, I will keep my comments shorter. It lead me to concluding remarks that with the rapid changes that were happening and all the discussion around technology, we're largely discussing many of the same types of issues that were discussed in some form at the last set of hearings in 1995. And as we hear from many voices during these hearings, I can say from my personal experience working with startups, working with large companies, new entrants, those that have been around for decades, most companies are motivated to do the right thing while also remaining competitively viable. </p><p>Straightforward laws that do not pick winners or losers, clear regulatory guidance, and vigorous support of self-regulation enable companies to achieve those goals without unnecessarily fencing in opportunity or innovation. And for the fraudsters and companies that are bent on causing consumer harm, the FTC has its tools -- existing tools -- to address that. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SAYYED:  Okay. Well, Alysa, thank you. We're going to -- and thank you for getting us almost back on schedule. That's why friends know, being off schedule just a few minutes would be a major achievement in my life. </p><p>So, anyway, we're going to take about a 10-minute break. So, let's come back here just a little slightly after 10:30 and we'll start up again. </p><p>SAYYED:  Okay. Thank you. I just want to remind everybody that we do have some of my FTC colleagues collecting question cards. So if you have a question for the panel members, just write it on the card, raise your hand, we'll pick it up, and we will try to get to it. But before we turn to both of sort of the panel Q&amp;A and audience Q&amp;A, we're going to ask separately, both Jan McDavid and David Vladeck to both comment on what they've heard and honestly comment on whatever they'd like to comment on.</p><p>But I'm sure it'll be germane. So I'll first turn it over to Jan and then turn it over to David when Jan is complete.</p><p>MCDAVID:  Thank you, Bilal. I want to applaud the Federal Trade Commission for again using its statutory authority to consider whether changes in our economy require adjustments in the FTC's enforcement priorities. Such hearings were part of the FTC's original statutory mandate and have been used very effectively throughout its history most notably in the Pitofsky hearings that were discussed extensively this morning.</p><p>I'm honored to participate again as I did in the Pitofsky hearings. And I'm returning to my antitrust roots here at Georgetown because my antitrust career started my final semester in law school at Georgetown when I studied antitrust law with Bob Pitofsky. </p><p>Hearings provide the FTC an opportunity to step back and consider broad philosophical issues without the pressure of fact and time deadlines arising out in particular proceedings. That's a real luxury that most agencies don't have and the FTC does.</p><p>That kind of introspection allows the FTC to identify opportunities for improvement. It also offers an opportunity for democratic participation, which is one of the objectives recently outlined by commissioner Chapra in his paper last week.</p><p>I speak here as a practitioner who advises clients everyday on antitrust issues. And I share the FTC's view. That competition produces the best, most innovative, lowest price products and services for consumers. Most antitrust enforcement actually takes place in conference rooms in law firms and boardrooms in corporations where people like me advice our clients on where the lines are and how they can achieve their business objectives without crossing those lines.</p><p>Our ability to do that effectively is significantly enhanced if our clients know that the antitrust cop is on the beat. That was true in the Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations because antitrust has always enjoyed bipartisan support. And based on our early impressions, it's also true with the current Federal Trade Commission and Antitrust Division.</p><p>I've always viewed the antitrust laws as sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing market conditions, such as those involving the growth of technologies or foreign competitors. It also has been sufficiently flexible to be applied across a broad range of industries involving defense, healthcare, consumer goods or technologies, which don't particularly have anything in common.</p><p>The antitrust statutes as they've been interpreted by the agencies and the courts in recent years, in the last 30 years or so, provide a framework that knowledgeable council can apply as we consider the unique facts brought to us by our clients. And of course, we also bring the bear the economic concepts that are so important to underlying antitrust analysis today. Over the course of my career, I've seen the development of sound antitrust doctrine rooted in a principled analysis, and above all the positive role, the economic analysis played starting really with the Supreme Court's decision in General Dynamics, which was decided just before my final law school exam by Bob and the GTE Sylvania decisions and leading to various iterations, for example, of the merger guidelines. </p><p>In contrast, one of my mentors, former FTC commissioner Tom Leary, said that during his early career, when they would be defending a merger before the agency, they would say, \"God forbid it would achieve any efficiencies,\" because that was suspect in the '60s and early 1970s. </p><p>As I was trying to do antitrust research as a young lawyer and as a law student, I had a very hard time discerning any consistent thread through the cases I was reading. And that made it really hard to advise clients. That's not true anymore, because we have a framework that lawyers and even our clients understand.</p><p>During my career, antitrust analysis has been grounded in fundamental principles and focused on consumer welfare. Contrary to the concerns expressed by some, prices are not the only touch point in our analysis. We have handled many matters in which issues like innovation and product quality were much more central than price. </p><p>And in my experience, the agencies have done a very good job of identifying those issues and resolving them in the matters. The way they have done so has also made it possible for advisors like me to tell our clients where the antitrust lines are. I'm a progressive Democrat. So you might expect that I would be applauding the development of populist antitrust theories. But I think that including populous antitrust concept would make the task that I undertake for my clients much more difficult.</p><p>Instead of well-established principles grounded in consumer welfare and sound economic analysis, we would be applying amorphous concepts of bigness and fairness, some of which turned traditional principles on their heads, such as lower prices that don't have the underpinnings of a predatory pricing analysis, or penalizing large successful technology company simply for being successful because they created new products and services that consumers genuinely desired.</p><p>This could return us to the era of Von's Grocery where the dissent lamented, \"the court grounds its conclusion solely on the impressionistic assertion that the Los Angeles retail food industry is becoming concentrated because the number of single-store concerns has declined.\" This led Justice Stewart to complain that \"the sole consistency I can find in the antitrust laws is that the government always wins.\"</p><p>But even that wouldn't be true in a populist system because ultimately we don't have an administrative system in the United States. We have a system of enforcement and the agencies and private plaintiffs bear the burden of proof. In Europe and many other countries, the government can simply say no. </p><p>Here, they have to go to court, and they do so grounded in facts and economic analysis that supports their case, but with a framework that everyone understands. Where there are legitimate concerns about fairness or employment effects, for example, those issues should be addressed under different regimes as it's done today with the CFIU.S., unless as in the case for example of the no poach cases, there is a legitimate antitrust concern directly affecting employment and arising out of particular conduct. </p><p>Antitrust is a well calibrated tool to achieve competition and consumer welfare. But it is poorly designed to tackle social issues that are more appropriately addressed under other kinds of legislation. We should respect the limitations of antitrust. </p><p>And finally, antitrust analysis that includes amorphous concept of bigness and fairness could lend itself to politically motivated enforcement, which we certainly should eschew, especially now in the current political environment.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SAYYED:  David? We'll turn to David now.</p><p>VLADECK:  Okay. Thank you. Let me start by thanking Chairman Simons for holding these hearings. I think this is the right way for the commission, for a new commission to get its bearings and to figure out what its priorities are going to be and what its agenda should be. </p><p>I also think it's right to honor Bob Pitofsky, his legacy still looms large at the FTC when I was there, I'm sure it still does. The influence he's had, not simply on the antitrust side of the agency, but on the consumer protection side is enormous. And it's only fitting to do this here at Georgetown Law School.</p><p>So I generally agree with Alysa. I'm going to try not to repeat the points that she made. What I'd like to talk about or what I think are three-main challenges the commission faces going forward. And the first and this I think Alysa brought up is tech, tech, tech. Virtually everything the agency does today has some connection with emerging technologies. </p><p>When Chairman Leibowitz and I got to the FTC, we did not have a tech infrastructure. We did not have a single technician on staff, to the extent we needed to engage in forensic analysis, we had to outsource it. Today, because each of the successive chairs has built upon the tech infrastructure that we started to build, the agency has more technology capacity than ever. </p><p>But I still wonder whether it's sufficient. The agency needs deep expertise in things like artificial intelligence. It needs the forensic ability to conduct investigations in data breaches and in other kinds of consumer injuries. We need better forensics, better tools. And so, one challenge I think the agency faces going forward is to make sure that its infrastructure, its resources match the challenges that the agency faces. </p><p>So I think that's one. One of my former colleagues, Cradmaker (ph), Professor Cradmaker, suggested that maybe it was time that the FTC added a new bureau, a bureau of technology. I don't know whether that's the right way to address the technology deficits that the FTC faces. But that's something that ought to be considered.</p><p>Second, the challenges of protecting consumers in a digital economy. Now, the FTC in 2012 issued a report that tries to set out a framework about how consumer protection matches the FTC mandate. And I think there's a lot of very valuable advice in that report. I would urge the new commissioners to dust it off and take a look because it provides, I think, a blueprint at least for dealing with some of the difficult questions the commission is going to face. </p><p>For example, automated decision-making, I'm not necessarily a foe of artificial intelligence. After all, we all know that human decision making is not necessarily great. Right? But it provides all sorts of challenges for regulators. It's a black box system. You can't interrogate an algorithm and it can be a breeding ground for disparate treatment that is based on impermissible factors. </p><p>And rooting out those kinds of problems is very difficult for the agency. Data driven offers in pricing. The marketplace is full of variable pricing and variable offers. I mean there have been challenges about Facebook's ads for housing and so forth.</p><p>These are very difficult challenges the agency faces to ensure fairness in the marketplace. And the lack of transparency in the algorithmic decision-making process runs a real risk that at least some consumers are going to face tyranny by algorithm. The commission needs to figure out how it can be an effective regulator in this space. </p><p>It faces enforcement challenges. Yesterday, there was a New York Times article about the New Mexico attorney general bring a COPPA case and criticizing the FTC for not beating his office to the punch. Well, COPPA enforcement has been a thorn on the side of the agency since apps were developed. </p><p>The app market, the app developer market is highly diffused. There are thousands of people making apps, some in their parents' basement. And it's very hard, unless you're going to carpet bomb the industry, to have an enforcement regime that really works well. And now the agency's brought many, many CAPA cases and it's done so against high profile violators. But that's a problem.</p><p>And Alysa talked about the usefulness of self-regulation. This is in the area where we've encouraged self-regulation. We actually detailed a lawyer to work out of our San Francisco office to be an outreach person to the app development community or encouraging some kind of self-regulatory body. But we didn't succeed.</p><p>So there are some enforcement challenges that the agency faces as well that are magnified by outdated statutes that the agency has to enforce. Neither (inaudible) nor some of the other statutes that were enacted before anyone could envision a digital economy like this need to be updated. And I would hope that the commission can work with Congress to do so.</p><p>I think the lack of civil penalties in Section 5 cases has been a serious lack for the agency, particularly in data breach cases. The RAND Institute is not a number of studies, making clear that the economic incentives, particularly for box stores and other kinds of consumer-facing companies don't push hard enough to ensure robust security defenses. </p><p>That is it's economically rational to risk a data breach because the cost of strengthening one's defenses may outweigh. I think civil penalty availability in those kinds of cases would add a necessary deterrent. And my help stem the (inaudible) ID theft. I think we need to update the unfairness doctrine.</p><p>It's interesting because the unfairness doctrine seems to at least be interpreted by some to require some form of economic or economic-like harm. But the statutory mandated the FTCs to prevent unfair and deceptive practices. Now I try to remediate them when they take place. And there are many harms that are just not actually well-remediated by money. </p><p>I mean for example, the Ashley Madison data breach. This was a secret dating site. Well, marriages broke up, people commit suicide. These are serious harms that ought to be prevented. There's at least an argument that the Unfairness Statement as it's currently constituted doesn't really take into account some of these reputational injuries that have been made possible by a digital economy. </p><p>My last point is the regulation of big data. There's now pervasive data collection. It's ubiquitous. In fact, the last bastion in privacy, our homes is now yet another side of data collection. People have always on, always love devices of the internet of things. They're going to put censors in people's homes, all of these -- these serve useful purposes. But they involve enormous data collection.</p><p>And we need to figure out how to protect consumers in this area of ubiquitous data collection. We don't have laws that really deal with this. The aggregation of data is a real sort of enticement to data thieves. So, Apam Ohm (ph), who worked at the FTC when John and I were there, wrote in a law review article about 10 years ago where he forecasted there might become a time where there would be databases of ruin. </p><p>That is, that the data collection would be so ubiquitous that whatever fact that you would be mortified to have revealed to the public or to other people, that those facts will be in a database. Well, given the ability of data sharing, data lakes, the ubiquitous movement of data, there really is no answer to those questions now.</p><p>And those are questions that the FTC has to address. We did -- when I was at the FTC, we did a 6B on the data collection by data brokers. And I think that was a good start. And I think one of the things that I'd urge the commission to think about is using a 6B authority to get a better handle on basically just how consumer data flows, where does it go, who has access to it, what kinds of constraints, if any, ought to be imposed? </p><p>So I think -- I commend the FTC for holding these hearings. I think this is going to be a challenging but interesting time. And I urge that the commission think about these things. Thank you so much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SAYYED:  So thank you, David. What I'd like to do now is I have a series of questions and in frankness we've shared them with the group in advance. But, of course, they were prepared before I knew what anybody would say. What I'd like to do is first ask the panelists, maybe to ask questions of each other or comment on what others have said. </p><p>And because he has to leave at 11:30, and in fact squeezed us in to do this panel, I'd like to ask Jason if he's got some thoughts on what he's heard, particularly because he comes from this -- from a different perspective or different background than the rest of us. And then I'll ask folks maybe to put some questions to Jason.</p><p>FURMAN:  Yes. I guess we've heard two references to populist antitrust. And I'm not sure whether I agree or disagree with those comments. If those comments are saying you should replace the current disciplined approach with the sort of wooly-headed if you don't like the company and you want to promote democracy and like ground your approach in something big and cosmic like that, then I certainly agree with you.</p><p>If what you're saying is that there were certain papers written decades ago and those papers are still a hundred percent correct, and we should base all everything on these tablets that were handed down and any change would be populist and barbarian, then I think I quite disagree with that. In fact, even some of the assumptions and arguments of people like Bork and Posner and others made, economists in IO have long known that they were quite fragile, and based on very specific assumptions that weren't very robust that the world was much more complicated. </p><p>As you said, Janet, people do take into account a broader set of considerations. But to some degree, economists need to do a better job of understanding this broader set of considerations too. So I think this is an evolving area.</p><p>As the chairman said at the very beginning of the remarks, I think that continued evolution is important. I think that if some of the macro evidence data and motivations that I said lends more impetus to that, I think that would be a welcome development and an important one. But I still would then use that to motivate -- you saying micro market by market techniques to think about cases, not some of those types of macro data. </p><p>But I don't think that irrelevant in motivating us to push further and think harder about ways that frankly enforcement has gotten more lax. And that has had deleterious consequences for the economy.</p><p>SAYYED:  Well, Tim, it looks like you want to -- yes.</p><p>MURIS:  Sure. Let me address the Chicago point about the sacred texts. Bruce Kobayashi and I published a paper subtitled \"Time To Let Go of the 20th Century.\" And -</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  When did you publish it?</p><p>MURIS:  2014. I think Bilal sent it to you. And what we said there -- essentially -- look, the way to think about Chicago is the way to think about the American revolutionaries. There was this revolutionary band of brothers. But what they were -- they were opposed to the old order. And the older order was overthrown.</p><p>But once it came to running a government, they split like Adams and Jefferson. If you take a list and put this in the paper, Baxter, Bork, Boman, Posner and Stigler, they either hadn't thought of or they disagreed radically on how to approach antitrust policy, mergers for example. Those guys were all over the lot from the most aggressive, Posner to the most restrictive, Bork.</p><p>And the point was they just hadn't thought about it. And when they did, they disagreed. And so, this idea, which is rife in this populist literature that there's this economic cult from the University of Chicago which dominates antitrust thinking is simply inaccurate.</p><p>SAYYED:  Any other reaction or anybody would like to put questions?</p><p>MCDAVID:  I agree with Tim. But I also agree, Jason, that this has to be evolutionary. We don't regard them as the tablets that came down with Moses. Economic theory has evolved. We had three iterations in the merger guidelines. And the ones we have in place now actually reflect how the agencies have been analyzing mergers for quite a long time. And they introduced new concepts such as unilateral effects analysis that weren't in the original versions.</p><p>So we do evolve. But I am very concerned about the inability to discern the consistent thread that I found when I was a young lawyer, and I'm very worried about how clients are then going to have to handle this stuff.</p><p>RILL:  Well, Jan, you've touched on merger guidelines. Let me ask a question that I have asked people to think about. And this is not been to reflect on a particular administration or not. But in 2010, the previous administration revised the horizontal merger guidelines and changed the whatever you want to call it, safety thresholds or presumption thresholds from HHI of 1800, post-merger HHI of 1800 being -- under some conditions presumed anti-competitive to level -- HHI level of 2400. </p><p>And also, in fairness, I think Tim Muris and I wrote an article suggesting that some change was appropriate and we may have landed at around 2400. But let me put that out there. I mean to be able to think the -- the thresholds in the merger guidelines should be adjusted downward.</p><p>MCDAVID:  Well, I deal with the guidelines all the time. And my view of the HHIs is that they are useful as an initial screen to identify the deals that need additional scrutiny. And then they show up in the complaint if the agency challenges the deal as part of the basis who either doing so, and in between we don't talk about them very much because we talk about competitive effects analysis. </p><p>Where is the real competition that takes place? And having numbers attached to it and squaring market shares creates a sense of precision about this process that simply doesn't exist in reality or in the way the guidelines are applied. So I don't think it's necessary. I have clients who come to me and say, \"Well, as I run the HHIs, we've got an 1800.\" And then I discover that they've defined the market in a way that the agencies would never agree with. And therefore, the client has assumed something will be fine, when in fact, they're going to run into a real buzzsaw. </p><p>MURIS:  Look, the guidelines do tell you something significant if you think -- forget the HHIs, think about -- I heard John Baker gave a good talk on this Friday after our retrospective analysis came out when I was chairman. Think about it in terms of the number of significant competitors.</p><p>Bill Baxter, we argued with him when he put the guiidelines out in '82. Six to five was his marginal case and we wanted to make it five to four. But Bill, Bill was a structuralist, much more than modern people are and he thought that there wasn't very many competitors, six or five. Jim Rill essentially, when he put out his guidelines, made it much more of the focus that Jan was talking about.</p><p>But when they did the guidelines in 2010, they were relying on data that said four to three was the marginal case. And in fact, John Kwoka, among others, had published papers out of the FTC's line of business data that showed the importance of the strong number three to ensuring competition. But it's the marginal case. There are lots of four to three's challenged and occasionally higher. </p><p>But it does turn on a lot of factors. But the number of significant, if you want very simple tests, the number of significant competitors and how consumers react if they're significant business consumers, those -- answer to those two questions predicts a fair number of the results.</p><p>MCDAVID:  And on the point of the number effective competitors, the FTC has done a number of reports, looking back at its data about the deals that challenged, the deals that it didn't challenge and what the factors were. And those papers which talk about how many competitors there were in deals of the challenged, whether there were customer complaints, whether there were bad documents, range of other things. Those are really useful guidance. And it's terrific work that the FTC has done. I wish the division would join in doing that kind of analysis.</p><p>FURMAN:  I mean just briefly on the previous one, Tim, I thought you were much more modest about the Chicago school in this discussion than you were in your remarks. Your remarks actually claimed that they had accomplished quite a lot in terms of changing the way antitrust was. And I think that's right. That was -</p><p>MURIS:  Well, they overthrew the old order. That was forty years ago.</p><p>FURMAN:  Right. But anyway, I don't think we need to -- so I think sort of everyone treats them that way. I don't think one needs to re-litigate that. I think the question is do we need to make some changes. On the HHI, I would just do the average of whatever Fiona and John think it should be. But I think the argument for raising them also involved focusing and making sure you were refocusing and being vigorous above them in terms of a screen and everything else you're taking into account. </p><p>So I think it's not just the number, but a whole bunch of other things. And some of that is also frankly dependent on the courts. When you're bringing hospital cases and you're still losing hospital cases even when you have, I think, unanimous commission voting for them, that means there's a set of thinking, some of which was shaped in the past and is -- that needs to probably be modernized and updated to deal with changing research, including issues like wages, which I think is an important one when thinking about hospitals.</p><p>MURIS:  Well, the FTC is mostly winning, as the chairman said, mostly winning hospital mergers. And the problem was there was this silly belief in the Elzinga-Hogarty test. And we got Ken -- I went to Ken and Ken testified, he had very -- two very simple propositions. He said, \"I can't believe anybody would apply that test to hospitals.\"</p><p>And second, \"I can't believe anybody would pay me to say anything so obvious.\" And those two -- those two propositions, believe it or not, helped carry the day in two circuit courts very recently blessed the FTC's opinion. But Jason, you're right in this sense, because these cases are decided out there by individual district court judges, the FTC actually had to overturn some of the district court judges in circuits. But I think the FTC's way of looking at it is correct. And it mostly wins. But obviously, in the world of individual judges, you could get some variance. </p><p>SAYYED:  Let me ask -- I know Jim have some comments.</p><p>RILL:  Just really quickly. I think what probably wasn't recognized very much in the change from the '82 guidelines to the '92 guidelines was a treatment of the structural paradigm. If you recall in the '82 guidelines that there's certain concentration levels of the guideline that provided there would be a likelihood of challenge.</p><p>In the '92 guideline, we said, this is presumption that's carried on with further analysis and then went into then the other factors including entry and competitive nature of the marketplace, which I think that's the major change from the '82 to '92 guidelines. I think one of the interesting things about the 2010 guidelines, very creative and very interesting. was probably in order, is the distinction between the analytical framework and the guidelines and the analytic framework when the commission goes to court. </p><p>The 2010 guidelines are very, I don't say critical but somewhat almost dismissively market definition issues, as a proxy for the -- base for the analysis. Shortly after those guidelines, we not only analyzed, the commission went to court. </p><p>And if you look at its brief in the Polypore case, it doesn't appear that the 2010 guidelines existed. They were very much the traditional analysis, '82, '92 approach. So I think there is a distinction that one has to draw between what the agencies do in their analysis, which is obviously extremely important if you don't want to go to court, and the practice of the agency's -- put into their court pleadings, which are more traditional because I think the judges had become comfortable and accepting the analytical framework of the '82, '92 guideline approach. So I think there's a distinction there that we have to be aware of.</p><p>MURIS:  Well, if I could -- I don't want to forget the other mission. Actually, the FTC is a bigger consumer protection agency in both dollars in people than it is antitrust. And if you ever go out as an official, and we've got some here and do an interview, unless there's a big antitrust case in the press, the questions are overwhelmingly going to be about consumer protection.</p><p>I think David is 100 percent right about not -- strictly non-monetary protection. I as a young scholar wrote a couple of papers about how contract law protects subjective value. But I'm not at all sure you need to revise the unfairness guideline. I think another speech would be also because the FTC has protected that non-monetary, as David mentioned, the first -- the first security breach case that we've got and it was when I was chairman involved Eli Lilly where what happened was a non -- not just poorly trained, an employee who wasn't trained at all managed to send out a list to the world of -- I think it was 600 people who were taking Prozac. </p><p>And email addresses are very easily identifiable. A lot of people have their names, certainly their last names. And obviously we thought that was -- that was private information that ought to be protected. And you could -- you could spin a case of monetary loss, but utility functions when I talked about those economists who trained me, Gary Becker was one of them and he was one of the first to put other things in utility functions. </p><p>And the -- that's the way the FTC thinks and David's right that the commission ought to stress that. I think you can read that in the Unfairness Statement now but certainly statements to that effect would be useful. </p><p>VLADECK:  Yes, and to Tim's credit, Tim and Howard published an article that's a classic, I think a classic in the Mark Twain sense that it's something that everybody talks about but no one's ever read. But in it -- but I didn't read it. And in it, Tim makes exactly that point which is that the Unfairness Statement ought to be construed to cover kind -- the kinds of behavior that we would think of as invasion of privacy toward. </p><p>But in fact, oftentimes when a bureau director brings a case like that to the commission, there's real pushback. And not every commissioner unfortunately is quite as enlightened as Tim is on this matter. And so I think that going forward some clarity needs to be injected into the process, either through a revision of the Unfairness Statement or some declaration by the commission writ large that these kinds of harms are subsumed in the Unfairness Statement because there are some case that Tim actually raises questions about in that article, and the result was I think you said was sort of hard to reconcile. </p><p>The order was hard to reconcile with the complaint language, cases like DesignerWare, Aaron's, and that's because there was friction within the commission. And so we need some resolution to this issue because increasingly, the harms that are caused through data breach, other forms of revelation of privacy information are not necessarily economic in nature and the Unfairness Statement should simply make that clear or the commission should make it clear in some other way. So I don't disagree. </p><p>MURIS:  Well, I appreciate the fact that we had at least one reader and -- but I think maybe the solution is the next time the commission brings a case like that is just to issue a public statement that interprets the Unfairness Doctrine. </p><p>MCDAVID:  Or perhaps in these hearings and the report...</p><p>MURIS:  Sure. Another good suggestion. </p><p>SAYYED:  Let me ask Alysa I think on this panel counsels clients most directly on these issues if she's got some thoughts on this area. </p><p>HUTNIK:  Well, one of the things that we hear from clients a lot are, what's the law and what's the best practice. And in counseling clients we -- it's the interpretation of the cases and really focusing on those fundamental policy statements. And so where you have the statement on deception and statement on unfairness from 1980 and '83 which are very helpful and we continually go back to that. </p><p>I think to David's point, modernizing them even with current examples rather than adding kind of the 75th, the 77th document that you need to put in an email to a client on what they need to address, I think with current types of challenges both in advertising and data practices and et cetera. </p><p>SAYYED:  That leads right into a broader question and the commission takes -- I think takes seriously its obligation to provide clear guidance, business guidance on consumer education. So I wonder if folks up here think there are other areas where new or updated policy statements or materials are needed. It ties in as well to the idea of the self-regulatory model as well. Put that open maybe to David and Alysa initially but, of course, that is just as potentially true on the antitrust side of things.</p><p>VLADECK:  Yes. Let me just make a quick comment, which is the agency spends enormous amount of time on guidance documents. When I was there, the endorsement guides came out, the Green Guides, 300 pages of narrative. These are really important documents. We understand why regulated parties need the kind of guidance that the agency can provide. But doing a good guidance document is an enormous undertaking. </p><p>And there are areas where I think the guidance needs to be updated. And native advertising I think is an issue that the agency is going to have to continue to grapple with. The Green Guides left a lot of questions unanswered simply because there was no real consensus about what certain words mean like renewable. </p><p>And so I think -- I think one core part of the agency's mission is providing the kind of guidance that Alysa's talking about, that her clients need. It is quite a formidable undertaking, but I do think it's part of the commission's core mission. </p><p>HUTNIK:  Right. And I would just say that while the reports are well-read by private practitioners, it's the business guides that the clients use, the TSR business guidance the Green Guides, every one of those. I have some of those sections memorized as do some of my clients. </p><p>And so I think taking concepts like the 2012 privacy report and taking the Unfairness statement and really bringing it up-to-date, that would be relevant for the clients, the innovative clients that are thinking of how to use machine learning and using AI, and using facial recognition and having it consolidated in some ways where the topics overlap so that they can use that and not feel like they are targeted with gotcha enforcement down the line when they are trying to interpret necessarily flexible standards and to do the right thing. </p><p>VLADECK:  Well, and this goes back to the 6B question, which is in order to issue some of these guidance documents. For example, the use of biometrics in the marketplace. I think the commission might do well commission a study to get a sense of how widespread these practices are, where companies are going, what the immediate future looks like, because this is a topography that the commission needs to understand but I don't know whether it has the knowledge base today to issue a guidance document on these issues.</p><p>MURIS:  You know, I think I completely agree about guidance and the best guidance the commission gives is in mergers. And an area that's badly in need of guidance on the consumer side is data security. And there's enough investigations and cases. There's over, I think, 50 cases and probably at least half that many serious investigations to do maybe not a merger guide, but at least a commentary on the -- which the agencies did in the, I don't know, 2006, '07 timeframe. </p><p>Because -- and something that would be important would be to talk about as examples and that can -- parties can be disguised -- when the agency didn't act. That's really important information because the complaints have tended to be vaguer and vaguer over time. And data security guidance I think is badly needed.</p><p>SAYYED:  Okay. Well, let me ask if there's any reaction to that. If not, I'd turn to another topic. Well, this is -- this ties in to a question we got from the audience. I'll raise it in two ways. And I think this -- first, there's a common critique that the U.S. has lost or is losing its leadership role on antitrust policy globally, that what we see developing outside the U.S. is a model predicated on the framework of the European Union or European countries. And that this is being adopted by some of the newer agencies and newer countries. </p><p>I'd make the same point -- well, maybe slightly different as a question. What can we learn from the -- and is there a divergence between the U.S. and other agencies on the consumer protection side? So two-part question, right, why -- have we lost our leadership and why? And then what can we learn from other agencies both on the competition and consumer protection side? </p><p>RILL:  Let me start out with the competition side because I don't think I've done much consumer protection work since we put Joe Camel out to stud. The -- there is a challenge here in the global framework of competition agencies. I mentioned in my earlier remarks the recent speech by Mario Monti in effect claiming that the European methods of antitrust, the European foundations for antitrust were far superior to those in the United States. </p><p>The challenge has been there for a long time. I think there is a concern that there is a divergence of enforcement principles and due process principles, substantive as well as, procedure and substantive around the world. And one that's increasingly being affected. I think that the U.S. has not lost its attempt, its leadership in the sense of the work that's done within the ICN. Largely the U.S. pressure, for example, to put out -- the U.S. initiative that put out the guidance documents on due process for the agency effectiveness working group, U.S. leadership of the working party on (inaudible) cooperation in the OECD. </p><p>This had a profound effect and produced a major report on due process, so I think that we're not running up the white flag any time soon. I think it is responsible -- it is a responsibility of the U.S. in two areas to preserve I think leadership not only for, it's not America first. America first sometimes could be America not there. I think it's America trying to present some of the principles that have underlined antitrust enforcement in our country and in our -- in our jurisprudential base to try and put those across.</p><p>I think two areas where this can be done is continuing the guidance through the international organizations. And I think further attention should be given to the -- if you will, the moral suasion, the publicity effort that I think underlines initiatives such as Assistant Attorney General Delrahim's multilateral framework for antitrust procedure deserve attention. And I think the increasing use of bilateral agreements on competition policy, bilateral memoranda of understanding is a good way to go about it. </p><p>And I think also that the agencies need to be perhaps attuned more as they have somewhat in the past to actually engage in consultation and advocacy if you will, in particular instances where the agency, foreign agency seems to be departing from a globally accepted principle, procedure, or substance, and in effect didn't engage in consultation as provided for in a number of instrumental -- instruments of cooperation. </p><p>I think those are important. I think the final point that the agencies need to be concerned about, the United States need to be concern about is the problem sometimes of an agency action being misused by a foreign agency that say, \"Well, you're doing it so we can do it.\" There's a lot of copycat misuse of U.S. agency. We need to be -- the U.S. agencies need to be conscious of the risk of that copycat. Recent article by Koren Wong-Ervin, Josh Wright lists a number of areas where that's happened following up on some, actually some consents being used as an expression of law. Bosch, for example, Motorola Mobility -- GoogleMotorola Mobility by foreign agencies as well. The U.S. -- this is an expression of U.S. law. They misuse that and have that as a copycat for the misapplication of antitrust law. </p><p>MURIS:  I want to take that and ask Jason a question. I know he's doing a lot of work on artificial intelligence and I assume big data is part of that. And, Jason, is what's going on overseas, is that important for the U.S. and what should the -- what should the FTC do about those issues? </p><p>FURMAN:  I'll -- can tell you the answer in like six months, but for now, I mean I think a lot of the issues around big data, the -- I think the empirical question that I don't know the answer to is -- talking about before is, if you think there's diminishing returns to data, then you're a lot less worried about it than if you think there's some region of increasing returns. And there's -- you know, people do computer science and say with machine learning when you get past a certain point, you get to this place where you can do the AI in a certain way that you couldn't do before you got to that scale. </p><p>If you have that, then I think you have -- do have to start to worrying about data becoming a barrier to entry, that there will be some large economies of scale in the machine learning AI space. And that you have to try to look at issues about who owns, for example, and something consumers may overlook and not fully understand and have those property right defined more properly. </p><p>On the other side of argument, the -- in a world where you think it's intangible capital producing things rather tangible capital makes it easier to enter and anyone can come up very little computer algorithm and enter the market. So I think this -- in question of, is it just a really cheap -- the AlphaGo reinforcement learning, the latest iteration of it that DeepMind did isn't that long or complicated a program, doesn't actually use any data. It just plays itself and generates the data, anyone in this room could have done it although none of you did. </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  No, we couldn't. </p><p>FURMAN:  But -- and so if technology is like that, then I think we don't need to be that worried. Anyone in a garage can do it. If technology is this increasing returns to data, then I think we do need to be more worried and I -- I don't know which, so I apologize. </p><p>SAYYED:  Thank you. I'll use that as a plug. We are doing two days on big data at American University's Washington College of Law in early November and two days on AI, artificial intelligence algorithms at Howard University's School of Law in the middle of November. So maybe you can come back, that would be great. </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Let me just be clear. Algorithmic collusion is a whole different issue from the...</p><p>SAYYED:  Yes. </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  ... big data one and another. </p><p>SAYYED:  Exactly. Although we are having some difficult separating out the people to do one or the other, but anyway. No, we're going to devote a lot of time to it. And that was a key -- one of the things the Pitofsky Report did was just sort of think about things that were going to come up over the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years and that's part of what we're doing on -- in that space. </p><p>Let me -- Jason, because you have to leave, I hope this doesn't put you on the spot, but I wanted to raise it since you are doing some platform-related work since you mentioned you're doing some platform-related work. To go back to merger law and you may have less familiarity with the doctrine, but to get your thoughts on this. </p><p>How should we think about acquisitions of new technologies by established players? Sometimes we use the term nascent competition or nascent competitors, but it's sort of -- it's something we're going to spend at least an afternoon on and maybe while you're here if you have some thoughts. </p><p>FURMAN:  Yes, no, absolutely. And you're creating a real incentive to leave panels early. I think (inaudible) It's working out really well for me. I think that's a really important issue. I think there's a sort of longstanding view that everything in technology is evolving so quickly that there's no point enforcing anything, because by the time you do, it's changed and there's some new competitor. And MySpace has disappeared or Internet Explorer has been dethroned or whatever else. </p><p>I think there's something to that. I think there's a lot of irreversibility, too, though. It's easier to stop an acquisition now and change your mind five years from now and allow it than it is to take a company that's already acquired and split it up. The second is basically impossible. The first, the cost of making an error in not allowing the acquisition may not be that high if you can change it later. </p><p>So there's a little bit under uncertainty, of literature and economics, there's an option value of waiting when you're making irreversible decisions and allowing a merger is one. I think you have to figure out how to think not just about market share but about the ecosystem as a whole, and if you are buying up something that could be a competitor later, then I think you're affecting the ecosystem and something that, prices, especially if there are no headline prices isn't a useful guide to market share, isn't a useful guide to -- but it's competition for creating a type of market and ecosystem. So I think that does require a new thinking and probably under that option value of waiting the uncertainty is an argument for more, not for less in those cases. </p><p>SAYYED:  Okay. Let me ask if anyone has a reaction to that. We're going to have a whole afternoon of reaction to that. Okay. Okay. Well, not to kick Jason off, but I want to thank Jason for coming. </p><p>MCDAVID:  Thank you, Jason.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>SAYYED:  He made a special effort to be here. So let me -- we -- unless members on the panel want to ask each other some questions. We have a number of questions from the audience and I don't want to be too selective because we did ask for questions, but I would like to get to them, so if people are ready, we'll do it. And Jason did leave in just the right time. </p><p>But maybe others could think about this either narrowly or more broadly. How -- and here's the question, how do we analyze -- how do we analyze the harm to small businesses who rely on large platforms to reach new customers in ways they never could before? So that may touch on two specific topics. </p><p>MURIS:  Yes, that sounds like a benefit, not a harm, if they're using these platforms to reach people that they never did before. Look, obviously there are a whole set of rules, disclosures, consumer protection rules. It's important that the -- just from a simple contract law standpoint that the contracts not be devised unilaterally as they sometimes can be, which is an obvious problem under contract law.</p><p>One of the things I'm surprised with is the number of times people bring me antitrust issues that are really contract law issues. I used to teach contract law. I don't think in the big picture sense that the platform -- so-called platform issues need to be analyzed any differently. The toolkit we have is perfectly adequate and it goes back decades when the -- you know, when the new industries were evolving. We're talking about going back to the 1990s. </p><p>SAYYED:  I took a little bit of this question. We focused on the use of antitrust to protect small businesses and I wonder if other folks have additional comment on that question. Is that a proper role for antitrust or is it just too hard for us to measure that particular factor in our analysis? </p><p>MCDAVID:  I share Tim's criticisms of the Robinson-Patman Act. I try to give those questions when they come up to someone else in the office. Or I tell my clients that whatever the right answer is, the Robinson-Patman answer is the other side of it. </p><p>VLADECK:  Let me just add one thing. You know, dealing with platforms is an issue that rises both -- on both sides of the building. For example, I mean, one of the ironies in the Google investigation were the companies that were complaining about anti-competitive conduct were the very companies that wouldn't have exist but for Google. And that interaction becomes very challenging. </p><p>Also some of the platforms raise serious consumer protection issues because they are essentially bazaars selling multiple products on the same page. And so questions about deception, who's responsible for the deception arise with some frequency. So I think one un-sort of-met challenge on both sides of the building is what do we do about platforms? I mean, we do have -- there are certain immunities for baseline content, but that doesn't really resolve some of the consumer protection problems and some of the antitrust issues that arose, for example, in the Google investigation. </p><p>HUTNIK:  I would just add. On the consumer protection side, we're talking about platforms and responsibilities and, David, I hear you earlier in terms of talking about the limited resources for enforcement, some of the things that we've seen is deputizing platforms to be responsible for those that they let into the bazaar, and that may be all well and good but there's a lot of interpretation and a lack of guidance on what is reason oversight and monitoring, what's scalable, and not doing a gotcha on that. </p><p>VLADECK:  And they're all fair questions. </p><p>HUTNIK:  So if we go towards that point, what I would strongly encourage thoughtfulness is what are the standards to avoid third party monitoring whether it's a safe harbor, whether it's other types of incentivizing, but clarity on those points. </p><p>SAYYED:  Let me -- okay. Any other comments on that? Let me turn to a question that is -- I think I'll direct it to everybody. It's a similar question. So the question says that former Chairman Muris mentioned imperfect information in contrast to behavioral economics. But in standard economic models, imperfect information causes transactions not to happen. It does not cause buyers to be fooled. </p><p>So here -- I think here's the question. Aren't buyers sometimes simply fooled and should they protected for being fooled? Or from being fooled? I think that's both a consumer protection and in some ways a competition question but I'll turn it over to David first. </p><p>VLADECK:  The answer is yes. The commission has struggled with what is a reasonable consumer and what percentage of consumers must be deceived by a message, but the mission of the commission is to prevent deception in the marketplace and Tim and I may disagree at the margins about this but I agree with Tim's fundamental point, that the core mission of the agency is to protect against fraud. And the statute doesn't really use the word fraud, it uses deception. </p><p>And I -- that's -- in my view, that's always been the core mission of the agency. The first cases the agency brought consumer deception cases. They were the sale of silk which was really cotton and it was sold C-I-L-K. And those were literally the first enforcement cases the commission brought. So, historically that's been at the center of the agency's mission. </p><p>HUTNIK:  I would also just add to that. We have to reconcile with the reasonable consumer and the gullible consumer standard, and one of the other parts of the FTC's mission is consumer education, and particularly as we go through the emerging marketplaces and people are learning even about those marketplaces, consumer education plays a key role on that, so that we don't dilute the reasonable person standard.</p><p>MURIS:  I agree with both of those points and let me take the economic modeling part of that. It almost 60 years since Ronald Coase's famous article and the applications of that are all about transactions costs. And shortly thereafter, George Stigler won his Nobel Prize in significant part for discussing that advertising was an extremely powerful tool for the elimination of ignorance. Well, obviously there's -- if there's ignorance, we're talking about a world with transaction costs and that's the world in which you need an FTC enforcement, as I was talking about. </p><p>And so the whole -- this straw man that you -- in the popular press, that economists talk about these automatons who only react, consumers with perfect knowledge who only react to price. That just hasn't been proven in any sensible economic application to what the FTC does for decades. </p><p>SAYYED:  Okay. Well, thank you. Let me follow up on a point David made as well about a bureau of technology in the FTC. I'm going to depart a little bit from the question, but ask, first of all, to the other panelists think about that, is it something that's relevant on both the antitrust side of house as well as the consumer protection side of the house? </p><p>And what might it look like and I raise that, maybe it's a little unfair because I didn't raise it earlier but we have, David was a bureau director, Tim as well as being chairman was a bureau director. How do you set up these things for success, really? That's maybe my question. </p><p>VLADECK:  I defer to someone who's the chair -- the chairman. I think that would be the chairman's mission, not -- I mean I think it would be important to retain some of the technology infrastructure in the bureaus. I mean much of what the Bureau of Consumer Protection uses technologists for are forensics for investigations, but there are a lot of, there's a lot of value to having access to skill technicians for the policy issues that the agency is going to have to confront moving forward. Biometric identification, things like that. These are difficult technical questions.</p><p>MURIS:  Look, the bureaus are complementary. They're not substitutes. As the only person ever to head both of them, they are significantly different. They're different in their personalities, they're different in the career paths. And they are, in many ways, autonomous, and it's important -- let me give you an anecdote. I wanted the Bureau of Consumer Protection to do more in working with criminal authorities. And I unfortunately insulted them and told them that they were being -- they were too self-satisfied. Those were not the words I used. </p><p>And I regrouped and after about a year, they decided it was their idea. And they now have a very successful criminal liaison unit which, of course, they take complete -- a hundred percent credit for which is fine with me. And it was a mistake on my part to criticize them in the first place, but it's a wonderful organization. It reminds me of working in OMB in the old days where you have people who -- it's their career. And it's not as transitory as the Bureau of Competition, but embedding in the bureau like David says would be a very sensible way to go. Anybody else? </p><p>Anybody else? Okay. I will answer one of the questions. There is a reference in the question to the Office of Technology Research and Investigation, what we call OTEC which does sit in BCP. Question is, why this is unit insufficient to get the job done now? Without commenting too much on whether it's insufficient or what job they are focused on, we are -- it is a very small group and more resources would probably be appreciated by the chair, by the commissioners, and even by the bureau directors. </p><p>So maybe I'll end with a question that maybe I have, and it's a real question given the difficulty of managing agencies, do you think the FTC should have more resources to do its mission, and maybe how would you, if you were to allocate those resource, how would allocate them? So I have no particular -- I'd like the private perspective as well as the, the folks who have not been at the agency as well as folks who have been at the agency to maybe give some thought to it. </p><p>RILL:  I think a question like that to be addressed by is like asking the Protestant minister what he thought about the latest papal encyclical. But when I was at the division, one of our major efforts was to enhance the workforce at the division, both from the standpoint of law and economics. And it was shorthanded when I got there and we were able to build it up and I think increase the efficacy of the agency with more resources. </p><p>It is difficult to get those kinds of resources with all the other budgetary demands and we ran into a number of problems. Partly solved by the filing fee issue, but I think the agencies do need, but certainly the division needed more resources at that time sensibly used and sensibly coordinated. The commission I leave to the people who've worked there. </p><p>MURIS:  Well, I have a long-running view about this and when -- in '81 when we came in, we were asked to reduce resources. The way to think about it is FTE, we put the agency on a path from 1800 to 1200. And that's where it was when we -- in the mid 1980s. </p><p>When I came back in 2001, I asked for a comparison with the mid 1980s and Bob had had about a thousand and it turned out, in professionals, a thousand and 1200 were about the same, very small difference. And what had happened, there was a lot of outsourcing and a lot of productivity improvements. Technology had had a significant effect. I think the agency is up to 1150, something like that.</p><p>RILL:  That's right. </p><p>MURIS:  And I don't know how that compares with 2001. I suspect there have been some more productivity improvements, probably not as dramatic as in the 1990s. But Bob did a hell of a job with a thousand. I think we're headed for another retrenchment era, so I think it's probably wishful thinking to ask for significantly more resources, and besides the people, there's -- BCP, for example, has a significant infrastructure burden that we managed to satisfy with the money from Do Not Call which we used for building up the infrastructure for Do Not Call, which was very helpful for the rest of the agency. </p><p>But I think at the present, the present rate strikes me as significantly more, we ended up about 1260, about 1060. And I thought we did a lot. I thought Bob did a lot, so I'm not -- I don't think more resources are in the cards and I think they're doing a lot with what they've got.</p><p>HUTNIK:  This is not from an internal perspective but I think it's all about the priorities, right, where do you want to focus the resources that you have. And some of the themes from today were -- we have division of enforcement and we need more manpower in terms of business guidance and I think to not get distracted by calls for regulation which would take a whole bunch of people off of doing some of those things now. That may not be as productive. </p><p>MCDAVID:  Speaking only on the competition side, the lawyers and economists with whom I work regularly at the commission are incredibly dedicated and hardworking. The general populace has a view of government employees that is deprecating, and it's not fair. They do yeoman's work. They work weekends, they work nights. And a lot of the competition mission is consumed with things they can't predict. What's the merger wave going to be? All of which are time-sensitive. So they have to at least retain the kinds of resources they've got because you'll burn them out. </p><p>VLADECK:  Yes, I would argue for more resources. I understand Tim's argument and I realize this is probably swimming against the tide, but since the 2001 or 1981, Congress has added considerable workload to the agency, and changes in the marketplace have required the agency to do more work. The Bureau of Consumer Protection at its height when I was there and I don't think we've added any resources to it had fewer than 450 people, including most of the people in the regions. </p><p>People work extremely hard. They're incredibly dedicated, but there are lots of people with fingers in the dikes and the water is just coming over the transom. So I would urge the commission to think about asking for an increase in resources. And I think -- of course, most of it should go to BCP, but I think the agency could well use a couple hundred more FTEs. </p><p>SAYYED:  Okay. Well, I think we'll conclude right there. We were on -- targeted for 11:45 and I think this is where we are. Before we conclude, I'd like to thank a bunch of people. First, I thank the panelists including Jason who had to leave very much for devoting some time and effort to this. I'd like to thank my colleagues in the Office of Policy Planning who have been working very hard on what will probably be about 20 days of sessions, and this is only five percent of the way through once we're done today. They're just a wonderful crew to work with and I'm very proud to work with them. And I think have the best job at the commission. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And finally, thank also the staff of the executive director for helping put this thing together, and you'll see more of it this afternoon, but I won't be on stage, I wanted to put that out there. And then thank everybody for showing up and paying attention. We'll be back here at 1:30, so if you come here slightly before, that'd be great. There's a cafeteria across the courtyard if people want to eat law school food. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But it's good. It's better than I remember. So hope to see you back here slightly before 1:30.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(RECESS)</p><p>SAYYED:  Start it in a -- in a minute or so. Let people coming in if they're trying to hit the 1:30 mark. </p><p>Okay. I'm just going to say welcome back, and remind people in the audience or new people that two of my colleagues, maybe more, are collecting questions that you may write on the question card, and they'll be brought up to the panel the end of the panel for some audience Q and A. </p><p>So, with that, I'm going to turn this over to Greg Werden from the Antitrust Division, and he's going to discuss with the panel whether the U.S. economy has become more concentrated and less competitive. </p><p>WERDEN:  Thank you. I'm not a fan of introductions, so I will not introduce our speakers, they can introduce themselves if they want to spend their time that way, that they have total control over their time. The way we're going to organize this is Jon is going to give a long slide presentation and then each of our other panelists will give much shorter presentations, and they will go to a series of questions that I pose, and then finally questions from the audience. So, Jon. </p><p>BAKER:  Thank you. Thank you, Greg. And nice to see all my co-panelists, and thank you Bilal, and the FTC for inviting me, I was involved in the hearings in 1980 -- '95, and I'm delighted to be back for the -- for these today. </p><p>So, the FTC hearings two decades ago that I just referred to, were spurred by two challenges for antitrust policy. Markets were becoming increasingly global and innovation competition was becoming increasingly important. And today, we have an additional challenge for antitrust policy, the economic evidence has been accumulating since the 1995 hearings and much of it for the past five years or so, that shows that market power has been growing for decades. And I think of what we're seeing as today's antitrust paradox, a conjunction of substantial and widening market power with well-established and extensive antitrust institutions. </p><p>Oh, what's with that one? All right. So, in my presentation I'll sketch the evidence that market power has been growing over the past quarter century and has become substantial in the United States. And I'm going to go through nine reasons, none of them is individually decisive, there are ways to question or push back on each, but their weaknesses are all, are different. </p><p>And so if -- so when you take them collectively, they paint a compelling picture of growing market power. And I'm also going to explain why the recent economic trends I point to reflect growing market power, not solely increased scale economies and temporary rents to early adopters of new technologies in competitive markets. </p><p>And to fit my presentation into the allotted time, I will say less about most of the reasons than will appear on the slides. And the very last slide will reference my forthcoming book, the first chapter of which goes into more detail on this topic including full cites for the research that's referenced on the slides. And it will also mention criticisms of the research that I don't have time to bring up in my presentation, although I'd be happy to talk about them during our discussion with, later. </p><p>Before I get into the nine reasons, I want to make clear what I mean when I use the term market power. Firms exercise market power in their output markets as sellers by raising prices or by altering other terms of trade adversely to buyers relative to what would prevail in a competitive market. Market power is not just about prices, it can be exercised on other competitive dimensions, too. And market power can also be exercised in input markets, exercised by buyers, and that's defined analogously. </p><p>The first of the nine reasons to think that market power has been growing is that we insufficiently deter anticompetitive coordinated conduct. The Justice Department keeps on covering cartels year after year. They seem to form at the same rate that we catch them. And that suggest under-deterrence because the penalties are probably too low to deter collusion, and there's no reason to think that the threat of penalties chills pro-competitive conduct or leads to excessive compliance expenditures. And under-deterred express cartels are probably the tip of an iceberg, because tacit collusion is probably even harder to deter. </p><p>We also insufficiently deter anticompetitive mergers and there's several empirical studies that support this conclusion. Now, what happened here? Did I hit a wrong button? All right. I need a tech guy -- there we go. Okay. The third reason is insufficient deterrence of anticompetitive exclusion. Since the late 1970s, the courts have targeted rules governing exclusionary conduct for extensive relaxation, and in some cases the new rules conferred de facto legality on such conduct. </p><p>The empirical evidence that exclusion is under-deterred is about the competitive effects of vertical practices. Now, vertical conduct an exclusionary conduct are not the same thing, but there are correlated, and the evidence shows that vertical restraints often support collusion and there are a number of examples of competitive harm from vertical restraints and vertical integration. </p><p>That interpretation -- oops, let me go back here. Yes. That interpretation of the literature on vertical conduct may surprise some of you. So, I want to make an important methodological point. Most empirical studies about the effects of vertical restraints are looking in the wrong place to learn about whether stronger antitrust enforcement would be beneficial. </p><p>If you want to know whether oligopolists can use vertical restraints to harm competition, you won't learn much by looking at markets with competitive structures or in markets where the firms could be deterred but from anticompetitive conduct with a threat of antitrust enforcement. Looking in those kind of markets lets you learn about potential pro-competitive consequences, and about ways that firms can craft their vertical arrangements to limit the inefficiencies and costs that they may impose. </p><p>Now, you might see some instances in which vertical restraints harm competition, but the markets aren't randomly selected, you'd expect in general the studies would not often find harm to competition, even if the conduct could be harmful in other settings that are not being studied, where one might want to think about antitrust enforcement. </p><p>And you're not going to learn much about whether relaxing antitrust constraints has or would lead to greater competitive harm. If you want to identify the effects of antitrust enforcement in the econometric sense, you have to compare outcomes with and without antitrust constraints, and the -- there's a McKay Smith study that's in the small print on the slide of -- about resale price maintenance, and that's a rare example of a study of a vertical restraints that addresses this identification problem. And it finds it on the whole, competition was harmed when the antitrust constraints on resale price maintenance were relaxed. </p><p>Fourth, market power is durable, markets are not invariably self-correcting, cartels and monopolies often last a long time. The eight-year lower bound on the length of the average cartel compares favorably with the time it takes to create -- to correct rather, erroneous judicial precedents, even Supreme Court decisions through later court decisions that overrule them or narrow them procedurally, or substantively, or through lower court decisions that distinguish or limit them, or through legislative abrogation. </p><p>Our fifth, the increased equity ownership of rival firms by diversified financial investors is another reason to worry about growing market power. Rival airlines, or banks, or pharmacy chains, or other competing firms increasingly have overlapping ownership by financial firms like Blackrock, State Street, Fidelity, and Vanguard. The initial studies have found that common ownership leads to higher prices, and this is an active research area where we're likely to learn more soon. </p><p>Sixth, increased governmental restraints on competition. Over the past few decades, the U.S. has broadened patent scope substantially, and granted too many patents after inadequate review. This trend may have halted, but it's not really been reversed. And other examples of governmental restraints that may be on the rise include occupational licensing and lobbying to limit rivalry. </p><p>All right. The seventh is the rise of dominant information technology platforms. Now, the empirical evidence suggests that price cost margins have been growing economy-wide since 1990 in the United States. And the trend seems clear, although the magnitude of the margin increases has not been measured precisely. </p><p>Growing price cost margins are probably tied to investments in information technology. Dominant information technology and internet platforms aren't the only firms making those kind of investments, or likely exercising some market power as a result. But the platforms are an important part of the story, because they're likely insulated from competition in some of their major markets. </p><p>All right. So, eighth. Oligopolies are common and concentrations increasing in many industries. The best evidence that increasing concentration allows firms to exercise more market power comes from studies of particular industries like airlines, brewing, and hospitals. The economy-wide evidence on concentration suggests only modest increases in concentration and in many -- and many industries with rising concentration remain unconcentrated. </p><p>But the economy-wide evidence is less reliable than the industry specific studies and that's because the economy wide studies often use broad product markets when it would be better to look for competitive problems in more narrow markets. And they often use national markets when it would be better to look at regional or local markets. </p><p>Now, some of the evidence involving broad national aggregates is consistent with rising overall concentration, but could instead reflect increased multi-market contact. But that could equally raise competitive concerns about coordination. And there are recent studies that also find concentration is high and possibly growing in many labor markets, potentially making it more possible for businesses to exercise monopsony power to depress wages. </p><p>The final reason to think that market power has been increasing is a decline in economic dynamism. And Jason Furman highlighted this reason this morning. Growing market power is a leading explanation or a plausible contributing explanation for a range of economic trends. A secular slowdown in business investment, rising profits as a share of U.S. GDP, a slowed rate at which firms expand when they become more productive, a declining rate of startups, a shift in growth and productivity gains from entrants to incumbents, and a growing gap in accounting profitability between the most and the least profitable firms. </p><p>So I've interpreted the evidence in these nine categories that I highlighted as indicating growing market power. And I want to explain now I think that's a better interpretation of the most plausible alternative, namely increased scale economies and temporary returns to the first firms to adopt new information technologies in competitive markets. </p><p>Now the benign alternative has an initial plausibility, because the efficient size of firms has likely grown over time in many industries, as a result of the high fixed costs of investments in information technology, network effects, and an increased scope of geographic markets. That means that firms could grow larger, and concentration could rise, and price cost margins could increase even if markets are competitive. And in addition, the first firms to invest in new information technologies might earn substantial rents which should be temporary if those investments don't confer market power and their rivals follow suit with investments of their own. </p><p>But the first six reasons I gave for thinking market power is substantial and widening in the U.S. cannot be reconciled with the benign alternative, anticompetitive coordination, mergers, and exclusion are under-deterred, market power is durable, and increased equity ownership of rivals by financial investors of the -- well, can soften competition, and governmental restraints on competition have grown. </p><p>Also, market power is a better interpretation in the benign alternative for the other three reasons. The growth of dominant platforms probably does owe a lot to scale economies and first mover advantages. But those platforms may still have the ability to exercise market power by excluding rivals. Scale economies and rents to early adopters of new technologies probably did contribute to rising concentration in various industries. </p><p>But there's often independent evidence that the firms in those concentrated markets exercise market power, which is not surprising because the same fixed expenditures that make scale economies and rents to movers possible can deter entry and soften competition. </p><p>Now, some of the evidence for the loss of economic dynamism could be consistent with the benign alternative of growing scale economies and returns to early adoption of new technologies in competitive markets, as well as consistent with increasing market power. And that might include the rising profit share of GDP and the growing gap in accounting profitability between the most in the least profitable firms. </p><p>But other aspects of declining dynamism cannot be reconciled with the benign alternative. The benign interpretation assumes that profits rise because markets are increasingly dynamic, with higher rates of entry, investment, and business failure. In competitive markets, growing scale economies yield higher profits because entrants have a greater risk of failure when fewer firms can succeed. </p><p>Early adopters of new technologies would earn profits, but they'd be temporary, competed away by new or expanding rivals making their own investments. But the benign interpretation is inconsistent with the evidence showing the reverse, a slowing rate of new entry, a declining rate of expansion when firms and plants grow more productive, and a secular slowdown in business investment. </p><p>And in addition, the financial markets appear to view corporate profit streams is less risky than in the past, and yet if markets are increasingly dynamic as the benign alternative supposes, those streams would be viewed as riskier. The bottom line is that growing market power is a better explanation for declining dynamism, and for all nine reasons taken as a whole, than the alternative of increasing scale economies and early adopter rents in competitive markets. The benign alternative might -- may well be a partial explanation, but increasing market power is likely an important part of the story too.</p><p>Now, I don't need to spend much time with this audience explaining what's wrong with market power. The harms within markets are described on the slide from a partial equilibrium perspective within an industry, within a market, the harms that they can arise regardless of whether market power is exercised by sellers or buyers. </p><p>Market power can also harm the economy as a whole by slowing economic growth and increasing inequality. And the adverse economic consequences of the exercise of market power could be reinforced if firms and industries can use their market power to secure political power, and use their political power to protect or extend their economic advantages. </p><p>So, just to summarize, the evidence I presented shows that market power has been growing in the U.S. economy for decades. From an error cost point of view, we've learned that we are deterring anticompetitive conduct less than we thought we were in 1995 when the FTC last held hearings. And that means we should take steps now to strengthen our antitrust rules, institutions and enforcement. And, Greg, I think I'm going to reserve my remainder of time for rebuttal. </p><p>WERDEN:  I'm sorry. You have to check in with the clerk before you start talking. If you've ever argued the Court of Appeals, that's the rule. </p><p>BERRY:  Oh, okay, good. </p><p>WERDEN:  Steve? </p><p>BERRY:  Okay, good. So we got new slides here. </p><p>WERDEN:  Yes.</p><p>BERRY:  Good. Okay. I want to give a talk that -- only about six minutes that I think is complementary to what Jonathan is talking about. And I want to talk about what kind of evidence we should weigh more or less as we're looking at this debate. And in particular, I think that Jonathan's mix of evidence was quite different than the evidence you often see in presentations in the -- in the press, by macroeconomists, and by other non-specialists. And I wanted to indicate what some of those distinctions are so that we can think about what evidence is the most convincing, and also what kind of things we'd like to look forward to in the future. </p><p>So, I'm going to divide things a little bit starkly into good and bad. And to talk about the relative bad, I want to go all the way back to the year 1989. And in the year 1989, there were two I think magisterial chapters that were published in the handbook of IO. One by Dick Schmalensee and one by Tim Bresnahan and Dick Schmalensee was a participant in and a sympathetic observer of decades worth of work that did something like what people are doing today, which is try to look at the correlation of various outcomes like prices and markups with measures of concentration like the Herfindahl Index. </p><p>And his chapter laid out a whole host of problems with that, but I want to emphasize particularly one. The Herfindahl Index in particular is probably better thought of as the cause of market competition, an interesting summary statistic of what is going on rather than as an effect that causes outcomes. The Herfindahl Index itself is a function of market shares, which one function of outputs which are codetermined simultaneously with price. </p><p>The most famous example that people used in those days is that differences in firm heterogeneity where, cost heterogeneity where you had some firms with very low prices, that those low marginal cost would feed into their market shares, their market shares feed into the Herfindahl Index, but their low marginal costs also flow into markups, and you see a positive correlation between markups and concentration that has to do with efficiency rather than with competition. That's the problem of simultaneity, the problem that in this case, correlation is not causation, and we should be very skeptical I think of these studies that in some ways naively regress an outcome on a Herfindahl Index. </p><p>Now, some people in this literature I think are actually quite aware of this, and they think of this is a problem with the Herfindahl Index itself, is correlated with other things, is endogenous, they look for purely statistical ways of dealing with that endogeneity, they look for what's called an instrumental variable or just a more plausible exogenous variation in market structure. </p><p>And that brings me to the second of those great handbook chapters written by Tim Bresnahan, and what he pointed out is that even if we grant that you have discovered the true causal effect say of the number of firms on price, you haven't established anything about the role of markups, either on the output side or on the input side. </p><p>And let me just give you one example of that. I teach freshman micro, and on the third day, we teach them that supply slopes up, and there are a bunch of shifters, among them are the number of firms that shift supply back and forth, and that's because of the upward sloping marginal cost curves of the individual firms. </p><p>Demand slopes down, as you move the number of firms to the supply curve, moves against that demand curve, and it shows that as the number of firms goes up supply shifts out, prices fall. In the perfectly competitive output market, decrease in concentration drops prices. But there are no markups, you haven't found evidence of markups, you may have found evidence of increasing marginal cost. </p><p>The same thing happens on the input side, it is an implication of the perfectly competitive model of wage determination that an increase in the number of firms will drive wages up. That's not evidence of monopsony power. What Bresnahan said is that we actually have to separately consider demand and cost and competition. And we can't do that and one equation or one correlation. </p><p>I think that kind of evidence with -- by the way did not feature greatly in conference discussion, should be downweighted a lot, right? We thought it died with the publication of these two chapters 25 years ago, and some of us woke up and were a little startled to see it suddenly outside of our window looking in, and that's trouble. </p><p>I want to talk for just two minutes about possible alternatives. One is just to look at, directly the facts of policy that have changed, and what effect did they have, we can learn about policy that way. Let me skip a couple slides though. Another thing though is to back away for one minute, to back away form -- for one minute from causation, and just think about measurement, what has happened to markups, and we heard about these papers just a minute ago. I think they do show that regardless of cause, our best evidence is that markup are going up. It's sensitive to measurement like whether you include certain intangible and fixed costs in that or not. </p><p>But that kind of simple descriptive cross-industry measurement is very valuable for telling us what has happened, but not why, not why. So, I think ultimately, we're going to have to do what Jonathan suggested, we're going to have to do studies of individual important industries and ask what is going on. So, here's an example a graduate student of mine did as a -- as a part of his thesis. He looked up the wholesale sector, that's pretty important, that's a pretty important sector, right? And what does he find? Concentration is up, aha, concentration is up. </p><p>On the other hand, output is up, that doesn't sound like monopolization, does it? Output is up. The product itself has changed, multi-warehouse wholesalers are locating closer to their customers, they're investing in IT for logistics, they're dual sourcing goods, you can shop between China and the United States with one stop at a wholesaler. The nature of the good is changing. And when you put this to a Bresnahan-like series of models, you'll see that markups are going up in the industry just like in the cross industry analysis, but for a mix of all of the reasons that Jonathan mentioned, not for one or the other, but for all of them. </p><p>Product quality is going up, that's pushing prices up that pushes margins up. The marginal cost is going down as firms get better logistics and locate closer to their customers, marginal cost is falling, that's efficiency, but markups go up, competition is really going down. And that also contributes to the markup effect. </p><p>Why don't we see the entry that Jonathan talked about? Implicitly there must be fixed costs or some costs that are preventing new entrants from somehow competing away these profits. It's costly to build all of those plants near your rivals and that's a sunk cost, and it's very hard for that to be competed away. </p><p>This is a complicated story. And what I want to finish with is a substantive hypothesis. What if this is true in broader sections of the economy, what if it's happening in broader sections, not just wholesale, maybe IT, maybe other parts of retail, maybe broad sectors of the economy, that firms for endogenous reasons or changing their production methods and their -- and the quality of their products so that marginal cost is falling and fixed cost is rising. Markups are going up, concentration is going up. </p><p>If that's happening in a broad scale way, it doesn't seem just that big is bad, but we're way, also, we're way far from the theory of perfect competition as well. We're in this very complex setting where there's some good and bad things happening, like Jonathan, it's not just economies of scale, there are other things too, there are competitive effects as well. We can't just wave our hands and say it's all fine. </p><p>I also don't think we can just simply say, big is bad. And I think it's these better kinds of evidence, these descriptive studies at the broad level and causal studies that are within industry level that we ought to emphasize, and I think are the ones that are going to eventually tell us what the correct policy path forward is, and these guys are better policy experts than I am, so I'm mostly going to listen for the rest of time. </p><p>WERDEN:  Thanks very much, Steve. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WERDEN:  Good job. I'm not sure who's going next, but why don't -- why don't you do it? </p><p>WRIGHT:  Okay. There are a few of my students in the audience who are laughing at the idea that I'm going to do anything in six minutes. But let's give it a shot nonetheless. I think sort of extending the discussion from Jon and Steve to move on, probably start in the same place as Steve which is I went to grad school in economics and studied in IO in the early 2000s and those handbook chapters were sort of taken as the starting point for learning empirical IO, we didn't read studies that attempted to infer causations and changes to HHI on the effect on price, we read Steve's stuff. </p><p>I think the fundamental challenge in this area, and then I'll dive into the data is that while it is probably true that zombie IO economics has died in economics departments a long time ago, I think the fundamental challenge in part is making sure we don't get antitrust policy that adopts zombie IO, and I think that's a challenge for the agencies, I think it's a challenge for IO economists. because the punch line for some of this is going to be on the real questions that matter for designing policy, my interpretation of the evidence is that we know -- we know a lot less, and probably need to know a lot more before we start playing much with policies, I'll spend the rest of my time talking about that. </p><p>For starters, I think it's important to separate, we're going to talk about testable hypotheses, and testing with empirical data, I think it's really important for these discussions, Especially, if we're going to attach any policy relevance to them, to separate claims. One of the claims around is that we've got a rise in concentration at the aggregate sort of of non-market level, sort of really aggregated industry sectors, stuff made with metal, not necessarily just capturing firms that are competing against each other. </p><p>There's a second -- a second set of claims that try to do relationship between what's happening in markets, changes in concentration in markets, and relate those to a price or output or markets, so are we getting more or less competition. </p><p>And I think there's a third set of claims that is, is any of this caused by lax antitrust enforcement. I spend most of my time talking about why it is so important for discussion of antitrust policy that we focus on markets, and not sort of broad, aggregated sectors, that doesn't mean that the sector-based research isn't incredibly useful. It is, we learned things like at a rough level what's happening to markups over time, that is interesting as a descriptive matter. </p><p>We don't, and often these studies are used to sort of glom on causation and make claims about whether antitrust is doing too much or too little. The reason that we care fundamentally about markets and not sectors in antitrust is because the fundamental lesson of those IO handbook chapters, and I think most of modern IO in this area is that competition and concentration are different things. </p><p>Concentration can be caused by more competition. It can be caused by less competition. I think Steve had this as the Chicago critique on his slides, I'm at UCLA guy, I'm going to call it the Demsetz critique, or else I'll lose my Bruin lunch card. So, but the fundamental idea that we grapple with and what makes antitrust hard is that changes in concentration can be the outcome of more or less competition, that makes identification difficult. It makes broad claims about whether we have too much, or too little, or sort of goldilocks just right levels of concentration really difficult to do, and probably outside the scope of the ability of modern IO. </p><p>And that really was the lesson of sort of the big empirical revolution of IO in the 1970's and 1980's. So, punch line for me is I think a lot of the evidence that we see are attempts to do some of these broad industry sector stuff, where we do exactly what we learned not to do in the 1970s. We regress markups or price, or profit on really broad, aggregated industry data. And then the policy world sort of jumps on and make causal claims, and sort of we're off and running, and I think that's a dangerous place to be in. </p><p>There are attempts to do better work, there are attempts to do sort of more sophisticated merger retrospectives and tradeoff, the broad general insights, we're learning about one case, and maybe I think in discussion, we'll talk a little bit more about that. But my read of the evidence is at the aggregated sort of relationship between aggregated concentration and competition outputs, we don't know much that's relevant to formation of antitrust policy, I think there are interesting questions, I think it is important for modern sort of IO economists and for the agencies, for the FTC and the DOJ who have great collections of IO economists inside those buildings, to engage in answering those questions. </p><p>And I'd say, it's great that we all get to come up here and engage in those questions, but I'm hopeful that the economists inside the agency who are experts and have access to data, things like agency predictions in individual cases that they can test against data, that they're also an active participant in that discussion. </p><p>So, I think the real challenge moving forward is if you've got data that isn't what you need to have the type of discussion that you want to have about whether it is desirable to move policy one way or another, whether it's mergers or something else, the challenge I think both for the academy and for the agencies is to invest in producing those data, producing tools, producing studies to move the ball forward in that literature, because I certainly agree, there are interesting questions here that require investment and are sort of worth the time. I'll stop there. </p><p>WERDEN:  Fiona?</p><p>MORTON:  Great. Hello, everybody, and thanks to the FTC very much for being invited to contribute to this panel. I agree with both Jon and Steve on the IO research here. It seems very easy to run the wrong regression, to someone without a PhD, it looks tempting. We need to resist that temptation, because it is in fact just wrong. </p><p>But we need to find another way to answer the question, that's not an excuse for not answering the question. And as Josh said, concentration and competition are not the same thing, it's not actually I think very informative to learn about aggregate concentration in the United States, I'd like to know about competition in the United States. </p><p>And I think as Steve said, the markups are a good way to get there. I think the real reason that we're -- that there is consensus among a large fraction of the people who do this work for a living and the people who read the newspaper, that we have a competition problem in the United States comes not from papers published in academic journals, but from two main sources. </p><p>One is, for people who work in this area, the actual experience of litigating. So it took 23 years from the time the FTC first found a pay for delay agreement in the record to getting the Supreme Court to say, yes, under certain conditions those could be anti-competitive. </p><p>Twenty three years, and a pay for delay is when a branded monopolist pays the generic to stay out of its market, okay? That is pretty straightforward. It's exclusionary conduct, it harms consumers, it keeps prices very high, why did we have to wait a quarter of a century to get that practice banned, or it -- never mind banned actually, to get that practice scrutinized properly. </p><p>The American Express opinion by the Supreme Court completely misses the locus of competition between American Express and Discover. It's all about American Express' consumers versus the retailers and so on, and gives a complete miss to the issue of competition, which is what the antitrust laws are supposed to protect. </p><p>So when you look at litigation, and you look at what the agencies are trying to prove in the courts, it's all really heavy lift, and as Bill Baer said when he was at DOJ, why are some of the mergers we're reviewing even getting out of the boardroom? They're just obviously anticompetitive, and yet we had to litigate them anyway. So, I think that's one big area that we look to for evidence as to why there are anticompetitive effects. </p><p>A second one is our experience as consumers. Look around at hospitals, airlines, beer, media, big tech, I think people in the economy walk around buying things, and the experience they have is of less competition. And I think also consumers can get can easily confused between what is regulated and what's not. So, for instance, pharmaceutical prices and cable prices are not fundamentally something that antitrust can do a lot about, and yet those things are exhibiting less competition, also for the reason that Jonathan covered in his talk about lobbying to get government protection. </p><p>So, what's my response to this emerging consensus? We need to revisit the economics, and I will say this slowly because it's worth saying 25 times, and I don't have that long, so I'll just say it once slowly. Economic analysis is not the same thing as less enforcement, okay? Chairman Simons said it exactly right this morning. Economics is a tool, if you feed a set of facts into the economic analysis box, okay, you can come out of this merger is competitive or this merger is anticompetitive. It works beautifully, okay? </p><p>But what happened in 1975 as we applied economics to antitrust and we got the pendulum swinging down, okay? Arguably we had too much disorganized enforcement, the pendulum swung down, and now we have these things as sacred texts, and the answer is always if you believe in the sacred texts of Chicago, to enforce less. Obviously, if you enforce less for 30 or 40 years in a row, you're eventually going to pass the optimum, okay? And that's what we've done, I think. </p><p>And we need to recognize -- I luckily was too young to be part of that project, and so it's -- I mean, perhaps easier for me to see that we've well overshot the optimum. And that we need to go back and look at the economics fresh and try to get the right answer. And let me remind you all that there's a big drumbeat of dollars in favor of keeping those sacred texts, because the parties that have monopoly profit would like to keep the monopoly profit, and they will spend their monopoly profit to fund people who say that less enforcement is always better. </p><p>So it's a -- it's going to be difficult to achieve progress in this area, because the parties that have financially gained from less competition are going to work hard to keep their status. So I just want to alert all of you in the media and the enforcement community to be battling courageously for the consumer. </p><p>But I think that the bottom line is that we have the tools, and we have the ability to get the right answer, and we should use them, and we should not be trapped in paradigms from 30 years ago, because those are really outdated to the extent they were even correct 30 years ago, which I would not stipulate to. All right, that's all. </p><p>WERDEN:  Thank you. We're going to turn now to a series of questions that I will pose to our panelists, they've gotten the questions in advance, and actually done some negotiating. And there's a designated first answerer on each of the questions, but after that it's up to them to work it out. So, the first question which is directed initially to Josh, it goes like this. Jon's basic point is that we have more market power than we used to and that's bad. Assuming that we do have more market power than we used to, and that it's a significant increase in market power, my question is, do you agree that it's necessarily bad, and do you think something ought to be done about it? </p><p>WRIGHT:  First, no one ever told me there was negotiating. I always get -- I always get left out. So let me spend ten seconds fighting the premise and then I'll give up an answer. The question is sort of assuming arguendo, the increase in market power then sort of -- is that of -- is that a bad thing? And I think my ten seconds is almost up, but I will say I'm not sure that the premise has been established. But assuming per the question that it is, again, I think we get back to the fundamental point, and some of these old Chicago texts are pretty good including Demsetz's on the point about identification which I still think is very relevant to our discussions about concentration and price. </p><p>I have a feeling you meant a different one. But I think here, we don't know ex ante, and this is the fundamental problem whether increase -- we in antitrust want to care about changes in market power that are attributed -- attributable to reductions in competition. That is not all of the ways in which market power can be increased, if we want to do antitrust that is sort of consistent with IO, if we want to get the economics right, we need to have a set of tools that enables us to distinguish between those propositions. </p><p>So, what do I think can or should be done? There are simple answers floated around, we could have -- we could sort of go back, I don't think anyone here wants to do that, we could go back to really simple structural rules that equate competition and concentration. We could pool, dust off the 1968 merger guidelines, do antitrust with our fingers, count the firms, and pretend as if we can make causal inferences from changes from concentration to competition. </p><p>We could have bright line rules that have presumptions of liability if mergers are above and X share or above X dollars. We have one of those in the Supreme Court, I count that as one of the bad cases we ought to get rid of. But there's pending legislation that does something like this. </p><p>None of that I think is based in sound economics, so I think what we're left doing if we properly reject those ideas is making a serious investment, both in the academy and in the agencies to improving our tools and being able to answer better some of the questions that we struggle with now with identification. </p><p>I think we're starting that with merger retrospectives, I think if you look at the evolution of the way inside the agency empirical analysis of mergers happens now versus 10 years ago, much less 20 years ago, the improvement is remarkable, but I think it is a burden on the agencies and on the academy in these areas who like to publish journal papers and whatnot but sort of engage on these questions, both to fight against sort of oversimplified fixes that will probably do more harm than good, but also to subsidize investment in more knowledge to do a better job designing and calibrating policy with these questions. </p><p>WERDEN:  Anybody else? </p><p>MORTON:  Yes, I would disagree. I think we have the tools. I don't think we need to spend 10 years developing new tools. I think we could start now. There isn't anything wrong with our existing standards or economic analysis. I think the problem comes when you try to apply it. </p><p>So if you're in court and it's -- and the judge is taking the view of recent cases that we have seen, which is either ignoring the facts or ignoring the economic principles or not applying the horizontal merger guidelines, for example, in terms of are efficiencies merger specific, are they verifiable, are they cognizable. </p><p>I think that's where the problem comes and, of course, if an agency is confronted with -- at the end of the day, they disagree with the firms and they have to go to court, that's the outside option. And if you have a very weak hand when you go to court, then there's not much you can get as a settlement. So I don't think actually think we have a problem with the economics. I think we're ready to go there.</p><p>BAKER:  Greg, I don't know the rules on, like, random intervention so I'm going to make one in the absence of a rule. So the thing that I have in mind in terms of getting the -- I think we're all for getting the economics right. But, for example, some of these areas go the other way so it's not a Chicago text but in 1968, Oliver Williamson wrote a pretty well-known paper on efficiencies and mergers. </p><p>Fifty years later, there's not a single federal court decision -- no merging parties have prevailed on an efficiencies defense, so 50 years is a heck of a good winning streak. I agree parties sometimes do a bad job presenting efficiencies. I've been inside an agency -- but I think there are places where we could do better. That's one that comes to mind that sort of cuts the other direction. </p><p>WRIGHT:  The -- just on that last point, I just want to observe that if the overall overriding problem is we're worrying about growing market power, sure, there's a good -- there might be good government reasons to think about ways in which we could do reforms that avoid showing less beneficial conduct but there problem is to strengthen antitrust enforcement and that should be the overriding focus at the moment. </p><p>WERDEN:  All right. Let's move to the second question. You've heard from a number of our speakers today about the evidence of -- or related to increased corporate profits. This evidence seems fairly clear. The trend is worldwide. But it is more pronounced in the United States than elsewhere and here, the profits are highly concentrated in relatively few hugely successful companies. My question for the panel is -- and Jon's going to first on this one -- does the presence of a relatively small number of hugely successful technology companies in any way suggest a failure of antitrust?</p><p>BAKER:  So the answer is not per se. I mean a large and profitable firm size and successful alone doesn't mean antitrust has failed. Firms can and do grow large and become successful, you know, providing customers with valuable products and services and that includes large technology companies. We want to encourage firms to grow successful and profitable by offering better and cheaper products and services. </p><p>We should also be concerned if firms including large and successful ones exercise market power in some other major markets or threaten to do that through exclusionary conduct or collusive conduct or merger. Now, I pointed to the growth of dominant information technology platforms as a reason for concern about increasing market power because I think their high margins probably reflect market power in part, not because of their success per se. </p><p>BERRY:  Yes. So I think I would combine my answer a little bit to these last two questions which is that -- and the IT example is good. I think they have high markups, they have high profits. For many good reasons, they have high markups. I'd just sort of say it slightly opposite from Jon, it's not just market power. I think it's a combination of market power and doing things that people want and gaining efficiencies. And so it's not -- but as I said before, it's not bad per se but I do think it has implications for antitrust even if it's not bad per se. </p><p>Take two of these firms. Take two of my big wholesaling firms that have an overlapping set of locations. If the markups are already very high, the stakes for a merger become that much more severe because they're already operating on inelastic parts of their demand curve. So I think in many cases, we can sort of litigate whether it was bad -- whether we got here or not. And I personally think we're going to figure out -- it's a mix of things and we're going to say some bad and some good. </p><p>I think what I'm more interested in is the forward-looking discussion of what are the implications, now that we're here, is there something that we should be doing, is there a kind of scrutiny that we should be offering that we haven't offered before. And I'd really like to hear from my closer to practitioner colleagues what those things might be. </p><p>WERDEN:  You want to get in on this? </p><p>MORTON:  I'll answer it as answer to the next question you're about to ask me, how about that? </p><p>WERDEN:  Okay. That's fine. Next question. Steve sketched a scenario in which technology is changing in a way that increases the sunk costs and decreases the marginal costs of companies. That scenario rings true even if lots of other forces are at work. I would like to hear from the panelists on what they think likely accounts for the empirical observation of increased markups over the past four decades. </p><p>MORTON:  Okay. So I'm going to take the first half of that question and then Steve's question on what do you do enforcement-wise. I think what we need to do is adjust our enforcement analytics to fit the market structure as Steve suggested. So let's take, for example, the presence of network effects. Network effects are when the value of the product rises in the number of users. So a social media platform is more valuable to me, the more other people are on it. What do we get when we have network effects? We get concentrated market structures. Everybody wants to be on the same network because all their friends are there. </p><p>Okay. So we get market shares that go 99 percent and 1 percent or a few little epsilons. We don't see market structures of 70/30 or 50/50 in a world with network effects. Okay. So we necessarily are going to see concentrated markets. Is that a problem? No. As we've said already, just per se, just that fact, that's not a problem. </p><p>But we need to recognize that the locus of competition has shifted. Competition in that market does not display itself in the market. The 30 is not competing with the 70. No, it's competition for the market. Who is going to be the winner-take-all? Who is going to get to be the 99? There are some firms that start out together and one of them gets ahead and the market tips and that winner gets 99 percent.</p><p>Okay. So now that we know that the locus of competition is for the market, not in the market, how would we do antitrust? We would care an awful lot about entry. We would care an awful lot about potential competition. We would care an awful lot about acquisitions by the 99 percent of a teeny little epsilon percent. Why? Because that epsilon percent doesn't have a lot of share, but that's where the competition's coming from. That 99 percent guy is afraid the epsilon is going to become one and attract all the teenagers and there's going to be a flip. </p><p>Okay. So we care a lot about that little epsilon and that's where the competition's coming from and we need to dust off our theories of harm when it comes to potential competition. We need to stop investing so much importance in market share. The market share of the little guy is not big and when you calculate the Herfindahls, nothing's going to happen when you do this -- when you analyze this merger. Does that mean there was no competitive significance to this little player? Quite the contrary. </p><p>All those little players are the only ones that are making the 99 percent pedal faster and work harder to keep consumers because they're all potentially able to overthrow the incumbent. So that's a way in which we have standards, lessening competition and so on that work perfectly well in an internet platform or a network effects market. But we need to think about focusing our enforcement efforts at the place where the competition is, which is a little bit different in some of these markets than it would be historically in, say, automobiles. So I think there are big implications for antitrust enforcement and I would point people in that kind of direction. </p><p>WERDEN:  Do you want to weigh in, Josh? </p><p>WRIGHT:  I think I agree with probably everything in that in terms of description of that and other contexts being appropriate to worry less about the shares and worry more about the competitive constraint imposed by the rival. I think that's sort of a common theme, focusing on the competitive constraint directly rather than using shares as a proxy that probably holds across a bunch of areas. I will make the observation that it is with respect to Steve's explanation with the sort of increasing sum cost and reduced marginal cost. </p><p>That -- one of the implications and I think this is a hearing for another day. But one of the implications is that a lot of those industries are industries that are intellectual property intensive, and one of the potential tensions that arises and I think the agencies have to engage with and be thinking about as do academics who are thinking about these things is, you know, the idea that we sort of are chasing markups leading us into those industries, invites a risk of having antitrust and IP sort of go back to the '60s and 1970s eras where they ran directly into each other.</p><p>I think a lot of work has been done to try to get antitrust and IP to serve as complements in the direction of competition innovation rather than substitutes. And there needs to be in those areas -- if that indeed is the right story, I think there needs to be sort of significant thinking about how to make sure that complementary relationship stays intact. </p><p>WERDEN:  Okay. Let's move on to the next question which concerns dynamism. You've heard quite a lot about that today as well. And Jon refers to some evidence on dynamism as one of the major reasons for rejecting a benign explanation for some of the trends that have been observed. But I will point out to our panelists and our audience that the databases on which economists rely may be missing a lot. The broadest database that I'm familiar with is the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics Statistics, which is a very high quality longitudinal database that includes every business in the United States with at least one employee. </p><p>But it doesn't include any of the businesses with zero employees. And you say, \"Well, how big a deal can that be?\" Well, the answer is a presentation done by Census economists a few years ago revealed that between 1997 and 2010, 75 million startups in the United States had zero employees while only 7.6 million had one or more employees. So over 90 percent of the startups in the United States are being missed in the data that shows entry rates going down. So my question is, well, what data, if any, is telling on dynamism? And Steve is going first on this one.</p><p>BERRY:  Okay. So I'll start off confessing my confusion a little bit. So when we talk about market power -- I know what we're talking about, we're talking about the ability to hold price above marginal cost. When we talk about dynamism, a few things come to mind and they seem different. One is a simply descriptive question which we might want an answer to which is has turnover in some sense changed? Is -- are the rates of entry and exit from various industries fundamentally changed? </p><p>I think one of the things Greg is asking is how good is the data on that. I don't actually have a great independent opinion on how good is the data on that. But there's another thing that I think Jonathan suggested, which is it's not a descriptive matter of entry and exit. It's a question of whether the economy is delivering important innovations to consumers in the form of lower costs that are actually passed through to lower prices and/or better products. And it's possible as with our last question that you have a set of really big, great innovative firms who protect their position by being very innovative. In that sense, we'd have a lot of innovation and not much turnover and I don't know if that's dynamism or not. </p><p>It does make me think hard though about Fiona's point about potential competition. And I think maybe this is what Jonathan is getting at. If there are firms who got where they are by being innovative, how do we ensure that the innovation continues? Surely not by seizing their intellectual property, for example, that seems bad. </p><p>But I duly take more seriously potential competition, is the data that Jonathan's referring to evidence of a lack of potential competition? I'm a little confused by that. It's more on sort of actual entry and exit. But these are always first order questions, these questions about innovation are always first order questions, and I think if we accept that we have these very large, very profitable, certainly firms that got where they were by innovating, again, I would sort of say, well, let's start from where we are and ask how we move forward. And I don't know that we have dispositive evidence, but it seems like an important question. </p><p>MORTON:  I would agree with everything Steve just said and I think then, the purpose of antitrust enforcement is to ensure that the large firm that got where it initially got on the -- by innovating and serving consumers continues to do that. If there isn't effective antitrust enforcement, then you have the possibility of entrenchment and monopoly profits and a decline in -- in the kind of innovation and price competition that we would like to see. </p><p>So it's very important that we have effective antitrust enforcement in this sector so that -- and if we do and we continue to have high concentration, then they're competing hard and we're getting what we want as a society, but if we don't enforce here, then I think we can't be sure that we will. </p><p>BAKER:  And I'd like to just respond by reminding you that I talked about six different indicators of declining dynamism, and really only like one or two depend on the data set that Greg was working -- is worried about -- I was talking about the secular slowdown in business investment and rising profits this year, GDP, slowed rate which firms expand when they become more productive and shift in growth and productivity gains from entrants to incumbents and the growing gap in accounting profitability between the most and least profitable firms, and then also a declining rate of startups, which is more about the data set Greg is emphasizing. </p><p>WRIGHT:  One small point on the relationship between business dynamism, I think for this purpose, however, we defined it in antitrust is that, you know, of course, there are issues to explore here on potential competition, but a point of agreement with Jon is, you know, public restraint scenario where the FTC has been very active, sort of state or locally imposed barriers to entry that reduce the ability for entry are a big deal here and an area I don't think the FTC needs to be convinced that it is worth spending time on. It has done for a really time. It has done in a bipartisan and consensus oriented way for a really long time. </p><p>My own view is that area is probably -- if we're looking for an area to agree on for more cases to bring, I think those cases have legal issues with state action defense and whatnot, but if you want to target the resources of the agency at stuff you know is anticompetitive, state barriers to entry including occupational licensing is a -- is pretty good stuff and stuff that I think the agency would be well-served, and we do lots of competition advocacy but used to be an area where we brought a few more cases.</p><p>WERDEN:  Shall we go after the lawyer monopoly first? I think we can get an agreement right here. That's the one that's really problematic. </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I'm in, Greg. </p><p>WERDEN:  Okay. </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  You're asking an economist that question. </p><p>WERDEN:  They know. Anybody want to say anything more about dynamism? Are we done? Okay. Good. So my final prepared question for the panelists is a broad policy question. If the plan is to somehow ramp up antitrust and the solution is not just to spend more money at the agencies which, of course, is always welcome, what should be done and by whom? Congress, the courts, the agencies? And in particular I ask, one change in substance or procedure do you recommend and what one change would you most strongly caution against. And start with Jon. </p><p>BAKER:  So in the book that I mentioned that I -- that's coming out next spring, I talk about a number of substantive presumptions for ramping up antitrust that I'd like courts to adopt but I don't want to do the equivalent of, you know, picking a favorite child. I can't really describe them all here. So instead, I'm going to give you two cautions rather than one of each. So on substance, I would caution against presuming that vertical conduct is pro-competitive and I think I talked about why in my presentation, and on process I would caution against introducing direct political influence into antitrust enforcement. </p><p>WERDEN:  So why don't we just go down? Steve, next? </p><p>BERRY:  Okay. So I really wanted to hear the practitioners talk to this more -- more than I wanted to hear myself talk about it. </p><p>WERDEN:  You can pass if you want. </p><p>BERRY:  But let me just say one quick thing which is -- it falls upon this last point. I think in general the state of the evidence and I think this is even consistent with Joshua's concentration about the state of the evidence, is that I think we could do with some flattening of priors and some less presumptions in general, that I think that's -- it's a time when things are changing, when there's a lot of interesting data and we're not quite sure what it means and the idea that we have strong presumptions, say, about what is vertical or potential competition being bad, I think a lot of presumptions should be at question and that we should be acting as though before we do the analysis, before we get the data to a specific situation, we should be more modest and are basing in priors should be flatter I think just in general. </p><p>MORTON:  And since current practice is to be extremely worried about over-enforcement and not at all under-enforcement, that would flatten, I agree. I don't have any cautions, so I'm going to do three recommendations, make up for Steve's one. so we're symmetric. </p><p>I think it would be -- I'm going to identify who should do this because I'm not enough of an expert in that area, but I think it would be helpful if courts were to actually follow the definition of consumer welfare that is correct and the horizontal merger guidelines. In particular, that efficiencies have to be cognizable and merger-specific and benefit consumers. That would be a big help. </p><p>A second big help would be if we were explicit about our concern for potential competition and instructing courts to consider that as an important element in that markets where it is proven to be an important element. </p><p>And third, I would say that there is, as Josh mentioned, I think an increasing use by firms of government processes to protect themselves from competition and to exclude, and I think it would be helpful if someone could figure out a way to adjust Noerr-Pennington and similar kinds of laws to make it less possible for incumbents to keep out potential competitors and entrants. Those would be my three. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Steven, Fiona stole my thunder. But let me say, I would sort of, one co-sign Steve's proposal that priors be flattened here and we take sort of hard looks at presumptions that are driving enforcement, whether they are structural presumptions in favor of more enforcement, whether they are presumptions that go the other way. I think flattening priors and reevaluating those is sort of -- no time like the present to take out zombie presumptions while we're reevaluating the economics. </p><p>I would say for the agencies that certainly includes -- Congress has such bright line proposals in front of it. And I'm sure would like to hear from the agencies about what they think about those bright line presumptions but I would also say in addition to quickly co-signing the reallocation -- I guess I'm not allowed to increase the budgets. Reallocation toward public restraints where I think a disproportionate amount of the harm, you line up a hundred economists and 99 are going to agree that that stuff is harmful, we're not going to have sort of big reasonable fights over which way that the welfare effects cut, so I say reallocation in that direction. </p><p>And the last one I would say which is more procedural and resource allocation inside the agency -- I do think -- there are a lot of really tough questions facing the agencies and facing IO economics and helping guide through what I think is a really interesting time and how we calibrate antitrust policy there. </p><p>A hundred-some PhD economists between the agencies and I guess I'm not allowed to raise the number to 200 without firing some lawyers which will not be popular here. But I think there are ways to more deeply involve economists inside the agency in these discussions. I think the more of that whether it is through 6Bs at the FTC, whether it is -- a lot of ways to do that. And I think the more of that, the better.</p><p>BERRY:  I'd like to comment on something that Josh and Fiona, talking about the -- I really don't think -- I mean sure, there are public restraints that are harmful and appropriate to be concerned with if you want to enhance competition, but I don't think the idea of reallocating the FTC and DOJ budgets towards public restraints is necessarily a good idea. </p><p>What I'm worried about is that a lot of public restraints, there are other mechanism that are outside of antitrust laws, legislative and, for example, for addressing them and probably more effectively and where advocacy in front of other regulatory agencies and the like. </p><p>But it's the antitrust agencies, you know, (inaudible) too in the states but the antitrust agencies are really the most important actors in stopping private anticompetitive conduct, you know, at least along with other actors. And I'm worried that of taking enforcement resources away from those important efforts by the antitrust agencies, the way that Josh's proposal would suggest. </p><p>So it's clear, we think the budget should go up. </p><p>WERDEN:  No argument from me on that. I think start with my pay. We have a bunch of questions from the audience and two of them are almost identical, so obviously there is a consensus that this is the most important issue because we have two who agree on...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  They were sitting next to each other. </p><p>WERDEN:  ...on this. The handwriting is almost identical. I think this is not two independent draws but what the heck. So I will rephrase. What, if anything, should the antitrust agencies be doing about Amazon? </p><p>MORTON:  About what? </p><p>WERDEN:  Amazon. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Doing the same thing they do in all of -- analyzing -- I mean the -- I think the point of the conversation and the reason for the silence is that I think we are all believers in the idea that you get the toolkit right and you fight over how to get the toolkit right and you work out how to get the toolkit right and you apply it evenly across the economy. You could take account of differences but you don't have different sort of...</p><p>MORTON:  You don't pick out a firm and say, how do we do...yes.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes. </p><p>WERDEN:  So if I rephrase the question, are you aware of any antitrust case that the government should have brought against Amazon but didn't, would you say no? </p><p>MORTON:  Well, if they should've brought it, then they should've brought it. </p><p>WERDEN:  Are you aware of it? </p><p>MORTON:  Oh, am I aware of one? No. </p><p>WERDEN:  No. Okay. Okay, that's enough for Amazon. We have a question about static versus dynamic view of market power. And this came up quite a few times in the conversation, but since I've got question, I'll put it again. </p><p>Because profit is the necessary incentive for innovation and investment, how should we think about many of the things we're observing today like high margins and network effects in terms of a dynamic view of how competition works? </p><p>And, Fiona, you addressed this quite a bit already but is there anything you would like to add? </p><p>MORTON:  I mean, this is why Steve and I have been saying let's look forward and let's try to keep firms honest. You have a good idea, you do something really well, you innovate, you get enormous amounts of revenue, people are very happy. That's excellent. But then it's very easy if we look at the historical record for such a firm to find it easier to exclude rivals rather than compete. Competing is hard. It's hard work. </p><p>And so we need to have a toolkit that's up-to-date and used to make sure that as we move forward, a firm that has significant market power is getting it honestly by competing on the merits and delivering innovation and low prices. And if that's what we're getting, that's excellent, but it would be not efficient and not good for consumers to stop enforcing against these firms. </p><p>BERRY:  Yes, I mean Fiona mentioned, you know, earlier the idea of rivals buying competitors just to -- just to remove the potential competition. We've talked about that a bit. And you're -- I don't think you're blaming the innovative firm or punishing the innovative firm by trying to see if we can stop that from happening. And my -- I have a question. I'm not quite sure whether we should be looking at acquisitions by these firms differently than we would, and I don't think that's blaming them or depriving them of the benefits of their innovation. </p><p>WERDEN:  Let me slow things down a little. You -- after I ask a question you can go next. Somebody who's worked in an agency realizes and I'm sure our panelists do, too, that none of these questions are as simple as they might appear in a panel discussion. </p><p>So if you get some, let's say, dominant technology platform and it's proposing to buy some nascent competitor that might come up with the next greatest idea or might have it already but hasn't got it to market. How do you know whether to think this is bad because this threat to the incumbent monopoly is being squelched, or this is good because this is the way that this new idea will come to market? </p><p>MORTON:  So here I think we rely on Jon and his error cost framework to think about this. Right? If you don't know whether the acquisition's going to going to be pro-competitive or anticompetitive, you have to think of the harms you're creating by getting it wrong. And if under-enforcement creates tremendous harm because the dominant technology platform has lots of market power and that's going to be a huge problem, then we have to make sure we're weighting that risk appropriately. </p><p>And it may be that we don't have very much information about -- or as much as we would about the potential competitor as we do in markets where we're assessing whether a 15 percent share should be allowed to buy a 20 percent share. </p><p>There's a lot of more information about the products, about the way competition arises, about the prices and so forth when you have competitors already in the marketplace. When it's potential, the problem is much more difficult. Does that mean there's less welfare at stake? Not at all. So just because there's less information doesn't mean we get a free pass to do nothing about it. </p><p>BAKER:  And I wanted to add -- sort of going back to the original question about where they're talking -- which was asking about static and dynamic competition. Some people have the idea that competition is somehow bad for innovation, and that when we are acting as antitrust enforcers if that's what we're -- who we are, to increase competition, we're just going to -- we're going to benefit the buyers with lower prices but somehow will impede innovation and that there's some -- a trade-off. And that's not necessarily right. And it probably isn't right on average. </p><p>There's lots of evidence that competition spurs productivity, lots of economic studies. And on innovation particularly, I read the literature saying the motive that firms have to innovate by escaping competition is probably stronger on average in the data than the motive to innovate that comes appropriating more returns on the margin. </p><p>And it's not surprising, because firms that are making major R&amp;D investments always have -- usually have a lot of reasons other than preexisting market power to appropriate submission returns to -- even if there's some imitation and successful incumbents may be discouraged from developing new products because they're -- that would cannibalize their existing rents, and because as Steve and Fiona have been emphasizing, firms with market power can discourage new competition with exclusionary conduct. And so there's every reason to think that more competition is good for society for dynamic innovation oriented productivity reasons, not just for static price and quality reasons.</p><p>WRIGHT:  So long as we are including the -- maybe the caveat or the definition that in Jon's claim that more competition is good, that we're not equating competition to the number of firms. I get nervous about these discussions when they convert to policy, because the temptation is when I've got a really, really hard, ballsy problem to figure out, like is that acquisition of the nascent or small competitor a good or bad thing on net -- on welfare, the trade-offs are really difficult to figure out. And it is sometimes tempting and I think history teaches us certainly in antitrust that there is a temptation that is often succumbed to by agencies to sort of cling to those bright line presumptions, because you can do them. </p><p>And that I think is something that in that area, we certainly don't have enough empirical evidence or economic theory to do, it involves -- this may be an area I think Fiona and I disagreed some about whether we've got all the tools we need. And I think -- I think we probably agree, we've got most of what we need, but I think there are areas where we could do better and even if that means doing better means learning more about the distribution, potential competition's one of those areas...</p><p>MORTON:  But here's the problem, Josh, if you say we don't know enough to draw a line, I'm fine with that, but that's not the same thing as saying because we don't know anything, we're going to decide all the cases so that it's fine for the big firm to buy the potential competitor. </p><p>WRIGHT:  You certainly didn't hear the latter claim I've made. I voted these cases. </p><p>MORTON:  Okay. </p><p>WRIGHT:  And to bring them. </p><p>MORTON:  Yes, let's not go there. But yes, I -- then I agree. </p><p>WERDEN:  Okay. Good. So rephrasing this -- these next two questions. Economists are really on top of how goodly or badly market concentration tells you that there is competition or not competition in an industry. So we don't want to further that conversation. The question is what else, what would you look at if you wanted to know how competitive a market sector the whole economy is. </p><p>BAKER:  Well, it's easier on the sector, right? And the fact of the matter is there are a lot of tools of merger analysis looking at the close substitution of products and differentiated products markets, for example, which I think are well-accepted as being much better than concentration measures. And in my understanding concentration is used largely as a screen, I'm not the practitioner. And I think some of us maybe even questioning that a little bit. But in horizontal mergers really I think practice has moved very, very far away from concentration measures and toward the closeness of substitution of merging parties. </p><p>I think there's less consensus in vertical mergers, but there are a new set of tools that look at changes in bargaining that result as a -- as a result of vertical competition, I think those are not as well-accepted outside of economics, and I understand some of the legal fights going on right now are not even over the specifics of whether a particular merger should go forward as much as they are about whether those economic tools have value. </p><p>So I think there are, in both horizontal and vertical cases, real tools of economics that focus on I think what is actually at issue in these cases both horizontally and vertically. If horizontally, they're well-accepted maybe less so vertically.</p><p>WERDEN:  When you get to a case, you're going to have information that a researcher wouldn't have, a lot of it. And it can be very useful. And we have tools for analyzing it. I think where the question was coming from is as a researcher, you know, as a policymaker, if you're looking at the whole big picture, what is it you should look at? </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, okay. So since I'm such a micro guy and I find it hard to move past the aggregation as the sum of its components. I think it's very hard to do at the broad aggregate level. Broad evidence on markets, broad evidence on profits are interesting and they do not particularly get to the whys. I think they're a flag of interests I would say.</p><p>MORTON:  The field of IO is a micro-field so we're just really bad at answering this question. And if you look at Jon's list of cites, a lot of those people are in finance or macro or labor. </p><p>BAKER:  Or labor. </p><p>MORTON:  That have come in to this empty space that we generated, which is how do we describe the economy as a whole because our field doesn't do that. And so that's partly why we have these conflicting methodologies...</p><p>WERDEN:  Don't you wish we had some occupational licensing here? </p><p>BERRY:  You know, it's -- you know, in all honesty, as I said before, it's actually excellent that those papers are raising these questions. That's an excellent thing that these questions are being raised by those papers. And I think people deserve a response. In the meantime, we don't necessarily believe the causal conclusions of those papers. </p><p>WERDEN:  I was just handed this emergency question. Are there important competition issues that antitrust can't handle? And I take this to be antitrust enforcement as we know it. So these would be problems that would be addressed in some other way than antitrust cases. </p><p>WRIGHT:  So, sure. Natural monopoly, you know, the heart -- you can't -- you have to regulate that. You can't use...</p><p>WERDEN:  We did that. We're kind of past it. </p><p>MORTON:  Well...</p><p>WRIGHT:  Well, it's important...</p><p>WERDEN:  Wait, it's almost all gone. </p><p>MORTON:  Your electricity bill I'm afraid to say has some regulation in it. </p><p>WERDEN:  A little bit. But I'm at the mercy of am unregulated water monopolist...</p><p>WRIGHT:  And then some of the governmental restraints we were talking about have to be dealt with legislatively. </p><p>WERDEN:  Apart from regulating monopolies which is an old but still good idea, is there anything else you wish to do? </p><p>WRIGHT:  Well, I mean I do think when people talk about the tech companies, they -- and this is a good question for the FTC is that people are sometimes talking about data and other forms of social relationships that I think are difficult to handle outside of the existing antitrust framework and may be subject to different kinds of regulation. And I think sometimes when people talk about old-fashioned antitrust they are also talking about, for example, political power and I think that's way outside the realm of traditional antitrust regulation. I think it should stay there. But it doesn't mean that -- it doesn't mean there shouldn't be some response. </p><p>BAKER:  And then also leader follower conduct that leads to tacit coordination, that's very hard to address through antitrust laws. </p><p>WERDEN:  Do you think it should be addressed at all? </p><p>BAKER:  Well, I -- you mean do I think someone -- some other actor could do a better job than the courts, like that? </p><p>MORTON:  So I don't want to...</p><p>BAKER:  It's the same problem that the antitrust agencies have. </p><p>WERDEN:  So that would be a no. </p><p>BAKER:  I -- you know, I mean it would be nice to be able to do that but I don't -- I'm not sure how. </p><p>MORTON:  So I'd like to follow up on what Steve said. I mean there's political power, there's things like privacy, there's misinformation. It's not clear that vigorous competition fixes the problems that people want to see fixed in those domains and it might be that you want another agency or some other law to do that if that's what the community would like to see done. </p><p>So I think there are calls -- you read in the paper about people who would like antitrust to -- or perhaps think that antitrust can fix everything and my view is that that's not going to work. That antitrust is very well-geared. It's a set of economic tools, it's very well-geared to certain kinds of problems and that we should look elsewhere to other kinds of regulations if we have different kinds of problems to fix. </p><p>BAKER:  Greg, let me come back, in fact I'm completely baffled that you're subject to a -- to an unregulated water monopoly and I know we're here and I still am confused by it. </p><p>WERDEN:  It's not my house here. </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes, no, I just mean... </p><p>WERDEN:  There are many unregulated monopolies in this country. </p><p>BAKER:  I agree and why we gave up on so many of them, I'm still baffled by. </p><p>WERDEN:  Okay. Running out of good questions here. So I'm tempted to say we're done but I will give the last five minutes to our panelists to say whatever they choose to say to wrap up. </p><p>BERRY:  Remind them about the book, Jon. </p><p>MORTON:  Yes. </p><p>BAKER:  My publicist says this. That every one of you go out and buy it when it's available.</p><p>WERDEN:  Are you offering a discount? </p><p>BAKER:  You'll have to discuss that with my publisher. </p><p>WERDEN:  Have you set the price yet? </p><p>BAKER:  I don't think it's even available yet. </p><p>WERDEN:  Okay. It's too soon to talk about. </p><p>MORTON:  I think it's great we're having these hearings. </p><p>WERDEN:  Okay. Well, then we're going to take our break now a few minutes early. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SAYYED:  All right. I think let's get started. It's the last panel for the day. And as I mentioned at the beginning for those who haven't read the website or when I hear at the beginning, because of at least the potential for what our difficulties tomorrow. We're going to reschedule tomorrow's sessions until probably sometime late in October. So, this -- we turn now from mostly antitrust, but not exclusively, to consumer protection issue with respect -- and James Cooper now with the FTC will moderate this panel.</p><p>COOPER:  All right. Thanks, Bilal. Welcome everyone. Good afternoon. I'm James Cooper. I'm the deputy director for economic analysis in the Bureau of Consumer Protection here at the FTC. It's my great pleasure to be here and take part in these hearings and moderate this august panel. </p><p>Before I get started, I have to, recently -- I'm on leave from academia, so I'm not used to doing this. But anything -- I'm going to try to say zero of substance today. And in the off chance I do, anything I say is just my opinion only and not necessarily that of the Federal Trade Commission or any individual commissioner including the one sitting next to me.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Most especially not.</p><p>COOPER:  Most especially the one sitting next to me.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  No, kidding. James and I have worked together for many years.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes. All right. Nearly, you should probably already heard today, nearly 25 years ago, Chairman Pitofsky, he began the FTC's journey on the path to become the nation's privacy and data cop. Along the way, much has changed, when this all began, things like the iPhone, Facebook and Google didn't even exist. </p><p>But today, we find ourselves in a digital economy that lives on consumer data. Clearly, this evolution has provided tremendous value for consumers. We have vast troves of information in our fingertip, most of us can't get anywhere without our phones anymore, myself included. And we can connect with millions of people instantaneously as I'm sure many of you are doing right now via Twitter. I could go on. </p><p>But at the same time, the fact that consumer data is so tightly woven into the fabric of today's economy, it's presented unique consumer protection challenges. Part of what I think makes these issues so tricky may stem from the fact that it's not agreed upon framework for analysis. As we've heard a lot today, antitrust is married up with microeconomics, it has been for about the past four decades.</p><p>Privacy and data security, however, yet to find similarly suited mates. So, the FTC, or clearly economics is an important role in shaping privacy and data security policy. For example, the seminal work of the economics in information that garnered Nobel Prizes for people with names like Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz teaches us generally that reducing the cost of information flows typically improves market performance because it helps consumers make better choices.</p><p>But at the same time, privacy and data security policy also involves significant consumer values such as dignity, the right to be let alone and autonomy, which are really difficult to balance in a typical benefit cost framework, though they're equally important.</p><p>Never the one to shy from a challenge, the FTC has been in the forefront of trying to tackle these complex and weighty matters. As I mentioned before in the beginning of 1995, when Chairman Pitofsky conveyed a series of -- when Chairman Pitofsky convened a series of workshops designed to educate the FTC and the public on consumer protection issues surrounding the online use of consumer data and continuing with the 2012 policy report and subsequent reports on -- and workshops examining issues like big data, the internet of things, data brokers, and most recently, informational injuries through what former Chairman Kovacic called Policy, Research and Development, the FTC has continually attempted to calibrate its enforcement posture to balance consumer interests and privacy in data security with the remarkable benefits that -- with the remarkable benefits that the digital economy provides. And I think that these hearings will continue that tradition.</p><p>So this brings me to the subject of our panel today. Today, we appear to be at an inflection point. Many of the same intercurrence that are animating the challenges to the antitrust status quo that were addressed earlier today, and that will be addressed another hearings, couple with catalysts of high profile data breaches, the use of social media to attempt the influence of 2016 election, Cambridge Analytica and the coming online of GDPR have caused many to -- have caused many to question whether the current privacy and data security framework needs a rethink. </p><p>For example, some have suggested the U.S. should adopt a more European-like approach. And it appears that California has already taken up the mantle. We see legislative proposals in various forms kicking around Congress. So, today we hope to work through some of these thorny issues, examining where we are, where we might go, and what that might mean for both consumer privacy and the digital economy, which has provided us with so much.</p><p>So we're very -- I'm very happy, we would all be happy to have an all-star panel to help us on this journey today. So to my immediately left is Maureen Ohlhausen. Maureen is currently a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. She was acting chairman from January 2017 through April 2018. Before that, Chairman or Commissioner Ohlhausen was a partner Wilkinson Barker Knauer where she focused on FTC issues, including privacy and data protection.</p><p>She was also, served at the FTC for 11 years prior to that, where she was the director of the Office of Policy Planning. And prior to that, she was a clerk for Judge Sentelle on the D.C. Circuit. </p><p>So next to Commissioner Ohlhausen is Howard Beales. Howard is a professor of strategic management and public policy at the George Washington University. Importantly for the purposes of our panel today, Howard from 2001 to 2004 served as the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection. In addition, in his earlier stint at the FTC, he helped think about and really develop a lot of the framework today for how we analyze informational issues surrounding consumer protection.</p><p>Next to Howard is Daniel Solove. He's the John Marshall Harlan Research Professor of Law at the George Washington University. Daniel is one of the leading privacy scholars in the country. In addition to writing some of the seminal articles in privacy, he along with his co-author Paul Schwartz are the author of a casebook on information privacy law, that everyone including me uses to teach that subject. </p><p>He is also the CEO of Teach Privacy and runs a myriad of privacy programs, which unfortunately for us may mean he has to cut our early. I don't think he will. Because he's got something going on tonight, including his annual privacy forum, Privacy Salon, things like that. </p><p>And then finally, last but definitely not least, David Vladeck is the A.B. Chettle Junior Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center. And he, like Howard, was the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection from 2009 to 2013. And before that, he spent 25 years at Public Citizen litigation group.</p><p>So we're kind of lucky here, I mentioned, to have Howard and -- Will, Howard and David because in their timeframe with Lydia Parnes and kind of -- in between as well really took the -- really helped usher in the era of the FTC being involved in privacy and data security and really kind of being at the helm of that in large part.</p><p>So what I want to do with the format today, we're just going to have a discussion. We don't have any presentation. But we're going to drill down on some questions. And we also will have -- if you have questions from the audience, we would -- we'll be taking note cards to -- I guess there are designated people to take those questions and we'll certainly save some time at the end to address these.</p><p>So, let me get started, and we're -- the big picture headline question of this panel is to kind of see, take stock of where we are in the privacy and data security regulation in the U.S. and where we need to go. And I think that if we're going to assess that, maybe in sort of a high level, we should think about what would be the goals of the privacy and data security program? </p><p>So at a high level, what should a privacy and data security program be concerned with -- what sort of values should it protecting and how might we think about measuring whether that goal is accomplished? So, Maureen, I want to have you take a first crack of the question and invite others to respond or react.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Great. Well, thank you James. And I'm delighted to be here. Thank you to the organizers for including me in the panel. </p><p>This is a topic I've thought a lot about, what are the values that we are trying to protect and pursue in our privacy and data security enforcement in the U.S. I would say one of the first values -- because our authority under the FTC, whether it's deceptive or unfair acts or practices and are affecting commerce. So first of all, it's commercial. Right? Everyone forgets that one at the end. But it's in Commerce.</p><p>And then deceptive. That means that there was a promise made to a consumer that isn't kept, or unfair, which means there was an act or practice that caused substantial injury to a consumer that the consumer couldn't reasonably avoid, that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to competition or the consumer protection.</p><p>And of course, the FTC isn't the only actor in the space. We already have lots of other or certain number of other privacy laws. You think about HIPAA. You think about financial privacy. You think about the CPNI rules for communications data. So those are areas where in a way if you think about it, we've already as a society through our political system decided there are special buckets of information that need special protection.</p><p>So where does FTC fit in there? First of all, to talk about deception. I was actually at the FTC back when we brought the first online privacy case, Dan Caprio was there with me as well, and some other people in the audience probably too, under Chairman Pitofsky in the Geocities case So, they had made a promise about how they would collect or use data and they didn't keep that promise.</p><p>And we've brought lots of privacy cases alleging deception since. And what we're trying to protect there, I think, is two-fold. One, it's consumer sovereignty. Right? The consumer made a choice and that choice wasn't respected. So I think that's the primary thing. </p><p>There is also a competition element there, because you certainly want to allow the marketplace to operate in an efficient way where you have -- someone not getting competitive advantage because they've lied about what they're doing and they actually aren't adhering to it. Maybe it's costly. I mean that was like an Uber case that we brought, it was -- they had initially promised that they were going to do certain things with the data. And then it turned to stop accessing it. And then it turned out to be kind of expensive to keep that promise. So we had to modify our order. So I would say the first thing is consumer sovereignty. </p><p>But then the second thing, I think that we are supposed to be protecting is protecting consumers from substantial injury. And that is captured in our unfairness authority. Now, what is substantial injury is really the question. And you don't always need a promise made to consumers. In fact, unfairness, I think, works particularly well when there hasn't been a promise made to the consumer. But there is sort of an expectation that consumers won't be injured through data collection and use.</p><p>So some of the cases that we've brought in that space involve things like collecting and sharing real-time location data about consumers, because that can be abused in a way that can be used for stalking, right? So there's a health or safety risk. Certainly, the collection of financial information or the failure to protect financial information that could -- that's sensitive. So it could be used to hurt consumers financially.</p><p>One of the things -- we mentioned the informational injury workshop. And so one of the things that I tried to do with that is actually come up with a little bit of a taxonomy of the different harms that we have addressed through FTC enforcement. And what I came up in doing a review of all the cases that we've brought in the privacy area, the first one I already mentioned, which is the distortion or not respecting consumer sovereignty and through deception.</p><p>Financial harms, health and safety. I mentioned that one already, and unwarranted intrusion. So cases -- we'd have some where we had the TRENDnet case where there was an internet-enabled camera that had a pretty obvious flaw in its software, so that anybody who had the IP address could hack into this camera that was sold to be used for home monitoring and watching your kids, right? </p><p>So we think, well, that is intrusion. We also had the rent-to-own, that was Aaron's case. David and I agreed very, very aggressively on that one.</p><p>VLADECK:  Well, it was the DesignerWare case.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  DesignerWare, that was it. Right, right. Very good. But where the laptops had a program that could turn on the camera and companies could use that or take screenshots. </p><p>And then last one is reputational injury. And my view is that the FTC, we've never brought a case purely to -- based on reputational injury but reputational injury has been certainly present in some of the cases that we've brought such as the Ashley Madison case.</p><p>So I would say those are the -- reputational is a little I think more controversial. But otherwise, I think those are the types of things that the FTC's approach, the authority that we've been given, those are the values that we should be pursing in privacy.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes. Would anyone else like to weigh on that? Sort of at a high level? Perhaps even leaving aside the FTC's goals. What are some things that -- what would we think of? What should we be thinking of when we think about an enforcement program or regulatory program to protect privacy? What sort of values should we be protecting? What should we be thinking about?</p><p>VLADECK:  So let me just add to Maureen's point about the DesignerWare, Aaron's kinds of cases. Ashley Madison, I'm not sure is a reputational harm case only. And I think part of the struggle -- and I'm glad we had the workshop on informational harms, is they all sort of fit generally into what we used to think of as an invasion privacy tort. But they're very hard to label. So with Ashley Madison, marriages were broken up and -</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  People committed suicide.</p><p>VLADECK:  People committed suicide. So labeling that kind of harm is difficult. But I think partly, what we ought to focus on is the nature of the intrusion. So in Ashley Madison, it's intruding into very personal relationships, in DesignerWare and Aaron's, it was intruding into the home. I mean the real problem in those cases was that cameras can be activated remotely when people are sitting on their couch or doing whatever.</p><p>And so, I agree that it's important to try to see if we can come up with a taxonomy. But why would this really just sort of depends on context. </p><p>COOPER:  Since David taxonomy, I don't know -- Daniel, if you'd like to jump in. Daniel is one of the taxonomy and privacy lawyers.</p><p>VLADECK:  Right. That was not inadvertent.</p><p>SOLOVE:  Well, I would say like to the -- there's obviously protection of consumers from harm, which I think is important, and a lot then depends on how we define harm. I tend to define harm broadly to also encompass risk, which I think is a very important concept. </p><p>There's also the broken promises. That it's very important that if a company makes a promise, that it be held to that promise. Otherwise, the entire self-regulatory regime collapses because the privacy policies are meaningless then. So it's nice that the FTC has a backstop to that and enforces.</p><p>I think there's also an important component to an enforcement regime that I think the FTC can and sometimes has gotten involved in, which is consumer expectations, even if it's a direct promise, consumers have expectations about how their data is going to be handled and used that are often -- and sometimes at variance with what's said in a privacy policy or with what companies do.</p><p>If you take -- there's been studies about like consumer attitudes about privacy and a vast majority of people agreed with the statement that if a company has a privacy policy, it does not share data with third parties. So there's definitely a lot of misinformation out there. Consumers have incorrect expectations. And the FTC can play a very important role in helping to make sure that faulty consumer expectations aren't exploited.</p><p>So companies knowing that consumers kind of already have this -- maybe unjustified trust in them don't exploit that trust, that what companies do that start becoming at great variance with the consumer expectations, that those outliers be stopped. The Sears case, I think, is a wonderful example of that where they installed spyware into people's computers.</p><p>And this was actually disclosed in the fine print in a very lengthy privacy policy. So it was actually there. But it wasn't very salient. It wasn't very noticeable, so most people missed it. And FTC said that it was not sufficiently disclosed and not conspicuous enough. And I think that's great, because what we had is a practice that was very unexpected to consumers that caught a lot off-guard.</p><p>And so, I think it's very important that consumers can use sites and engage in e-commerce and other commerce and know that their -- what they expect generally is going to be the case. And there aren't going to be unpleasant surprises down the road. And so, I think it's very important that the FTC police that, especially because we know from a lot of studies that a very, very small percentage of people actually read the privacy policies or privacy notices, something like less than 1 percent.</p><p>So we really are in a world that consumers come in with this baggage, these expectations. And I think we have to play in that world. I know that that's how people are going to make decisions on what -- how to share their data. And there should be some protection from that being exploited.</p><p>COOPER:  Howard, did you want to jump in? One thing just to -- it may be completely orthogonal to what you're going to say, but maybe it'll be related. It sounds listening to David and Daniel, and I don't know if it's -- to what extent should a privacy regulatory framework -- should we think about privacy in sort of the rights-based framework? Or is it something that needs to be balanced with other values as well? Is it something that can be balanced or is it just a right? And I don't know -- it's something that's kind of I was thinking about it as David and Daniel were talking. And so anyway, Howard, I'll let you speak to that or whatever you want, whatever -</p><p>BEALES:  I did want to comment a little on the discussion that's gone before it. Firstly, I wanted to take you to task for listing a Nobel Prize winners for the economics of information without listing the guy who founded the field, which was George Stigler, first and foremost. But he was one of my advisors too. </p><p>But I'll forgive you. I mean I think the attraction to me of the consequences based approach to thinking about consumer privacy, which is what we developed in that time that I was at the commission, was that it makes explicit what ought to be there all the time, which is that particularly in the commercial context, this is a balancing issue.</p><p>There are tremendous benefits that come from the ability to use information, even if it's an unexpected use of the information. And we don't want to sacrifice those benefits because somebody didn't think to include that in the list of things that might be done with information in the privacy policy because it wasn't thought of at that time, that the privacy policy was written. We didn't know this was a possible use of the data.</p><p>Those kinds of benefits, we have an enormous number of services that are built on exactly those kinds of secondary uses of information that was collected for a different purpose that may or may not have fit with consumers' expectations.</p><p>What we want to make sure of is that that information is not being used in ways that are harmful to consumers, that's doing damage to consumers. And that's where privacy regulation and privacy enforcement really ought to focus. If there's not a harm, it's not something that the FTC in particular should be worried about.</p><p>Now, I also have a reasonably broad concept of harm, perhaps not as broad as some. I certainly think that the things that fit -- the kinds of subjective harms that fit within the traditional privacy torts are the kinds of harms that are actionable privacy harms. But I note that the torts standard in -- virtually all of the privacy torts is highly offensive to a reasonable person. Right? </p><p>If the intrusion or the putting somebody in a false light is something that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, that's an essential element of the tort, not just any intrusion, not just any false light that might be held -- might be held out. </p><p>But including those kinds of harms, I make, I think makes complete sense. We've had two mentions of DesignerWare and Aaron's and there's a part of that case that I completely agree with. And that's the turn on the camera part of the case. There's a part of it that I've always found really troubling, and that is, this is a computer that -- when somebody stopped paying, you could activate the software and the computer would call home and tell this company that had rented the computer to somebody who was no longer paying for it where it was.</p><p>That's really useful. The complaint says -- well, this is location tracking, and location tracking is bad. But the complaint doesn't say why location tracking is bad, and especially when it's every two hours. And the remedy that's in the complaint or in the consent order is, \"Well, if you disclose when you first turn this on and track continuously, that'll comply with the order.\" </p><p>So to fix tracking every two hours, we track continuously. I don't get what harm we thought we were fixing there, and that's -- it's that harm that really needs to be the focus. If we can't articulate why we think this is a problem, we're not going to be able to adopt sensible and low-cost ways to control that problem. We've got to think first about what's the harm we're trying to prevent.</p><p>COOPER:  Thanks, Howard. So, after hearing kind of a high-level view of what sort of values we should be concerned about when we're thinking about a privacy program or regulatory framework, maybe it's important now to take stock of actually where we are. So I wanted to turn to Daniel, who as I mentioned before, has written a seminal textbook on this and lots of articles defining and thinking about what privacy is.</p><p>So Daniel, just kind of help us characterize the current U.S. system of privacy and data security regulation in about five minutes maybe?</p><p>SOLOVE:  Sure. Well, at the high level, the bird's-eye view. My sophisticated way of synopsis of it is it's a mess. We have a sectorial approach with laws have risen in various economic sectors over a very long span of time. Then you have common law torts that have risen, the private torts. Plus, there's the forgotten breach of confidentiality tort that I'd like to mention too that doesn't require highly offensive.</p><p>There are all sorts of other common law torts that could apply in these contexts, such as negligence. That's making a resurgence and data breach cases. Then you have various state statutes in the states. You have dozens of federal laws. Not as many recently, but certainly in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, you had a real series of laws that were passed to deal with various privacy issues in various economic sectors. </p><p>And then you have the FTC, kind of an overarching -- the broadest jurisdiction of any federal agency regulating privacy that regulates most companies, except for some carve-outs. And that's the U.S. approach. And there are inconsistencies in the various laws, some of them are a lot weaker than others. </p><p>On the stronger side, you have HIPAA, which is very, very broad. It has a broad reach. It follows the data through the chain of its custody. But you also have laws like FERPA that regulate schools, that buying large are kind of -- for lack of a better characterization, a bit of a joke that are not really enforceable. They lack a lot of the features that more recent privacy legislation has. </p><p>Contrast this to a number of other countries in the world, including especially the EU. They have a comprehensive privacy law baseline of protection, so they can articulate, \"Here are the basic rules of the road that we follow.\" Here in the U.S., it's very hard to articulate, well, how is this particular data protected? </p><p>We really can't. It depends on -- well, who holds it, if it's held by certain entities and it's regulated by HHS, then it can also be regulated by the FTC, and it depends on new enforces. And it depends on what the sectors are. And one of the challenges with the sectorial approach is that the sectors change. </p><p>So, in the 1970s and 1980s, what various types of companies are doing in the sectors make sense then. But now, as we see, different companies are jumping into different areas. And so, when we build laws around sectors and -- they don't stay fixed. And now, there's a lot of overlap in company saying, wow, we're regulated by five different agencies and five different bodies of law, and we don't know what to do. There are so much.</p><p>Plus, and all the different state laws that are overlapping, and it becomes a bit of a nightmare. I'm not sure we can dial this back in the United States. I'm not sure we can kind of go and say, hey, we're going to do the other approach. But I think there are some sensible aspects to the other approach that are quite efficient, and to some extent I think could be particularly business friendlier than the U.S. sectorial approach, which I think the -- a lot of industries were happy with initially because they liked the idea of a law tailored to them or they liked the idea of a law that -- the fact that laws didn't apply to them and they fell through the crevices. </p><p>But those crevices have been largely -- a lot of them have been plugged up by the FTC which regulates. The other problem too with the U.S. approach is that we get no respect from the rest of the world. We're kind of the Rodney Dangerfield of privacy in the U.S. </p><p>But I think we have some very effective, some really good laws. I think the FTC has done tremendously effective work. We do have a lot of protection. It's just that it's inconsistent. It's hard to articulate. It's very hard to explain to other countries, especially the EU, how the U.S. system works and how information is protected here. It's so haphazard. </p><p>So I think the biggest challenge is what do we do going forward when we have so many laws that are locked into antiquated visions of the economy from 30 years ago, and a world that is increasingly been, the leadership role has increasingly been ceded by the U.S. Congress ever since I think around 2000, where we really haven't seen a tremendous amount of legislative activity on privacy. It really has tapered off. I mean, really seeing the states, especially California and the EU take the lead. </p><p>And I think if you ask most large multinational companies, what privacy law are they focusing on for their compliance efforts? GDPR, the new California law, hardly anyone will say anything about any other U.S. law. Maybe a little bit of HIPAA. FTC, I barely hear whispered these days. Although I think a few years ago, the FTC was spoken about it a little bit more. </p><p>But increasingly, what we're seeing I think is the companies, and these are U.S. companies, not really looking to the law here as to what they're doing and how they're building their privacy programs and practices. So, that's where we are. And I think the big question is what should we do in the U.S. for what's the next step. </p><p>Do we kind of say, hey, we'll just let the -- be regulated by Europe and California or will we have meaningful regulation at the federal level that reflects the balances and approaches that the U.S. would like to have.</p><p>COOPER:  Well, thanks, Daniel. I'd like to invite anyone to react to that, and also kind of throw out there -- it seems as you -- when you think about the landscape of the U.S. privacy regime, it seems to be a mixture of ex-ante, sort of an ex-ante regulation with notice and choice in some areas, you know, HIPAA, COPPA maybe. </p><p>But then we also see -- we also see enforcement, you know, private and the FTC. I mean, what are the pros and cons in -- of those approaches, and what might be, you know, you think about whether -- there should be a mixture, we should hew to one, or another, or it makes sense to kind of mix it up, and in some ways the way that we have here in the U.S. So, throw that out to anyone as -- well...</p><p>VLADECK:  Let me comment on that briefly, because, you know, until at least a few years ago, the difference between the EU and the United States was, we did a lot of enforcement, but we had this patchwork, this crazy patchwork of laws. On the other hand, in the EU, they had even before the GDPR they had a general regulation which was much more comprehensive than any U.S. privacy law but there was almost no enforcement. </p><p>And some scholars have done a lot of work looking at sort of privacy on the ground both in the United States and in the EU, and they found that the privacy commitments in the EU were met only to the extent that there was a real enforcement or culture of compliance, which left out large swathes of the EU</p><p>And so, I think that somewhere in the middle with the desired outcome, but strict rules without enforcement, at least according to the studies that have been done, didn't work all that well in the EU, and I think that was one of the major driving forces for enacting the GDPR and to basically base the new system on commitments of compliance and enforcement. And it will be interesting to see the extent to which the new GDPR is enforced by the data protection authorities in the EU who are not used to doing FTC-like enforcement cases. </p><p>COOPER:  Anyone else like to jump in on the ex-ante versus ex-post question or in -- anything? </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I guess -- oh. Go ahead. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  I was going to say, well, I, you know, I agree that regulation, very -- if there's clear regulation that says, like the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Congress drew the lines there and the FTC implements and enforces it. </p><p>But one of the things that I had -- I think has been a real strength of the FTC's approach has been its case by case enforcement, maybe a little less predictable in some ways, but it trades that from great flexibility, right? So, a focus on harm in case by case enforcement reduces the need for you to have, predict the future to design some overarching regulation that foresees all innovations, Howard mentioned this, and I think we all would agree consumers have got enormous benefits from a lot of these technologies. </p><p>And consumers have gotten a lot of free content, and they've gotten a lot of information at their fingertips, as you mentioned, and so that doesn't mean like, well, anything goes, but I think we need to be careful about coming up with a system that is too regulatory, because it can't predict what the new innovation's going to be and perhaps it's going prevent it from happening. </p><p>COOPER:  OK. </p><p>BEALES:  Yes, I just to -- just to pick up a little on the ex-ante versus ex-post problem, I think part of the -- I put -- I think part of the problem with the ex-ante regulation is that the we have now, and particularly the approaches that are embodied in the GDPR and in the California statute are really based on a premise that won't work. That people are going to read privacy policies and pay attention to these notices about what's going to be done with the information and make choices based on that. </p><p>And Dan says, and I think he's right, nobody reads privacy policies, it's probably a good thing because there's a study out of Carnegie Mellon that said that if people actually did read their online privacy policies, the opportunity cost to the U.S. economy would be $787 billion. </p><p>It's just out of all proportion to what might be at stake in commercial privacy decisions. And with the ex-ante approach that difficult, if you will, the focus ex-post on where do -- where have things gone wrong that need to be fixed, and what can we do to keep them from happening again, seems like a much more sensible way to approach the problems. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Howard, I just wanted to weigh in a little bit on your point about people not reading privacy policies. I agree, probably the average consumer doesn't, but we have academics in the U.S., I bet Daniel reads the privacy policies, I bet David reads privacy policies, and academics, and consumer groups, consumer organizations, and competitors. </p><p>COOPER:  I don't read them. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Right. So, James doesn't, I'm just kidding, but...</p><p>COOPER:  Well, you said academics, I just want to make sure that you know that. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Well, I -- oh, academics other than James. But there -- I think there are mechanisms for if there is a problematic term in a privacy policy for it to get noticed and surfaced, and that's one of the things we've seen I think with social media that when something is discovered, that people don't like, that news get out there pretty quick. </p><p>BEALES:  Well, I just, you know, I -- if that's the goal, then that points to a very different kind of a privacy policy, because you don't want something that's understandable to consumers, you want something that is understandable to geeks and competitors, who can figure out whether there's something wrong going here. </p><p>That's sort of not where we're headed, it's not where the Europeans are headed, it's not where California is headed, we want simple privacy policies that anyone can understand that tell you nothing, and mostly aren't read. I mean, no doubt, some people read them. </p><p>SOLOVE:  A while ago I wrote a piece about privacy self-management, which is this idea that people manage their own privacy by reading these policies and making choices. I think this is a flawed approach, not just because people don't read privacy policies, and also I think the point that there's this tension, privacy policies are useful to regulators and advocates, and academics and others who can read them carefully, and they get a lot of information, but the average consumer really can't get all that. </p><p>So there's a tension, you almost need two different things, which is what, you know, Paul Schwartz and I have proposed in a -- in our ALI project, which is a transparency statement for the regulators and then something simpler for the consumers. </p><p>But as a consumer, reading the privacy policies is relatively meaningless, I don't -- I don't read them because it's too many, and the amount of entities I do business with, and the sites I visit, you know, hundreds, thousands, I don't have time, and then the choices I think, do I share this piece of information on Facebook? I don't know. </p><p>The implications for privacy depend on how that information is combined and aggregated with other information over time, and how that information might line up, and what someone might do with something, and what algorithms someone might create five years from now, and a whole litany of things that I can't even figure out, so I really can't make the judgment as a privacy expert on exactly what the implications and costs and benefits to me, especially the costs over time are going to be for me to release a certain piece of data. </p><p>So, it's very, very difficult, and now multiply that by a thousand, and have to make that decision all the time, just really, really hard to do for the consumer. So, I'm just not sure that that approach, it's great if there's like one company that you actually do business with, I mean, only on Facebook. But it's not, I'm on all the sites, like the professors who, you know, I give an amount of homework every night, and I think like, hey, it's reasonable for my students to read 30 pages a night, but what if they have 10 professors and each assign 30 pages? </p><p>And that's what the companies are doing, every company thinks, hey, you know, they can pay attention, we think this is a great mechanism, yeah, multiply it, it doesn't scale, that's the problem. And the consumer, if you say, hey, we protect your data with reasonable data security, well, what's that? As a consumer, I can -- how do I assess your security? How do I know how prepared your employees are to not be phished? I can't -- how do I know what kind of encryption you're going to use, and all these other things? </p><p>I can't really make an informed the assessment, which is why, you know, we need an agency like the FTC to be looking out for people, just like when, you know, I would travel abroad, and the taxi fares were -- they didn't have a meter, and I didn't know what the right fare was, and they would just say like it's X whatever, and I had to trust them or make some, I didn't know, it's nice to know that someone's looking out for me. And there's a meter in someone's thought of what the right there is going to be, and I don't have to worry about someone cheating me. </p><p>Or I can pick up a jug of milk and know that I can drink it, and I'm not going to be poisoned. They don't have to do research, imagine that, you know, you didn't have that food safety and actually have to go online and research like the safety conditions that each farm to figure out that you buy food from there. I just like to know like I pick up a product in the supermarket, it's safe. And I think we want the same thing for privacy. </p><p>VLADECK:  It's amazing how whenever you use the phrase privacy policy, everybody watches into a diatribe. So, I'm going to take a minute and launch into my own. One is, they're not privacy policies, you know, the original sin was calling them something that they're not. None of them really deal with privacy, they deal with data daily use. And part of the problem is they misnamed. </p><p>The other problem, of course, and this gets back to the question that James started with, the difference between ex-ante regulation and something else, if you have a regulatory regime that is clear, so you know that everything you do on the internet is safe, or at least you have that promise, even if it's not enforceable, then the privacy policy where the data use statement becomes less important. </p><p>And part of the problem that we have and the FTC has done a lot of work on simplified notice and Dan and the ALI have done a lot of work in trying to figure out a better system for this. But these are really notice systems, and they need to be simplified, many of them are written by lawyers, so they're bound to be incomprehensible. And they're often designed to be incomprehensible. So this is an issue then that plagues us and I just, don't think we've collectively figured out a way to escape it. </p><p>BEALES:  I think actually Mick Jagger had the answer to what's been happening here, in 1964, the technology was a little different but he said, the man comes on the radio, like, I said the technology is a little different, telling me more and more about some useless information supposed to fire my imagination. What happens, I can't get no satisfaction. </p><p>VLADECK:  There we go. </p><p>COOPER:  Nice. All right. So, David, well, I'll -- with that segue, thank you, Howard. To our, you know, what or now we've kind of set the stage for where we are in the U.S., what do you see is any of the problems, because the -- again, the headline picture of this, and the headline of this, this panel supposed to think about, what or kind of rethinking the current privacy data security regime, what are -- what are some of the problems, if any of the current status quo, are there any harms that you don't think are being addressed? Is there inefficient enforcement, either over-deterrence, under-deterrence? So what do you think, David?</p><p>VLADECK:  So, let me just use a few examples, because we've, time does not permit me to go through the concerns that I have. But one is, I don't think we have effective tools to really understand what's going on with big data, let alone to regulate it sensibly. So, we all know the data collection is now ubiquitous, we bring it into our own homes through always on devices or sensors of the Internet of Things. We know that this data is being collected, but our laws really don't have any restraint on the sale or renting of this data. </p><p>We know it moves, we know it has a substantial economic value, but we don't have any real information on the velocity or volume of this kind of data aggregation. So, that presents risks. Paul Ohm, one of my colleagues both at the FTC and here, wrote an article ten years ago, in which he sort of cast in dystopian light what would he called the database of ruin. Well, we don't know yet whether there are these kinds of enormous databases, but there's nothing in U.S. law that really restrains that development. </p><p>And these kind of databases pose risks to consumers, there's the risk of data breach, after all these would be honeypots, they'd be a magnet for identity thieves, and we know identity theft is still rampant. So, one question that the FTC I think is going to have to grapple with is sort of where is this data, what's it being used for, how is it being transmitted to whom, and for what purpose? So, that is one issue that I think the commission is going to have to grapple with going forward. </p><p>Second, the rapid, the rapid initiation of algorithmic decision making in the marketplace. Now, I said this morning, I'm not a fan of human decision making. You know, we generally don't do such a great job, and machines may help. But for regulators, these kinds of decisions are very difficult to oversee, they're not transparent, machine learning algorithms are impossible to interrogate, you can't put them under oath. It's hard to root out disparate treatment based on factors that are impermissible, age, gender, race, things like that. You know, nor is there necessarily due process at the end of the -- at the end of the decision making chain. </p><p>And so, I know the agency's already done a fair amount of work on this, but this is an issue that I think demands greater attention, because I do think it poses enormous risks to those who come out on the bottom, in terms of these kinds of decision making. </p><p>In terms of enforcement, my concerns are not really with over-enforcement, because the agency resources are too scarce for that. Indeed, when I was the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, I don't know whether Howard had the same concern, but I spent a lot of my time doing triage, deciding which cases to bring and which cases not to bring, even though many of those cases in the latter category were meritorious and we should have brought them if we could have. </p><p>So I don't think that's the problem. I do think they are enforcement challenges. So one is, how do you enforce against an industry like the mobile app industry, which is highly diffuse, diverse industry, thousands and thousands of app developers, many of whom either don't really know what the law requires, or just don't really care. </p><p>So the New York Times did a story yesterday about COPPA violations, violations of the Children Online Privacy Protection Act by app developers that were tracking kids 12 and under without explicit parental permission. Sure, the FTC could, you know, bring 20 or 30 enforcement actions against this kind of industry. But it's not at all clear to me that you get any of the kind of deterrent value that you really need. </p><p>So one question is, with respect to these kind of diffuse industries, how do you make them comply with the law? That's one problem. Another is, we have to figure out to what extent machine learning decision making tools are staying within the statutory guidelines. That is an enforcement problem. </p><p>And last, we have a lot of companies under order, and order violations are hard for the agency to detect and to deal with, simply because of the high volume of companies under order, that's a serious enforcement matter. I mean, for a company to violate an FTC order undermines the ability of the agency to do its work, it undermines the deterrent value of consent decrees or enforcement cases. And I think my -- the new -- sort of the new management at the FTC is going to have to grapple with that. There are many others, but I'll stop there. </p><p>COOPER:  Yes, anyone else like to weigh in? </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Oh, one thing, building on what David said, I want to -- I agree that one of the challenges for the approach that we have, and when I talked about privacy policies it was not certainly to say privacy policies are it and take care of everything, it's just that I don't think they are as totally is useless as some other people seem to think they are. </p><p>But the other problem is these kinds of harms that we, you know, you may have a lot of little bits of data that weren't sensitive, that weren't even person identifiable when they were collected. But through these new tools, they can be assembled into a more complete mosaic and identified to a certain person. And then I think the question there is, is there a harm, is there a risk there? And that is where I think we need to start thinking, how do we address that? </p><p>Because a lot of those uses may be great, they may be very beneficial, we don't want to stop those, but for the harmful ones. And if we look at something like the -- going back to the pre-internet days, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it was trying to get at those kinds of issues, to allow some kind of balancing and use of this data, but to allow consumers to know if it was being used in a way that disadvantaged them in connection with an important decision like employment or insurance or some other -- some other ones blend in. And then gave them insight into what it was and the right of correction. </p><p>So I think that is where we see need to start thinking about like a kind of a risk -- a risk based approach, because I don't think we can necessarily foresee all the uses, I'm a little concerned about the data use specification requirements, because as Howard said, there may be great uses down the road that consumers would like. But they still need to be protected from some of these, you know, new abilities to use, these little bits of data in a new -- in a new way. </p><p>BEALES:  But that, you know, I don't know why the -- I don't know why the more complete mosaic is itself a problem, I mean, the one -- the one part of that, there clearly is a problem is if the government to get that, but that -- there's another tool to control that problem. And it's the one we ought to use and not worry about the possibility that this might be put together. </p><p>I want to say two things about, I think big data is a really interesting question, and it does -- there are certainly potential costs there, but there's also been big benefits, I mean, that's where our fraud control tools come from, is data aggregations, often data that was collected for a different purpose that's put together in an algorithm that predicts the likelihood that a particular person is really who they say they are. </p><p>And if it weren't for those tools, there'd be a whole lot more identity theft than there is which is way too much. But that's a big data I think, you can't do that with little pieces of data one at a time, you got to aggregate the data in order to get a more comprehensive picture. </p><p>The other thing I wanted to say about algorithms which raise some potentially interesting questions. But I think the algorithms that ought to be of concern are the ones where the user of the algorithm doesn't face the costs of mistakes, because an algorithm is just basically a way to classify. You're a good risk, you're a bad risk, you're a good prospect, you're a bad prospect. </p><p>There is a really interesting example of Reuters, which wants to get scoops on international news, and it does that in part by following tweets, but there's a lot of bogus tweets. And so they built an algorithm to figure out whether this was likely a real story that they should follow up on or a bunch of fake tweets that they should ignore. </p><p>They face the costs of both mistakes, right? They're going to miss a story if they misclassify these tweets as false tweets and ignore it, they're going to waste resources if they misclassify these tweets as true and pursue it and they're false. So, they know what the tradeoff is, they know what the costs are of both kinds of mistakes, there's no reason to think they make the wrong tradeoff. </p><p>And I think that's true of a lot of marketing applications where if I screen out \"bad prospects,\" I'm turning away business. I don't want to do that by mistake. I want to turn it away if it's bad business, but I don't want to turn it away if it really is good business. So, there's some fairly strong incentives within the system to make sure the algorithm works well. Where you don't have those incentives is where somebody using the algorithm only pays part of the costs and the rest of the costs are shifted to somebody else. </p><p>SOLOVE:  What, suppose with the algorithms, I think there's a lot of concerns, because suppose especially a predictive algorithm, suppose the hotel chains, like, you know, get together or create an algorithm for determining when a particular hotel guest is going to damage the hotel room or treat the hotel room badly or do misconduct in a hotel room. And they basically come up with the algorithm and it comes up and says that you're one of those people, and starts...you're booked. </p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes. </p><p>SOLOVE:  Along with Mick Jagger too. And, you know, you started not be able to get, rent hotel rooms or suddenly you're charged more. And what are your rights there? Because you're targeted in a predictive sense, it's like well, hey, I never did any damage. Well, we're not saying you did, the algorithm's just saying that we think there's a high probability that you might. So the algorithm -- there's something wrong with the algorithm, it's just taking into account factors, and, hey, it might actually be true, but you haven't done it. Should people have rights to say just because it says I'm likely to, how do I disprove that? </p><p>VLADECK:  Or how do you even know it? </p><p>SOLOVE:  Exactly, how do you know it? How do you disapprove it? How do you argue with the prediction? So the FBI says, our algorithms says you're going to commit terrorism, we won't let you the plane and so how do I prove it? </p><p>It's like, well, live your life and die. And then if you die and you haven't terrorism, then we'll take you off the list because we know you didn't do it. The algorithm was wrong. But there has to be something to say like who regulates, what are the concerns with the incorrect thing. How much transparency do we have? How can it be used? What about people's rights to challenge it and say the prediction is wrong and either inaccurate. I mean how do we -- but to just kind of leave it to industry to do whatever they want without looking to the harms that consumers might suffer from this I think is something that we definitely don't want to do. </p><p>We need this, why I think is very important that if we look into this and have good regulation on it. </p><p>VLADECK:  Yes. Let me push back a little on Howard's point. And maybe that Reuters bears the risks on both sides of this. But in consumer finance or creditworthiness or anything else, the consumer who is misclassified by the algorithm bears the risk, may not be informed and there are no shortage of stories that have been publicly discussed where people have been disadvantaged based on correlations, not on their actuals. </p><p>So, American Express had a serious problem because it was reducing the credit limits for black customers who went to certain kinds of black stores that were deemed to be indicative of a credit risk. And when that became public, their answer was we screwed up but we relied essentially on an algorithm. And so, again, I know I'm not trying to suggest that we -- that machine learning can't help us make better decisions. </p><p>But there needs to be both some transparency and some due process here, particularly where it's not the company that bears both sides of the risks.</p><p>BEALES:  Well, I mean I think in the financial transaction, it often is a company that bears both sides of the risk, because they're turning away business that would be profitable business and they -- there's an incentive to not do that. I mean, we can argue whether it's the perfect incentive or not. I think the other thing that we have to recognize and, is human decision-makers have all those same biases. </p><p>VLADECK:  Right. </p><p>BEALES:  And they're every bit that's hard to tease out. They are probably less transparent than algorithms. And I know when I was at the FTC in the 1980s, in the early 1980s, and we were bringing a lot of equal credit opportunity cases, every time we looked at a judgment creditor, right? The guy who sits down and looks at the applicant across the table and say, \"You look honest. I'll loan you money.\" There was discrimination. It varied whether it was women or race or what kind of discrimination, but there was discrimination. </p><p>Credits scoring guys didn't have that problem. Credit scoring reduced the discrimination problems that were inherent in judgmental creditors. And that's the potential gain from algorithmic decisions. More data is usually better because it can challenge your preconceptions about what's going on and what's the right answer here. </p><p>SOLOVE:  Sometimes. I mean I think that's true sometimes. But sometimes algorithms are no better than the humans that design them and there are hidden biases that can crop up in algorithms. </p><p>Not just the people who design them, in fact, the data being inputted into them. If you input data that is infected with human biases into algorithms, the algorithm spits out a data that also is infected as well. </p><p>So there's a lot of concerns all around, absolutely, algorithms can improve human judgment. Absolutely, human judgment can be problematic. But I do think that the cost of let's say for a business, just say, hey, I don't want this business, I'm going to turn a consumer away is not enough. It's not the same level of harm to the consumer. </p><p>Because the business can say on the aggregate we just think certain types of consumers are just not very profitable for us. So who cares if we don't -- if we lose a little bit of business, we ultimately gain. </p><p>For those consumers who can't have access to credit, who can't get a loan, it's a much, much bigger deal and a much, much bigger cost. So I actually don't think it's -- the market would always work itself out because I think that businesses might be, make a good economic decision. Hey, if we do this, yes, we lose a little business but we also lose some risk but that doesn't always look the same way on the consumer side. </p><p>COOPER:  Maureen, do you want to... </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Yes, I wanted to weigh in on this. I do think that there is the mechanism of the market, where if one company has a poorly designed algorithm, and it is leaving good business on the table, someone else has an incentive to try to capture that. </p><p>And that's one of the things I think we are seeing in the lending area. There are finer distinctions being made with better targeting tools that allow lending to occur at better rates than really going by the rough calculation of a credit score, that you kind of fall on this side of the line or that side of the line. </p><p>So, I want to certainly take into account the fact that there are competitive pressures to have a better algorithm to expand your business. </p><p>COOPER:  Just to kind of follow up. It seems that a lot of this discussion is about the classifications obviously, to come out of algorithms. Is Section 5 the right way to address that? </p><p>I mean, when we think about Section 5 would it be, with at least three out of the four of you here on the table have been in the position of an enforcer and is this the -- leaving aside whatever statutory or regulatory authority Congress has given the FTC to enforce discriminatory, Is Section 5 should it be, address an algorithm unfairly classify someone as being getting subprime loans for instance. Is that stretching Section 5 beyond where you think it should go? Or is that the right place for Section 5 to be or should it, instead should it be Congress making cuts of what is unfair discrimination? </p><p>BEALES:  It's beyond where I think Section 5 should go. It is the -- obviously, the FTC has a role in places where Congress has given it a role like equal credit opportunity. </p><p>COOPER:  Right, yes. </p><p>BEALES:  Where it enforces and that is -- it's reasonable and appropriate for them to do that. That's what it should do. But to look for discrimination even of the same sort in other places is a whole different set of considerations than what the commission knows about and has expertise in. </p><p>In one of the proposals that was kicking around at the time of the Unfairness Policy Statement was, well, maybe we should use Section 5 to say boards of directors should be more representative. </p><p>Elizabeth Warren, call your office. And that was the kind of thing that the commission and Congress were trying to get away from, and that's why the subjective kinds of values I think is something that the Unfairness Statement says in general, we can't do that. And even if it's something that we might do, it's probably more appropriate for a different agency to do it. </p><p>COOPER:  David? </p><p>VLADECK:  I have a slightly different answer. I agree with Howard that this kind of issue would rise mostly under ECOA or FCRA or some of the other statutes the agency enforces. But I think to the extent that there is some intentionality here, then it would fit under the unfairness doctrine. </p><p>That is if there was reason for the designers or the users of the algorithm to know that it somehow either inadvertently or because of the training data, systematically excluded X people based on gender or one of the suspect (ph) classes, I think the agency would have would have an unfairness case. But I think the burden on the agency in the case like that would be very high. </p><p>COOPER:  I imagine you probably don't want to weigh on it, so. The... </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  It's been covered. </p><p>COOPER:  Yes. It has been covered adequately. Just, while we're on this about and you had raised something, David, I think it's interesting about when we -- early on in your earlier response thinking about some of the problems. </p><p>Do you think that -- and really both David and Howard's people enforced and sat there and looked at the complaint recommendations and thought about what relief you should get. Do you think the FTC, its 13(b), equitable powers, I mean do you think it's hamstrung strong at all in its ability to get adequate relief in privacy cases? </p><p>Or do you think there should be -- I realize the commission I think on a bipartisan basis has been on record and saying that in data security cases civil penalties authority would be good and I could be wrong, but I think that's right. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  That's right. </p><p>COOPER:  But leaving aside that, I mean do you think that in privacy enforcement, do you think some -- there needs to be a bigger stick than what we have now, which it seems in many cases when these are apps that are free and collect data, it may be very difficult to get an equitable relief under 13(b). </p><p>VLADECK:  Yes. I mean I do think that, I mean, in my view and I don't think this is the commission's view is that there ought to be original fining authority under 13(b). And take Ashley Madison, I mean, there's no way to do meaningful redress there. </p><p>Injunctive relief is not going to give much solace to peoples whose marriages ended or whose spouse committed suicide. So I do wonder about sort of the ability of the agency to forge any kind of effective remedy in those cases. </p><p>I also think that if you look back at some of the cases that we brought earlier on in -- during the Leibowitz era, I think that a civil penalty for example against Google or Facebook initially would have had a deterrent value. </p><p>Facebook is currently under investigation again. Google, it took only two years before it violated the consent decree. I do think there ought to be initial fining authority under 13(b). I think the commission would have to use it carefully, particularly where other remedies were just simply inadequate. </p><p>But I do think 13(b) cases ought to be -- I think civil penalties ought to be available in these cases. </p><p>COOPER:  Howard, I don't know if you want to weigh in on that or ... </p><p>BEALES:  Sure, yes -- no, I don't like the idea of civil penalties, I like -- and especially in an area like privacy, I like the original scheme of the FTC Act that was the -- essentially the one bite at the apple because the precise meaning of unfair and deceptive is not that clear. </p><p>And the way the act was set up, the commission could get an order and if you violated the order, you were subject to civil penalties for that. But civil penalties sort of presume a really clear standard I think of what's a violation and what's not. </p><p>And that's not so clear in a lot of privacy areas. I think it is a lot clearer in data security. I do think civil penalties there make a lot more sense. But I think in a lot of privacy and some other areas, I think it's not -- I think monetary relief is not appropriate. </p><p>COOPER:  All right. So, Howard, I -- while I have you -- now turning to kind of how we -- or seeing a shift, we look at the GDP or some changes in the landscape of privacy regulation around the world and throughout the United States. We see GDPR, California, the FCC privacy rules is now at in funk. They all seem to be taking a -- like more of a FIPPs-based approach, a notice and consent, deletion rights, correction rights. </p><p>We see in the GDPR and California. On the other hand, we have the FTC which has been really based on demonstrating likely consumer harms or deception. And this tees off a little bit. We've discussed a little of this in the ex-ante versus ex-post discussion. </p><p>But do you have any thoughts on why you think we've seen a trend towards this at least in recent evolution, of these newer privacy schemes, away from a harm-based and more toward a consent-based. </p><p>BEALES:  Well, I think two things. One is and I think this remains true. There's a remarkable unwillingness to articulate what are the harms we're worried about, or inability to articulate what are the harms we're worried about. </p><p>And if you can't do that then you can't -- then it's hard to do a harm-based approach, especially as an across the board regulation that applies to absolutely everything. You've got to think through the harms that you're trying to prevent first. And there's been to me a remarkable unwillingness to do that. </p><p>Second, I think the FTC in the last few years has -- it certainly hasn't abandoned worrying about consequences, but it's also moved towards a more what I would call FIPPs-plus in its enforcement actions. I mean the VIZIO case is a really good -- a good example. </p><p>There is just no way to tell a story about that case that doesn't come down to notice and choice. People were surprised to learn, did it violate their expectations to learn that their internet connected TV was connected to the internet? </p><p>Really? And did they think that it was making recommendations for the next thing they should watch without knowing what they had been watching in the past. Really? </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  It didn't make recommendations, Howard. It said that's what it was collecting the data for. </p><p>COOPER:  But it didn't make recommendations. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  But it didn't make the recommendation. </p><p>BEALES:  Well, that's -- the complaint doesn't charge the failure to make recommendations. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  No. But it charges that if it's collecting the data and sharing it. </p><p>BEALES:  For ratings purposes. This was a completely inaccurate use -- innocuous use. There's no harm there at all. No harm there at all. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Wait, wait... </p><p>BEALES:  People didn't know, it violated their expectations. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  But it was also... </p><p>BEALES:  Why is that there? </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  It was also collecting data like even if you weren't watching something streaming, you were watching a DVD or something. It was collecting and reporting that this television watched this DVD. That's not a ratings. </p><p>BEALES:  Well, and again what's the -- I mean it is a rating purpose because it's how are people spending their time with the set which is what you, well, I mean, it's what the television rating services are busy measuring is how much time -- or is this set on that's what the boxtop is recording. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  But that's not what was being collected. </p><p>VLADECK:  Right. </p><p>BEALES:  But this is complementary to that data. It is -- it would help you... </p><p>VLADECK:  Well, in addition to that data. </p><p>BEALES:  Yes. Well, this is competition for Nielsen, right? It's got a box that measures what the TV is on and what channel is it tuned to. And that's about it. It's additional information about whether people are actually watching a TV show on the channel that it's tuned to or watching something else. I mean there's -- you can say it was unexpected but I don't know why it's bad. </p><p>SOLOVE:  Well, this is a lot of dispute about harm. This is one of the problems when it comes to harm is that you say, well, that harm is never articulated. Well, maybe the harms that you would think what harm is not articulated. I mean there are harms in some of these cases that don't necessarily mean that someone is out financially or their reputation is ruined. </p><p>And part of it is just consumer trust, that you buy a product. You think something is going to be used in a certain way and suddenly you discover, well, oh, all of this other stuff is going on. </p><p>And that doesn't just hurt the consumers. It also hurts other industry. People start to not trust it. Well, gee, I don't want to buy the nest things because they're going to do something with my data. I don't want to buy a Google home. </p><p>I don't want to go and use these new technologies because they are not -- I can't trust what they're going to do. Nothing they say, and it could be a different company that if consumers start losing faith that what's told to them, what they expect is not what they expect. All these products they're going to start to say why do I want to start bringing this stuff into my home when it seems like that everybody, the common story is they're doing something else with it that I didn't expect. </p><p>And that hurts other companies. It undermines the companies that are doing the right thing and are saying what they're doing with it and then doing that. And then if they want to use it for something else, tell people. Try to get their consent. </p><p>VLADECK:  (inaudible) problem. This is why we have the Video Privacy Protection Act because someone went to -- they used to have stores where you could rent videos. </p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  (inaudible) video. </p><p>VLADECK:  And they got list of what -- and everyone was outraged because who knows whether he was sitting there at night watching Disney shows or porn. </p><p>BEALES:  But VIZIO says, to me the VIZIO case seems to say the store can't keep the record. </p><p>VLADECK:  No. </p><p>BEALES:  That seems crazy. They're not publishing. They're not publishing this. </p><p>VLADECK:  It's a TV set. It's not your content provider. </p><p>BEALES:  Let me, let me -- yes. </p><p>VLADECK:  It's not your content provider. It's a TV set. It's like a radio. It's not a content provider. It's, and what VIZIO was doing is keeping an account of what you watch and selling it not just, with no restraint on selling it and that's why, that's... </p><p>BEALES:  But they're selling it -- selling it anonymized in aggregate. </p><p>VLADECK:  Well, OK. That's why we have a Video Privacy Protection Act because Congress... </p><p>BEALES:  No, there's nothing in the Video Privacy Protection Act that would keep the store from reporting the aggregate rentals by title. </p><p>VLADECK:  That's true. </p><p>BEALES:  That's what VIZIO wanted to do with this data, was the stuff by title. But I just wanted to say if we think about the problem the way Daniel just characterized it, then I think it's a problem that has no solution. I mean there are going to be -- this is an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today that I didn't read closely about 5G and why it's important to be first that predicted among other things, we're going to have internet connected tennis shoes. OK? </p><p>Now, imagine having to read the privacy policy for your shoes and your light bulb and everybody else. If we -- there are going to be things that happen in this new world that consumers will not know about, right? </p><p>Their cars will do things now that they don't understand how it happens or that it happens. If the goal is for consumers to understand at a technical level what's going on and how all the information is being used, we're not going to get there, guys. Let's think about what's second best. </p><p>SOLOVE:  Well, I think the consumer -- I totally agree with that point, consumers aren't really going to understand the technical thing, that's why I think the FTC plays a great role here as a backstop to say, \"Look, someone's got your back.\" If the uses are going to start to get so far afield, so unexpected, we're going to stop that. We're going to keep that in check. And I think that it shouldn't be like OK, wow, you're going to be totally ruined, that that shouldn't be the standard or else then I think it should just be obviously, if there is a small variation in use and it's very innocuous, it's not a big deal. I don't think we should go after trivial things. </p><p>But I think like significant variances in use aren't totally trivial. And it's not like it's impossible, and you can also look at circumstances, how hard would it have been just to try to shape expectations a bit better about what this product is going to do. </p><p>Companies should have an -- some kind of an obligation not to just hide the ball and secretly do things. Not saying it has to be in a fine print of a privacy policy, but the more people understand a little bit about like, OK, what are these new products doing and what are the consequences, it's an education that needs to happen as we make these changes. And it's not happening because there's no incentive to do it. So like, great, I can get away with just doing it on the sly and no one is going to come after me. </p><p>BEALES:  I think the important backstop though is not that there's something that I know there's nothing surprising happening with my data, because I'm sorry, whatever your data is there's something that would surprise you that's happening with it almost for sure. And even if you're quite sophisticated about what's being done with information and how it's being used, that's probably true. </p><p>The question should be is there something that's being done with that data that's creating a problem? But the mere fact that I didn't know it was there is not the problem. </p><p>COOPER:  Well, now that Daniel and Howard agree on the role of consumer expectations in privacy, great, that we solved that problem. </p><p>I want to -- we are going to -- I want to make sure we have time for some of the questions we got, but I want to turn back to David and in my introductory remarks I kind of posited that we're at an inflection point, that there is something out there seems to be at least have a lot of people talking or suggesting that we need to rethink privacy here in the U.S., maybe moving us closer to the EU, we see this in California. </p><p>So, I -- to David, do you think that the pressure for national and international conformity is going to drive federal privacy law closer to these other models whether we like it or not? </p><p>VLADECK:  I think that -- well, first of all, I think that the California -- the enactment of the California statute and the, sort of the slow implementation of it, deliberately slow implementation has created an interest in many other states to see if they can replicate what California has done. </p><p>And so, I don't think that Congress is going to immediately race to enact federal privacy legislation, but many of the most important statutes that we have the environmental protection laws, the occupational safety and health laws, these were all enacted basically in response to an emerging -- emergement of state law. </p><p>And so, my guess is that unless the business interests that are unhappy with the California law succeed in either scuttling it back in the California legislature, or attacking it successfully in court, you'll see other states moving to adopt a regime based on the California statute, which is to some extent based on the GDPR. And so, the other force that is very much at work in the privacy lawyers in this, either here or watching this on the web, they know this because they spent the last six months advising clients nonstop, compliance with the GDPR. </p><p>So I do think it's going to have an influence on United States. I think that that's problematic in and of itself. I think there are many laudable goals in the GDPR. I think for the United States to adopt that kind of approach would be very difficult. I mean we are not based on a code system of laws. And the GDPR reads a little like Napoleonic Codes updated. </p><p>So I think there is some friction in the joints, but I do think that particularly California has got 37 million people. It's the fifth largest economy in the world. It is the locus for much of the development of the tech community. And I think it's going to be highly influential. And I think the FTC has to sort of be very conscious about what's going to take place as a result. </p><p>And I do think that Congress has basically made itself irrelevant in this debate. And that may be a good thing.</p><p>COOPER:  Howard? </p><p>BEALES:  I agree with that. I would point to a slightly different example of what I actually think is probably the most likely outcome. There's a lot of -- and California is big enough to sort of drive things substantively. </p><p>It turns out, so is Vermont. Vermont passed a law requiring labeling of anything that had genetically modified organisms. That provoked industry support for a preemptive federal law that says you've got to label if it's got genetically modified ingredients. But you can label by a QR code that people can scan and go to a website to figure out whether it's genetically modified or not. </p><p>Now, it is -- there will be pressure for preemptive federal legislation. What that federal legislation will look like is not so clear. But I think there will be that pressure. </p><p>SOLOVE:  In the early days of breach notification, I remember I testified before Congress right after the ChoicePoint breach, this is 2005. And there was interest, very strong interest in Congress, look, all these states are starting to pass breach notification and industry was all behind it. We have to comply with all these different standards and this is going to be very complicated and expensive and, you know, we really need some federal pre-emptive law. There was even a couple of bills kicking around. Nothing happened.</p><p>So I have very little faith that this Congress really can -- can pass a law let along tie its shoes. So I think that it -- it really -- I'm not expecting, even though I think that some of these laws could benefit consumers and benefit industry to have some in these areas, I just don't think it's likely. And so I think, you know, Congress just will have not have the role unless it somehow gets it act together. Really won't.</p><p>I mean, the most significant privacy legal change that was passed was passed as part of Obama Care. It was the HITECH Act's updating of HIPAA and passing the notification rule and -- and that's really the big accomplishment for Congress in the last, you know, since 2000 really. Not much has gone on.</p><p>So yeah, I don't hold out much hope, so I think it's going to be what it is and I think there's some problems with that approach, when we're going to have a lot of different varying state legislation on privacy, breach notification's at least something that's more, you know, focused on one thing, you have variances. And all the different -- you know, all sorts of different laws like California's with different variations is really going to be a big nightmare for industry to comply with and I don't necessarily think that's a good thing.</p><p>BEALES:  I will say when I started at the FTC in 2001, everybody said the Internet legislation and privacy legislation is going to pass right away and you guys better get behind it, but well.</p><p>VLADECK:  Well, we said that at the beginning of the Obama Administration too.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Well, I was just going to point out that Congress isn't the, and the FTC aren't the only actors in this drama or the states. And so NTIA, and NIST and the Department of Commerce and the White House are all considering paths forward, do we look at some sort of approach that would allow more of a uniform privacy framework to be put in place. So I would encourage people to pay attention to that process as well.</p><p>COOPER:  I just got a card that, I was going to wait for the audience, but it says point of fact, HR 6743 Federal data breach is going to the full House and it was just voted out of committee today, so breaking news here. So I'm guessing it was prompted by this panel. Taking immediate action, immediate action.</p><p>So we're, I want to -- we're talking here about the pressure on the U.S.. One -- one thing that we have here in the U.S. that is the first amendment then, that seems to push back against privacy regulation, so I wanted to, Daniel turn to you and I know you've written and thought about this, the international or at least the comparative privacy law a lot, do you see any problems with extraterritorial application of elements of the GDPR?</p><p>For instance, we see that the European Court of Justice is now considering the extraterritorial application of the right to be forgotten. We saw a Canadian court deal some of that early this year with Google. So do you see that as a potential push back?</p><p>SOLOVE:  I mean there are definitely certain problems with that. I mean a lot of laws including U.S. laws have extraterritorial application as well, including the California law. And yes, I think that to some extent every country in every region has a right to regulate those who do business in its borders.</p><p>And I guess one thing is good luck enforcing that over in the U.S.. If a company is not in Europe, GDPR says it applies, but I don't see what they're going to do to really enforce it. So it's there in paper. It looks scary on paper, but in practice, it's kind of a joke. They really can't enforce it.</p><p>There are certain aspect of GDPR that wouldn't fly under the first amendment, but there are a lot of aspects under it that are fine under the first amendment, that are embodied in various laws. I can look to a lot of different provisions of GDPR and find analogs and similarities in U.S. laws including even rights to be forgotten. There are already right to be -- COPPA has one for example. So a lot of these aren't like foreign, radical concepts. There are certain things about GDPR that just will not fly in the U.S. for first amendment reasons as well as just general U.S. approaches.</p><p>So the idea that you need to have a lawful basis to process data, that you have to be somehow authorized to do it. And there's only justifications that allow you to even use or collect data. I don't think that would really work in the United States. It's just so contrary to the U.S. approach which is generally a permissive approach. Like you can use it unless there's a problem that's caused by it, and it's generally U.S. approach is not to just say, you know, you need authorization. Do something unless what you're doing starts creating an issue.</p><p>So I don't see that being carried over. But I think a lot of the things that GDPR does and a lot of things these laws do are not so radical and foreign and different to the U.S. You look at HIPAA, you look at GDPR, there's a lot of similarities, actually much more than the California law. HIPAA has a lot of similarities. A lot of GDPR is just having a privacy program, doing basic risk assessments and other things all of which HIPAA requires. </p><p>And the GDPR often doesn't say a lot about like what those things should entail. It just say, hey, do privacy by design and do it early, but it doesn't say what you're supposed to do for that, it's largely empty. It says do a privacy impact analysis, but it doesn't have a lot of specificity on these things. And sort of how HIPAA is in a lot of ways too.</p><p>So in a way, I don't think there is like -- things are so radically at odds with each other and that the GDPR approach is radically incompatible with the United States. I think there are certain things that are -- that won't transfer over, but I think the things that transfer over, the commonalities and the things that could work are more than the things that can't.</p><p>COOPER:  Anyone else want to jump in on that? All right, well so with a little bit of time, I've gotten lots of great questions, I unfortunately we don't have time to ask all of them, but I want to direct one to Maureen because it's right in your bailiwick. It has to do with the FTC taking advantage of it dual role as both having consumer protection and a competition side and using that to examine the impact of data, not just in the consumer protection dimension but on the impact on small business competition and entry.</p><p>And I know you've written about that and thought a lot about the mixing privacy and competition.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Certainly in a competition analysis, data could be considered if it is an asset that is being combined in a merger in a way that is going to reduce competition in some way. I mean much like combining two distribution systems or combining two factories. I think one of the questions though is really a lot of times concerns about privacy are really what's it driving, concerns about trying to use privacy in a competition analysis, so it's not really about hurting competition, it's about hurting privacy. So I think there certainly are examples one could think of, right?</p><p>So say there were two very privacy-protective handset manufacturers, right, and they sort of have that big part of the market and say you can say that was a separate part of the market than other handsets, and they were going to merge, right, and then they were going to have a high market share of handsets that compete on privacy attributes. That could be in any trust case just like you could have two manufacturers of super premium ice cream who want to merge, right?</p><p>COOPER:  Just hypothetically.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Just hypothetically, super premium ice cream, that was the case. And anyway, so I -- so I think it's not that data cannot be a part of it. It just has to be -- the concern has to be about competition. Now on the other hand, we have had situations where one company is buying another company and they're going to be combining data sets. They're not -- it's not -- they're not horizontal competitors, right? It's not that it's taking the competitor out of the marketplace, but that data that is going to be transferred over to the merged company was collected with a certain set of promises.</p><p>And so what we've said through the head of Bureau of Consumer Protection is that the promises travel with the data, right? So if you collected this data and said we're not going to use it for marketing and they're going to combine it and then use it for marketing, they would have to get a new set, well basically a new consent from the consumers. So if consumer says well no, no, that's not what I wanted, then they would have to take them out of that data set.</p><p>And so I think that's -- that's the way it has been handled. I mean there are merger cases where you do -- you're combining two very unique datasets, like we had a case about mapping use for insurance. And we had a competition remedy, because it was going to reduce competition and so we actually had a remedy that required sort of replication and sharing of this data set.</p><p>But so often, these types of mergers that involve a lot of data are, they're being combined to create what we would consider in antitrust like a new product, like a new efficiency as long as it's not harming consumers as a consumer protection matter and that wouldn't be considered a negative kind of thing.</p><p>So I actually have an article about this, called Competition, Consumer Protection, and the Right Approach to Privacy.</p><p>COOPER:  She'll be outside signing it on the way out.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Right, it's in the Anti-Trust Law Journal in 2014, but -- so it's not to say these values aren't important. It's to say what tools you use are, that's an important consideration. If you are concerned just about, you know, someone is going to use data in a way that harms consumers, that's a core consumer protection issue and you might -- you should use those tools. If you are concerned that this transaction that involves data sets is going to reduce competition, either competition on privacy or competition in another -- some other form, then antitrust is the right tool.</p><p>COOPER:  Anyone else? Yes.</p><p>BEALES:  Yes. I just think there's a different perspective on it that is also important. As we -- as we look at it and as states and Congress look at additional regulatory requirements, those often have differential effects on competitors, and in particular in the privacy world, it is a whole lot easier for a consumer-facing company like Google or Facebook to get consent than it is for the behind-the-scenes somebody that does exactly the same thing using exactly the same information, but they collect it via cookies, planted by a host of different publishers participating in an advertising network.</p><p>But that is the competitive fringe in the online advertising market, and regulations that make it harder for them helped to entrench Google and Facebook and that's not necessarily a good thing, but it's very much a competitive concern.</p><p>COOPER:  Okay, so here is a question in our 2 minutes and 21 seconds left, about the -- the -- it didn't come up surprisingly, but we kind of touched around on it, the privacy paradox. You know, maybe Daniel, I'll aim this one at you first, but the audience member says, how do you reconcile the fact that consumers readily value privacy highly even asked, but they tend to do things that contradict these stated values and I think we all know that as the privacy paradox, that stated preference seems to diverge from revealed preference in the privacy space.</p><p>SOLOVE:  Yes. Alessandro Acquisti, an economist at Carnegie Mellon, has done some really great work on this and studied this very effect of, you know, people and what they say and what they do are at variance. And that's often the case. And part of it is that, you know, the choices that people have and the way that they make those choices are shaped by how those choices are presented to them and a bunch of other factors that could lead them to make choices that are not always consistent with their stated attitudes.</p><p>And so we might say, well, what is true? Do you say the behavior is the truth about what they really value or is it what they say? I actually think it's neither. I don't think what they say is actually reflective of how they actually value something, but I don't think behavior is always a good metric either, because there're a lot of things skewing the behavior. And Acquisti does a great job of pointing out all the different skewing things on behavior.</p><p>So in a way, it's very difficult to measure what consumers actually value, because I think both metrics are problematic for doing that, because a lot of it is how informed the consumer is and what information they're given and so on. And you get very odd effects. One of his studies is very interesting. He had two groups and one group, he told like they're going to collect very sensitive data and one group he said, we're going to protect it, we're going to give all sorts of privacy protections and security protections on it and the other group, he said nothing.</p><p>And guess which group disclosed more, the group he said nothing to. And so it's almost figuring out like punishing you for actually doing the right thing, and that's because when you told people all the privacy and security protections, people's minds suddenly woke up, oh my gosh, maybe there are these risks that I didn't think about and that made them more cautious.</p><p>So a lot of interesting effects and I just urge you to read his work. It's very illuminating, and he'd do a much better job than I did at tackling this issue.</p><p>COOPER:  I'm sorry David.</p><p>VLADECK:  Yes, I'll make one other -- you know, people are generally presented with take it or leave it offers. I mean either of you are on Facebook or you're not, or you use Google Search or not and, you know, we did some research when I was at the FTC about these issues and part of it just -- and this is, just sort of echoes what Dave says, how the choice is presented.</p><p>COOPER:  Yes. Howard?</p><p>BEALES:  I think how you frame it clearly matters, but, you know, consumers have all sorts of preferences where it's a perfectly valid preference and a perfectly real preference, but when they confront the cost of satisfying that preference, they make a different choice, and that's -- there are issues of how you pose the question and how you define it and what consumers know, but there's also these choices have costs and consumers may make them differently.</p><p>An example I like is organic foods, something like 48 percent of consumers say, \"yes, I prefer organic.\" Organic's market share is about five percent.</p><p>COOPER:  All right, well I wish we could go on forever. I'm sure the rest of you all do, but we are out of time by the 6-0s on the clock up here. So join me in thanking this great group to -</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  I will await my instructions from below.</p><p>SAYYED:  If -- we have one more little end note, if Howard Shelanski, professor here will give closing remarks and here he comes now. The Price is Right style.</p><p>SHELANSKI:  All right great, thanks very much to all. And thanks to all of you for being here. I'm used to at academic conferences saying I'm standing between the audience and cocktail hour, there're no cocktails here, so you guys are stuck. I will nonetheless keep things brief.</p><p>I want to start by just reiterating what Dean Treanor said this morning, it's a real honor for us here at Georgetown to be able to host these first days of these series of hearings that the FTC is hosting. It's really -- we have a deep connection to the FTC as Dean Treanor explained and it's really just wonderful to have such a vibrant debate and so many of you here today and special props for my antitrust students who showed up, I appreciate that, former students so they're not getting any benefit from this since I'm not teaching at this semester.</p><p>One of the things that I think has been particularly heartening about today's discussion is we really see the full integration of the agency's consumer protection and competition missions. I think both of those are front and center, certainly the last panel makes that very clear, in the issues that these hearings are tackling. And you heard Bilal say earlier that the Bureau of Competition and the Bureau of Consumer Protection are really complementary.</p><p>I might add Bilal left one thing out of his formulation which was the Bureau of Economics, and it's my view that with a small handful of FTEs, the Bureau of Economics could actually be completely substituting of both of those other bureaus, but that's perhaps a chauvinistic view from someone who spent some time at that agency and in that bureau.</p><p>The importance of these hearings really can't be understated. I think one of the great things of the American regulatory system writ large and one that, sort of a distinguishing set of characteristics that one sees when one goes around the world and sees how regulation and law enforcement is done in many other very sophisticated jurisdictions, is the level of transparency and accountability that characterizes the way our federal agencies act.</p><p>And to be sure, one could be cynical about certain actions that those agencies take, but when one takes a broad view, it really is quite impressive. Agencies have to justify their decisions. Agencies have to have a coherent framework and they have to have evidence, and those agencies don't get to make those decisions on their own because they are subject to accountability through the courts, and you just have to open up the paper today to see an example of a court overruling a federal agency that did not meet those standards.</p><p>So the agencies have a real obligation. These hearings fall into that framework of transparency and accountability. An agency that fails to justify its actions in a particular case to a court loses the case. An agency that fails to justify its program and its approaches and framework loses its -- loses its relevance before the public, and that is I think a very damaging and harmful thing to have happen.</p><p>So for an agency periodically to hold sustained public hearings where it examines both the sets of problems on which it is focusing and the analytical framework with which it's approaching those problems is really a very important aspect of maintaining that relevance, maintaining that legitimacy with the public, and that is exactly how I see these hearings and what I see the FTC as doing.</p><p>The FTC has always been an agency that cannot stand still and rest too comfortably with the problems it's focusing on or with the tools with which it's analyzing its approaches to those problems. Indeed, that was the spirit which Chairman Pitofsky launched the hearings nearly a quarter century ago. We were in a time of very interesting economic turmoil with the rise of high technology industries, economics and other tools for assessing where there were competitive harms, where there were harms to consumers, were changing and developing.</p><p>And it was his judgment as chair that the agency needed to go out and make sure that it was well understanding what problems the public is focused on, that it was understanding the industrial changes that were before it and that it was understanding the state of the art of the knowledge with which it would assess those problems.</p><p>Well, I think all of those forces are even stronger today. And when Chairman Simons came into office, he came into office at a moment that most of us in the antitrust field and many of us in the consumer protection field recognized as a sort of a historic moment. I think there was sort of unprecedented debate, but I don't want to say unprecedented but certainly unprecedented for the last 40 years, debate over some of the fundamental framework and conventional understandings of how antitrust should be enforced.</p><p>There is a recognition that we have much sharper tools out there for understanding how consumers behave and process information. It's time for the agency to step forward and make sure that it is fully taking account of and understanding that public debate, because if it doesn't, it will keep looking over here and the public will be thinking about problems over there. </p><p>So if you open up again, the paper over the past week, you'll read that there is a lot of public debate, a lot of debate in academia, a lot of debate in think tanks about whether the consumer welfare standard and as conventionally conceived in antitrust enforcement is adequate to address some of the concerns about market structure changes or wealth distribution changes, things that the first panel this morning talked about.</p><p>I had people come up to me and say, can you believe the FTC invited so and so? Those are flaky ideas. They shouldn't be giving air time to those. And the FTC and I firmly disagree. These are things that people are thinking about and they are motivated by the problems that everyday consumers are perceiving. And if the agency turns its back on those voices in the debate and doesn't take into account what might be legitimate in those arguments, the agency will lose its transparency and it will fail the test of accountability before the public.</p><p>So recognizing that, we see on all of the panels today and on the panels that we will see in the other 19 days of hearings that I think are scheduled, are real diversity of views that explore the outer boundaries of what would traditionally be thought of as competition enforcement or consumer protection enforcement. And only by taking into account that thinking at the outer boundaries, of hearing about the problems that might be novel or different in form from the way we've seen them before given the rise of large digital industries and AI and new kinds of technology, only by fully exploring them and doing what Chairman Simons said we should do and that he would do in his opening remarks, follow the evidence, follow the evidence to identify where there is really a problem, follow the evidence for where we have a good understanding of tools that can resolve those problems.</p><p>In that way the agency will do two things. The agency will modernize its thinking. It will better be able to explain its actions even where the action is inaction, it will better be able to say action is not warranted or we don't know enough to have action. And we're making that decision having taken into account the state of the art thinking and having really heard from the public, from stakeholders of all kinds about what the problems are that they are feeling and that they are sensing out there in the marketplace.</p><p>By doing that, the agency will become more effective, it will modify its framework as it needs to to be more effective, but it will also be more effective and transparent in justifying what framework it eventually arrives at after these hearings.</p><p>So these are more important as events than the one-off kinds of conferences that very often characterize a field. They are a sustained and iterative process over 20 days where some of the same issues will come up again and again. Everything is documented, everything is public, and at the end, there will be reports very transparently explaining what evidence the agency is crediting, what arguments it's crediting, what arguments it doesn't feel it can credit, and the technology if you will of consumer protection and competition enforcement under Section 5 at the agency will all be the better for it.</p><p>So this is an important enterprise. It's an important enterprise not just for the people on the different panels, but it's an important enterprise for all of you to participate in, commenting, sending your comments to the agency, the agency has got an open window for those comments right now, because it is a unique moment that we might not get again for another 20 or 25 years, or else it will occur only incrementally though the case by case kinds of transparency and accountability. So this is a critically important moment. I think this is a really auspicious start today to that moment. I look forward to following and participating in some of at least the remaining 20 days, I would encourage all of you to do so as well. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SAYYED:  So I'm just going to say thank you and say five percent down. And then our next session, September 21st, Constitution Center, so not very far from here and that will get us I don't know, 10 percent down. Thank you, thank you to the panelists. Thank you, everybody.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2105093237</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X10-PMN1-DY0W-41Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"50603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bloomberg Government</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0005CZ7</classCode><className>HOGAN LOVELLS US LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001ST3</classCode><className>BAKER BOTTS LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009QT6</classCode><className>SIDLEY AUSTIN LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0004N36</classCode><className>KELLEY DRYE &amp;

And we at Georgetown Law are very pleased to be hosting this event. a And I think it's very fitting that we're here. Georgetown Law's connection to antitrust and consumer protection is longstanding and very deep. Dean Robert Pitofsky served as Bureau Director, commissioner, and then Chair of the FTC over his long distinguished career. </p><p>      Numerous agency leaders have been graduates of Georgetown Law; most recently, our current FTC chair, Joe Simons, we'll be hearing from him shortly. Also commissioner Nominees Christine Wilson, former DOJ Assistant Attorney General, Christine Varney. Monique Fortenberry, Deputy Executive Director of the FTC. </p><p>      We're very proud of having educated so many of the leaders of the FTC. And among our current faculty, David Vladeck, who is at the end of our panel today, was director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection.</p><p>      Howard Shelanski was director of the Bureau of Economics. Professor Steve Salop was both a senior official of the FTC's Bureau of Economics and a mentor to Chairman Simons and Christine Wilson. </p><p>      Actually, the chair, the chair and I were just talking about how his time in Georgetown had really prepared him in every way that you had. We're just very proud. </p><p>      And it's appropriate and it's particularly appropriate I think because in some ways these hearings are intended to follow the path that was set by the FTC's global competition and innovation hearings which were held in 1995 when Bob, Bob Pitofsky, was the FTC's chair. </p><p>      So we can look forward over the course of these hearings to a serious, insightful, and interesting set of discussion, some of the most pressing questions facing antitrust and consumer protection policy.</p><p>      FURMAN:  And don't take my thunder, okay?</p><p>      TREANOR:  Okay. Let me just kind of -- don't expect too much until you hear from the chair who will bring up your expectations. The FTC will be continuing its hearings and locations across the country. And over the next several months, it'll be exploring new ideas and approaches to its historic statutory mission. </p><p>      And for those of you who want to hear more about the antitrust issues of today right here at Georgetown Law, our global antitrust symposium which is now in its 12th year and is one of the most prominent antitrust conferences outside of the ABA Spring Meeting will take place this room in about two weeks, so.</p><p>      Thank you all for coming. I want to congratulate the FTC for its initiative and hard work in organizing these public hearings. And now, I'd like to call to the podium the director of the Office of Policy Planning, Bilal Sayyed.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SAYYED:  Okay. I won't take long except to thank everybody for coming and to tell people a little bit about what we'll do today. We'll turn to the chair in just a minute. But I just want to tell everybody this event is being webcast. The webcast will be posted to the FTC's website shortly after we conclude. This session is being transcribed and the transcript will be posted quickly. </p><p>      Tomorrow's planned session -- excuse me -- tomorrow's planned session has been cancelled because of concern about the weather, but it will be rescheduled and the, we'll make the effort to reschedule it here at Georgetown fairly, fairly quickly.</p><p>      Some of my FTC colleagues will be passing out question cards. If members of the audience have questions that they'd like to put to the panel, they should write them on the card and raise their hand, and we'll come collect them. </p><p>      We have an open comment process. And so we encourage people to continue to comment. That comment process will be open through probably the end of February. </p><p>      But we encourage people to comment on what they hear today, both what is presented and what is discussed. And then, all presentations made here will be posted on the website. And as I noted, the transcript of the session will be posted, so I'd say with that, I'll turn it over to the chairman and he'll kick us off to get started. </p><p>      SIMONS:  All right. Thank you so much, Bilal. Good morning, everyone and welcome. </p><p>      On behalf of all of us at the Federal Trade Commission, I want to thank you for coming to the opening of our Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century. Our goal is to make these hearings as informative, insightful, and consequential as possible, covering some of the most important competition and consumer protection policy and enforcement issues of the day. We believe we are situated to do just that. </p><p>      These hearings, as has been discussed already, are modeled on the ones that were held back in 1995 by then-Chairman Bob Pitofsky, who in his opening remarks said at the time, \"These hearings are designed to restore the tradition of linking law enforcement with a continuing review of economic conditions to ensure that the laws make sense in light of contemporary competitive conditions.\" We intend to continue that same tradition with these hearings. </p><p>      We are very fortunate to have a large group of highly respected participants representing a diverse range of views, including academics, practitioners, enforcement officials and representatives from public interest groups. </p><p>      And I am proud that we are opening the hearings at the Georgetown University Law Center, where Chairman Pitofsky spent much of his career when he was not otherwise at the FTC, and where I received my initial antitrust education to a significant extent from Professor Pitofsky. </p><p>      So, today, I want to talk about why the commission is holding these hearings. Almost 30 years ago, I came to the FTC, the first of my three times here at the tail end of the commission's adoption of a significantly revised approach to antitrust enforcement. This change, which began in 1981, and was implemented to a large extent by Tim Muris who is two or three people to my left here. </p><p>      This change, which began in 1981, reflected new learning that had begun to influence the Supreme Court antitrust doctrine. It was primarily driven by the scholarship of academics; the most prominent -- Phil Areeda, Don Turner, Frank Easterbrook, Richard Posner, and Robert Bork, were associated with either Harvard University or the University of Chicago. </p><p>      They applied microeconomic principles to antitrust questions and paid attention to empirical work, which led them to conclude that a lot of pre-1970s antitrust case law was inconsistent with rational, pro-competitive, and economically beneficial behavior. </p><p>      By the time I left the agency for the first time in 1989, application of microeconomic principles and simple economic models was routine and encouraged. Notwithstanding some initial criticism, the Clinton administration's antitrust leadership, including Bob Pitofsky, Anne Bingham, and Joel Klein, largely adhered to the same principles. </p><p>      So, when I returned to the commission as director of the Bureau of Competition in 2001, there was substantial support for and acceptance of the antitrust reforms that had been initiated 20 or so years prior. In other words, there was a general consensus on how we ought to think about antitrust enforcement and policy. </p><p>      But now, at the beginning of my third stint at the commission, things have shifted. The broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged in at least two ways. </p><p>      First, some recent economic literature concludes that the U.S. economy has grown more concentrated and less competitive over the last 20 to 30 years, which happens to correlate with the timing of the change to a less enforcement-oriented antitrust policy beginning in the early 1980s. These concerns merit serious attention, and they will be part of today's discussion. </p><p>      Second, some are debating the very nature of antitrust itself, calling for antitrust enforcers to take account of policy goals beyond consumer welfare. Inequality, labor issues, and excessive political power are perhaps the main examples. </p><p>      We will discuss some of these suggestions during later sessions. These concerns raise a challenge for antitrust agency leadership, the courts, and legislators to think hard about whether significant adjustments to antitrust doctrine, enforcement decisions, and law would be beneficial to our country, in order to accommodate these concerns.</p><p>      As I noted in announcing the hearings, it is important that the antitrust enforcement agencies be at the forefront in thinking about these issues, not bystanders to this debate. To that end, today and continuing through the fall and early winter, we have invited interested parties to discuss these issues, both through public comment and public sessions, with us and each other. </p><p>      We do this with the goal of understanding whether our current enforcement of policies are on the right track, or on the wrong track or on the wrong track, and if they're on the wrong track, what should we do to improve them.</p><p>      I approach all of these issues with a very open mind, very much willing to be influenced by what I see and hear at these hearings. I am old enough to have witnessed in my own career dramatic changes in antitrust policy and enforcement. These changes have largely been driven by developments within the economic community, which were then adopted by the legal community. The movement by the economists, however, has not always been in the same direction. </p><p>      In the 1950s and 1960s, a substantial body of empirical economic work purported to show significant anticompetitive effects at relatively low levels of concentration. In 1968, the DOJ issued merger guidelines based on these studies. But just about the time the guidelines were issued, the economic studies on which they were based were being substantially discredited. </p><p>      As a result, the agencies over time raised the concentration levels at which mergers were seen as problematic. A more recent example where developments in economics increased the level of successful merger enforcement involves hospitals. </p><p>      In the 1990s, the government lost a large number of hospital merger cases in a row, and the agencies considered whether to give up on hospital merger enforcement. Fortunately, we did not. Instead, we engaged in empirical economic studies that demonstrated the anticompetitive effects of hospital mergers, and we revitalized our hospital merger enforcement program. </p><p>      So the developments in economics can suggest, depending on the circumstances, that our enforcement has either been too aggressive or too lax. This episode involving hospital merger enforcement really drove this point home for me personally. The use of economics should not be thought of as a one-way ratchet, only driving down the level of antitrust enforcement. </p><p>      Good economics might point us toward more or less enforcement, depending on the facts and the analysis in front of us at the time. In my view, basing antitrust policy and enforcement decisions on an ideological viewpoint, whether from the left or the right, is a mistake. Whether or not we expand antitrust beyond the consumer welfare standard, I would rather make policy and enforcement decisions based on the best evidence and analysis, including in particular, empirically grounded economic analysis that enables the analysts to weigh the costs and benefits broadly defined to help determine the best approach. </p><p>      My hope is that these hearings will significantly improve our ability to do so, and help to bring about a new and improved consensus among our antitrust stakeholders.</p><p>      But we are not focused solely on competition issues today or throughout the hearings. The strength and direction of the agency's consumer protection mission is also something that we are going to explore at some length at these hearings. </p><p>      Today, our most significant and difficult consumer protection issues often revolve around the use and abuse of technological capabilities not likely imaged during Bob Pitofsky's chairmanship. </p><p>      As a result, we will be having multiple sessions on data security issues. And our upcoming hearings on platforms, big data, and artificial intelligence will address consumer protection issues, including privacy, as well as competition issues. </p><p>      Before closing, I want to thank not only the participants in these sessions, but the many groups and individuals who have filed comments in response to our initial hearings notice. We have received over 500 non-duplicative comments, many of substantial length and thoughtfulness. We are reading them and considering them carefully. We expect more comments as we proceed, and I encourage those interested to comment on what you hear today and throughout the hearings. </p><p>      I also want to thank our co-sponsor and host, the team at the Georgetown University Law Center, for helping us pull this initial effort together. I also want to recognize the staff of the FTC for their efforts in both preparing for the substance of this event and undertaking all the logistics to bring us together. </p><p>      I, and all the commissioners, are grateful for the work of so many people both within the FTC and outside the FTC, who are engaged in making this a successful effort. Thank you for attending, and I hope you enjoy the hearings. </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      And I'll turn it over to Bilal.</p><p>      SAYYED:  Okay. So, I'll just take a few minutes the panelists and then try to get out of the way, in no -- in no particular order, or maybe some particular order.</p><p>      Jason Furman will speak first. Jason is presently a professor at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, and was formerly the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.</p><p>      Tim Muris, just to Jason's left, it was most -- is presently a senior counsel at Sidley Austin but was also chairman of the FTC from 2001 to 2004. And previously, director of both of the Bureau of Competition and the Bureau of Consumer Protection but not of course at the same time. </p><p>      Just to the left of Tim is Alysa Hutnik. She's a partner at Kelley Drye, and really an expert in consumer protection law. </p><p>      Immediately to my left is Jim Rill. Jim is senior counsel at Baker Botts presently, but was head of the Antitrust Division for about 1989 to 1992. </p><p>      And then we also have Janet McDavid, who was not a head of the either agency but certainly is one who has been considered to head either, maybe even both agencies, had in the past. Jan is a partner at Hogan Lovells. </p><p>      And, finally but by no means least, Professor Vladeck, who serves as director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection just a few short years ago. And, of course, is a professor here at Georgetown.</p><p>      So, with that I'm going to turn it over to Jason. And just remind everybody if they have questions, raise your hands, pass your questions over to some of my colleagues who are collecting question cards.</p><p>      FURMAN:  Thank you so much. And I thought Chairman Simons' remarks were perfect in three respects. One is you want somebody to be open-minded coming to this question, because thinking really is evolving very rapidly. </p><p>      Second, he had a really excellent capsule history of antitrust thinking, and third, I think he made it clear that he was deferring completely to economists in how he was proceeding on this matter.</p><p>      I'm a little bit of an interloper on this panel. I think I'm one of the only economists. And anyone that knows any economics would know I'm even more of an interloper than that, because my main focus has been on macroeconomic issues, labor market issues, inequality, not on industrial organization and antitrust narrowly defined. </p><p>      When I was chairing the Council of Economic Advisers, I came to this issue partly out of what I'll now admit was paranoia. There was a crime that had been committed and we were looking for suspects. </p><p>      The crime was low productivity growth and high inequality, something clearly going wrong in the economy. Productivity growth being about a percentage point lower over the last decade than it had been previously; at the same time, high levels of inequality continued to move higher. </p><p>      And those were the two factors that were underlying the slowdown of the growth and income for the typical families that I think is the central challenge for economic policy. So, what can you do to raise productivity growth, to reduce inequality?</p><p>      And we were looking around a lot of different suspects. And just to be clear, there is more than one cause of this set of phenomena. But one thing we alighted on was this area. Part of what motivated it was a few sub-facts under those two big ones. And let me just list a few of them. </p><p>      One, a number of economists had documented that throughout the economy, there was less churn and dynamism. Fewer businesses being created, fewer older businesses, larger businesses increasingly dominating the economy, fewer people moving from job to job. So, a little bit more of a sclerosis than we like to think is the case for the U.S. economy. </p><p>      There was, in terms of inequality -- I'm sorry -- reduction in investment, a trend down in investment. Partly, that's shift to intangibles, but not completely, and trying to understand that. </p><p>      On the inequality side, there was a rise -- fall in the reduction. I'm sorry. A fall in the share of income going to labor. And, finally, an increase in markups in the rate of return to capital relative to the safe rate of return. And an increasingly skewed rate of return to capital, with some very successful companies having persistently very high returns, much higher than the median, relative to the median than they had before. </p><p>      So, this was a fact pattern about aggregate data that made us to look beneath the aggregates in terms of what was going on at the firm and the industry level. </p><p>      Now, one way to look at what's going on in the firm and the industry level is to use aggregate industrial data, and to divide up the economy into 10 industries, into 800 industries, and look within each one of those what's going on in concentration.</p><p>      And then, numbers did that -- a number of people did that. Grion et. al., Archer et. al. -- we did at the Council of Economic Advisers, and you saw it in the press as well and places like The Economist. And we generally find that in about 75 percent of industries defined in this way concentration increased. </p><p>      Now, as the antitrust community was quick to point out, there is some dispute as to whether it was 35 years ago people realized this was an idiotic procedure, or 50 years ago that people had realized this was an idiotic procedure. But that these aren't antitrust markets.</p><p>      Now, the people that put this forward from the very beginning, including ourselves, understood that. No one would bring in an antitrust case based on these types of aggregate data. Everything has pluses and minuses. </p><p>      But we're trying to look at economy-wide phenomenon and really needed to use economy-wide data because the type of relevant antitrust market analysis we have for some parts of the economy -- and I'll talk about it in a moment, but we don't have it for all of them, and can't really aggregate up, synthesize, and add it all together. </p><p>      When looking at this macro data, I think the question is not ex ante, what do we think about it? Of course, these are the relevant markets for antitrust. It's does it work, does it help explain some of what we're trying to explain. </p><p>      And subsequent research by Gutierrez [ph] and Philepon [ph], among others, has found actually that as this aggregate level, increases in concentration are tied to reductions in business investment, are tied to reductions in R&amp;D by business, and also are associated with rising markups in those industries and rising rates of profit in those industries. So, you see these different measures seemed to, in a broad sense, work and explain some of what we are interested in.</p><p>      The next set of measures that one could look at aren't the aggregate macro data but are doing what you would do in an antitrust case, which is looking at a particular relevant market properly defined, and asking is the level of concentration high? Has the level of concentration increased? </p><p>      There have been a range of studies, some done by the FTC, a number done by economists for a whole lot of markets. Ad services, health insurers, hospitals, refrigerators, airlines, telecommunications, beer, all of which have consistently found very high levels of concentration, and in many cases, rising levels of concentration well in excess of the levels that would trigger a review if there was a merger under the merger guidelines. </p><p>      Moreover, a new strand of research, one that is still very new, I wouldn't necessarily go and make policy on it with certainty tomorrow, but one that so far as turning out to be empirically more convincing than, frankly, I would have expected on common ownership finds that when the same few companies own all of the airlines and own all of the banks that that increases concentration above and beyond what you would measure if you thought that American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta were three different companies, when you realized they're all owned by the same companies. </p><p>      And you see that in a variety of data including remarkably at sort of a root by root level in terms of the pricing, so there's a wealth of microeconomic, more traditional antitrust evidence for this. </p><p>      So the question now is why have we seen this increase in concentration? And what are its consequences? I don't think there's any single answer to the why question. </p><p>      In some cases, the increase in concentration may be for good reasons and reflect increases in efficiency, increases in competition that weed out some of the less effective firms, globalization, and the like. This is an explanation that's been stressed by economists including David Ardor [ph], et al. </p><p>      That's the story that probably works pretty well in the retail sector where it wasn't that there were a few big mergers. It wasn't that there was some collusive common ownership. But the company Wal-Mart figured out how to have better supply chain management and grew. And then Amazon did the same online. And as a result, there's more concentration in that sector, and it reflects that increase in efficiency. </p><p>      For a lot of the economy, though, the story is much less benign than that one, and it gets to -- has its roots in what Chairman Simons described as a large change in the way we thought about antitrust. </p><p>      Kwoka has documented for example the FTC's oversight challenge looking into mergers, used to look at six to five, now we'd never look at something like that. So you have changes in antitrust enforcement. Some of it may be grounded in other parts of the economy. </p><p>      We should be looking also at things like regulations and rent-seeking that allow companies to create rules that benefit themselves at the expense of others; certainly, in questions like intellectual property. And I think a lot of these competition issues are about antitrust, but they go more broadly. </p><p>      And then if you look at labor markets, you want to look at occupational licensing, something the FTC has been at the forefront of for a long time, land use restrictions and a whole bunch of ways that reduce competition in the economy.</p><p>      So, I think you have this combination of good reasons, bad reasons. And then you have some that are ambiguous. If you look at something like the tech sector, you've seen a lot of innovation, but you also have platforms with network effects that lend themselves to scale that might say that it's efficient to have a single producer at scale. </p><p>      It's also efficient to have a single municipal water company, but that doesn't mean we would want to let it go off and charge whatever it wanted to charge. I'm not saying that we want to regulate technology the same way we regulate municipal water. It's much more complicated. And it's an issue that I'm currently looking at as head of an expert panel for the UK government reviewing digital competition by trying to understand the combination of good reasons that you've seen companies grow with innovation and competition and bad.</p><p>      I want to talk about why we care about this. Traditionally in economics, this is just about prices, and it's about prices being higher. I think that issue matters. Airlines prices and cellphone bills are higher in the United States than they are in Europe, because European competition enforcers have been more vigorous. They have more players in those industries than we do. So, I think the price issue matters. The price issue may be a lot smaller than some of the others I talked about. One is innovation, what this does to the incentives for business investment for R&amp;D, for productivity growth. </p><p>      There's a longstanding debate between a review of Arrow and Schumpeter in economics about the impact of competition on innovation. But there's a number of ways in which it could be deleterious.</p><p>      And then, finally, inequality. And there's been, at the same time that there's been this increase thinking about these types of macro issues in competition, there are also has been in labor markets as well. And that's grounded in the observation that every employment relationship has a bit of monopoly power a and a bit of rent that's being divided between the two because there's a cost of finding a new job and shifting a job, and so market power matters a lot.</p><p>      If you have one hospital in town, it's a lot harder for a nurse to threaten to move to another hospital to get a pay raise. If you have two hospitals in town, it's much easier for the two of them to collude tacitly or even illegally to hold down the pay of nurses.</p><p>      Even in the fast-food industry, there's evidence that anti-poaching and non-compete agreements have a deleterious impact on workers' bargaining power, help to hold down wages, and have been part of the reason that the labor share has been reduced. </p><p>      In summary, I think this evidence is coming from a variety of different places, and a variety of different perspectives. If you're trying to ask a question about the economy as a whole, you're not going to have one definitive data source or one definitive study that's going to answer that question. You have to take a collage of views. And I think that collage involves looking at the pattern of what we've seen in the data that I talked about in terms of falling labor share, falling investment, rising markups.</p><p>      Looking at the industry level and seeing whether those phenomenon are industry by industry tied to concentration, and they are. Looking in a deeper, more careful way where we can, and we can -- we've done that in a lot of different industries. </p><p>      And then no single story comes out of this, but on balance and on average, this does seem to add up to a reduction in competition, a reduction in dynamism. And one that I think that we need to be concerned about and think about what ways we need to update our policies to address if we want to have more investment, more dynamism, more productivity growth, less inequality, in addition of course to the traditional focus on lower prices for consumers. Thank you. </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SAYYED:  Well, thank you, Jason. We're going to turn to Tim Muris now. I will note that although Jason is the only economist on this panel, we have if I count correctly, five economists; 100 percent of the panel, on our second panel in the afternoon. So, we are trying to balance just about everything in these hearings. Right. Okay. </p><p>      MURIS:  Well, thank you, Bilal. I'm honored to be here, once again following in the giant steps of my friend and predecessor, Robert Pitofsky.</p><p>      We first met in 1976. But it was 1988 working on this second Kirkpatrick Commission that we realized we shared a vision for the FTC. </p><p>      Not that Bob and I always agreed, of course. Minutes after being sworn in as chair, I announced to a somewhat nervous reaction that there was indeed a new majority. I said there was no longer majority of New York Yankee fans on the commission. </p><p>      The FTC has enjoyed great success for decades. And I'll address a few topics here. First, what durable success means for an agency like the FTC; then the vision that Bob and I shared that has led to the agency's success.</p><p>      Next, I consider recent challenges from two Ps, paternalism in consumer protection, and populism in antitrust. Because both of these isms once dominated FTC work particularly in the 1970s. I discuss history. I lived through the 1970s, and the decade was disastrous for the FTC. Nostalgia expressed explicitly in recent literatures is misplaced. I have no desire to relive those years and neither should you.</p><p>      I'm submitting a longer paper with lots of footnotes, like lawyers do. And I'll make a lot of assertions for which those footnotes provide support. But starting with success, it has to be built on something more ephemeral than headlines. A definition that is less ephemeral starts with the recognition that an agency needs a clear understanding of and support for its core mission among its constituents. </p><p>      Second, this core must derive from a vision clearly shared not just today but enduring -- enduring through electoral cycles. Over time, perhaps, decades, stakeholders adjudge favorably the core mission of successful agencies. </p><p>      Finally, a successful public institution needs a coherent strategy. The positive agenda must direct the institution at all levels from the staff to the managers to agency leaders. Without a general strategy and positive agenda, an agency merely reacts.</p><p>      The FTC has such an agenda, the heart of which is to attack practices that harm consumers by hampering the competitive process and violating the basic rules of exchange. The FTC's success in large part reflects this shared vision. </p><p>      Take antitrust first. Until recently, antitrust reflected bipartisan cooperation. Disagreements existed in close cases but there was widespread agreement that antitrust should protect consumers, that economic analysis should case selection, and that horizontal cases were central to enforcement.</p><p>      Regarding cases, Robert Bork once remarked that firms either make war on each other or they make peace. This framework reflects the consensus that the most harmful practices occur when firms stop competing vigorously; making peace to hurt consumers. Horizontal mergers with likely anti-competitive effects are one fertile area for firms to make peace. Firms also make peace through non-merger conduct. As with mergers, of course, collaboration is not itself sufficient to assess consumer welfare.</p><p>      Many collaborations are beneficial. And the peacemaking of most concern lacks offsetting efficiencies, what antitrust lawyers call naked horizontal agreements. The FTC has pioneered development of the law here, especially among professions, generic drugs, and the process to analyze collaboration. </p><p>      In rare instances, a single firm with market power can exclude competition to harm consumers. The 2001 Microsoft case, probably the most famous recent example, it's, those kind of cases are important to any antitrust program. </p><p>      A particularly fruitful category of troubling single-firm conduct involves misleading the government. Misuse of courts and government agencies is effective way, this rent-seeking, to stifle competition. Such strategies are not limited to single firms, of course. They're the cheap exclusion which is a felicitous phrase that the people at the FTC have invented. </p><p>      Two antitrust immunities helped protect this rent-seeking, NOR and state action. Some courts have broadly interpreted these immunities for -- and for decades, 40 years in fact, the FTC has sought to circumscribe both with three Supreme Court victories and state action. </p><p>      On NOR, the agency saved consumers billions of dollars at the gas pump in Unocal and provided large benefits for pharmaceutical consumers in Bristol-Myers Squibb among many other successes. </p><p>      The vision for consumer protection is identical to that in antitrust. When competition alone cannot defer dishonesty, private legal rights help, there's government-developed common law. When the market forces are insufficient and common laws ineffective, there's a role for a public agency. And consumer protection and the antitrust naturally complement each other. Under the FTC's positive agenda, robust competition is the first and most important way to protect consumers. </p><p>      And the FTC's role is crucial but it's a referee, not the star player. The foundation and core of consumer protection is the systematic attack on fraud begun in 1981. And the FTC has continued to expand in each administration the fraud program.</p><p>      The commission has long evaluated advertising by legitimate businesses, and in this century has expanded into privacy, and with many successes. The National Do-Not-Call Registry being one of the most popular government initiatives in history.</p><p>      But yesterday's success has become today's challenge with robocalls clogging our phones. In terms of robocalls, the FTC has been aggressive and ingenious but ultimately, robocalls are like spam. </p><p>      Spam was, ultimately, the most effective way to deal with spam was when the ISPs developed tools to be able to screen out the majority of spam. And in the same way, robocalls I think will be best dealt with when those who deliver phone services and others develop the legal and technical tools to block unwanted calls. </p><p>      Now, I've written and with Howard Beales that we criticized the Obama FTC on occasion. But compared to the paternalism of the CFPB to which I turn next, the FTC has been a paragon of virtue. </p><p>      Let me turn to those two P's and their contrary vision for the FTC. The first is the return of the paternalism of the 1970s. The FTC of that era sought to become the second most powerful legislature. </p><p>      In one 15-month strength, the FTC issued over a rule a month seeking to transform the entire industries along the vision of the then-very young people in charge of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, as proposed most of these rules were market supplanting with adverse consequences. </p><p>      There was an exchange in the 1972 National Commission of Consumer Finance which is illustrative, and I'm not making this up. There was a debate about whether poor and middleclass people should borrow money to buy color televisions. With some people saying they shouldn't do it because they didn't need such luxuries, and other people defending their right to buy on credit color televisions. That, unfortunately, was illustrative. </p><p>      This paternalism has returned with a vengeance in the CFPB. And by this, I mean the Obama CFPB. Whatever one thinks about what's going on, the powers of the CFPB are there. They haven't been touched when President Warren comes in in a few years. If she or someone likes her -- like her comes in, the incredible power of the CFPB which is insulated from any effective control will still be there. </p><p>      Substantively, the CFPB has broad undefined powers to regulate. It adds the word \"abuse\" to the more defined FTC termed of deceptive and unfairness. And abuse is akin to the FTC use of unfairness in the 1970s. And like the FTC, the CFPB -- like the FTC in those days, the CFPB prefers to use its discretion as opposed to a definition. </p><p>      You can look at the effects of the CFPB on consumer credit and they've been significant, in the paper, I discuss the qualified mortgage rule and the criticism of the Federal Reserve on that rule in slowing the return of the housing market, and the adverse effect particularly on minorities.</p><p>      Now, those who defend the CFPB sometimes raise behavioral economics, which is a recent challenge to the benefits of markets. In its extreme version, it's based on the idea that errors that -- and people, obviously, sometimes make mistakes. But the idea is that those errors are systematically irrational.</p><p>      Now, some people will tell you that normal economics assumes that consumers have perfect knowledge in their economic calculators. Well, I was schooled by those normal economists, and I learned about transaction cost and imperfect information from those individuals. So, I think that that parody of economics is simply inaccurate. </p><p>      Moreover, there are numerous problems with using behavioral economics. For one thing, the behavioralists don't agree on which biases they talk about are relevant. For another thing, there is not empirical evidence to support what they want to do. For yet another problem is that consumers invest in various ways to improve decision-making. </p><p>      Now, I'm not saying there aren't important papers and empirical work here to be done. I cite an example in the paper of the credit card market, where people do choose accurately and are learning from their mistakes. There are lots of papers like that in the healthcare market. I mean, in the credit market. </p><p>      In the healthcare market, on the other hand, Fiona Scott Morton has written a very good paper where there are systematic -- there are systematic mistakes. Now, I believe that healthcare markets are different, but I would hope these hearings and the FTC pay attention to those empirical issues. </p><p>      The second P, populism, is reflected in calls -- and Chairman Simons mentioned this -- on the left and the right to use antitrust to dismantle the highly successful companies, or at least the so-called tech companies, or at least regulate them as public utilities.</p><p>      These are misguided calls. For one thing, what a tech or digital company is, is hard to know. We have new technologies but they're being diffused through the economy. Moreover, these companies have different positions in the market. Some have big market shares; some don't. </p><p>      Equally important, we've been down the populist road before with disastrous consequences. John Nuechterlein and I discuss some of this history in a new paper that John will discuss in detail later. And let me talk about the highlights.</p><p>      Before Wal-Mart and Amazon, another company used the same kind of tools to become the largest retailer in the United States for over 40 years. This company was so important, the company was the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company that John Updike, the young John Updike, used the company as the title in the setting for his iconic short story which every one of my generation had to read in high school. And what happened was A&amp;P success triggered a backlash, and the government went after A&amp;P for two decades. </p><p>      First, they passed the Robinson-Patman Act which embarrassed the antitrust world for much longer than two decades, and took a long time for the antitrust world from which to recover.</p><p>      This new legislation was not enough. First, the government prosecuted the A&amp;P successfully criminally. They still weren't done. They sued to break the A&amp;P up. Finally, a new administration came in, the Eisenhower Administration, and settled for some vertical divestiture. </p><p>      The problem was this long war of attrition caused the leadership of the A&amp;P to focus on fighting the government, not on its new competition. And today, all that's left of the A&amp;P are the coffees. Eight O'clock, I think it's called Eight O'clock. And the company itself is gone. </p><p>      Now, it's true that the FTC largely abandoned RP in the 1970s, but there are two vestiges of populism that were strong at the FTC in the 1970s and the first was predatory pricing.</p><p>      There were three important cases, probably the most prominent of which was the coffee case. In the -- in the early -- in the mid-1970s, Proctor &amp; Gamble, then the most feared marketer of consumer goods had Folgers Coffee. Folgers Coffee expanded into the heartland, into the East, into the heartland of Maxwell House.</p><p>      Maxwell House General Foods responded, massive price war, benefiting consumers enormously. How did the FTC respond? It sued General Foods for responding against the best marketer in the world. I'm not making that up either. And there were -- and there were other such cases. And a call for return to predatory pricing is an important plank of the new populist agenda. </p><p>      Another bulwark of the 1970s antitrust was reliance on the simple market concentration doctrine. And the concentration levels were levels that no one today would regard as significant. </p><p>      The prominent example was four firms with 50 percent share. This theory was sometimes married to a populist animus toward bigness, which led the commission to seek vertical disintegration of the then very unconcentrated oil industry. </p><p>      And through 1980, the FTC was pursuing de-concentration long after the majority of the economics profession had dominated or had abandoned extreme versions of the market concentration doctrine.</p><p>      Well, let me conclude. With the creation of the CFPB, the FTC has another federal agency performing each mission. The original CFPB model, mirroring the 1970s FTC, contrasts to the modern FTC. Perhaps the regulatory world runs in cycles. But one hopes that the FTC will not be in a future Groundhog Day where it awakes each morning to 1975.</p><p>      In contrast, consider the current, in antitrust -- I'm sorry -- consider the impact of the current reformers who which to return antitrust to focus less on consumers and more on protecting less efficient businesses. </p><p>      Imagine how the companies they would now punish would have fared in their desired legal environment. Once the newcomers had grown beyond a certain size, perhaps by the late 1990s, their lawyers would have counseled them to be cautious about expansion, innovation, and price cutting, lest they face antitrust liability for disadvantaging their less efficient rivals. </p><p>      Luckily, because this advice would have badly misstated antitrust law, lawyers did not give it. Let us pray for the sake of American consumers that such advice never becomes sound. Rather than condemn innovation, whether in the 1930s or today, we should applaud.</p><p>      Companies like the so-called tech giants have been built from the ground up in the United States rather than in Europe or China, largely because the U.S. legal environment is stable, predictable, and uniquely hospitable to vigorous paradigm-shattering competition by all businesses. That legal environment is a hallmark of American exceptionalism, long may it continue. Thank you. </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SAYYED:  Okay. Thank you, Tim. And we'll turn to Jim Rill now. </p><p>      RILL:  Thank you, Bilal. It's indeed an honor to be here, the commemoration of the work that was done by Bob Pitofsky and the leadership of the commission in 1995. And a particular honor to me. I go back relationships with Bob in 1969 when he was basically the author of the first Kirkpatrick Report on the Federal Trade Commission, and we worked together in the ABA. </p><p>      In 1992, he was a very important and direct consultant on the 1992 horizontal merger guidelines. So, it's indeed an honor to be a participant in these, in these programs. </p><p>      I want to talk today about the developments in the antitrust world that's created by the globalization of antitrust, which I think is one of the most significant developments in the competition world in the last decade since the first Pitofsky hearings. </p><p>      I think the most important thing we can see is there's been a cascade, a tsunami of antitrust agencies across the world. In the 1995, there was a handful of agencies that had antitrust, and some agencies that had an antitrust law -- Japan, a gift of 1946, really didn't enforce it. </p><p>      Now, we see something like 130 or more agencies with an antitrust regime. And those agencies that have had an antitrust regime are increasingly engaged in enforcement, often with a very controversial, very controversial, very controversial results. </p><p>      So, what we need to think about, what I think needs to be thought about at the commission and the other antitrust agencies is what is the response of the antitrust agencies to this global tsunami of antitrust agencies around the world. And I don't want to suggest that that's a bad thing. I think it's a good thing, properly founded, property principled, properly directed, because I think a sound competition policy is essential to the operation of a market economy. </p><p>      So, what have the agencies done, and what is the challenge facing them in the future? The agencies were responsible, I think particularly the FTC and the Department of Justice in the formation of the International Competition Network in 1990 -- in 2001, following on the report of the Department of Justice International Competition Policy Advisory Committee, the ICPAC that was put together in 1997 and reissued its report in 2000. </p><p>      The International Competition Network was founded on the platform of the Fordham Program in 1991 with 12 members. Tim Muris was very instrumental in putting that together. Now, we have well over 100 members, 100 agencies that are members of the International Competition Network. And the ICN has been extremely important in producing guidance that's based on market economics and due process for its member countries and for other countries around the world, essentially soft guidance, but nonetheless effective and responsible guidance. </p><p>      The ICN has produced merger notification and procedure guidelines, has put out through its unilateral conduct working group of guidelines on predatory pricing, guidelines on dominance. Most interestingly I think the work that the ICN has done in the area of procedural due process and the antitrust, the working group -- excuse me, the working group on agency effectiveness which was headed -- task force was headed by the Federal Trade Commission, the work of Randy Tritell and Paul O'Brien has been extremely effective in putting out guidelines on due process, guiding principles, annotated guidance and similar documents. </p><p>      These are extremely important contributions that are made towards convergence, if not harmonization in the antitrust world. Similarly, the OECD again under U.S. leadership has put out a protocol on hardcore competition. Also, documents on the merger notification and procedure really anticipating ahead of time the ICN's work in that area. The OECD has also issued a very monumental report under the leadership of then-Chairman and then Assistant Attorney General Varney on due process and procedural fairness. </p><p>      So, most recently, in 2017, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission issued revised guidance for international enforcement. This guidance document I think broke some new ground. And providing for the government's involvement in advocacy across the globe, that it would attempt to foment adherence to sound principles of not only process, but substance and would advocate decisions as the occasion rose in particular situations. </p><p>      It extolled the benefit of bilateral agreements which the United States antitrust agencies have several, calling for cooperation in particular cases, it set forth principles of comity, and establish a principle that criticized extraterritorial reach of antitrust enforcement where that extraterritorial reach was not based on the immediate impact, substantial reasonably foreseeable direct, immediate impact on the host nation, consistent with our legal principles in that particular area. </p><p>      On the question of its advocacy, what we have is a fairly general statement, however, not one that gets into the specificity of when and how that advocacy might be best advanced and effected and implemented. And I think that's a challenge as we will indicate going ahead. The ICN, the International Competition Network, is continuing its effort towards promoting convergence in substance and procedure through workshops and similar efforts to bring about convergence and harmonization and sound principles. </p><p>      Non-governmental agencies as well since the last time, since the 1995 hearings increased their efforts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has issued a so-called expert report -- I say \"so-called\" because I was on it, so therefore I've got to be modest -- expert report on due process and the way forward, somewhat controversial in that it advocated the establishment of a cabinet-level coordinating committee for dealing with international antitrust. </p><p>      I think one head issue that I personally had some -- it was on the report, had some skepticism as to its efficacy although there should be more coordination among the agencies of the federal government. The American Bar Association has had several task forces, several reports in this area, a due process report and currently a program going forward, soon to be I think finalized on sort of a, if you will, not a report card but an analysis of the implementation of due process, task force headed by my partner, John Taladay and Melanie Akin (ph). Also, the ABA is soon to present a paper on the use of public policy issues in antitrust globally. </p><p>      That is the extent to which non-antitrust factors flying under the flag of antitrust tend to adulterate -- that's my pejorative, not theirs, I expect -- tend to adulterate the efficacy and substantial foundation for antitrust enforcement. The ICC, International Chamber of Commerce has issued a report in this area that is of significance and extols again the need for global consensus and fair procedures. The private sector is active -- is it enough active? No, but increasingly active in this particular area. </p><p>      So, what are the challenges going forward? There are limits I think to the efficacy of soft guidance, of soft convergence. It's necessary, essential, but is it enough? Is it sufficient? My answer to that is I think you need to go beyond it. There are -- there's no structured mechanism right now for establishing, if you will, ambassadors (ph) for evaluating the extent to which the guidance of the various international organizations and national organizations that I referenced are being actually implemented and then can -- then followed in the nations around the world, including sometimes I might say the United States. </p><p>      We see action in China involving a merger by Coca-Cola which I think has questionable economic foundation, the denial of a transaction involving NXP which had been approved by every other agency in the world on grounds that are difficult to discern any kind of link through it to sound antitrust. We seeing in Korea in expanded reach for extraterritoriality, in an area where there may be no effect, whatever on consumer welfare in Korea. We see in Taiwan enforcement actions with no printed, published and maybe not even any practiced sound standards for due process. </p><p>      All of these issues I think are a challenge, a huge challenge to global antitrust including the United States going forward. And sometimes, frankly, the United States has been criticized for its use of CFIU.S., criticized overseas by its use of CFIU.S. to in effect undermine sound antitrust analysis and engage in national championship work. I'm not trying to agree. I don't agree with that in many respects, but I know that has been criticized overseas and recently. </p><p>      In a speech, former Director General -- former commissioner for competition of the European Union Mario Monti said that Europe has much sounder antitrust leadership, foundation, correctness than the United States. We have to be aware of that and be sensitive to it. </p><p>      So, what should be the response going forward? And I don't pretend that I have any particular wisdom here, but throw out some ideas and actions that I've seen. First, there is an increasing, I think, demand, interest for the United States agencies to become directly involved in individual enforcement actions overseas where the effectiveness on important interests of the United States, not to protect the U.S. champion but where there's an important interest to the United States that bears on effective competition policy. </p><p>      We have in our agreements and then in other international principles, mechanisms for cooperation, notification, and transparency. These I suggest should be implemented. They have been implemented by the United States. In BoeingMcDonnell Douglas for example, the U.S. was very much involved in attempting to I think put on -- I'll say put on the right track the European Commission's analysis of that transaction even to the point where this guy was an antitrust professor at Arkansas, I think named William Clinton got involved in the lobbying before the European Commission on that transaction. </p><p>      The actions of the Federal Trade Commission in certain circumstances have been salutary. I think in discussing a matter involving Intel in Japan, it was effective outcome. Press reports indicate there was effective outcome involved in U.S. involvement with Qualcomm, a principal issue in China. And of course the -- I'm not sure how, I think effectively about greater convergence in understanding and consultation, the U.S. criticism of the European and the commission's action in G.E. Honeywell. </p><p>      We must respect foreign agencies' interpretation of their own law. We don't necessarily need to surrender to it. In our efforts to converge, to consult, I think the decision by my classmate, Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the vitamin C case sets a good principle for the question of respect, but not total deference to foreign law. </p><p>      So, I think what we need to do going forward, what I suggest would be an appropriate role for the Federal Trade Commission and consider the really excellent work it's done and the work that the Department of Justice has done. I think the Federal Trade Commission under the guidance of Randy Tritell has made great strides in this area. But the question is testing the implementation. </p><p>      And I'd like to close with reference to the initiative that's recently been announced and promoted by Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim to establish a multilateral framework for procedure in antitrust cases. He recently spoke at the Fordham Conference indicating that there's significant progress in that area, that some 12 or so countries are signing on. We haven't seen what they're singing on to in detail yet, but signing on to the principle. It's a major first step by a national antitrust agency to attempt to persuade other countries that there needs to be some system -- joint system for assisting in the implementation and review, not a scorecard, but a review of the extent to which the guidance document for the so-called soft guidance is actually adopted and fomented in the international arena. </p><p>      I think that is the challenge going forward to the FTC, to the Department of Justice, and I think it's a challenge of enormous importance for international antitrust and international competition policy. And so, with that, thank you very much. </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SAYYED:  All right. Thank you, Jim. </p><p>      And, Alysa, (inaudible) I note that I'm very envious of the ICPAC, that they had apparently three to four years to do their report. </p><p>      HUTNIK:  So, switching gears to consumer protection and privacy, and like most consumer protection lawyers, I have pictures. </p><p>      So, I do want to first strongly support the commission's objectives for these hearings. I'm a firm believer in that there is value in self-examination and being willing to both solicit and consider constructive feedback from constituents and practitioners inside and out. And indeed, from a similar process, the 1995 hearings positively shaped subsequent FTC policy and approach and one would expect similar outcomes from these hearings. </p><p>      So, taking the time machine, let's see if we can get there, back to the 1990s and while some of us might have had Mariah Carey on the radio, hopefully no one is going to raise their hands on that, here at the FTC in 1995 hearings had technology front and center in the focus. </p><p>      And there, the focus was innovative changes and convergence happening with the online marketplace, television, cyberspace, even radical new technology issues such as purchasing compact disks over your telephone. And notably even then, the FTC was already anticipating issues with the amount and the type of data collected online, who was accessing that data, how many people who were accessing that data, cyber security issues with the data and the associated other consumer protection considerations. </p><p>      The resulting Pitofsky Report from those hearings provided an effective roadmap for consumer protection business guidance and policy for over 20 years. Tim Muris mentioned durability. This policy has been extremely durable. That report centered on several key tenets:  one, consumer sovereignty. This is a point that's been echoed in the 1980 FTC policy on unfairness and in decades before in adjudications and business guidance, the idea that we would give consumers access to material information and allow them to make their own choice without regulatory intervention, to do it conveniently. </p><p>      Two, the agency would prioritize enforcement to fight fraud and deception and unfair business practices that caused consumers harm. The agency also would support industry self-regulation as a way to make limited agency resources go further and to provide businesses with greater clarity on compliance expectations. And finally, the commission would provide consumer education to empower consumers to navigate through emerging marketplaces. </p><p>      And while some might argue that the application of these concepts has ebbed and flowed over the years, they're viewed by many as the successful foundation to the FTC's approach in consumer protection. It's an approach that is largely consensus-based. It's not largely political. It's measured and it intentionally considers competition concerns with those of consumer protection. It's also a framework that supports our nation of innovation. We are experiencing and witnessing a technology revolution that has no end in sight and a robust marketplace that provides feedback when a line has been crossed. Through both consumer choice, a vibrant press and government enforcement. </p><p>      And while there may be growing pains from time-to-time and sometimes criticisms that the FTC does not act fast enough to prevent unlawful business conduct, it is the flexible nature of the FTC's Section 5 authority that is such a critical part of our country's economic success. </p><p>      Now, like any balanced framework, we should continue to ask tough questions to determine if and what changes may be warranted so that the agency's consumer protection mission can continue to be fulfilled for the next 20 years. </p><p>      And in looking at the comments filed in response to these hearings, these certainly raise several themes. One of the main themes that Chairman Simons started out with was the concept of technology, whether the technology marketplace of today and tomorrow requires the change to the FTC's organizational structure and allocation of resources. And just as the 1996 Pitofsky Report following those hearings observe that there would be challenges to the agency's consumer protection mission with the evolving technology marketplace, today's cyber threats and technology changes and innovations will absolutely test the FTC's expertise and its resources. </p><p>      Technology plays an integral part of the consumer experience whether at work, at home, in educational settings, healthcare, facilitates the way we interact with each other and with the world around us. So, it's no surprise then that technology should play such a key role in most of the FTC's consumer protection enforcement cases. And given the technology emphasis of commerce today and tomorrow, does the current FTC's organizational structure and investment of resources in technology expertise reflect the present and foreseeable needs in order to fulfill the consumer protection mission. </p><p>      One of the second themes and many might call it a pain point reflected in the comments is the ever-growing patchwork of consumer protection and privacy laws around the globe and here in the United States. The 1996 Pitofsky Report recognized the obstacles that a multitude of conflicting laws would pose for commerce, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses and new entrants. Today, these compliance obstacles have only grown, particularly in the area of privacy where there appears to be a race to become the most comprehensive in regulating data practices. </p><p>      And given the examples that we are seeing in Europe, California and elsewhere, it remains an open question on whether the commission's risk-based approach will have to yield to a national and uniform approach to privacy. But that may be easier said than done with respect to passing federal legislation particularly in an election year. </p><p>      So, in the near term and in the absence of a uniform federal standard, what type of guidance and policy leadership can the agency provide that could be helpful to the national and global discussion on the costs and the benefits of more prescriptively regulating business practices? </p><p>      And the third theme from the comments underscored a point that this agency has always faced, where to focus its enforcement efforts, what shall be the priorities given finite and limited resources. And with lots of shiny objects and headlines to choose from, the agency has most advanced its consumer protection mission when it's focused on business practices causing real harm. </p><p>      Financial and physical harm have rightly had the agency's attention, but importantly, given the role of technology in our lives, the agency under then-acting Chairman Ohlhausen has also explored how informational injury can cause real harm and how the agency can measure such harm and seek to deter and to remedy unlawful business practices with such results. </p><p>      Doing more with less also might involve all aspects of the commission's in-house expertise with more visible collaboration with the bureaus of competition and economics. Indeed, the unfairness prong of Section 5 requires that competition be taken into account and more transparency on this involvement in the competition analysis in consumer protection cases would provide helpful guidance to businesses, which in turn will help consumers. </p><p>      The last theme that was raised that I'll touch on by the comments and which played an important role in the Pitofsky Report as well is how important the FTC's supporting and incentivizing company participation and meaningful self-regulatory programs is. They're not a substitute for government oversight, but they can enhance the agency's consumer protection mission with a lot less cost. History has shown that self-regulation is more nimble and able to move more quickly to address innovation and technology changes. </p><p>      And when the FTC promotes the use of self-regulation and incentivizes companies to embrace such standards, industry responds time and time again and consumers benefit directly from this carrot rather than stick approach, incentivizing rather than purely focusing on punitive deterrence. </p><p>      So, I will keep my comments shorter. It lead me to concluding remarks that with the rapid changes that were happening and all the discussion around technology, we're largely discussing many of the same types of issues that were discussed in some form at the last set of hearings in 1995. And as we hear from many voices during these hearings, I can say from my personal experience working with startups, working with large companies, new entrants, those that have been around for decades, most companies are motivated to do the right thing while also remaining competitively viable. </p><p>      Straightforward laws that do not pick winners or losers, clear regulatory guidance, and vigorous support of self-regulation enable companies to achieve those goals without unnecessarily fencing in opportunity or innovation. And for the fraudsters and companies that are bent on causing consumer harm, the FTC has its tools -- existing tools -- to address that. </p><p>      Thank you. </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SAYYED:  Okay. Well, Alysa, thank you. We're going to -- and thank you for getting us almost back on schedule. That's why friends know, being off schedule just a few minutes would be a major achievement in my life. </p><p>      So, anyway, we're going to take about a 10-minute break. So, let's come back here just a little slightly after 10:30 and we'll start up again. </p><p>      SAYYED:  Okay. Thank you. I just want to remind everybody that we do have some of my FTC colleagues collecting question cards. So if you have a question for the panel members, just write it on the card, raise your hand, we'll pick it up, and we will try to get to it. But before we turn to both of sort of the panel Q&amp;A and audience Q&amp;A, we're going to ask separately, both Jan McDavid and David Vladeck to both comment on what they've heard and honestly comment on whatever they'd like to comment on.</p><p>      But I'm sure it'll be germane. So I'll first turn it over to Jan and then turn it over to David when Jan is complete.</p><p>      MCDAVID:  Thank you, Bilal. I want to applaud the Federal Trade Commission for again using its statutory authority to consider whether changes in our economy require adjustments in the FTC's enforcement priorities. Such hearings were part of the FTC's original statutory mandate and have been used very effectively throughout its history most notably in the Pitofsky hearings that were discussed extensively this morning.</p><p>      I'm honored to participate again as I did in the Pitofsky hearings. And I'm returning to my antitrust roots here at Georgetown because my antitrust career started my final semester in law school at Georgetown when I studied antitrust law with Bob Pitofsky. </p><p>      Hearings provide the FTC an opportunity to step back and consider broad philosophical issues without the pressure of fact and time deadlines arising out in particular proceedings. That's a real luxury that most agencies don't have and the FTC does.</p><p>      That kind of introspection allows the FTC to identify opportunities for improvement. It also offers an opportunity for democratic participation, which is one of the objectives recently outlined by commissioner Chapra in his paper last week.</p><p>      I speak here as a practitioner who advises clients everyday on antitrust issues. And I share the FTC's view. That competition produces the best, most innovative, lowest price products and services for consumers. Most antitrust enforcement actually takes place in conference rooms in law firms and boardrooms in corporations where people like me advice our clients on where the lines are and how they can achieve their business objectives without crossing those lines.</p><p>      Our ability to do that effectively is significantly enhanced if our clients know that the antitrust cop is on the beat. That was true in the Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations because antitrust has always enjoyed bipartisan support. And based on our early impressions, it's also true with the current Federal Trade Commission and Antitrust Division.</p><p>      I've always viewed the antitrust laws as sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing market conditions, such as those involving the growth of technologies or foreign competitors. It also has been sufficiently flexible to be applied across a broad range of industries involving defense, healthcare, consumer goods or technologies, which don't particularly have anything in common.</p><p>      The antitrust statutes as they've been interpreted by the agencies and the courts in recent years, in the last 30 years or so, provide a framework that knowledgeable council can apply as we consider the unique facts brought to us by our clients. And of course, we also bring the bear the economic concepts that are so important to underlying antitrust analysis today. Over the course of my career, I've seen the development of sound antitrust doctrine rooted in a principled analysis, and above all the positive role, the economic analysis played starting really with the Supreme Court's decision in General Dynamics, which was decided just before my final law school exam by Bob and the GTE Sylvania decisions and leading to various iterations, for example, of the merger guidelines. </p><p>      In contrast, one of my mentors, former FTC commissioner Tom Leary, said that during his early career, when they would be defending a merger before the agency, they would say, \"God forbid it would achieve any efficiencies,\" because that was suspect in the '60s and early 1970s. </p><p>      As I was trying to do antitrust research as a young lawyer and as a law student, I had a very hard time discerning any consistent thread through the cases I was reading. And that made it really hard to advise clients. That's not true anymore, because we have a framework that lawyers and even our clients understand.</p><p>      During my career, antitrust analysis has been grounded in fundamental principles and focused on consumer welfare. Contrary to the concerns expressed by some, prices are not the only touch point in our analysis. We have handled many matters in which issues like innovation and product quality were much more central than price. </p><p>      And in my experience, the agencies have done a very good job of identifying those issues and resolving them in the matters. The way they have done so has also made it possible for advisors like me to tell our clients where the antitrust lines are. I'm a progressive Democrat. So you might expect that I would be applauding the development of populist antitrust theories. But I think that including populous antitrust concept would make the task that I undertake for my clients much more difficult.</p><p>      Instead of well-established principles grounded in consumer welfare and sound economic analysis, we would be applying amorphous concepts of bigness and fairness, some of which turned traditional principles on their heads, such as lower prices that don't have the underpinnings of a predatory pricing analysis, or penalizing large successful technology company simply for being successful because they created new products and services that consumers genuinely desired.</p><p>      This could return us to the era of Von's Grocery where the dissent lamented, \"the court grounds its conclusion solely on the impressionistic assertion that the Los Angeles retail food industry is becoming concentrated because the number of single-store concerns has declined.\" This led Justice Stewart to complain that \"the sole consistency I can find in the antitrust laws is that the government always wins.\"</p><p>      But even that wouldn't be true in a populist system because ultimately we don't have an administrative system in the United States. We have a system of enforcement and the agencies and private plaintiffs bear the burden of proof. In Europe and many other countries, the government can simply say no. </p><p>      Here, they have to go to court, and they do so grounded in facts and economic analysis that supports their case, but with a framework that everyone understands. Where there are legitimate concerns about fairness or employment effects, for example, those issues should be addressed under different regimes as it's done today with the CFIU.S., unless as in the case for example of the no poach cases, there is a legitimate antitrust concern directly affecting employment and arising out of particular conduct. </p><p>      Antitrust is a well calibrated tool to achieve competition and consumer welfare. But it is poorly designed to tackle social issues that are more appropriately addressed under other kinds of legislation. We should respect the limitations of antitrust. </p><p>      And finally, antitrust analysis that includes amorphous concept of bigness and fairness could lend itself to politically motivated enforcement, which we certainly should eschew, especially now in the current political environment.</p><p>      Thank you.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SAYYED:  David? We'll turn to David now.</p><p>      VLADECK:  Okay. Thank you. Let me start by thanking Chairman Simons for holding these hearings. I think this is the right way for the commission, for a new commission to get its bearings and to figure out what its priorities are going to be and what its agenda should be. </p><p>      I also think it's right to honor Bob Pitofsky, his legacy still looms large at the FTC when I was there, I'm sure it still does. The influence he's had, not simply on the antitrust side of the agency, but on the consumer protection side is enormous. And it's only fitting to do this here at Georgetown Law School.</p><p>      So I generally agree with Alysa. I'm going to try not to repeat the points that she made. What I'd like to talk about or what I think are three-main challenges the commission faces going forward. And the first and this I think Alysa brought up is tech, tech, tech. Virtually everything the agency does today has some connection with emerging technologies. </p><p>      When Chairman Leibowitz and I got to the FTC, we did not have a tech infrastructure. We did not have a single technician on staff, to the extent we needed to engage in forensic analysis, we had to outsource it. Today, because each of the successive chairs has built upon the tech infrastructure that we started to build, the agency has more technology capacity than ever. </p><p>      But I still wonder whether it's sufficient. The agency needs deep expertise in things like artificial intelligence. It needs the forensic ability to conduct investigations in data breaches and in other kinds of consumer injuries. We need better forensics, better tools. And so, one challenge I think the agency faces going forward is to make sure that its infrastructure, its resources match the challenges that the agency faces. </p><p>      So I think that's one. One of my former colleagues, Cradmaker (ph), Professor Cradmaker, suggested that maybe it was time that the FTC added a new bureau, a bureau of technology. I don't know whether that's the right way to address the technology deficits that the FTC faces. But that's something that ought to be considered.</p><p>      Second, the challenges of protecting consumers in a digital economy. Now, the FTC in 2012 issued a report that tries to set out a framework about how consumer protection matches the FTC mandate. And I think there's a lot of very valuable advice in that report. I would urge the new commissioners to dust it off and take a look because it provides, I think, a blueprint at least for dealing with some of the difficult questions the commission is going to face. </p><p>      For example, automated decision-making, I'm not necessarily a foe of artificial intelligence. After all, we all know that human decision making is not necessarily great. Right? But it provides all sorts of challenges for regulators. It's a black box system. You can't interrogate an algorithm and it can be a breeding ground for disparate treatment that is based on impermissible factors. </p><p>      And rooting out those kinds of problems is very difficult for the agency. Data driven offers in pricing. The marketplace is full of variable pricing and variable offers. I mean there have been challenges about Facebook's ads for housing and so forth.</p><p>      These are very difficult challenges the agency faces to ensure fairness in the marketplace. And the lack of transparency in the algorithmic decision-making process runs a real risk that at least some consumers are going to face tyranny by algorithm. The commission needs to figure out how it can be an effective regulator in this space. </p><p>      It faces enforcement challenges. Yesterday, there was a New York Times article about the New Mexico attorney general bring a COPPA case and criticizing the FTC for not beating his office to the punch. Well, COPPA enforcement has been a thorn on the side of the agency since apps were developed. </p><p>      The app market, the app developer market is highly diffused. There are thousands of people making apps, some in their parents' basement. And it's very hard, unless you're going to carpet bomb the industry, to have an enforcement regime that really works well. And now the agency's brought many, many CAPA cases and it's done so against high profile violators. But that's a problem.</p><p>      And Alysa talked about the usefulness of self-regulation. This is in the area where we've encouraged self-regulation. We actually detailed a lawyer to work out of our San Francisco office to be an outreach person to the app development community or encouraging some kind of self-regulatory body. But we didn't succeed.</p><p>      So there are some enforcement challenges that the agency faces as well that are magnified by outdated statutes that the agency has to enforce. Neither (inaudible) nor some of the other statutes that were enacted before anyone could envision a digital economy like this need to be updated. And I would hope that the commission can work with Congress to do so.</p><p>      I think the lack of civil penalties in Section 5 cases has been a serious lack for the agency, particularly in data breach cases. The RAND Institute is not a number of studies, making clear that the economic incentives, particularly for box stores and other kinds of consumer-facing companies don't push hard enough to ensure robust security defenses. </p><p>      That is it's economically rational to risk a data breach because the cost of strengthening one's defenses may outweigh. I think civil penalty availability in those kinds of cases would add a necessary deterrent. And my help stem the (inaudible) ID theft. I think we need to update the unfairness doctrine.</p><p>      It's interesting because the unfairness doctrine seems to at least be interpreted by some to require some form of economic or economic-like harm. But the statutory mandated the FTCs to prevent unfair and deceptive practices. Now I try to remediate them when they take place. And there are many harms that are just not actually well-remediated by money. </p><p>      I mean for example, the Ashley Madison data breach. This was a secret dating site. Well, marriages broke up, people commit suicide. These are serious harms that ought to be prevented. There's at least an argument that the Unfairness Statement as it's currently constituted doesn't really take into account some of these reputational injuries that have been made possible by a digital economy. </p><p>      My last point is the regulation of big data. There's now pervasive data collection. It's ubiquitous. In fact, the last bastion in privacy, our homes is now yet another side of data collection. People have always on, always love devices of the internet of things. They're going to put censors in people's homes, all of these -- these serve useful purposes. But they involve enormous data collection.</p><p>      And we need to figure out how to protect consumers in this area of ubiquitous data collection. We don't have laws that really deal with this. The aggregation of data is a real sort of enticement to data thieves. So, Apam Ohm (ph), who worked at the FTC when John and I were there, wrote in a law review article about 10 years ago where he forecasted there might become a time where there would be databases of ruin. </p><p>      That is, that the data collection would be so ubiquitous that whatever fact that you would be mortified to have revealed to the public or to other people, that those facts will be in a database. Well, given the ability of data sharing, data lakes, the ubiquitous movement of data, there really is no answer to those questions now.</p><p>      And those are questions that the FTC has to address. We did -- when I was at the FTC, we did a 6B on the data collection by data brokers. And I think that was a good start. And I think one of the things that I'd urge the commission to think about is using a 6B authority to get a better handle on basically just how consumer data flows, where does it go, who has access to it, what kinds of constraints, if any, ought to be imposed? </p><p>      So I think -- I commend the FTC for holding these hearings. I think this is going to be a challenging but interesting time. And I urge that the commission think about these things. Thank you so much.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SAYYED:  So thank you, David. What I'd like to do now is I have a series of questions and in frankness we've shared them with the group in advance. But, of course, they were prepared before I knew what anybody would say. What I'd like to do is first ask the panelists, maybe to ask questions of each other or comment on what others have said. </p><p>      And because he has to leave at 11:30, and in fact squeezed us in to do this panel, I'd like to ask Jason if he's got some thoughts on what he's heard, particularly because he comes from this -- from a different perspective or different background than the rest of us. And then I'll ask folks maybe to put some questions to Jason.</p><p>      FURMAN:  Yes. I guess we've heard two references to populist antitrust. And I'm not sure whether I agree or disagree with those comments. If those comments are saying you should replace the current disciplined approach with the sort of wooly-headed if you don't like the company and you want to promote democracy and like ground your approach in something big and cosmic like that, then I certainly agree with you.</p><p>      If what you're saying is that there were certain papers written decades ago and those papers are still a hundred percent correct, and we should base all everything on these tablets that were handed down and any change would be populist and barbarian, then I think I quite disagree with that. In fact, even some of the assumptions and arguments of people like Bork and Posner and others made, economists in IO have long known that they were quite fragile, and based on very specific assumptions that weren't very robust that the world was much more complicated. </p><p>      As you said, Janet, people do take into account a broader set of considerations. But to some degree, economists need to do a better job of understanding this broader set of considerations too. So I think this is an evolving area.</p><p>      As the chairman said at the very beginning of the remarks, I think that continued evolution is important. I think that if some of the macro evidence data and motivations that I said lends more impetus to that, I think that would be a welcome development and an important one. But I still would then use that to motivate -- you saying micro market by market techniques to think about cases, not some of those types of macro data. </p><p>      But I don't think that irrelevant in motivating us to push further and think harder about ways that frankly enforcement has gotten more lax. And that has had deleterious consequences for the economy.</p><p>      SAYYED:  Well, Tim, it looks like you want to -- yes.</p><p>      MURIS:  Sure. Let me address the Chicago point about the sacred texts. Bruce Kobayashi and I published a paper subtitled \"Time To Let Go of the 20th Century.\" And -</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  When did you publish it?</p><p>      MURIS:  2014. I think Bilal sent it to you. And what we said there -- essentially -- look, the way to think about Chicago is the way to think about the American revolutionaries. There was this revolutionary band of brothers. But what they were -- they were opposed to the old order. And the older order was overthrown.</p><p>      But once it came to running a government, they split like Adams and Jefferson. If you take a list and put this in the paper, Baxter, Bork, Boman, Posner and Stigler, they either hadn't thought of or they disagreed radically on how to approach antitrust policy, mergers for example. Those guys were all over the lot from the most aggressive, Posner to the most restrictive, Bork.</p><p>      And the point was they just hadn't thought about it. And when they did, they disagreed. And so, this idea, which is rife in this populist literature that there's this economic cult from the University of Chicago which dominates antitrust thinking is simply inaccurate.</p><p>      SAYYED:  Any other reaction or anybody would like to put questions?</p><p>      MCDAVID:  I agree with Tim. But I also agree, Jason, that this has to be evolutionary. We don't regard them as the tablets that came down with Moses. Economic theory has evolved. We had three iterations in the merger guidelines. And the ones we have in place now actually reflect how the agencies have been analyzing mergers for quite a long time. And they introduced new concepts such as unilateral effects analysis that weren't in the original versions.</p><p>      So we do evolve. But I am very concerned about the inability to discern the consistent thread that I found when I was a young lawyer, and I'm very worried about how clients are then going to have to handle this stuff.</p><p>      RILL:  Well, Jan, you've touched on merger guidelines. Let me ask a question that I have asked people to think about. And this is not been to reflect on a particular administration or not. But in 2010, the previous administration revised the horizontal merger guidelines and changed the whatever you want to call it, safety thresholds or presumption thresholds from HHI of 1800, post-merger HHI of 1800 being -- under some conditions presumed anti-competitive to level -- HHI level of 2400. </p><p>      And also, in fairness, I think Tim Muris and I wrote an article suggesting that some change was appropriate and we may have landed at around 2400. But let me put that out there. I mean to be able to think the -- the thresholds in the merger guidelines should be adjusted downward.</p><p>      MCDAVID:  Well, I deal with the guidelines all the time. And my view of the HHIs is that they are useful as an initial screen to identify the deals that need additional scrutiny. And then they show up in the complaint if the agency challenges the deal as part of the basis who either doing so, and in between we don't talk about them very much because we talk about competitive effects analysis. </p><p>      Where is the real competition that takes place? And having numbers attached to it and squaring market shares creates a sense of precision about this process that simply doesn't exist in reality or in the way the guidelines are applied. So I don't think it's necessary. I have clients who come to me and say, \"Well, as I run the HHIs, we've got an 1800.\" And then I discover that they've defined the market in a way that the agencies would never agree with. And therefore, the client has assumed something will be fine, when in fact, they're going to run into a real buzzsaw. </p><p>      MURIS:  Look, the guidelines do tell you something significant if you think -- forget the HHIs, think about -- I heard John Baker gave a good talk on this Friday after our retrospective analysis came out when I was chairman. Think about it in terms of the number of significant competitors.</p><p>      Bill Baxter, we argued with him when he put the guiidelines out in '82. Six to five was his marginal case and we wanted to make it five to four. But Bill, Bill was a structuralist, much more than modern people are and he thought that there wasn't very many competitors, six or five. Jim Rill essentially, when he put out his guidelines, made it much more of the focus that Jan was talking about.</p><p>      But when they did the guidelines in 2010, they were relying on data that said four to three was the marginal case. And in fact, John Kwoka, among others, had published papers out of the FTC's line of business data that showed the importance of the strong number three to ensuring competition. But it's the marginal case. There are lots of four to three's challenged and occasionally higher. </p><p>      But it does turn on a lot of factors. But the number of significant, if you want very simple tests, the number of significant competitors and how consumers react if they're significant business consumers, those -- answer to those two questions predicts a fair number of the results.</p><p>      MCDAVID:  And on the point of the number effective competitors, the FTC has done a number of reports, looking back at its data about the deals that challenged, the deals that it didn't challenge and what the factors were. And those papers which talk about how many competitors there were in deals of the challenged, whether there were customer complaints, whether there were bad documents, range of other things. Those are really useful guidance. And it's terrific work that the FTC has done. I wish the division would join in doing that kind of analysis.</p><p>      FURMAN:  I mean just briefly on the previous one, Tim, I thought you were much more modest about the Chicago school in this discussion than you were in your remarks. Your remarks actually claimed that they had accomplished quite a lot in terms of changing the way antitrust was. And I think that's right. That was -</p><p>      MURIS:  Well, they overthrew the old order. That was forty years ago.</p><p>      FURMAN:  Right. But anyway, I don't think we need to -- so I think sort of everyone treats them that way. I don't think one needs to re-litigate that. I think the question is do we need to make some changes. On the HHI, I would just do the average of whatever Fiona and John think it should be. But I think the argument for raising them also involved focusing and making sure you were refocusing and being vigorous above them in terms of a screen and everything else you're taking into account. </p><p>      So I think it's not just the number, but a whole bunch of other things. And some of that is also frankly dependent on the courts. When you're bringing hospital cases and you're still losing hospital cases even when you have, I think, unanimous commission voting for them, that means there's a set of thinking, some of which was shaped in the past and is -- that needs to probably be modernized and updated to deal with changing research, including issues like wages, which I think is an important one when thinking about hospitals.</p><p>      MURIS:  Well, the FTC is mostly winning, as the chairman said, mostly winning hospital mergers. And the problem was there was this silly belief in the Elzinga-Hogarty test. And we got Ken -- I went to Ken and Ken testified, he had very -- two very simple propositions. He said, \"I can't believe anybody would apply that test to hospitals.\"</p><p>      And second, \"I can't believe anybody would pay me to say anything so obvious.\" And those two -- those two propositions, believe it or not, helped carry the day in two circuit courts very recently blessed the FTC's opinion. But Jason, you're right in this sense, because these cases are decided out there by individual district court judges, the FTC actually had to overturn some of the district court judges in circuits. But I think the FTC's way of looking at it is correct. And it mostly wins. But obviously, in the world of individual judges, you could get some variance. </p><p>      SAYYED:  Let me ask -- I know Jim have some comments.</p><p>      RILL:  Just really quickly. I think what probably wasn't recognized very much in the change from the '82 guidelines to the '92 guidelines was a treatment of the structural paradigm. If you recall in the '82 guidelines that there's certain concentration levels of the guideline that provided there would be a likelihood of challenge.</p><p>      In the '92 guideline, we said, this is presumption that's carried on with further analysis and then went into then the other factors including entry and competitive nature of the marketplace, which I think that's the major change from the '82 to '92 guidelines. I think one of the interesting things about the 2010 guidelines, very creative and very interesting. was probably in order, is the distinction between the analytical framework and the guidelines and the analytic framework when the commission goes to court. </p><p>      The 2010 guidelines are very, I don't say critical but somewhat almost dismissively market definition issues, as a proxy for the -- base for the analysis. Shortly after those guidelines, we not only analyzed, the commission went to court. </p><p>      And if you look at its brief in the Polypore case, it doesn't appear that the 2010 guidelines existed. They were very much the traditional analysis, '82, '92 approach. So I think there is a distinction that one has to draw between what the agencies do in their analysis, which is obviously extremely important if you don't want to go to court, and the practice of the agency's -- put into their court pleadings, which are more traditional because I think the judges had become comfortable and accepting the analytical framework of the '82, '92 guideline approach. So I think there's a distinction there that we have to be aware of.</p><p>      MURIS:  Well, if I could -- I don't want to forget the other mission. Actually, the FTC is a bigger consumer protection agency in both dollars in people than it is antitrust. And if you ever go out as an official, and we've got some here and do an interview, unless there's a big antitrust case in the press, the questions are overwhelmingly going to be about consumer protection.</p><p>      I think David is 100 percent right about not -- strictly non-monetary protection. I as a young scholar wrote a couple of papers about how contract law protects subjective value. But I'm not at all sure you need to revise the unfairness guideline. I think another speech would be also because the FTC has protected that non-monetary, as David mentioned, the first -- the first security breach case that we've got and it was when I was chairman involved Eli Lilly where what happened was a non -- not just poorly trained, an employee who wasn't trained at all managed to send out a list to the world of -- I think it was 600 people who were taking Prozac. </p><p>      And email addresses are very easily identifiable. A lot of people have their names, certainly their last names. And obviously we thought that was -- that was private information that ought to be protected. And you could -- you could spin a case of monetary loss, but utility functions when I talked about those economists who trained me, Gary Becker was one of them and he was one of the first to put other things in utility functions. </p><p>      And the -- that's the way the FTC thinks and David's right that the commission ought to stress that. I think you can read that in the Unfairness Statement now but certainly statements to that effect would be useful. </p><p>      VLADECK:  Yes, and to Tim's credit, Tim and Howard published an article that's a classic, I think a classic in the Mark Twain sense that it's something that everybody talks about but no one's ever read. But in it -- but I didn't read it. And in it, Tim makes exactly that point which is that the Unfairness Statement ought to be construed to cover kind -- the kinds of behavior that we would think of as invasion of privacy toward. </p><p>      But in fact, oftentimes when a bureau director brings a case like that to the commission, there's real pushback. And not every commissioner unfortunately is quite as enlightened as Tim is on this matter. And so I think that going forward some clarity needs to be injected into the process, either through a revision of the Unfairness Statement or some declaration by the commission writ large that these kinds of harms are subsumed in the Unfairness Statement because there are some case that Tim actually raises questions about in that article, and the result was I think you said was sort of hard to reconcile. </p><p>      The order was hard to reconcile with the complaint language, cases like DesignerWare, Aaron's, and that's because there was friction within the commission. And so we need some resolution to this issue because increasingly, the harms that are caused through data breach, other forms of revelation of privacy information are not necessarily economic in nature and the Unfairness Statement should simply make that clear or the commission should make it clear in some other way. So I don't disagree. </p><p>      MURIS:  Well, I appreciate the fact that we had at least one reader and -- but I think maybe the solution is the next time the commission brings a case like that is just to issue a public statement that interprets the Unfairness Doctrine. </p><p>      MCDAVID:  Or perhaps in these hearings and the report...</p><p>      MURIS:  Sure. Another good suggestion. </p><p>      SAYYED:  Let me ask Alysa I think on this panel counsels clients most directly on these issues if she's got some thoughts on this area. </p><p>      HUTNIK:  Well, one of the things that we hear from clients a lot are, what's the law and what's the best practice. And in counseling clients we -- it's the interpretation of the cases and really focusing on those fundamental policy statements. And so where you have the statement on deception and statement on unfairness from 1980 and '83 which are very helpful and we continually go back to that. </p><p>      I think to David's point, modernizing them even with current examples rather than adding kind of the 75th, the 77th document that you need to put in an email to a client on what they need to address, I think with current types of challenges both in advertising and data practices and et cetera. </p><p>      SAYYED:  That leads right into a broader question and the commission takes -- I think takes seriously its obligation to provide clear guidance, business guidance on consumer education. So I wonder if folks up here think there are other areas where new or updated policy statements or materials are needed. It ties in as well to the idea of the self-regulatory model as well. Put that open maybe to David and Alysa initially but, of course, that is just as potentially true on the antitrust side of things.</p><p>      VLADECK:  Yes. Let me just make a quick comment, which is the agency spends enormous amount of time on guidance documents. When I was there, the endorsement guides came out, the Green Guides, 300 pages of narrative. These are really important documents. We understand why regulated parties need the kind of guidance that the agency can provide. But doing a good guidance document is an enormous undertaking. </p><p>      And there are areas where I think the guidance needs to be updated. And native advertising I think is an issue that the agency is going to have to continue to grapple with. The Green Guides left a lot of questions unanswered simply because there was no real consensus about what certain words mean like renewable. </p><p>      And so I think -- I think one core part of the agency's mission is providing the kind of guidance that Alysa's talking about, that her clients need. It is quite a formidable undertaking, but I do think it's part of the commission's core mission. </p><p>      HUTNIK:  Right. And I would just say that while the reports are well-read by private practitioners, it's the business guides that the clients use, the TSR business guidance the Green Guides, every one of those. I have some of those sections memorized as do some of my clients. </p><p>      And so I think taking concepts like the 2012 privacy report and taking the Unfairness statement and really bringing it up-to-date, that would be relevant for the clients, the innovative clients that are thinking of how to use machine learning and using AI, and using facial recognition and having it consolidated in some ways where the topics overlap so that they can use that and not feel like they are targeted with gotcha enforcement down the line when they are trying to interpret necessarily flexible standards and to do the right thing. </p><p>      VLADECK:  Well, and this goes back to the 6B question, which is in order to issue some of these guidance documents. For example, the use of biometrics in the marketplace. I think the commission might do well commission a study to get a sense of how widespread these practices are, where companies are going, what the immediate future looks like, because this is a topography that the commission needs to understand but I don't know whether it has the knowledge base today to issue a guidance document on these issues.</p><p>      MURIS:  You know, I think I completely agree about guidance and the best guidance the commission gives is in mergers. And an area that's badly in need of guidance on the consumer side is data security. And there's enough investigations and cases. There's over, I think, 50 cases and probably at least half that many serious investigations to do maybe not a merger guide, but at least a commentary on the -- which the agencies did in the, I don't know, 2006, '07 timeframe. </p><p>      Because -- and something that would be important would be to talk about as examples and that can -- parties can be disguised -- when the agency didn't act. That's really important information because the complaints have tended to be vaguer and vaguer over time. And data security guidance I think is badly needed.</p><p>      SAYYED:  Okay. Well, let me ask if there's any reaction to that. If not, I'd turn to another topic. Well, this is -- this ties in to a question we got from the audience. I'll raise it in two ways. And I think this -- first, there's a common critique that the U.S. has lost or is losing its leadership role on antitrust policy globally, that what we see developing outside the U.S. is a model predicated on the framework of the European Union or European countries. And that this is being adopted by some of the newer agencies and newer countries. </p><p>      I'd make the same point -- well, maybe slightly different as a question. What can we learn from the -- and is there a divergence between the U.S. and other agencies on the consumer protection side? So two-part question, right, why -- have we lost our leadership and why? And then what can we learn from other agencies both on the competition and consumer protection side? </p><p>      RILL:  Let me start out with the competition side because I don't think I've done much consumer protection work since we put Joe Camel out to stud. The -- there is a challenge here in the global framework of competition agencies. I mentioned in my earlier remarks the recent speech by Mario Monti in effect claiming that the European methods of antitrust, the European foundations for antitrust were far superior to those in the United States. </p><p>      The challenge has been there for a long time. I think there is a concern that there is a divergence of enforcement principles and due process principles, substantive as well as, procedure and substantive around the world. And one that's increasingly being affected. I think that the U.S. has not lost its attempt, its leadership in the sense of the work that's done within the ICN. Largely the U.S. pressure, for example, to put out -- the U.S. initiative that put out the guidance documents on due process for the agency effectiveness working group, U.S. leadership of the working party on (inaudible) cooperation in the OECD. </p><p>      This had a profound effect and produced a major report on due process, so I think that we're not running up the white flag any time soon. I think it is responsible -- it is a responsibility of the U.S. in two areas to preserve I think leadership not only for, it's not America first. America first sometimes could be America not there. I think it's America trying to present some of the principles that have underlined antitrust enforcement in our country and in our -- in our jurisprudential base to try and put those across.</p><p>      I think two areas where this can be done is continuing the guidance through the international organizations. And I think further attention should be given to the -- if you will, the moral suasion, the publicity effort that I think underlines initiatives such as Assistant Attorney General Delrahim's multilateral framework for antitrust procedure deserve attention. And I think the increasing use of bilateral agreements on competition policy, bilateral memoranda of understanding is a good way to go about it. </p><p>      And I think also that the agencies need to be perhaps attuned more as they have somewhat in the past to actually engage in consultation and advocacy if you will, in particular instances where the agency, foreign agency seems to be departing from a globally accepted principle, procedure, or substance, and in effect didn't engage in consultation as provided for in a number of instrumental -- instruments of cooperation. </p><p>      I think those are important. I think the final point that the agencies need to be concerned about, the United States need to be concern about is the problem sometimes of an agency action being misused by a foreign agency that say, \"Well, you're doing it so we can do it.\" There's a lot of copycat misuse of U.S. agency. We need to be -- the U.S. agencies need to be conscious of the risk of that copycat. Recent article by Koren Wong-Ervin, Josh Wright lists a number of areas where that's happened following up on some, actually some consents being used as an expression of law. Bosch, for example, Motorola Mobility -- GoogleMotorola Mobility by foreign agencies as well. The U.S. -- this is an expression of U.S. law. They misuse that and have that as a copycat for the misapplication of antitrust law. </p><p>      MURIS:  I want to take that and ask Jason a question. I know he's doing a lot of work on artificial intelligence and I assume big data is part of that. And, Jason, is what's going on overseas, is that important for the U.S. and what should the -- what should the FTC do about those issues? </p><p>      FURMAN:  I'll -- can tell you the answer in like six months, but for now, I mean I think a lot of the issues around big data, the -- I think the empirical question that I don't know the answer to is -- talking about before is, if you think there's diminishing returns to data, then you're a lot less worried about it than if you think there's some region of increasing returns. And there's -- you know, people do computer science and say with machine learning when you get past a certain point, you get to this place where you can do the AI in a certain way that you couldn't do before you got to that scale. </p><p>      If you have that, then I think you have -- do have to start to worrying about data becoming a barrier to entry, that there will be some large economies of scale in the machine learning AI space. And that you have to try to look at issues about who owns, for example, and something consumers may overlook and not fully understand and have those property right defined more properly. </p><p>      On the other side of argument, the -- in a world where you think it's intangible capital producing things rather tangible capital makes it easier to enter and anyone can come up very little computer algorithm and enter the market. So I think this -- in question of, is it just a really cheap -- the AlphaGo reinforcement learning, the latest iteration of it that DeepMind did isn't that long or complicated a program, doesn't actually use any data. It just plays itself and generates the data, anyone in this room could have done it although none of you did. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  No, we couldn't. </p><p>      FURMAN:  But -- and so if technology is like that, then I think we don't need to be that worried. Anyone in a garage can do it. If technology is this increasing returns to data, then I think we do need to be more worried and I -- I don't know which, so I apologize. </p><p>      SAYYED:  Thank you. I'll use that as a plug. We are doing two days on big data at American University's Washington College of Law in early November and two days on AI, artificial intelligence algorithms at Howard University's School of Law in the middle of November. So maybe you can come back, that would be great. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Let me just be clear. Algorithmic collusion is a whole different issue from the...</p><p>      SAYYED:  Yes. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  ... big data one and another. </p><p>      SAYYED:  Exactly. Although we are having some difficult separating out the people to do one or the other, but anyway. No, we're going to devote a lot of time to it. And that was a key -- one of the things the Pitofsky Report did was just sort of think about things that were going to come up over the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years and that's part of what we're doing on -- in that space. </p><p>      Let me -- Jason, because you have to leave, I hope this doesn't put you on the spot, but I wanted to raise it since you are doing some platform-related work since you mentioned you're doing some platform-related work. To go back to merger law and you may have less familiarity with the doctrine, but to get your thoughts on this. </p><p>      How should we think about acquisitions of new technologies by established players? Sometimes we use the term nascent competition or nascent competitors, but it's sort of -- it's something we're going to spend at least an afternoon on and maybe while you're here if you have some thoughts. </p><p>      FURMAN:  Yes, no, absolutely. And you're creating a real incentive to leave panels early. I think (inaudible) It's working out really well for me. I think that's a really important issue. I think there's a sort of longstanding view that everything in technology is evolving so quickly that there's no point enforcing anything, because by the time you do, it's changed and there's some new competitor. And MySpace has disappeared or Internet Explorer has been dethroned or whatever else. </p><p>      I think there's something to that. I think there's a lot of irreversibility, too, though. It's easier to stop an acquisition now and change your mind five years from now and allow it than it is to take a company that's already acquired and split it up. The second is basically impossible. The first, the cost of making an error in not allowing the acquisition may not be that high if you can change it later. </p><p>      So there's a little bit under uncertainty, of literature and economics, there's an option value of waiting when you're making irreversible decisions and allowing a merger is one. I think you have to figure out how to think not just about market share but about the ecosystem as a whole, and if you are buying up something that could be a competitor later, then I think you're affecting the ecosystem and something that, prices, especially if there are no headline prices isn't a useful guide to market share, isn't a useful guide to -- but it's competition for creating a type of market and ecosystem. So I think that does require a new thinking and probably under that option value of waiting the uncertainty is an argument for more, not for less in those cases. </p><p>      SAYYED:  Okay. Let me ask if anyone has a reaction to that. We're going to have a whole afternoon of reaction to that. Okay. Okay. Well, not to kick Jason off, but I want to thank Jason for coming. </p><p>      MCDAVID:  Thank you, Jason.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE) </p><p>      SAYYED:  He made a special effort to be here. So let me -- we -- unless members on the panel want to ask each other some questions. We have a number of questions from the audience and I don't want to be too selective because we did ask for questions, but I would like to get to them, so if people are ready, we'll do it. And Jason did leave in just the right time. </p><p>      But maybe others could think about this either narrowly or more broadly. How -- and here's the question, how do we analyze -- how do we analyze the harm to small businesses who rely on large platforms to reach new customers in ways they never could before? So that may touch on two specific topics. </p><p>      MURIS:  Yes, that sounds like a benefit, not a harm, if they're using these platforms to reach people that they never did before. Look, obviously there are a whole set of rules, disclosures, consumer protection rules. It's important that the -- just from a simple contract law standpoint that the contracts not be devised unilaterally as they sometimes can be, which is an obvious problem under contract law.</p><p>      One of the things I'm surprised with is the number of times people bring me antitrust issues that are really contract law issues. I used to teach contract law. I don't think in the big picture sense that the platform -- so-called platform issues need to be analyzed any differently. The toolkit we have is perfectly adequate and it goes back decades when the -- you know, when the new industries were evolving. We're talking about going back to the 1990s. </p><p>      SAYYED:  I took a little bit of this question. We focused on the use of antitrust to protect small businesses and I wonder if other folks have additional comment on that question. Is that a proper role for antitrust or is it just too hard for us to measure that particular factor in our analysis? </p><p>      MCDAVID:  I share Tim's criticisms of the Robinson-Patman Act. I try to give those questions when they come up to someone else in the office. Or I tell my clients that whatever the right answer is, the Robinson-Patman answer is the other side of it. </p><p>      VLADECK:  Let me just add one thing. You know, dealing with platforms is an issue that rises both -- on both sides of the building. For example, I mean, one of the ironies in the Google investigation were the companies that were complaining about anti-competitive conduct were the very companies that wouldn't have exist but for Google. And that interaction becomes very challenging. </p><p>      Also some of the platforms raise serious consumer protection issues because they are essentially bazaars selling multiple products on the same page. And so questions about deception, who's responsible for the deception arise with some frequency. So I think one un-sort of-met challenge on both sides of the building is what do we do about platforms? I mean, we do have -- there are certain immunities for baseline content, but that doesn't really resolve some of the consumer protection problems and some of the antitrust issues that arose, for example, in the Google investigation. </p><p>      HUTNIK:  I would just add. On the consumer protection side, we're talking about platforms and responsibilities and, David, I hear you earlier in terms of talking about the limited resources for enforcement, some of the things that we've seen is deputizing platforms to be responsible for those that they let into the bazaar, and that may be all well and good but there's a lot of interpretation and a lack of guidance on what is reason oversight and monitoring, what's scalable, and not doing a gotcha on that. </p><p>      VLADECK:  And they're all fair questions. </p><p>      HUTNIK:  So if we go towards that point, what I would strongly encourage thoughtfulness is what are the standards to avoid third party monitoring whether it's a safe harbor, whether it's other types of incentivizing, but clarity on those points. </p><p>      SAYYED:  Let me -- okay. Any other comments on that? Let me turn to a question that is -- I think I'll direct it to everybody. It's a similar question. So the question says that former Chairman Muris mentioned imperfect information in contrast to behavioral economics. But in standard economic models, imperfect information causes transactions not to happen. It does not cause buyers to be fooled. </p><p>      So here -- I think here's the question. Aren't buyers sometimes simply fooled and should they protected for being fooled? Or from being fooled? I think that's both a consumer protection and in some ways a competition question but I'll turn it over to David first. </p><p>      VLADECK:  The answer is yes. The commission has struggled with what is a reasonable consumer and what percentage of consumers must be deceived by a message, but the mission of the commission is to prevent deception in the marketplace and Tim and I may disagree at the margins about this but I agree with Tim's fundamental point, that the core mission of the agency is to protect against fraud. And the statute doesn't really use the word fraud, it uses deception. </p><p>      And I -- that's -- in my view, that's always been the core mission of the agency. The first cases the agency brought consumer deception cases. They were the sale of silk which was really cotton and it was sold C-I-L-K. And those were literally the first enforcement cases the commission brought. So, historically that's been at the center of the agency's mission. </p><p>      HUTNIK:  I would also just add to that. We have to reconcile with the reasonable consumer and the gullible consumer standard, and one of the other parts of the FTC's mission is consumer education, and particularly as we go through the emerging marketplaces and people are learning even about those marketplaces, consumer education plays a key role on that, so that we don't dilute the reasonable person standard.</p><p>      MURIS:  I agree with both of those points and let me take the economic modeling part of that. It almost 60 years since Ronald Coase's famous article and the applications of that are all about transactions costs. And shortly thereafter, George Stigler won his Nobel Prize in significant part for discussing that advertising was an extremely powerful tool for the elimination of ignorance. Well, obviously there's -- if there's ignorance, we're talking about a world with transaction costs and that's the world in which you need an FTC enforcement, as I was talking about. </p><p>      And so the whole -- this straw man that you -- in the popular press, that economists talk about these automatons who only react, consumers with perfect knowledge who only react to price. That just hasn't been proven in any sensible economic application to what the FTC does for decades. </p><p>      SAYYED:  Okay. Well, thank you. Let me follow up on a point David made as well about a bureau of technology in the FTC. I'm going to depart a little bit from the question, but ask, first of all, to the other panelists think about that, is it something that's relevant on both the antitrust side of house as well as the consumer protection side of the house? </p><p>      And what might it look like and I raise that, maybe it's a little unfair because I didn't raise it earlier but we have, David was a bureau director, Tim as well as being chairman was a bureau director. How do you set up these things for success, really? That's maybe my question. </p><p>      VLADECK:  I defer to someone who's the chair -- the chairman. I think that would be the chairman's mission, not -- I mean I think it would be important to retain some of the technology infrastructure in the bureaus. I mean much of what the Bureau of Consumer Protection uses technologists for are forensics for investigations, but there are a lot of, there's a lot of value to having access to skill technicians for the policy issues that the agency is going to have to confront moving forward. Biometric identification, things like that. These are difficult technical questions.</p><p>      MURIS:  Look, the bureaus are complementary. They're not substitutes. As the only person ever to head both of them, they are significantly different. They're different in their personalities, they're different in the career paths. And they are, in many ways, autonomous, and it's important -- let me give you an anecdote. I wanted the Bureau of Consumer Protection to do more in working with criminal authorities. And I unfortunately insulted them and told them that they were being -- they were too self-satisfied. Those were not the words I used. </p><p>      And I regrouped and after about a year, they decided it was their idea. And they now have a very successful criminal liaison unit which, of course, they take complete -- a hundred percent credit for which is fine with me. And it was a mistake on my part to criticize them in the first place, but it's a wonderful organization. It reminds me of working in OMB in the old days where you have people who -- it's their career. And it's not as transitory as the Bureau of Competition, but embedding in the bureau like David says would be a very sensible way to go. Anybody else? </p><p>      Anybody else? Okay. I will answer one of the questions. There is a reference in the question to the Office of Technology Research and Investigation, what we call OTEC which does sit in BCP. Question is, why this is unit insufficient to get the job done now? Without commenting too much on whether it's insufficient or what job they are focused on, we are -- it is a very small group and more resources would probably be appreciated by the chair, by the commissioners, and even by the bureau directors. </p><p>      So maybe I'll end with a question that maybe I have, and it's a real question given the difficulty of managing agencies, do you think the FTC should have more resources to do its mission, and maybe how would you, if you were to allocate those resource, how would allocate them? So I have no particular -- I'd like the private perspective as well as the, the folks who have not been at the agency as well as folks who have been at the agency to maybe give some thought to it. </p><p>      RILL:  I think a question like that to be addressed by is like asking the Protestant minister what he thought about the latest papal encyclical. But when I was at the division, one of our major efforts was to enhance the workforce at the division, both from the standpoint of law and economics. And it was shorthanded when I got there and we were able to build it up and I think increase the efficacy of the agency with more resources. </p><p>      It is difficult to get those kinds of resources with all the other budgetary demands and we ran into a number of problems. Partly solved by the filing fee issue, but I think the agencies do need, but certainly the division needed more resources at that time sensibly used and sensibly coordinated. The commission I leave to the people who've worked there. </p><p>      MURIS:  Well, I have a long-running view about this and when -- in '81 when we came in, we were asked to reduce resources. The way to think about it is FTE, we put the agency on a path from 1800 to 1200. And that's where it was when we -- in the mid 1980s. </p><p>      When I came back in 2001, I asked for a comparison with the mid 1980s and Bob had had about a thousand and it turned out, in professionals, a thousand and 1200 were about the same, very small difference. And what had happened, there was a lot of outsourcing and a lot of productivity improvements. Technology had had a significant effect. I think the agency is up to 1150, something like that.</p><p>      RILL:  That's right. </p><p>      MURIS:  And I don't know how that compares with 2001. I suspect there have been some more productivity improvements, probably not as dramatic as in the 1990s. But Bob did a hell of a job with a thousand. I think we're headed for another retrenchment era, so I think it's probably wishful thinking to ask for significantly more resources, and besides the people, there's -- BCP, for example, has a significant infrastructure burden that we managed to satisfy with the money from Do Not Call which we used for building up the infrastructure for Do Not Call, which was very helpful for the rest of the agency. </p><p>      But I think at the present, the present rate strikes me as significantly more, we ended up about 1260, about 1060. And I thought we did a lot. I thought Bob did a lot, so I'm not -- I don't think more resources are in the cards and I think they're doing a lot with what they've got.</p><p>      HUTNIK:  This is not from an internal perspective but I think it's all about the priorities, right, where do you want to focus the resources that you have. And some of the themes from today were -- we have division of enforcement and we need more manpower in terms of business guidance and I think to not get distracted by calls for regulation which would take a whole bunch of people off of doing some of those things now. That may not be as productive. </p><p>      MCDAVID:  Speaking only on the competition side, the lawyers and economists with whom I work regularly at the commission are incredibly dedicated and hardworking. The general populace has a view of government employees that is deprecating, and it's not fair. They do yeoman's work. They work weekends, they work nights. And a lot of the competition mission is consumed with things they can't predict. What's the merger wave going to be? All of which are time-sensitive. So they have to at least retain the kinds of resources they've got because you'll burn them out. </p><p>      VLADECK:  Yes, I would argue for more resources. I understand Tim's argument and I realize this is probably swimming against the tide, but since the 2001 or 1981, Congress has added considerable workload to the agency, and changes in the marketplace have required the agency to do more work. The Bureau of Consumer Protection at its height when I was there and I don't think we've added any resources to it had fewer than 450 people, including most of the people in the regions. </p><p>      People work extremely hard. They're incredibly dedicated, but there are lots of people with fingers in the dikes and the water is just coming over the transom. So I would urge the commission to think about asking for an increase in resources. And I think -- of course, most of it should go to BCP, but I think the agency could well use a couple hundred more FTEs. </p><p>      SAYYED:  Okay. Well, I think we'll conclude right there. We were on -- targeted for 11:45 and I think this is where we are. Before we conclude, I'd like to thank a bunch of people. First, I thank the panelists including Jason who had to leave very much for devoting some time and effort to this. I'd like to thank my colleagues in the Office of Policy Planning who have been working very hard on what will probably be about 20 days of sessions, and this is only five percent of the way through once we're done today. They're just a wonderful crew to work with and I'm very proud to work with them. And I think have the best job at the commission. </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      And finally, thank also the staff of the executive director for helping put this thing together, and you'll see more of it this afternoon, but I won't be on stage, I wanted to put that out there. And then thank everybody for showing up and paying attention. We'll be back here at 1:30, so if you come here slightly before, that'd be great. There's a cafeteria across the courtyard if people want to eat law school food. </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      But it's good. It's better than I remember. So hope to see you back here slightly before 1:30.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      (RECESS)</p><p>      SAYYED:  Start it in a -- in a minute or so. Let people coming in if they're trying to hit the 1:30 mark. </p><p>      Okay. I'm just going to say welcome back, and remind people in the audience or new people that two of my colleagues, maybe more, are collecting questions that you may write on the question card, and they'll be brought up to the panel the end of the panel for some audience Q and A. </p><p>      So, with that, I'm going to turn this over to Greg Werden from the Antitrust Division, and he's going to discuss with the panel whether the U.S. economy has become more concentrated and less competitive. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Thank you. I'm not a fan of introductions, so I will not introduce our speakers, they can introduce themselves if they want to spend their time that way, that they have total control over their time. The way we're going to organize this is Jon is going to give a long slide presentation and then each of our other panelists will give much shorter presentations, and they will go to a series of questions that I pose, and then finally questions from the audience. So, Jon. </p><p>      BAKER:  Thank you. Thank you, Greg. And nice to see all my co-panelists, and thank you Bilal, and the FTC for inviting me, I was involved in the hearings in 1980 -- '95, and I'm delighted to be back for the -- for these today. </p><p>      So, the FTC hearings two decades ago that I just referred to, were spurred by two challenges for antitrust policy. Markets were becoming increasingly global and innovation competition was becoming increasingly important. And today, we have an additional challenge for antitrust policy, the economic evidence has been accumulating since the 1995 hearings and much of it for the past five years or so, that shows that market power has been growing for decades. And I think of what we're seeing as today's antitrust paradox, a conjunction of substantial and widening market power with well-established and extensive antitrust institutions. </p><p>      Oh, what's with that one? All right. So, in my presentation I'll sketch the evidence that market power has been growing over the past quarter century and has become substantial in the United States. And I'm going to go through nine reasons, none of them is individually decisive, there are ways to question or push back on each, but their weaknesses are all, are different. </p><p>      And so if -- so when you take them collectively, they paint a compelling picture of growing market power. And I'm also going to explain why the recent economic trends I point to reflect growing market power, not solely increased scale economies and temporary rents to early adopters of new technologies in competitive markets. </p><p>      And to fit my presentation into the allotted time, I will say less about most of the reasons than will appear on the slides. And the very last slide will reference my forthcoming book, the first chapter of which goes into more detail on this topic including full cites for the research that's referenced on the slides. And it will also mention criticisms of the research that I don't have time to bring up in my presentation, although I'd be happy to talk about them during our discussion with, later. </p><p>      Before I get into the nine reasons, I want to make clear what I mean when I use the term market power. Firms exercise market power in their output markets as sellers by raising prices or by altering other terms of trade adversely to buyers relative to what would prevail in a competitive market. Market power is not just about prices, it can be exercised on other competitive dimensions, too. And market power can also be exercised in input markets, exercised by buyers, and that's defined analogously. </p><p>      The first of the nine reasons to think that market power has been growing is that we insufficiently deter anticompetitive coordinated conduct. The Justice Department keeps on covering cartels year after year. They seem to form at the same rate that we catch them. And that suggest under-deterrence because the penalties are probably too low to deter collusion, and there's no reason to think that the threat of penalties chills pro-competitive conduct or leads to excessive compliance expenditures. And under-deterred express cartels are probably the tip of an iceberg, because tacit collusion is probably even harder to deter. </p><p>      We also insufficiently deter anticompetitive mergers and there's several empirical studies that support this conclusion. Now, what happened here? Did I hit a wrong button? All right. I need a tech guy -- there we go. Okay. The third reason is insufficient deterrence of anticompetitive exclusion. Since the late 1970s, the courts have targeted rules governing exclusionary conduct for extensive relaxation, and in some cases the new rules conferred de facto legality on such conduct. </p><p>      The empirical evidence that exclusion is under-deterred is about the competitive effects of vertical practices. Now, vertical conduct an exclusionary conduct are not the same thing, but there are correlated, and the evidence shows that vertical restraints often support collusion and there are a number of examples of competitive harm from vertical restraints and vertical integration. </p><p>      That interpretation -- oops, let me go back here. Yes. That interpretation of the literature on vertical conduct may surprise some of you. So, I want to make an important methodological point. Most empirical studies about the effects of vertical restraints are looking in the wrong place to learn about whether stronger antitrust enforcement would be beneficial. </p><p>      If you want to know whether oligopolists can use vertical restraints to harm competition, you won't learn much by looking at markets with competitive structures or in markets where the firms could be deterred but from anticompetitive conduct with a threat of antitrust enforcement. Looking in those kind of markets lets you learn about potential pro-competitive consequences, and about ways that firms can craft their vertical arrangements to limit the inefficiencies and costs that they may impose. </p><p>      Now, you might see some instances in which vertical restraints harm competition, but the markets aren't randomly selected, you'd expect in general the studies would not often find harm to competition, even if the conduct could be harmful in other settings that are not being studied, where one might want to think about antitrust enforcement. </p><p>      And you're not going to learn much about whether relaxing antitrust constraints has or would lead to greater competitive harm. If you want to identify the effects of antitrust enforcement in the econometric sense, you have to compare outcomes with and without antitrust constraints, and the -- there's a McKay Smith study that's in the small print on the slide of -- about resale price maintenance, and that's a rare example of a study of a vertical restraints that addresses this identification problem. And it finds it on the whole, competition was harmed when the antitrust constraints on resale price maintenance were relaxed. </p><p>      Fourth, market power is durable, markets are not invariably self-correcting, cartels and monopolies often last a long time. The eight-year lower bound on the length of the average cartel compares favorably with the time it takes to create -- to correct rather, erroneous judicial precedents, even Supreme Court decisions through later court decisions that overrule them or narrow them procedurally, or substantively, or through lower court decisions that distinguish or limit them, or through legislative abrogation. </p><p>      Our fifth, the increased equity ownership of rival firms by diversified financial investors is another reason to worry about growing market power. Rival airlines, or banks, or pharmacy chains, or other competing firms increasingly have overlapping ownership by financial firms like Blackrock, State Street, Fidelity, and Vanguard. The initial studies have found that common ownership leads to higher prices, and this is an active research area where we're likely to learn more soon. </p><p>      Sixth, increased governmental restraints on competition. Over the past few decades, the U.S. has broadened patent scope substantially, and granted too many patents after inadequate review. This trend may have halted, but it's not really been reversed. And other examples of governmental restraints that may be on the rise include occupational licensing and lobbying to limit rivalry. </p><p>      All right. The seventh is the rise of dominant information technology platforms. Now, the empirical evidence suggests that price cost margins have been growing economy-wide since 1990 in the United States. And the trend seems clear, although the magnitude of the margin increases has not been measured precisely. </p><p>      Growing price cost margins are probably tied to investments in information technology. Dominant information technology and internet platforms aren't the only firms making those kind of investments, or likely exercising some market power as a result. But the platforms are an important part of the story, because they're likely insulated from competition in some of their major markets. </p><p>      All right. So, eighth. Oligopolies are common and concentrations increasing in many industries. The best evidence that increasing concentration allows firms to exercise more market power comes from studies of particular industries like airlines, brewing, and hospitals. The economy-wide evidence on concentration suggests only modest increases in concentration and in many -- and many industries with rising concentration remain unconcentrated. </p><p>      But the economy-wide evidence is less reliable than the industry specific studies and that's because the economy wide studies often use broad product markets when it would be better to look for competitive problems in more narrow markets. And they often use national markets when it would be better to look at regional or local markets. </p><p>      Now, some of the evidence involving broad national aggregates is consistent with rising overall concentration, but could instead reflect increased multi-market contact. But that could equally raise competitive concerns about coordination. And there are recent studies that also find concentration is high and possibly growing in many labor markets, potentially making it more possible for businesses to exercise monopsony power to depress wages. </p><p>      The final reason to think that market power has been increasing is a decline in economic dynamism. And Jason Furman highlighted this reason this morning. Growing market power is a leading explanation or a plausible contributing explanation for a range of economic trends. A secular slowdown in business investment, rising profits as a share of U.S. GDP, a slowed rate at which firms expand when they become more productive, a declining rate of startups, a shift in growth and productivity gains from entrants to incumbents, and a growing gap in accounting profitability between the most and the least profitable firms. </p><p>      So I've interpreted the evidence in these nine categories that I highlighted as indicating growing market power. And I want to explain now I think that's a better interpretation of the most plausible alternative, namely increased scale economies and temporary returns to the first firms to adopt new information technologies in competitive markets. </p><p>      Now the benign alternative has an initial plausibility, because the efficient size of firms has likely grown over time in many industries, as a result of the high fixed costs of investments in information technology, network effects, and an increased scope of geographic markets. That means that firms could grow larger, and concentration could rise, and price cost margins could increase even if markets are competitive. And in addition, the first firms to invest in new information technologies might earn substantial rents which should be temporary if those investments don't confer market power and their rivals follow suit with investments of their own. </p><p>      But the first six reasons I gave for thinking market power is substantial and widening in the U.S. cannot be reconciled with the benign alternative, anticompetitive coordination, mergers, and exclusion are under-deterred, market power is durable, and increased equity ownership of rivals by financial investors of the -- well, can soften competition, and governmental restraints on competition have grown. </p><p>      Also, market power is a better interpretation in the benign alternative for the other three reasons. The growth of dominant platforms probably does owe a lot to scale economies and first mover advantages. But those platforms may still have the ability to exercise market power by excluding rivals. Scale economies and rents to early adopters of new technologies probably did contribute to rising concentration in various industries. </p><p>      But there's often independent evidence that the firms in those concentrated markets exercise market power, which is not surprising because the same fixed expenditures that make scale economies and rents to movers possible can deter entry and soften competition. </p><p>      Now, some of the evidence for the loss of economic dynamism could be consistent with the benign alternative of growing scale economies and returns to early adoption of new technologies in competitive markets, as well as consistent with increasing market power. And that might include the rising profit share of GDP and the growing gap in accounting profitability between the most in the least profitable firms. </p><p>      But other aspects of declining dynamism cannot be reconciled with the benign alternative. The benign interpretation assumes that profits rise because markets are increasingly dynamic, with higher rates of entry, investment, and business failure. In competitive markets, growing scale economies yield higher profits because entrants have a greater risk of failure when fewer firms can succeed. </p><p>      Early adopters of new technologies would earn profits, but they'd be temporary, competed away by new or expanding rivals making their own investments. But the benign interpretation is inconsistent with the evidence showing the reverse, a slowing rate of new entry, a declining rate of expansion when firms and plants grow more productive, and a secular slowdown in business investment. </p><p>      And in addition, the financial markets appear to view corporate profit streams is less risky than in the past, and yet if markets are increasingly dynamic as the benign alternative supposes, those streams would be viewed as riskier. The bottom line is that growing market power is a better explanation for declining dynamism, and for all nine reasons taken as a whole, than the alternative of increasing scale economies and early adopter rents in competitive markets. The benign alternative might -- may well be a partial explanation, but increasing market power is likely an important part of the story too.</p><p>      Now, I don't need to spend much time with this audience explaining what's wrong with market power. The harms within markets are described on the slide from a partial equilibrium perspective within an industry, within a market, the harms that they can arise regardless of whether market power is exercised by sellers or buyers. </p><p>      Market power can also harm the economy as a whole by slowing economic growth and increasing inequality. And the adverse economic consequences of the exercise of market power could be reinforced if firms and industries can use their market power to secure political power, and use their political power to protect or extend their economic advantages. </p><p>      So, just to summarize, the evidence I presented shows that market power has been growing in the U.S. economy for decades. From an error cost point of view, we've learned that we are deterring anticompetitive conduct less than we thought we were in 1995 when the FTC last held hearings. And that means we should take steps now to strengthen our antitrust rules, institutions and enforcement. And, Greg, I think I'm going to reserve my remainder of time for rebuttal. </p><p>      WERDEN:  I'm sorry. You have to check in with the clerk before you start talking. If you've ever argued the Court of Appeals, that's the rule. </p><p>      BERRY:  Oh, okay, good. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Steve? </p><p>      BERRY:  Okay, good. So we got new slides here. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Yes.</p><p>      BERRY:  Good. Okay. I want to give a talk that -- only about six minutes that I think is complementary to what Jonathan is talking about. And I want to talk about what kind of evidence we should weigh more or less as we're looking at this debate. And in particular, I think that Jonathan's mix of evidence was quite different than the evidence you often see in presentations in the -- in the press, by macroeconomists, and by other non-specialists. And I wanted to indicate what some of those distinctions are so that we can think about what evidence is the most convincing, and also what kind of things we'd like to look forward to in the future. </p><p>      So, I'm going to divide things a little bit starkly into good and bad. And to talk about the relative bad, I want to go all the way back to the year 1989. And in the year 1989, there were two I think magisterial chapters that were published in the handbook of IO. One by Dick Schmalensee and one by Tim Bresnahan and Dick Schmalensee was a participant in and a sympathetic observer of decades worth of work that did something like what people are doing today, which is try to look at the correlation of various outcomes like prices and markups with measures of concentration like the Herfindahl Index. </p><p>      And his chapter laid out a whole host of problems with that, but I want to emphasize particularly one. The Herfindahl Index in particular is probably better thought of as the cause of market competition, an interesting summary statistic of what is going on rather than as an effect that causes outcomes. The Herfindahl Index itself is a function of market shares, which one function of outputs which are codetermined simultaneously with price. </p><p>      The most famous example that people used in those days is that differences in firm heterogeneity where, cost heterogeneity where you had some firms with very low prices, that those low marginal cost would feed into their market shares, their market shares feed into the Herfindahl Index, but their low marginal costs also flow into markups, and you see a positive correlation between markups and concentration that has to do with efficiency rather than with competition. That's the problem of simultaneity, the problem that in this case, correlation is not causation, and we should be very skeptical I think of these studies that in some ways naively regress an outcome on a Herfindahl Index. </p><p>      Now, some people in this literature I think are actually quite aware of this, and they think of this is a problem with the Herfindahl Index itself, is correlated with other things, is endogenous, they look for purely statistical ways of dealing with that endogeneity, they look for what's called an instrumental variable or just a more plausible exogenous variation in market structure. </p><p>      And that brings me to the second of those great handbook chapters written by Tim Bresnahan, and what he pointed out is that even if we grant that you have discovered the true causal effect say of the number of firms on price, you haven't established anything about the role of markups, either on the output side or on the input side. </p><p>      And let me just give you one example of that. I teach freshman micro, and on the third day, we teach them that supply slopes up, and there are a bunch of shifters, among them are the number of firms that shift supply back and forth, and that's because of the upward sloping marginal cost curves of the individual firms. </p><p>      Demand slopes down, as you move the number of firms to the supply curve, moves against that demand curve, and it shows that as the number of firms goes up supply shifts out, prices fall. In the perfectly competitive output market, decrease in concentration drops prices. But there are no markups, you haven't found evidence of markups, you may have found evidence of increasing marginal cost. </p><p>      The same thing happens on the input side, it is an implication of the perfectly competitive model of wage determination that an increase in the number of firms will drive wages up. That's not evidence of monopsony power. What Bresnahan said is that we actually have to separately consider demand and cost and competition. And we can't do that and one equation or one correlation. </p><p>      I think that kind of evidence with -- by the way did not feature greatly in conference discussion, should be downweighted a lot, right? We thought it died with the publication of these two chapters 25 years ago, and some of us woke up and were a little startled to see it suddenly outside of our window looking in, and that's trouble. </p><p>      I want to talk for just two minutes about possible alternatives. One is just to look at, directly the facts of policy that have changed, and what effect did they have, we can learn about policy that way. Let me skip a couple slides though. Another thing though is to back away for one minute, to back away form -- for one minute from causation, and just think about measurement, what has happened to markups, and we heard about these papers just a minute ago. I think they do show that regardless of cause, our best evidence is that markup are going up. It's sensitive to measurement like whether you include certain intangible and fixed costs in that or not. </p><p>      But that kind of simple descriptive cross-industry measurement is very valuable for telling us what has happened, but not why, not why. So, I think ultimately, we're going to have to do what Jonathan suggested, we're going to have to do studies of individual important industries and ask what is going on. So, here's an example a graduate student of mine did as a -- as a part of his thesis. He looked up the wholesale sector, that's pretty important, that's a pretty important sector, right? And what does he find? Concentration is up, aha, concentration is up. </p><p>      On the other hand, output is up, that doesn't sound like monopolization, does it? Output is up. The product itself has changed, multi-warehouse wholesalers are locating closer to their customers, they're investing in IT for logistics, they're dual sourcing goods, you can shop between China and the United States with one stop at a wholesaler. The nature of the good is changing. And when you put this to a Bresnahan-like series of models, you'll see that markups are going up in the industry just like in the cross industry analysis, but for a mix of all of the reasons that Jonathan mentioned, not for one or the other, but for all of them. </p><p>      Product quality is going up, that's pushing prices up that pushes margins up. The marginal cost is going down as firms get better logistics and locate closer to their customers, marginal cost is falling, that's efficiency, but markups go up, competition is really going down. And that also contributes to the markup effect. </p><p>      Why don't we see the entry that Jonathan talked about? Implicitly there must be fixed costs or some costs that are preventing new entrants from somehow competing away these profits. It's costly to build all of those plants near your rivals and that's a sunk cost, and it's very hard for that to be competed away. </p><p>      This is a complicated story. And what I want to finish with is a substantive hypothesis. What if this is true in broader sections of the economy, what if it's happening in broader sections, not just wholesale, maybe IT, maybe other parts of retail, maybe broad sectors of the economy, that firms for endogenous reasons or changing their production methods and their -- and the quality of their products so that marginal cost is falling and fixed cost is rising. Markups are going up, concentration is going up. </p><p>      If that's happening in a broad scale way, it doesn't seem just that big is bad, but we're way, also, we're way far from the theory of perfect competition as well. We're in this very complex setting where there's some good and bad things happening, like Jonathan, it's not just economies of scale, there are other things too, there are competitive effects as well. We can't just wave our hands and say it's all fine. </p><p>      I also don't think we can just simply say, big is bad. And I think it's these better kinds of evidence, these descriptive studies at the broad level and causal studies that are within industry level that we ought to emphasize, and I think are the ones that are going to eventually tell us what the correct policy path forward is, and these guys are better policy experts than I am, so I'm mostly going to listen for the rest of time. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Thanks very much, Steve. </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      WERDEN:  Good job. I'm not sure who's going next, but why don't -- why don't you do it? </p><p>      WRIGHT:  Okay. There are a few of my students in the audience who are laughing at the idea that I'm going to do anything in six minutes. But let's give it a shot nonetheless. I think sort of extending the discussion from Jon and Steve to move on, probably start in the same place as Steve which is I went to grad school in economics and studied in IO in the early 2000s and those handbook chapters were sort of taken as the starting point for learning empirical IO, we didn't read studies that attempted to infer causations and changes to HHI on the effect on price, we read Steve's stuff. </p><p>      I think the fundamental challenge in this area, and then I'll dive into the data is that while it is probably true that zombie IO economics has died in economics departments a long time ago, I think the fundamental challenge in part is making sure we don't get antitrust policy that adopts zombie IO, and I think that's a challenge for the agencies, I think it's a challenge for IO economists. because the punch line for some of this is going to be on the real questions that matter for designing policy, my interpretation of the evidence is that we know -- we know a lot less, and probably need to know a lot more before we start playing much with policies, I'll spend the rest of my time talking about that. </p><p>      For starters, I think it's important to separate, we're going to talk about testable hypotheses, and testing with empirical data, I think it's really important for these discussions, Especially, if we're going to attach any policy relevance to them, to separate claims. One of the claims around is that we've got a rise in concentration at the aggregate sort of of non-market level, sort of really aggregated industry sectors, stuff made with metal, not necessarily just capturing firms that are competing against each other. </p><p>      There's a second -- a second set of claims that try to do relationship between what's happening in markets, changes in concentration in markets, and relate those to a price or output or markets, so are we getting more or less competition. </p><p>      And I think there's a third set of claims that is, is any of this caused by lax antitrust enforcement. I spend most of my time talking about why it is so important for discussion of antitrust policy that we focus on markets, and not sort of broad, aggregated sectors, that doesn't mean that the sector-based research isn't incredibly useful. It is, we learned things like at a rough level what's happening to markups over time, that is interesting as a descriptive matter. </p><p>      We don't, and often these studies are used to sort of glom on causation and make claims about whether antitrust is doing too much or too little. The reason that we care fundamentally about markets and not sectors in antitrust is because the fundamental lesson of those IO handbook chapters, and I think most of modern IO in this area is that competition and concentration are different things. </p><p>      Concentration can be caused by more competition. It can be caused by less competition. I think Steve had this as the Chicago critique on his slides, I'm at UCLA guy, I'm going to call it the Demsetz critique, or else I'll lose my Bruin lunch card. So, but the fundamental idea that we grapple with and what makes antitrust hard is that changes in concentration can be the outcome of more or less competition, that makes identification difficult. It makes broad claims about whether we have too much, or too little, or sort of goldilocks just right levels of concentration really difficult to do, and probably outside the scope of the ability of modern IO. </p><p>      And that really was the lesson of sort of the big empirical revolution of IO in the 1970's and 1980's. So, punch line for me is I think a lot of the evidence that we see are attempts to do some of these broad industry sector stuff, where we do exactly what we learned not to do in the 1970s. We regress markups or price, or profit on really broad, aggregated industry data. And then the policy world sort of jumps on and make causal claims, and sort of we're off and running, and I think that's a dangerous place to be in. </p><p>      There are attempts to do better work, there are attempts to do sort of more sophisticated merger retrospectives and tradeoff, the broad general insights, we're learning about one case, and maybe I think in discussion, we'll talk a little bit more about that. But my read of the evidence is at the aggregated sort of relationship between aggregated concentration and competition outputs, we don't know much that's relevant to formation of antitrust policy, I think there are interesting questions, I think it is important for modern sort of IO economists and for the agencies, for the FTC and the DOJ who have great collections of IO economists inside those buildings, to engage in answering those questions. </p><p>      And I'd say, it's great that we all get to come up here and engage in those questions, but I'm hopeful that the economists inside the agency who are experts and have access to data, things like agency predictions in individual cases that they can test against data, that they're also an active participant in that discussion. </p><p>      So, I think the real challenge moving forward is if you've got data that isn't what you need to have the type of discussion that you want to have about whether it is desirable to move policy one way or another, whether it's mergers or something else, the challenge I think both for the academy and for the agencies is to invest in producing those data, producing tools, producing studies to move the ball forward in that literature, because I certainly agree, there are interesting questions here that require investment and are sort of worth the time. I'll stop there. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Fiona?</p><p>      MORTON:  Great. Hello, everybody, and thanks to the FTC very much for being invited to contribute to this panel. I agree with both Jon and Steve on the IO research here. It seems very easy to run the wrong regression, to someone without a PhD, it looks tempting. We need to resist that temptation, because it is in fact just wrong. </p><p>      But we need to find another way to answer the question, that's not an excuse for not answering the question. And as Josh said, concentration and competition are not the same thing, it's not actually I think very informative to learn about aggregate concentration in the United States, I'd like to know about competition in the United States. </p><p>      And I think as Steve said, the markups are a good way to get there. I think the real reason that we're -- that there is consensus among a large fraction of the people who do this work for a living and the people who read the newspaper, that we have a competition problem in the United States comes not from papers published in academic journals, but from two main sources. </p><p>      One is, for people who work in this area, the actual experience of litigating. So it took 23 years from the time the FTC first found a pay for delay agreement in the record to getting the Supreme Court to say, yes, under certain conditions those could be anti-competitive. </p><p>      Twenty three years, and a pay for delay is when a branded monopolist pays the generic to stay out of its market, okay? That is pretty straightforward. It's exclusionary conduct, it harms consumers, it keeps prices very high, why did we have to wait a quarter of a century to get that practice banned, or it -- never mind banned actually, to get that practice scrutinized properly. </p><p>      The American Express opinion by the Supreme Court completely misses the locus of competition between American Express and Discover. It's all about American Express' consumers versus the retailers and so on, and gives a complete miss to the issue of competition, which is what the antitrust laws are supposed to protect. </p><p>      So when you look at litigation, and you look at what the agencies are trying to prove in the courts, it's all really heavy lift, and as Bill Baer said when he was at DOJ, why are some of the mergers we're reviewing even getting out of the boardroom? They're just obviously anticompetitive, and yet we had to litigate them anyway. So, I think that's one big area that we look to for evidence as to why there are anticompetitive effects. </p><p>      A second one is our experience as consumers. Look around at hospitals, airlines, beer, media, big tech, I think people in the economy walk around buying things, and the experience they have is of less competition. And I think also consumers can get can easily confused between what is regulated and what's not. So, for instance, pharmaceutical prices and cable prices are not fundamentally something that antitrust can do a lot about, and yet those things are exhibiting less competition, also for the reason that Jonathan covered in his talk about lobbying to get government protection. </p><p>      So, what's my response to this emerging consensus? We need to revisit the economics, and I will say this slowly because it's worth saying 25 times, and I don't have that long, so I'll just say it once slowly. Economic analysis is not the same thing as less enforcement, okay? Chairman Simons said it exactly right this morning. Economics is a tool, if you feed a set of facts into the economic analysis box, okay, you can come out of this merger is competitive or this merger is anticompetitive. It works beautifully, okay? </p><p>      But what happened in 1975 as we applied economics to antitrust and we got the pendulum swinging down, okay? Arguably we had too much disorganized enforcement, the pendulum swung down, and now we have these things as sacred texts, and the answer is always if you believe in the sacred texts of Chicago, to enforce less. Obviously, if you enforce less for 30 or 40 years in a row, you're eventually going to pass the optimum, okay? And that's what we've done, I think. </p><p>      And we need to recognize -- I luckily was too young to be part of that project, and so it's -- I mean, perhaps easier for me to see that we've well overshot the optimum. And that we need to go back and look at the economics fresh and try to get the right answer. And let me remind you all that there's a big drumbeat of dollars in favor of keeping those sacred texts, because the parties that have monopoly profit would like to keep the monopoly profit, and they will spend their monopoly profit to fund people who say that less enforcement is always better. </p><p>      So it's a -- it's going to be difficult to achieve progress in this area, because the parties that have financially gained from less competition are going to work hard to keep their status. So I just want to alert all of you in the media and the enforcement community to be battling courageously for the consumer. </p><p>      But I think that the bottom line is that we have the tools, and we have the ability to get the right answer, and we should use them, and we should not be trapped in paradigms from 30 years ago, because those are really outdated to the extent they were even correct 30 years ago, which I would not stipulate to. All right, that's all. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Thank you. We're going to turn now to a series of questions that I will pose to our panelists, they've gotten the questions in advance, and actually done some negotiating. And there's a designated first answerer on each of the questions, but after that it's up to them to work it out. So, the first question which is directed initially to Josh, it goes like this. Jon's basic point is that we have more market power than we used to and that's bad. Assuming that we do have more market power than we used to, and that it's a significant increase in market power, my question is, do you agree that it's necessarily bad, and do you think something ought to be done about it? </p><p>      WRIGHT:  First, no one ever told me there was negotiating. I always get -- I always get left out. So let me spend ten seconds fighting the premise and then I'll give up an answer. The question is sort of assuming arguendo, the increase in market power then sort of -- is that of -- is that a bad thing? And I think my ten seconds is almost up, but I will say I'm not sure that the premise has been established. But assuming per the question that it is, again, I think we get back to the fundamental point, and some of these old Chicago texts are pretty good including Demsetz's on the point about identification which I still think is very relevant to our discussions about concentration and price. </p><p>      I have a feeling you meant a different one. But I think here, we don't know ex ante, and this is the fundamental problem whether increase -- we in antitrust want to care about changes in market power that are attributed -- attributable to reductions in competition. That is not all of the ways in which market power can be increased, if we want to do antitrust that is sort of consistent with IO, if we want to get the economics right, we need to have a set of tools that enables us to distinguish between those propositions. </p><p>      So, what do I think can or should be done? There are simple answers floated around, we could have -- we could sort of go back, I don't think anyone here wants to do that, we could go back to really simple structural rules that equate competition and concentration. We could pool, dust off the 1968 merger guidelines, do antitrust with our fingers, count the firms, and pretend as if we can make causal inferences from changes from concentration to competition. </p><p>      We could have bright line rules that have presumptions of liability if mergers are above and X share or above X dollars. We have one of those in the Supreme Court, I count that as one of the bad cases we ought to get rid of. But there's pending legislation that does something like this. </p><p>      None of that I think is based in sound economics, so I think what we're left doing if we properly reject those ideas is making a serious investment, both in the academy and in the agencies to improving our tools and being able to answer better some of the questions that we struggle with now with identification. </p><p>      I think we're starting that with merger retrospectives, I think if you look at the evolution of the way inside the agency empirical analysis of mergers happens now versus 10 years ago, much less 20 years ago, the improvement is remarkable, but I think it is a burden on the agencies and on the academy in these areas who like to publish journal papers and whatnot but sort of engage on these questions, both to fight against sort of oversimplified fixes that will probably do more harm than good, but also to subsidize investment in more knowledge to do a better job designing and calibrating policy with these questions. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Anybody else? </p><p>      MORTON:  Yes, I would disagree. I think we have the tools. I don't think we need to spend 10 years developing new tools. I think we could start now. There isn't anything wrong with our existing standards or economic analysis. I think the problem comes when you try to apply it. </p><p>      So if you're in court and it's -- and the judge is taking the view of recent cases that we have seen, which is either ignoring the facts or ignoring the economic principles or not applying the horizontal merger guidelines, for example, in terms of are efficiencies merger specific, are they verifiable, are they cognizable. </p><p>      I think that's where the problem comes and, of course, if an agency is confronted with -- at the end of the day, they disagree with the firms and they have to go to court, that's the outside option. And if you have a very weak hand when you go to court, then there's not much you can get as a settlement. So I don't think actually think we have a problem with the economics. I think we're ready to go there.</p><p>      BAKER:  Greg, I don't know the rules on, like, random intervention so I'm going to make one in the absence of a rule. So the thing that I have in mind in terms of getting the -- I think we're all for getting the economics right. But, for example, some of these areas go the other way so it's not a Chicago text but in 1968, Oliver Williamson wrote a pretty well-known paper on efficiencies and mergers. </p><p>      Fifty years later, there's not a single federal court decision -- no merging parties have prevailed on an efficiencies defense, so 50 years is a heck of a good winning streak. I agree parties sometimes do a bad job presenting efficiencies. I've been inside an agency -- but I think there are places where we could do better. That's one that comes to mind that sort of cuts the other direction. </p><p>      WRIGHT:  The -- just on that last point, I just want to observe that if the overall overriding problem is we're worrying about growing market power, sure, there's a good -- there might be good government reasons to think about ways in which we could do reforms that avoid showing less beneficial conduct but there problem is to strengthen antitrust enforcement and that should be the overriding focus at the moment. </p><p>      WERDEN:  All right. Let's move to the second question. You've heard from a number of our speakers today about the evidence of -- or related to increased corporate profits. This evidence seems fairly clear. The trend is worldwide. But it is more pronounced in the United States than elsewhere and here, the profits are highly concentrated in relatively few hugely successful companies. My question for the panel is -- and Jon's going to first on this one -- does the presence of a relatively small number of hugely successful technology companies in any way suggest a failure of antitrust?</p><p>      BAKER:  So the answer is not per se. I mean a large and profitable firm size and successful alone doesn't mean antitrust has failed. Firms can and do grow large and become successful, you know, providing customers with valuable products and services and that includes large technology companies. We want to encourage firms to grow successful and profitable by offering better and cheaper products and services. </p><p>      We should also be concerned if firms including large and successful ones exercise market power in some other major markets or threaten to do that through exclusionary conduct or collusive conduct or merger. Now, I pointed to the growth of dominant information technology platforms as a reason for concern about increasing market power because I think their high margins probably reflect market power in part, not because of their success per se. </p><p>      BERRY:  Yes. So I think I would combine my answer a little bit to these last two questions which is that -- and the IT example is good. I think they have high markups, they have high profits. For many good reasons, they have high markups. I'd just sort of say it slightly opposite from Jon, it's not just market power. I think it's a combination of market power and doing things that people want and gaining efficiencies. And so it's not -- but as I said before, it's not bad per se but I do think it has implications for antitrust even if it's not bad per se. </p><p>      Take two of these firms. Take two of my big wholesaling firms that have an overlapping set of locations. If the markups are already very high, the stakes for a merger become that much more severe because they're already operating on inelastic parts of their demand curve. So I think in many cases, we can sort of litigate whether it was bad -- whether we got here or not. And I personally think we're going to figure out -- it's a mix of things and we're going to say some bad and some good. </p><p>      I think what I'm more interested in is the forward-looking discussion of what are the implications, now that we're here, is there something that we should be doing, is there a kind of scrutiny that we should be offering that we haven't offered before. And I'd really like to hear from my closer to practitioner colleagues what those things might be. </p><p>      WERDEN:  You want to get in on this? </p><p>      MORTON:  I'll answer it as answer to the next question you're about to ask me, how about that? </p><p>      WERDEN:  Okay. That's fine. Next question. Steve sketched a scenario in which technology is changing in a way that increases the sunk costs and decreases the marginal costs of companies. That scenario rings true even if lots of other forces are at work. I would like to hear from the panelists on what they think likely accounts for the empirical observation of increased markups over the past four decades. </p><p>      MORTON:  Okay. So I'm going to take the first half of that question and then Steve's question on what do you do enforcement-wise. I think what we need to do is adjust our enforcement analytics to fit the market structure as Steve suggested. So let's take, for example, the presence of network effects. Network effects are when the value of the product rises in the number of users. So a social media platform is more valuable to me, the more other people are on it. What do we get when we have network effects? We get concentrated market structures. Everybody wants to be on the same network because all their friends are there. </p><p>      Okay. So we get market shares that go 99 percent and 1 percent or a few little epsilons. We don't see market structures of 70/30 or 50/50 in a world with network effects. Okay. So we necessarily are going to see concentrated markets. Is that a problem? No. As we've said already, just per se, just that fact, that's not a problem. </p><p>      But we need to recognize that the locus of competition has shifted. Competition in that market does not display itself in the market. The 30 is not competing with the 70. No, it's competition for the market. Who is going to be the winner-take-all? Who is going to get to be the 99? There are some firms that start out together and one of them gets ahead and the market tips and that winner gets 99 percent.</p><p>      Okay. So now that we know that the locus of competition is for the market, not in the market, how would we do antitrust? We would care an awful lot about entry. We would care an awful lot about potential competition. We would care an awful lot about acquisitions by the 99 percent of a teeny little epsilon percent. Why? Because that epsilon percent doesn't have a lot of share, but that's where the competition's coming from. That 99 percent guy is afraid the epsilon is going to become one and attract all the teenagers and there's going to be a flip. </p><p>      Okay. So we care a lot about that little epsilon and that's where the competition's coming from and we need to dust off our theories of harm when it comes to potential competition. We need to stop investing so much importance in market share. The market share of the little guy is not big and when you calculate the Herfindahls, nothing's going to happen when you do this -- when you analyze this merger. Does that mean there was no competitive significance to this little player? Quite the contrary. </p><p>      All those little players are the only ones that are making the 99 percent pedal faster and work harder to keep consumers because they're all potentially able to overthrow the incumbent. So that's a way in which we have standards, lessening competition and so on that work perfectly well in an internet platform or a network effects market. But we need to think about focusing our enforcement efforts at the place where the competition is, which is a little bit different in some of these markets than it would be historically in, say, automobiles. So I think there are big implications for antitrust enforcement and I would point people in that kind of direction. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Do you want to weigh in, Josh? </p><p>      WRIGHT:  I think I agree with probably everything in that in terms of description of that and other contexts being appropriate to worry less about the shares and worry more about the competitive constraint imposed by the rival. I think that's sort of a common theme, focusing on the competitive constraint directly rather than using shares as a proxy that probably holds across a bunch of areas. I will make the observation that it is with respect to Steve's explanation with the sort of increasing sum cost and reduced marginal cost. </p><p>      That -- one of the implications and I think this is a hearing for another day. But one of the implications is that a lot of those industries are industries that are intellectual property intensive, and one of the potential tensions that arises and I think the agencies have to engage with and be thinking about as do academics who are thinking about these things is, you know, the idea that we sort of are chasing markups leading us into those industries, invites a risk of having antitrust and IP sort of go back to the '60s and 1970s eras where they ran directly into each other.</p><p>      I think a lot of work has been done to try to get antitrust and IP to serve as complements in the direction of competition innovation rather than substitutes. And there needs to be in those areas -- if that indeed is the right story, I think there needs to be sort of significant thinking about how to make sure that complementary relationship stays intact. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Okay. Let's move on to the next question which concerns dynamism. You've heard quite a lot about that today as well. And Jon refers to some evidence on dynamism as one of the major reasons for rejecting a benign explanation for some of the trends that have been observed. But I will point out to our panelists and our audience that the databases on which economists rely may be missing a lot. The broadest database that I'm familiar with is the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics Statistics, which is a very high quality longitudinal database that includes every business in the United States with at least one employee. </p><p>      But it doesn't include any of the businesses with zero employees. And you say, \"Well, how big a deal can that be?\" Well, the answer is a presentation done by Census economists a few years ago revealed that between 1997 and 2010, 75 million startups in the United States had zero employees while only 7.6 million had one or more employees. So over 90 percent of the startups in the United States are being missed in the data that shows entry rates going down. So my question is, well, what data, if any, is telling on dynamism? And Steve is going first on this one.</p><p>      BERRY:  Okay. So I'll start off confessing my confusion a little bit. So when we talk about market power -- I know what we're talking about, we're talking about the ability to hold price above marginal cost. When we talk about dynamism, a few things come to mind and they seem different. One is a simply descriptive question which we might want an answer to which is has turnover in some sense changed? Is -- are the rates of entry and exit from various industries fundamentally changed? </p><p>      I think one of the things Greg is asking is how good is the data on that. I don't actually have a great independent opinion on how good is the data on that. But there's another thing that I think Jonathan suggested, which is it's not a descriptive matter of entry and exit. It's a question of whether the economy is delivering important innovations to consumers in the form of lower costs that are actually passed through to lower prices and/or better products. And it's possible as with our last question that you have a set of really big, great innovative firms who protect their position by being very innovative. In that sense, we'd have a lot of innovation and not much turnover and I don't know if that's dynamism or not. </p><p>      It does make me think hard though about Fiona's point about potential competition. And I think maybe this is what Jonathan is getting at. If there are firms who got where they are by being innovative, how do we ensure that the innovation continues? Surely not by seizing their intellectual property, for example, that seems bad. </p><p>      But I duly take more seriously potential competition, is the data that Jonathan's referring to evidence of a lack of potential competition? I'm a little confused by that. It's more on sort of actual entry and exit. But these are always first order questions, these questions about innovation are always first order questions, and I think if we accept that we have these very large, very profitable, certainly firms that got where they were by innovating, again, I would sort of say, well, let's start from where we are and ask how we move forward. And I don't know that we have dispositive evidence, but it seems like an important question. </p><p>      MORTON:  I would agree with everything Steve just said and I think then, the purpose of antitrust enforcement is to ensure that the large firm that got where it initially got on the -- by innovating and serving consumers continues to do that. If there isn't effective antitrust enforcement, then you have the possibility of entrenchment and monopoly profits and a decline in -- in the kind of innovation and price competition that we would like to see. </p><p>      So it's very important that we have effective antitrust enforcement in this sector so that -- and if we do and we continue to have high concentration, then they're competing hard and we're getting what we want as a society, but if we don't enforce here, then I think we can't be sure that we will. </p><p>      BAKER:  And I'd like to just respond by reminding you that I talked about six different indicators of declining dynamism, and really only like one or two depend on the data set that Greg was working -- is worried about -- I was talking about the secular slowdown in business investment and rising profits this year, GDP, slowed rate which firms expand when they become more productive and shift in growth and productivity gains from entrants to incumbents and the growing gap in accounting profitability between the most and least profitable firms, and then also a declining rate of startups, which is more about the data set Greg is emphasizing. </p><p>      WRIGHT:  One small point on the relationship between business dynamism, I think for this purpose, however, we defined it in antitrust is that, you know, of course, there are issues to explore here on potential competition, but a point of agreement with Jon is, you know, public restraint scenario where the FTC has been very active, sort of state or locally imposed barriers to entry that reduce the ability for entry are a big deal here and an area I don't think the FTC needs to be convinced that it is worth spending time on. It has done for a really time. It has done in a bipartisan and consensus oriented way for a really long time. </p><p>      My own view is that area is probably -- if we're looking for an area to agree on for more cases to bring, I think those cases have legal issues with state action defense and whatnot, but if you want to target the resources of the agency at stuff you know is anticompetitive, state barriers to entry including occupational licensing is a -- is pretty good stuff and stuff that I think the agency would be well-served, and we do lots of competition advocacy but used to be an area where we brought a few more cases.</p><p>      WERDEN:  Shall we go after the lawyer monopoly first? I think we can get an agreement right here. That's the one that's really problematic. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm in, Greg. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Okay. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You're asking an economist that question. </p><p>      WERDEN:  They know. Anybody want to say anything more about dynamism? Are we done? Okay. Good. So my final prepared question for the panelists is a broad policy question. If the plan is to somehow ramp up antitrust and the solution is not just to spend more money at the agencies which, of course, is always welcome, what should be done and by whom? Congress, the courts, the agencies? And in particular I ask, one change in substance or procedure do you recommend and what one change would you most strongly caution against. And start with Jon. </p><p>      BAKER:  So in the book that I mentioned that I -- that's coming out next spring, I talk about a number of substantive presumptions for ramping up antitrust that I'd like courts to adopt but I don't want to do the equivalent of, you know, picking a favorite child. I can't really describe them all here. So instead, I'm going to give you two cautions rather than one of each. So on substance, I would caution against presuming that vertical conduct is pro-competitive and I think I talked about why in my presentation, and on process I would caution against introducing direct political influence into antitrust enforcement. </p><p>      WERDEN:  So why don't we just go down? Steve, next? </p><p>      BERRY:  Okay. So I really wanted to hear the practitioners talk to this more -- more than I wanted to hear myself talk about it. </p><p>      WERDEN:  You can pass if you want. </p><p>      BERRY:  But let me just say one quick thing which is -- it falls upon this last point. I think in general the state of the evidence and I think this is even consistent with Joshua's concentration about the state of the evidence, is that I think we could do with some flattening of priors and some less presumptions in general, that I think that's -- it's a time when things are changing, when there's a lot of interesting data and we're not quite sure what it means and the idea that we have strong presumptions, say, about what is vertical or potential competition being bad, I think a lot of presumptions should be at question and that we should be acting as though before we do the analysis, before we get the data to a specific situation, we should be more modest and are basing in priors should be flatter I think just in general. </p><p>      MORTON:  And since current practice is to be extremely worried about over-enforcement and not at all under-enforcement, that would flatten, I agree. I don't have any cautions, so I'm going to do three recommendations, make up for Steve's one. so we're symmetric. </p><p>      I think it would be -- I'm going to identify who should do this because I'm not enough of an expert in that area, but I think it would be helpful if courts were to actually follow the definition of consumer welfare that is correct and the horizontal merger guidelines. In particular, that efficiencies have to be cognizable and merger-specific and benefit consumers. That would be a big help. </p><p>      A second big help would be if we were explicit about our concern for potential competition and instructing courts to consider that as an important element in that markets where it is proven to be an important element. </p><p>      And third, I would say that there is, as Josh mentioned, I think an increasing use by firms of government processes to protect themselves from competition and to exclude, and I think it would be helpful if someone could figure out a way to adjust Noerr-Pennington and similar kinds of laws to make it less possible for incumbents to keep out potential competitors and entrants. Those would be my three. </p><p>      WRIGHT:  Steven, Fiona stole my thunder. But let me say, I would sort of, one co-sign Steve's proposal that priors be flattened here and we take sort of hard looks at presumptions that are driving enforcement, whether they are structural presumptions in favor of more enforcement, whether they are presumptions that go the other way. I think flattening priors and reevaluating those is sort of -- no time like the present to take out zombie presumptions while we're reevaluating the economics. </p><p>      I would say for the agencies that certainly includes -- Congress has such bright line proposals in front of it. And I'm sure would like to hear from the agencies about what they think about those bright line presumptions but I would also say in addition to quickly co-signing the reallocation -- I guess I'm not allowed to increase the budgets. Reallocation toward public restraints where I think a disproportionate amount of the harm, you line up a hundred economists and 99 are going to agree that that stuff is harmful, we're not going to have sort of big reasonable fights over which way that the welfare effects cut, so I say reallocation in that direction. </p><p>      And the last one I would say which is more procedural and resource allocation inside the agency -- I do think -- there are a lot of really tough questions facing the agencies and facing IO economics and helping guide through what I think is a really interesting time and how we calibrate antitrust policy there. </p><p>      A hundred-some PhD economists between the agencies and I guess I'm not allowed to raise the number to 200 without firing some lawyers which will not be popular here. But I think there are ways to more deeply involve economists inside the agency in these discussions. I think the more of that whether it is through 6Bs at the FTC, whether it is -- a lot of ways to do that. And I think the more of that, the better.</p><p>      BERRY:  I'd like to comment on something that Josh and Fiona, talking about the -- I really don't think -- I mean sure, there are public restraints that are harmful and appropriate to be concerned with if you want to enhance competition, but I don't think the idea of reallocating the FTC and DOJ budgets towards public restraints is necessarily a good idea. </p><p>      What I'm worried about is that a lot of public restraints, there are other mechanism that are outside of antitrust laws, legislative and, for example, for addressing them and probably more effectively and where advocacy in front of other regulatory agencies and the like. </p><p>      But it's the antitrust agencies, you know, (inaudible) too in the states but the antitrust agencies are really the most important actors in stopping private anticompetitive conduct, you know, at least along with other actors. And I'm worried that of taking enforcement resources away from those important efforts by the antitrust agencies, the way that Josh's proposal would suggest. </p><p>      So it's clear, we think the budget should go up. </p><p>      WERDEN:  No argument from me on that. I think start with my pay. We have a bunch of questions from the audience and two of them are almost identical, so obviously there is a consensus that this is the most important issue because we have two who agree on...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  They were sitting next to each other. </p><p>      WERDEN:  ...on this. The handwriting is almost identical. I think this is not two independent draws but what the heck. So I will rephrase. What, if anything, should the antitrust agencies be doing about Amazon? </p><p>      MORTON:  About what? </p><p>      WERDEN:  Amazon. </p><p>      WRIGHT:  Doing the same thing they do in all of -- analyzing -- I mean the -- I think the point of the conversation and the reason for the silence is that I think we are all believers in the idea that you get the toolkit right and you fight over how to get the toolkit right and you work out how to get the toolkit right and you apply it evenly across the economy. You could take account of differences but you don't have different sort of...</p><p>      MORTON:  You don't pick out a firm and say, how do we do...yes.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes. </p><p>      WERDEN:  So if I rephrase the question, are you aware of any antitrust case that the government should have brought against Amazon but didn't, would you say no? </p><p>      MORTON:  Well, if they should've brought it, then they should've brought it. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Are you aware of it? </p><p>      MORTON:  Oh, am I aware of one? No. </p><p>      WERDEN:  No. Okay. Okay, that's enough for Amazon. We have a question about static versus dynamic view of market power. And this came up quite a few times in the conversation, but since I've got question, I'll put it again. </p><p>      Because profit is the necessary incentive for innovation and investment, how should we think about many of the things we're observing today like high margins and network effects in terms of a dynamic view of how competition works? </p><p>      And, Fiona, you addressed this quite a bit already but is there anything you would like to add? </p><p>      MORTON:  I mean, this is why Steve and I have been saying let's look forward and let's try to keep firms honest. You have a good idea, you do something really well, you innovate, you get enormous amounts of revenue, people are very happy. That's excellent. But then it's very easy if we look at the historical record for such a firm to find it easier to exclude rivals rather than compete. Competing is hard. It's hard work. </p><p>      And so we need to have a toolkit that's up-to-date and used to make sure that as we move forward, a firm that has significant market power is getting it honestly by competing on the merits and delivering innovation and low prices. And if that's what we're getting, that's excellent, but it would be not efficient and not good for consumers to stop enforcing against these firms. </p><p>      BERRY:  Yes, I mean Fiona mentioned, you know, earlier the idea of rivals buying competitors just to -- just to remove the potential competition. We've talked about that a bit. And you're -- I don't think you're blaming the innovative firm or punishing the innovative firm by trying to see if we can stop that from happening. And my -- I have a question. I'm not quite sure whether we should be looking at acquisitions by these firms differently than we would, and I don't think that's blaming them or depriving them of the benefits of their innovation. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Let me slow things down a little. You -- after I ask a question you can go next. Somebody who's worked in an agency realizes and I'm sure our panelists do, too, that none of these questions are as simple as they might appear in a panel discussion. </p><p>      So if you get some, let's say, dominant technology platform and it's proposing to buy some nascent competitor that might come up with the next greatest idea or might have it already but hasn't got it to market. How do you know whether to think this is bad because this threat to the incumbent monopoly is being squelched, or this is good because this is the way that this new idea will come to market? </p><p>      MORTON:  So here I think we rely on Jon and his error cost framework to think about this. Right? If you don't know whether the acquisition's going to going to be pro-competitive or anticompetitive, you have to think of the harms you're creating by getting it wrong. And if under-enforcement creates tremendous harm because the dominant technology platform has lots of market power and that's going to be a huge problem, then we have to make sure we're weighting that risk appropriately. </p><p>      And it may be that we don't have very much information about -- or as much as we would about the potential competitor as we do in markets where we're assessing whether a 15 percent share should be allowed to buy a 20 percent share. </p><p>      There's a lot of more information about the products, about the way competition arises, about the prices and so forth when you have competitors already in the marketplace. When it's potential, the problem is much more difficult. Does that mean there's less welfare at stake? Not at all. So just because there's less information doesn't mean we get a free pass to do nothing about it. </p><p>      BAKER:  And I wanted to add -- sort of going back to the original question about where they're talking -- which was asking about static and dynamic competition. Some people have the idea that competition is somehow bad for innovation, and that when we are acting as antitrust enforcers if that's what we're -- who we are, to increase competition, we're just going to -- we're going to benefit the buyers with lower prices but somehow will impede innovation and that there's some -- a trade-off. And that's not necessarily right. And it probably isn't right on average. </p><p>      There's lots of evidence that competition spurs productivity, lots of economic studies. And on innovation particularly, I read the literature saying the motive that firms have to innovate by escaping competition is probably stronger on average in the data than the motive to innovate that comes appropriating more returns on the margin. </p><p>      And it's not surprising, because firms that are making major R&amp;D investments always have -- usually have a lot of reasons other than preexisting market power to appropriate submission returns to -- even if there's some imitation and successful incumbents may be discouraged from developing new products because they're -- that would cannibalize their existing rents, and because as Steve and Fiona have been emphasizing, firms with market power can discourage new competition with exclusionary conduct. And so there's every reason to think that more competition is good for society for dynamic innovation oriented productivity reasons, not just for static price and quality reasons.</p><p>      WRIGHT:  So long as we are including the -- maybe the caveat or the definition that in Jon's claim that more competition is good, that we're not equating competition to the number of firms. I get nervous about these discussions when they convert to policy, because the temptation is when I've got a really, really hard, ballsy problem to figure out, like is that acquisition of the nascent or small competitor a good or bad thing on net -- on welfare, the trade-offs are really difficult to figure out. And it is sometimes tempting and I think history teaches us certainly in antitrust that there is a temptation that is often succumbed to by agencies to sort of cling to those bright line presumptions, because you can do them. </p><p>      And that I think is something that in that area, we certainly don't have enough empirical evidence or economic theory to do, it involves -- this may be an area I think Fiona and I disagreed some about whether we've got all the tools we need. And I think -- I think we probably agree, we've got most of what we need, but I think there are areas where we could do better and even if that means doing better means learning more about the distribution, potential competition's one of those areas...</p><p>      MORTON:  But here's the problem, Josh, if you say we don't know enough to draw a line, I'm fine with that, but that's not the same thing as saying because we don't know anything, we're going to decide all the cases so that it's fine for the big firm to buy the potential competitor. </p><p>      WRIGHT:  You certainly didn't hear the latter claim I've made. I voted these cases. </p><p>      MORTON:  Okay. </p><p>      WRIGHT:  And to bring them. </p><p>      MORTON:  Yes, let's not go there. But yes, I -- then I agree. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Okay. Good. So rephrasing this -- these next two questions. Economists are really on top of how goodly or badly market concentration tells you that there is competition or not competition in an industry. So we don't want to further that conversation. The question is what else, what would you look at if you wanted to know how competitive a market sector the whole economy is. </p><p>      BAKER:  Well, it's easier on the sector, right? And the fact of the matter is there are a lot of tools of merger analysis looking at the close substitution of products and differentiated products markets, for example, which I think are well-accepted as being much better than concentration measures. And in my understanding concentration is used largely as a screen, I'm not the practitioner. And I think some of us maybe even questioning that a little bit. But in horizontal mergers really I think practice has moved very, very far away from concentration measures and toward the closeness of substitution of merging parties. </p><p>      I think there's less consensus in vertical mergers, but there are a new set of tools that look at changes in bargaining that result as a -- as a result of vertical competition, I think those are not as well-accepted outside of economics, and I understand some of the legal fights going on right now are not even over the specifics of whether a particular merger should go forward as much as they are about whether those economic tools have value. </p><p>      So I think there are, in both horizontal and vertical cases, real tools of economics that focus on I think what is actually at issue in these cases both horizontally and vertically. If horizontally, they're well-accepted maybe less so vertically.</p><p>      WERDEN:  When you get to a case, you're going to have information that a researcher wouldn't have, a lot of it. And it can be very useful. And we have tools for analyzing it. I think where the question was coming from is as a researcher, you know, as a policymaker, if you're looking at the whole big picture, what is it you should look at? </p><p>      BAKER:  Yes, okay. So since I'm such a micro guy and I find it hard to move past the aggregation as the sum of its components. I think it's very hard to do at the broad aggregate level. Broad evidence on markets, broad evidence on profits are interesting and they do not particularly get to the whys. I think they're a flag of interests I would say.</p><p>      MORTON:  The field of IO is a micro-field so we're just really bad at answering this question. And if you look at Jon's list of cites, a lot of those people are in finance or macro or labor. </p><p>      BAKER:  Or labor. </p><p>      MORTON:  That have come in to this empty space that we generated, which is how do we describe the economy as a whole because our field doesn't do that. And so that's partly why we have these conflicting methodologies...</p><p>      WERDEN:  Don't you wish we had some occupational licensing here? </p><p>      BERRY:  You know, it's -- you know, in all honesty, as I said before, it's actually excellent that those papers are raising these questions. That's an excellent thing that these questions are being raised by those papers. And I think people deserve a response. In the meantime, we don't necessarily believe the causal conclusions of those papers. </p><p>      WERDEN:  I was just handed this emergency question. Are there important competition issues that antitrust can't handle? And I take this to be antitrust enforcement as we know it. So these would be problems that would be addressed in some other way than antitrust cases. </p><p>      WRIGHT:  So, sure. Natural monopoly, you know, the heart -- you can't -- you have to regulate that. You can't use...</p><p>      WERDEN:  We did that. We're kind of past it. </p><p>      MORTON:  Well...</p><p>      WRIGHT:  Well, it's important...</p><p>      WERDEN:  Wait, it's almost all gone. </p><p>      MORTON:  Your electricity bill I'm afraid to say has some regulation in it. </p><p>      WERDEN:  A little bit. But I'm at the mercy of am unregulated water monopolist...</p><p>      WRIGHT:  And then some of the governmental restraints we were talking about have to be dealt with legislatively. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Apart from regulating monopolies which is an old but still good idea, is there anything else you wish to do? </p><p>      WRIGHT:  Well, I mean I do think when people talk about the tech companies, they -- and this is a good question for the FTC is that people are sometimes talking about data and other forms of social relationships that I think are difficult to handle outside of the existing antitrust framework and may be subject to different kinds of regulation. And I think sometimes when people talk about old-fashioned antitrust they are also talking about, for example, political power and I think that's way outside the realm of traditional antitrust regulation. I think it should stay there. But it doesn't mean that -- it doesn't mean there shouldn't be some response. </p><p>      BAKER:  And then also leader follower conduct that leads to tacit coordination, that's very hard to address through antitrust laws. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Do you think it should be addressed at all? </p><p>      BAKER:  Well, I -- you mean do I think someone -- some other actor could do a better job than the courts, like that? </p><p>      MORTON:  So I don't want to...</p><p>      BAKER:  It's the same problem that the antitrust agencies have. </p><p>      WERDEN:  So that would be a no. </p><p>      BAKER:  I -- you know, I mean it would be nice to be able to do that but I don't -- I'm not sure how. </p><p>      MORTON:  So I'd like to follow up on what Steve said. I mean there's political power, there's things like privacy, there's misinformation. It's not clear that vigorous competition fixes the problems that people want to see fixed in those domains and it might be that you want another agency or some other law to do that if that's what the community would like to see done. </p><p>      So I think there are calls -- you read in the paper about people who would like antitrust to -- or perhaps think that antitrust can fix everything and my view is that that's not going to work. That antitrust is very well-geared. It's a set of economic tools, it's very well-geared to certain kinds of problems and that we should look elsewhere to other kinds of regulations if we have different kinds of problems to fix. </p><p>      BAKER:  Greg, let me come back, in fact I'm completely baffled that you're subject to a -- to an unregulated water monopoly and I know we're here and I still am confused by it. </p><p>      WERDEN:  It's not my house here. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, no, I just mean... </p><p>      WERDEN:  There are many unregulated monopolies in this country. </p><p>      BAKER:  I agree and why we gave up on so many of them, I'm still baffled by. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Okay. Running out of good questions here. So I'm tempted to say we're done but I will give the last five minutes to our panelists to say whatever they choose to say to wrap up. </p><p>      BERRY:  Remind them about the book, Jon. </p><p>      MORTON:  Yes. </p><p>      BAKER:  My publicist says this. That every one of you go out and buy it when it's available.</p><p>      WERDEN:  Are you offering a discount? </p><p>      BAKER:  You'll have to discuss that with my publisher. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Have you set the price yet? </p><p>      BAKER:  I don't think it's even available yet. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Okay. It's too soon to talk about. </p><p>      MORTON:  I think it's great we're having these hearings. </p><p>      WERDEN:  Okay. Well, then we're going to take our break now a few minutes early. </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SAYYED:  All right. I think let's get started. It's the last panel for the day. And as I mentioned at the beginning for those who haven't read the website or when I hear at the beginning, because of at least the potential for what our difficulties tomorrow. We're going to reschedule tomorrow's sessions until probably sometime late in October. So, this -- we turn now from mostly antitrust, but not exclusively, to consumer protection issue with respect -- and James Cooper now with the FTC will moderate this panel.</p><p>      COOPER:  All right. Thanks, Bilal. Welcome everyone. Good afternoon. I'm James Cooper. I'm the deputy director for economic analysis in the Bureau of Consumer Protection here at the FTC. It's my great pleasure to be here and take part in these hearings and moderate this august panel. </p><p>      Before I get started, I have to, recently -- I'm on leave from academia, so I'm not used to doing this. But anything -- I'm going to try to say zero of substance today. And in the off chance I do, anything I say is just my opinion only and not necessarily that of the Federal Trade Commission or any individual commissioner including the one sitting next to me.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Most especially not.</p><p>      COOPER:  Most especially the one sitting next to me.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  No, kidding. James and I have worked together for many years.</p><p>      COOPER:  Yes. All right. Nearly, you should probably already heard today, nearly 25 years ago, Chairman Pitofsky, he began the FTC's journey on the path to become the nation's privacy and data cop. Along the way, much has changed, when this all began, things like the iPhone, Facebook and Google didn't even exist. </p><p>      But today, we find ourselves in a digital economy that lives on consumer data. Clearly, this evolution has provided tremendous value for consumers. We have vast troves of information in our fingertip, most of us can't get anywhere without our phones anymore, myself included. And we can connect with millions of people instantaneously as I'm sure many of you are doing right now via Twitter. I could go on. </p><p>      But at the same time, the fact that consumer data is so tightly woven into the fabric of today's economy, it's presented unique consumer protection challenges. Part of what I think makes these issues so tricky may stem from the fact that it's not agreed upon framework for analysis. As we've heard a lot today, antitrust is married up with microeconomics, it has been for about the past four decades.</p><p>      Privacy and data security, however, yet to find similarly suited mates. So, the FTC, or clearly economics is an important role in shaping privacy and data security policy. For example, the seminal work of the economics in information that garnered Nobel Prizes for people with names like Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz teaches us generally that reducing the cost of information flows typically improves market performance because it helps consumers make better choices.</p><p>      But at the same time, privacy and data security policy also involves significant consumer values such as dignity, the right to be let alone and autonomy, which are really difficult to balance in a typical benefit cost framework, though they're equally important.</p><p>      Never the one to shy from a challenge, the FTC has been in the forefront of trying to tackle these complex and weighty matters. As I mentioned before in the beginning of 1995, when Chairman Pitofsky conveyed a series of -- when Chairman Pitofsky convened a series of workshops designed to educate the FTC and the public on consumer protection issues surrounding the online use of consumer data and continuing with the 2012 policy report and subsequent reports on -- and workshops examining issues like big data, the internet of things, data brokers, and most recently, informational injuries through what former Chairman Kovacic called Policy, Research and Development, the FTC has continually attempted to calibrate its enforcement posture to balance consumer interests and privacy in data security with the remarkable benefits that -- with the remarkable benefits that the digital economy provides. And I think that these hearings will continue that tradition.</p><p>      So this brings me to the subject of our panel today. Today, we appear to be at an inflection point. Many of the same intercurrence that are animating the challenges to the antitrust status quo that were addressed earlier today, and that will be addressed another hearings, couple with catalysts of high profile data breaches, the use of social media to attempt the influence of 2016 election, Cambridge Analytica and the coming online of GDPR have caused many to -- have caused many to question whether the current privacy and data security framework needs a rethink. </p><p>      For example, some have suggested the U.S. should adopt a more European-like approach. And it appears that California has already taken up the mantle. We see legislative proposals in various forms kicking around Congress. So, today we hope to work through some of these thorny issues, examining where we are, where we might go, and what that might mean for both consumer privacy and the digital economy, which has provided us with so much.</p><p>      So we're very -- I'm very happy, we would all be happy to have an all-star panel to help us on this journey today. So to my immediately left is Maureen Ohlhausen. Maureen is currently a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. She was acting chairman from January 2017 through April 2018. Before that, Chairman or Commissioner Ohlhausen was a partner Wilkinson Barker Knauer where she focused on FTC issues, including privacy and data protection.</p><p>      She was also, served at the FTC for 11 years prior to that, where she was the director of the Office of Policy Planning. And prior to that, she was a clerk for Judge Sentelle on the D.C. Circuit. </p><p>      So next to Commissioner Ohlhausen is Howard Beales. Howard is a professor of strategic management and public policy at the George Washington University. Importantly for the purposes of our panel today, Howard from 2001 to 2004 served as the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection. In addition, in his earlier stint at the FTC, he helped think about and really develop a lot of the framework today for how we analyze informational issues surrounding consumer protection.</p><p>      Next to Howard is Daniel Solove. He's the John Marshall Harlan Research Professor of Law at the George Washington University. Daniel is one of the leading privacy scholars in the country. In addition to writing some of the seminal articles in privacy, he along with his co-author Paul Schwartz are the author of a casebook on information privacy law, that everyone including me uses to teach that subject. </p><p>      He is also the CEO of Teach Privacy and runs a myriad of privacy programs, which unfortunately for us may mean he has to cut our early. I don't think he will. Because he's got something going on tonight, including his annual privacy forum, Privacy Salon, things like that. </p><p>      And then finally, last but definitely not least, David Vladeck is the A.B. Chettle Junior Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center. And he, like Howard, was the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection from 2009 to 2013. And before that, he spent 25 years at Public Citizen litigation group.</p><p>      So we're kind of lucky here, I mentioned, to have Howard and -- Will, Howard and David because in their timeframe with Lydia Parnes and kind of -- in between as well really took the -- really helped usher in the era of the FTC being involved in privacy and data security and really kind of being at the helm of that in large part.</p><p>      So what I want to do with the format today, we're just going to have a discussion. We don't have any presentation. But we're going to drill down on some questions. And we also will have -- if you have questions from the audience, we would -- we'll be taking note cards to -- I guess there are designated people to take those questions and we'll certainly save some time at the end to address these.</p><p>      So, let me get started, and we're -- the big picture headline question of this panel is to kind of see, take stock of where we are in the privacy and data security regulation in the U.S. and where we need to go. And I think that if we're going to assess that, maybe in sort of a high level, we should think about what would be the goals of the privacy and data security program? </p><p>      So at a high level, what should a privacy and data security program be concerned with -- what sort of values should it protecting and how might we think about measuring whether that goal is accomplished? So, Maureen, I want to have you take a first crack of the question and invite others to respond or react.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  Great. Well, thank you James. And I'm delighted to be here. Thank you to the organizers for including me in the panel. </p><p>      This is a topic I've thought a lot about, what are the values that we are trying to protect and pursue in our privacy and data security enforcement in the U.S. I would say one of the first values -- because our authority under the FTC, whether it's deceptive or unfair acts or practices and are affecting commerce. So first of all, it's commercial. Right? Everyone forgets that one at the end. But it's in Commerce.</p><p>      And then deceptive. That means that there was a promise made to a consumer that isn't kept, or unfair, which means there was an act or practice that caused substantial injury to a consumer that the consumer couldn't reasonably avoid, that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to competition or the consumer protection.</p><p>      And of course, the FTC isn't the only actor in the space. We already have lots of other or certain number of other privacy laws. You think about HIPAA. You think about financial privacy. You think about the CPNI rules for communications data. So those are areas where in a way if you think about it, we've already as a society through our political system decided there are special buckets of information that need special protection.</p><p>      So where does FTC fit in there? First of all, to talk about deception. I was actually at the FTC back when we brought the first online privacy case, Dan Caprio was there with me as well, and some other people in the audience probably too, under Chairman Pitofsky in the Geocities case So, they had made a promise about how they would collect or use data and they didn't keep that promise.</p><p>      And we've brought lots of privacy cases alleging deception since. And what we're trying to protect there, I think, is two-fold. One, it's consumer sovereignty. Right? The consumer made a choice and that choice wasn't respected. So I think that's the primary thing. </p><p>      There is also a competition element there, because you certainly want to allow the marketplace to operate in an efficient way where you have -- someone not getting competitive advantage because they've lied about what they're doing and they actually aren't adhering to it. Maybe it's costly. I mean that was like an Uber case that we brought, it was -- they had initially promised that they were going to do certain things with the data. And then it turned to stop accessing it. And then it turned out to be kind of expensive to keep that promise. So we had to modify our order. So I would say the first thing is consumer sovereignty. </p><p>      But then the second thing, I think that we are supposed to be protecting is protecting consumers from substantial injury. And that is captured in our unfairness authority. Now, what is substantial injury is really the question. And you don't always need a promise made to consumers. In fact, unfairness, I think, works particularly well when there hasn't been a promise made to the consumer. But there is sort of an expectation that consumers won't be injured through data collection and use.</p><p>      So some of the cases that we've brought in that space involve things like collecting and sharing real-time location data about consumers, because that can be abused in a way that can be used for stalking, right? So there's a health or safety risk. Certainly, the collection of financial information or the failure to protect financial information that could -- that's sensitive. So it could be used to hurt consumers financially.</p><p>      One of the things -- we mentioned the informational injury workshop. And so one of the things that I tried to do with that is actually come up with a little bit of a taxonomy of the different harms that we have addressed through FTC enforcement. And what I came up in doing a review of all the cases that we've brought in the privacy area, the first one I already mentioned, which is the distortion or not respecting consumer sovereignty and through deception.</p><p>      Financial harms, health and safety. I mentioned that one already, and unwarranted intrusion. So cases -- we'd have some where we had the TRENDnet case where there was an internet-enabled camera that had a pretty obvious flaw in its software, so that anybody who had the IP address could hack into this camera that was sold to be used for home monitoring and watching your kids, right? </p><p>      So we think, well, that is intrusion. We also had the rent-to-own, that was Aaron's case. David and I agreed very, very aggressively on that one.</p><p>      VLADECK:  Well, it was the DesignerWare case.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  DesignerWare, that was it. Right, right. Very good. But where the laptops had a program that could turn on the camera and companies could use that or take screenshots. </p><p>      And then last one is reputational injury. And my view is that the FTC, we've never brought a case purely to -- based on reputational injury but reputational injury has been certainly present in some of the cases that we've brought such as the Ashley Madison case.</p><p>      So I would say those are the -- reputational is a little I think more controversial. But otherwise, I think those are the types of things that the FTC's approach, the authority that we've been given, those are the values that we should be pursing in privacy.</p><p>      COOPER:  Yes. Would anyone else like to weigh on that? Sort of at a high level? Perhaps even leaving aside the FTC's goals. What are some things that -- what would we think of? What should we be thinking of when we think about an enforcement program or regulatory program to protect privacy? What sort of values should we be protecting? What should we be thinking about?</p><p>      VLADECK:  So let me just add to Maureen's point about the DesignerWare, Aaron's kinds of cases. Ashley Madison, I'm not sure is a reputational harm case only. And I think part of the struggle -- and I'm glad we had the workshop on informational harms, is they all sort of fit generally into what we used to think of as an invasion privacy tort. But they're very hard to label. So with Ashley Madison, marriages were broken up and -</p><p>OHLHAUSEN:  People committed suicide.</p><p>      VLADECK:  People committed suicide. So labeling that kind of harm is difficult. But I think partly, what we ought to focus on is the nature of the intrusion. So in Ashley Madison, it's intruding into very personal relationships, in DesignerWare and Aaron's, it was intruding into the home. I mean the real problem in those cases was that cameras can be activated remotely when people are sitting on their couch or doing whatever.</p><p>      And so, I agree that it's important to try to see if we can come up with a taxonomy. But why would this really just sort of depends on context. </p><p>      COOPER:  Since David taxonomy, I don't know -- Daniel, if you'd like to jump in. Daniel is one of the taxonomy and privacy lawyers.</p><p>      VLADECK:  Right. That was not inadvertent.</p><p>      SOLOVE:  Well, I would say like to the -- there's obviously protection of consumers from harm, which I think is important, and a lot then depends on how we define harm. I tend to define harm broadly to also encompass risk, which I think is a very important concept. </p><p>      There's also the broken promises. That it's very important that if a company makes a promise, that it be held to that promise. Otherwise, the entire self-regulatory regime collapses because the privacy policies are meaningless then. So it's nice that the FTC has a backstop to that and enforces.</p><p>      I think there's also an important component to an enforcement regime that I think the FTC can and sometimes has gotten involved in, which is consumer expectations, even if it's a direct promise, consumers have expectations about how their data is going to be handled and used that are often -- and sometimes at variance with what's said in a privacy policy or with what companies do.</p><p>      If you take -- there's been studies about like consumer attitudes about privacy and a vast majority of people agreed with the statement that if a company has a privacy policy, it does not share data with third parties. So there's definitely a lot of misinformation out there. Consumers have incorrect expectations. And the FTC can play a very important role in helping to make sure that faulty consumer expectations aren't exploited.</p><p>      So companies knowing that consumers kind of already have this -- maybe unjustified trust in them don't exploit that trust, that what companies do that start becoming at great variance with the consumer expectations, that those outliers be stopped. The Sears case, I think, is a wonderful example of that where they installed spyware into people's computers.</p><p>      And this was actually disclosed in the fine print in a very lengthy privacy policy. So it was actually there. But it wasn't very salient. It wasn't very noticeable, so most people missed it. And FTC said that it was not sufficiently disclosed and not conspicuous enough. And I think that's great, because what we had is a practice that was very unexpected to consumers that caught a lot off-guard.</p><p>      And so, I think it's very important that consumers can use sites and engage in e-commerce and other commerce and know that their -- what they expect generally is going to be the case. And there aren't going to be unpleasant surprises down the road. And so, I think it's very important that the FTC police that, especially because we know from a lot of studies that a very, very small percentage of people actually read the privacy policies or privacy notices, something like less than 1 percent.</p><p>      So we really are in a world that consumers come in with this baggage, these expectations. And I think we have to play in that world. I know that that's how people are going to make decisions on what -- how to share their data. And there should be some protection from that being exploited.</p><p>      COOPER:  Howard, did you want to jump in? One thing just to -- it may be completely orthogonal to what you're going to say, but maybe it'll be related. It sounds listening to David and Daniel, and I don't know if it's -- to what extent should a privacy regulatory framework -- should we think about privacy in sort of the rights-based framework? Or is it something that needs to be balanced with other values as well? Is it something that can be balanced or is it just a right? And I don't know -- it's something that's kind of I was thinking about it as David and Daniel were talking. And so anyway, Howard, I'll let you speak to that or whatever you want, whatever -</p><p>      BEALES:  I did want to comment a little on the discussion that's gone before it. Firstly, I wanted to take you to task for listing a Nobel Prize winners for the economics of information without listing the guy who founded the field, which was George Stigler, first and foremost. But he was one of my advisors too. </p><p>      But I'll forgive you. I mean I think the attraction to me of the consequences based approach to thinking about consumer privacy, which is what we developed in that time that I was at the commission, was that it makes explicit what ought to be there all the time, which is that particularly in the commercial context, this is a balancing issue.</p><p>      There are tremendous benefits that come from the ability to use information, even if it's an unexpected use of the information. And we don't want to sacrifice those benefits because somebody didn't think to include that in the list of things that might be done with information in the privacy policy because it wasn't thought of at that time, that the privacy policy was written. We didn't know this was a possible use of the data.</p><p>      Those kinds of benefits, we have an enormous number of services that are built on exactly those kinds of secondary uses of information that was collected for a different purpose that may or may not have fit with consumers' expectations.</p><p>      What we want to make sure of is that that information is not being used in ways that are harmful to consumers, that's doing damage to consumers. And that's where privacy regulation and privacy enforcement really ought to focus. If there's not a harm, it's not something that the FTC in particular should be worried about.</p><p>      Now, I also have a reasonably broad concept of harm, perhaps not as broad as some. I certainly think that the things that fit -- the kinds of subjective harms that fit within the traditional privacy torts are the kinds of harms that are actionable privacy harms. But I note that the torts standard in -- virtually all of the privacy torts is highly offensive to a reasonable person. Right? </p><p>      If the intrusion or the putting somebody in a false light is something that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, that's an essential element of the tort, not just any intrusion, not just any false light that might be held -- might be held out. </p><p>      But including those kinds of harms, I make, I think makes complete sense. We've had two mentions of DesignerWare and Aaron's and there's a part of that case that I completely agree with. And that's the turn on the camera part of the case. There's a part of it that I've always found really troubling, and that is, this is a computer that -- when somebody stopped paying, you could activate the software and the computer would call home and tell this company that had rented the computer to somebody who was no longer paying for it where it was.</p><p>      That's really useful. The complaint says -- well, this is location tracking, and location tracking is bad. But the complaint doesn't say why location tracking is bad, and especially when it's every two hours. And the remedy that's in the complaint or in the consent order is, \"Well, if you disclose when you first turn this on and track continuously, that'll comply with the order.\" </p><p>      So to fix tracking every two hours, we track continuously. I don't get what harm we thought we were fixing there, and that's -- it's that harm that really needs to be the focus. If we can't articulate why we think this is a problem, we're not going to be able to adopt sensible and low-cost ways to control that problem. We've got to think first about what's the harm we're trying to prevent.</p><p>      COOPER:  Thanks, Howard. So, after hearing kind of a high-level view of what sort of values we should be concerned about when we're thinking about a privacy program or regulatory framework, maybe it's important now to take stock of actually where we are. So I wanted to turn to Daniel, who as I mentioned before, has written a seminal textbook on this and lots of articles defining and thinking about what privacy is.</p><p>      So Daniel, just kind of help us characterize the current U.S. system of privacy and data security regulation in about five minutes maybe?</p><p>      SOLOVE:  Sure. Well, at the high level, the bird's-eye view. My sophisticated way of synopsis of it is it's a mess. We have a sectorial approach with laws have risen in various economic sectors over a very long span of time. Then you have common law torts that have risen, the private torts. Plus, there's the forgotten breach of confidentiality tort that I'd like to mention too that doesn't require highly offensive.</p><p>      There are all sorts of other common law torts that could apply in these contexts, such as negligence. That's making a resurgence and data breach cases. Then you have various state statutes in the states. You have dozens of federal laws. Not as many recently, but certainly in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, you had a real series of laws that were passed to deal with various privacy issues in various economic sectors. </p><p>      And then you have the FTC, kind of an overarching -- the broadest jurisdiction of any federal agency regulating privacy that regulates most companies, except for some carve-outs. And that's the U.S. approach. And there are inconsistencies in the various laws, some of them are a lot weaker than others. </p><p>      On the stronger side, you have HIPAA, which is very, very broad. It has a broad reach. It follows the data through the chain of its custody. But you also have laws like FERPA that regulate schools, that buying large are kind of -- for lack of a better characterization, a bit of a joke that are not really enforceable. They lack a lot of the features that more recent privacy legislation has. </p><p>      Contrast this to a number of other countries in the world, including especially the EU. They have a comprehensive privacy law baseline of protection, so they can articulate, \"Here are the basic rules of the road that we follow.\" Here in the U.S., it's very hard to articulate, well, how is this particular data protected? </p><p>      We really can't. It depends on -- well, who holds it, if it's held by certain entities and it's regulated by HHS, then it can also be regulated by the FTC, and it depends on new enforces. And it depends on what the sectors are. And one of the challenges with the sectorial approach is that the sectors change. </p><p>      So, in the 1970s and 1980s, what various types of companies are doing in the sectors make sense then. But now, as we see, different companies are jumping into different areas. And so, when we build laws around sectors and -- they don't stay fixed. And now, there's a lot of overlap in company saying, wow, we're regulated by five different agencies and five different bodies of law, and we don't know what to do. There are so much.</p><p>      Plus, and all the different state laws that are overlapping, and it becomes a bit of a nightmare. I'm not sure we can dial this back in the United States. I'm not sure we can kind of go and say, hey, we're going to do the other approach. But I think there are some sensible aspects to the other approach that are quite efficient, and to some extent I think could be particularly business friendlier than the U.S. sectorial approach, which I think the -- a lot of industries were happy with initially because they liked the idea of a law tailored to them or they liked the idea of a law that -- the fact that laws didn't apply to them and they fell through the crevices. </p><p>      But those crevices have been largely -- a lot of them have been plugged up by the FTC which regulates. The other problem too with the U.S. approach is that we get no respect from the rest of the world. We're kind of the Rodney Dangerfield of privacy in the U.S. </p><p>      But I think we have some very effective, some really good laws. I think the FTC has done tremendously effective work. We do have a lot of protection. It's just that it's inconsistent. It's hard to articulate. It's very hard to explain to other countries, especially the EU, how the U.S. system works and how information is protected here. It's so haphazard. </p><p>      So I think the biggest challenge is what do we do going forward when we have so many laws that are locked into antiquated visions of the economy from 30 years ago, and a world that is increasingly been, the leadership role has increasingly been ceded by the U.S. Congress ever since I think around 2000, where we really haven't seen a tremendous amount of legislative activity on privacy. It really has tapered off. I mean, really seeing the states, especially California and the EU take the lead. </p><p>      And I think if you ask most large multinational companies, what privacy law are they focusing on for their compliance efforts? GDPR, the new California law, hardly anyone will say anything about any other U.S. law. Maybe a little bit of HIPAA. FTC, I barely hear whispered these days. Although I think a few years ago, the FTC was spoken about it a little bit more. </p><p>      But increasingly, what we're seeing I think is the companies, and these are U.S. companies, not really looking to the law here as to what they're doing and how they're building their privacy programs and practices. So, that's where we are. And I think the big question is what should we do in the U.S. for what's the next step. </p><p>      Do we kind of say, hey, we'll just let the -- be regulated by Europe and California or will we have meaningful regulation at the federal level that reflects the balances and approaches that the U.S. would like to have.</p><p>      COOPER:  Well, thanks, Daniel. I'd like to invite anyone to react to that, and also kind of throw out there -- it seems as you -- when you think about the landscape of the U.S. privacy regime, it seems to be a mixture of ex-ante, sort of an ex-ante regulation with notice and choice in some areas, you know, HIPAA, COPPA maybe. </p><p>      But then we also see -- we also see enforcement, you know, private and the FTC. I mean, what are the pros and cons in -- of those approaches, and what might be, you know, you think about whether -- there should be a mixture, we should hew to one, or another, or it makes sense to kind of mix it up, and in some ways the way that we have here in the U.S. So, throw that out to anyone as -- well...</p><p>      VLADECK:  Let me comment on that briefly, because, you know, until at least a few years ago, the difference between the EU and the United States was, we did a lot of enforcement, but we had this patchwork, this crazy patchwork of laws. On the other hand, in the EU, they had even before the GDPR they had a general regulation which was much more comprehensive than any U.S. privacy law but there was almost no enforcement. </p><p>      And some scholars have done a lot of work looking at sort of privacy on the ground both in the United States and in the EU, and they found that the privacy commitments in the EU were met only to the extent that there was a real enforcement or culture of compliance, which left out large swathes of the EU</p><p>      And so, I think that somewhere in the middle with the desired outcome, but strict rules without enforcement, at least according to the studies that have been done, didn't work all that well in the EU, and I think that was one of the major driving forces for enacting the GDPR and to basically base the new system on commitments of compliance and enforcement. And it will be interesting to see the extent to which the new GDPR is enforced by the data protection authorities in the EU who are not used to doing FTC-like enforcement cases. </p><p>      COOPER:  Anyone else like to jump in on the ex-ante versus ex-post question or in -- anything? </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I guess -- oh. Go ahead. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  I was going to say, well, I, you know, I agree that regulation, very -- if there's clear regulation that says, like the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Congress drew the lines there and the FTC implements and enforces it. </p><p>      But one of the things that I had -- I think has been a real strength of the FTC's approach has been its case by case enforcement, maybe a little less predictable in some ways, but it trades that from great flexibility, right? So, a focus on harm in case by case enforcement reduces the need for you to have, predict the future to design some overarching regulation that foresees all innovations, Howard mentioned this, and I think we all would agree consumers have got enormous benefits from a lot of these technologies. </p><p>      And consumers have gotten a lot of free content, and they've gotten a lot of information at their fingertips, as you mentioned, and so that doesn't mean like, well, anything goes, but I think we need to be careful about coming up with a system that is too regulatory, because it can't predict what the new innovation's going to be and perhaps it's going prevent it from happening. </p><p>      COOPER:  OK. </p><p>      BEALES:  Yes, I just to -- just to pick up a little on the ex-ante versus ex-post problem, I think part of the -- I put -- I think part of the problem with the ex-ante regulation is that the we have now, and particularly the approaches that are embodied in the GDPR and in the California statute are really based on a premise that won't work. That people are going to read privacy policies and pay attention to these notices about what's going to be done with the information and make choices based on that. </p><p>      And Dan says, and I think he's right, nobody reads privacy policies, it's probably a good thing because there's a study out of Carnegie Mellon that said that if people actually did read their online privacy policies, the opportunity cost to the U.S. economy would be $787 billion. </p><p>      It's just out of all proportion to what might be at stake in commercial privacy decisions. And with the ex-ante approach that difficult, if you will, the focus ex-post on where do -- where have things gone wrong that need to be fixed, and what can we do to keep them from happening again, seems like a much more sensible way to approach the problems. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Howard, I just wanted to weigh in a little bit on your point about people not reading privacy policies. I agree, probably the average consumer doesn't, but we have academics in the U.S., I bet Daniel reads the privacy policies, I bet David reads privacy policies, and academics, and consumer groups, consumer organizations, and competitors. </p><p>      COOPER:  I don't read them. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Right. So, James doesn't, I'm just kidding, but...</p><p>      COOPER:  Well, you said academics, I just want to make sure that you know that. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Well, I -- oh, academics other than James. But there -- I think there are mechanisms for if there is a problematic term in a privacy policy for it to get noticed and surfaced, and that's one of the things we've seen I think with social media that when something is discovered, that people don't like, that news get out there pretty quick. </p><p>      BEALES:  Well, I just, you know, I -- if that's the goal, then that points to a very different kind of a privacy policy, because you don't want something that's understandable to consumers, you want something that is understandable to geeks and competitors, who can figure out whether there's something wrong going here. </p><p>      That's sort of not where we're headed, it's not where the Europeans are headed, it's not where California is headed, we want simple privacy policies that anyone can understand that tell you nothing, and mostly aren't read. I mean, no doubt, some people read them. </p><p>      SOLOVE:  A while ago I wrote a piece about privacy self-management, which is this idea that people manage their own privacy by reading these policies and making choices. I think this is a flawed approach, not just because people don't read privacy policies, and also I think the point that there's this tension, privacy policies are useful to regulators and advocates, and academics and others who can read them carefully, and they get a lot of information, but the average consumer really can't get all that. </p><p>      So there's a tension, you almost need two different things, which is what, you know, Paul Schwartz and I have proposed in a -- in our ALI project, which is a transparency statement for the regulators and then something simpler for the consumers. </p><p>      But as a consumer, reading the privacy policies is relatively meaningless, I don't -- I don't read them because it's too many, and the amount of entities I do business with, and the sites I visit, you know, hundreds, thousands, I don't have time, and then the choices I think, do I share this piece of information on Facebook? I don't know. </p><p>      The implications for privacy depend on how that information is combined and aggregated with other information over time, and how that information might line up, and what someone might do with something, and what algorithms someone might create five years from now, and a whole litany of things that I can't even figure out, so I really can't make the judgment as a privacy expert on exactly what the implications and costs and benefits to me, especially the costs over time are going to be for me to release a certain piece of data. </p><p>      So, it's very, very difficult, and now multiply that by a thousand, and have to make that decision all the time, just really, really hard to do for the consumer. So, I'm just not sure that that approach, it's great if there's like one company that you actually do business with, I mean, only on Facebook. But it's not, I'm on all the sites, like the professors who, you know, I give an amount of homework every night, and I think like, hey, it's reasonable for my students to read 30 pages a night, but what if they have 10 professors and each assign 30 pages? </p><p>      And that's what the companies are doing, every company thinks, hey, you know, they can pay attention, we think this is a great mechanism, yeah, multiply it, it doesn't scale, that's the problem. And the consumer, if you say, hey, we protect your data with reasonable data security, well, what's that? As a consumer, I can -- how do I assess your security? How do I know how prepared your employees are to not be phished? I can't -- how do I know what kind of encryption you're going to use, and all these other things? </p><p>      I can't really make an informed the assessment, which is why, you know, we need an agency like the FTC to be looking out for people, just like when, you know, I would travel abroad, and the taxi fares were -- they didn't have a meter, and I didn't know what the right fare was, and they would just say like it's X whatever, and I had to trust them or make some, I didn't know, it's nice to know that someone's looking out for me. And there's a meter in someone's thought of what the right there is going to be, and I don't have to worry about someone cheating me. </p><p>      Or I can pick up a jug of milk and know that I can drink it, and I'm not going to be poisoned. They don't have to do research, imagine that, you know, you didn't have that food safety and actually have to go online and research like the safety conditions that each farm to figure out that you buy food from there. I just like to know like I pick up a product in the supermarket, it's safe. And I think we want the same thing for privacy. </p><p>      VLADECK:  It's amazing how whenever you use the phrase privacy policy, everybody watches into a diatribe. So, I'm going to take a minute and launch into my own. One is, they're not privacy policies, you know, the original sin was calling them something that they're not. None of them really deal with privacy, they deal with data daily use. And part of the problem is they misnamed. </p><p>      The other problem, of course, and this gets back to the question that James started with, the difference between ex-ante regulation and something else, if you have a regulatory regime that is clear, so you know that everything you do on the internet is safe, or at least you have that promise, even if it's not enforceable, then the privacy policy where the data use statement becomes less important. </p><p>      And part of the problem that we have and the FTC has done a lot of work on simplified notice and Dan and the ALI have done a lot of work in trying to figure out a better system for this. But these are really notice systems, and they need to be simplified, many of them are written by lawyers, so they're bound to be incomprehensible. And they're often designed to be incomprehensible. So this is an issue then that plagues us and I just, don't think we've collectively figured out a way to escape it. </p><p>      BEALES:  I think actually Mick Jagger had the answer to what's been happening here, in 1964, the technology was a little different but he said, the man comes on the radio, like, I said the technology is a little different, telling me more and more about some useless information supposed to fire my imagination. What happens, I can't get no satisfaction. </p><p>      VLADECK:  There we go. </p><p>      COOPER:  Nice. All right. So, David, well, I'll -- with that segue, thank you, Howard. To our, you know, what or now we've kind of set the stage for where we are in the U.S., what do you see is any of the problems, because the -- again, the headline picture of this, and the headline of this, this panel supposed to think about, what or kind of rethinking the current privacy data security regime, what are -- what are some of the problems, if any of the current status quo, are there any harms that you don't think are being addressed? Is there inefficient enforcement, either over-deterrence, under-deterrence? So what do you think, David?</p><p>      VLADECK:  So, let me just use a few examples, because we've, time does not permit me to go through the concerns that I have. But one is, I don't think we have effective tools to really understand what's going on with big data, let alone to regulate it sensibly. So, we all know the data collection is now ubiquitous, we bring it into our own homes through always on devices or sensors of the Internet of Things. We know that this data is being collected, but our laws really don't have any restraint on the sale or renting of this data. </p><p>      We know it moves, we know it has a substantial economic value, but we don't have any real information on the velocity or volume of this kind of data aggregation. So, that presents risks. Paul Ohm, one of my colleagues both at the FTC and here, wrote an article ten years ago, in which he sort of cast in dystopian light what would he called the database of ruin. Well, we don't know yet whether there are these kinds of enormous databases, but there's nothing in U.S. law that really restrains that development. </p><p>      And these kind of databases pose risks to consumers, there's the risk of data breach, after all these would be honeypots, they'd be a magnet for identity thieves, and we know identity theft is still rampant. So, one question that the FTC I think is going to have to grapple with is sort of where is this data, what's it being used for, how is it being transmitted to whom, and for what purpose? So, that is one issue that I think the commission is going to have to grapple with going forward. </p><p>      Second, the rapid, the rapid initiation of algorithmic decision making in the marketplace. Now, I said this morning, I'm not a fan of human decision making. You know, we generally don't do such a great job, and machines may help. But for regulators, these kinds of decisions are very difficult to oversee, they're not transparent, machine learning algorithms are impossible to interrogate, you can't put them under oath. It's hard to root out disparate treatment based on factors that are impermissible, age, gender, race, things like that. You know, nor is there necessarily due process at the end of the -- at the end of the decision making chain. </p><p>      And so, I know the agency's already done a fair amount of work on this, but this is an issue that I think demands greater attention, because I do think it poses enormous risks to those who come out on the bottom, in terms of these kinds of decision making. </p><p>      In terms of enforcement, my concerns are not really with over-enforcement, because the agency resources are too scarce for that. Indeed, when I was the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, I don't know whether Howard had the same concern, but I spent a lot of my time doing triage, deciding which cases to bring and which cases not to bring, even though many of those cases in the latter category were meritorious and we should have brought them if we could have. </p><p>      So I don't think that's the problem. I do think they are enforcement challenges. So one is, how do you enforce against an industry like the mobile app industry, which is highly diffuse, diverse industry, thousands and thousands of app developers, many of whom either don't really know what the law requires, or just don't really care. </p><p>      So the New York Times did a story yesterday about COPPA violations, violations of the Children Online Privacy Protection Act by app developers that were tracking kids 12 and under without explicit parental permission. Sure, the FTC could, you know, bring 20 or 30 enforcement actions against this kind of industry. But it's not at all clear to me that you get any of the kind of deterrent value that you really need. </p><p>      So one question is, with respect to these kind of diffuse industries, how do you make them comply with the law? That's one problem. Another is, we have to figure out to what extent machine learning decision making tools are staying within the statutory guidelines. That is an enforcement problem. </p><p>      And last, we have a lot of companies under order, and order violations are hard for the agency to detect and to deal with, simply because of the high volume of companies under order, that's a serious enforcement matter. I mean, for a company to violate an FTC order undermines the ability of the agency to do its work, it undermines the deterrent value of consent decrees or enforcement cases. And I think my -- the new -- sort of the new management at the FTC is going to have to grapple with that. There are many others, but I'll stop there. </p><p>      COOPER:  Yes, anyone else like to weigh in? </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Oh, one thing, building on what David said, I want to -- I agree that one of the challenges for the approach that we have, and when I talked about privacy policies it was not certainly to say privacy policies are it and take care of everything, it's just that I don't think they are as totally is useless as some other people seem to think they are. </p><p>      But the other problem is these kinds of harms that we, you know, you may have a lot of little bits of data that weren't sensitive, that weren't even person identifiable when they were collected. But through these new tools, they can be assembled into a more complete mosaic and identified to a certain person. And then I think the question there is, is there a harm, is there a risk there? And that is where I think we need to start thinking, how do we address that? </p><p>      Because a lot of those uses may be great, they may be very beneficial, we don't want to stop those, but for the harmful ones. And if we look at something like the -- going back to the pre-internet days, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it was trying to get at those kinds of issues, to allow some kind of balancing and use of this data, but to allow consumers to know if it was being used in a way that disadvantaged them in connection with an important decision like employment or insurance or some other -- some other ones blend in. And then gave them insight into what it was and the right of correction. </p><p>      So I think that is where we see need to start thinking about like a kind of a risk -- a risk based approach, because I don't think we can necessarily foresee all the uses, I'm a little concerned about the data use specification requirements, because as Howard said, there may be great uses down the road that consumers would like. But they still need to be protected from some of these, you know, new abilities to use, these little bits of data in a new -- in a new way. </p><p>      BEALES:  But that, you know, I don't know why the -- I don't know why the more complete mosaic is itself a problem, I mean, the one -- the one part of that, there clearly is a problem is if the government to get that, but that -- there's another tool to control that problem. And it's the one we ought to use and not worry about the possibility that this might be put together. </p><p>      I want to say two things about, I think big data is a really interesting question, and it does -- there are certainly potential costs there, but there's also been big benefits, I mean, that's where our fraud control tools come from, is data aggregations, often data that was collected for a different purpose that's put together in an algorithm that predicts the likelihood that a particular person is really who they say they are. </p><p>      And if it weren't for those tools, there'd be a whole lot more identity theft than there is which is way too much. But that's a big data I think, you can't do that with little pieces of data one at a time, you got to aggregate the data in order to get a more comprehensive picture. </p><p>      The other thing I wanted to say about algorithms which raise some potentially interesting questions. But I think the algorithms that ought to be of concern are the ones where the user of the algorithm doesn't face the costs of mistakes, because an algorithm is just basically a way to classify. You're a good risk, you're a bad risk, you're a good prospect, you're a bad prospect. </p><p>      There is a really interesting example of Reuters, which wants to get scoops on international news, and it does that in part by following tweets, but there's a lot of bogus tweets. And so they built an algorithm to figure out whether this was likely a real story that they should follow up on or a bunch of fake tweets that they should ignore. </p><p>      They face the costs of both mistakes, right? They're going to miss a story if they misclassify these tweets as false tweets and ignore it, they're going to waste resources if they misclassify these tweets as true and pursue it and they're false. So, they know what the tradeoff is, they know what the costs are of both kinds of mistakes, there's no reason to think they make the wrong tradeoff. </p><p>      And I think that's true of a lot of marketing applications where if I screen out \"bad prospects,\" I'm turning away business. I don't want to do that by mistake. I want to turn it away if it's bad business, but I don't want to turn it away if it really is good business. So, there's some fairly strong incentives within the system to make sure the algorithm works well. Where you don't have those incentives is where somebody using the algorithm only pays part of the costs and the rest of the costs are shifted to somebody else. </p><p>      SOLOVE:  What, suppose with the algorithms, I think there's a lot of concerns, because suppose especially a predictive algorithm, suppose the hotel chains, like, you know, get together or create an algorithm for determining when a particular hotel guest is going to damage the hotel room or treat the hotel room badly or do misconduct in a hotel room. And they basically come up with the algorithm and it comes up and says that you're one of those people, and starts...you're booked. </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes. </p><p>      SOLOVE:  Along with Mick Jagger too. And, you know, you started not be able to get, rent hotel rooms or suddenly you're charged more. And what are your rights there? Because you're targeted in a predictive sense, it's like well, hey, I never did any damage. Well, we're not saying you did, the algorithm's just saying that we think there's a high probability that you might. So the algorithm -- there's something wrong with the algorithm, it's just taking into account factors, and, hey, it might actually be true, but you haven't done it. Should people have rights to say just because it says I'm likely to, how do I disprove that? </p><p>      VLADECK:  Or how do you even know it? </p><p>      SOLOVE:  Exactly, how do you know it? How do you disapprove it? How do you argue with the prediction? So the FBI says, our algorithms says you're going to commit terrorism, we won't let you the plane and so how do I prove it? </p><p>      It's like, well, live your life and die. And then if you die and you haven't terrorism, then we'll take you off the list because we know you didn't do it. The algorithm was wrong. But there has to be something to say like who regulates, what are the concerns with the incorrect thing. How much transparency do we have? How can it be used? What about people's rights to challenge it and say the prediction is wrong and either inaccurate. I mean how do we -- but to just kind of leave it to industry to do whatever they want without looking to the harms that consumers might suffer from this I think is something that we definitely don't want to do. </p><p>      We need this, why I think is very important that if we look into this and have good regulation on it. </p><p>      VLADECK:  Yes. Let me push back a little on Howard's point. And maybe that Reuters bears the risks on both sides of this. But in consumer finance or creditworthiness or anything else, the consumer who is misclassified by the algorithm bears the risk, may not be informed and there are no shortage of stories that have been publicly discussed where people have been disadvantaged based on correlations, not on their actuals. </p><p>      So, American Express had a serious problem because it was reducing the credit limits for black customers who went to certain kinds of black stores that were deemed to be indicative of a credit risk. And when that became public, their answer was we screwed up but we relied essentially on an algorithm. And so, again, I know I'm not trying to suggest that we -- that machine learning can't help us make better decisions. </p><p>      But there needs to be both some transparency and some due process here, particularly where it's not the company that bears both sides of the risks.</p><p>      BEALES:  Well, I mean I think in the financial transaction, it often is a company that bears both sides of the risk, because they're turning away business that would be profitable business and they -- there's an incentive to not do that. I mean, we can argue whether it's the perfect incentive or not. I think the other thing that we have to recognize and, is human decision-makers have all those same biases. </p><p>      VLADECK:  Right. </p><p>      BEALES:  And they're every bit that's hard to tease out. They are probably less transparent than algorithms. And I know when I was at the FTC in the 1980s, in the early 1980s, and we were bringing a lot of equal credit opportunity cases, every time we looked at a judgment creditor, right? The guy who sits down and looks at the applicant across the table and say, \"You look honest. I'll loan you money.\" There was discrimination. It varied whether it was women or race or what kind of discrimination, but there was discrimination. </p><p>      Credits scoring guys didn't have that problem. Credit scoring reduced the discrimination problems that were inherent in judgmental creditors. And that's the potential gain from algorithmic decisions. More data is usually better because it can challenge your preconceptions about what's going on and what's the right answer here. </p><p>      SOLOVE:  Sometimes. I mean I think that's true sometimes. But sometimes algorithms are no better than the humans that design them and there are hidden biases that can crop up in algorithms. </p><p>      Not just the people who design them, in fact, the data being inputted into them. If you input data that is infected with human biases into algorithms, the algorithm spits out a data that also is infected as well. </p><p>      So there's a lot of concerns all around, absolutely, algorithms can improve human judgment. Absolutely, human judgment can be problematic. But I do think that the cost of let's say for a business, just say, hey, I don't want this business, I'm going to turn a consumer away is not enough. It's not the same level of harm to the consumer. </p><p>      Because the business can say on the aggregate we just think certain types of consumers are just not very profitable for us. So who cares if we don't -- if we lose a little bit of business, we ultimately gain. </p><p>      For those consumers who can't have access to credit, who can't get a loan, it's a much, much bigger deal and a much, much bigger cost. So I actually don't think it's -- the market would always work itself out because I think that businesses might be, make a good economic decision. Hey, if we do this, yes, we lose a little business but we also lose some risk but that doesn't always look the same way on the consumer side. </p><p>      COOPER:  Maureen, do you want to... </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Yes, I wanted to weigh in on this. I do think that there is the mechanism of the market, where if one company has a poorly designed algorithm, and it is leaving good business on the table, someone else has an incentive to try to capture that. </p><p>      And that's one of the things I think we are seeing in the lending area. There are finer distinctions being made with better targeting tools that allow lending to occur at better rates than really going by the rough calculation of a credit score, that you kind of fall on this side of the line or that side of the line. </p><p>      So, I want to certainly take into account the fact that there are competitive pressures to have a better algorithm to expand your business. </p><p>      COOPER:  Just to kind of follow up. It seems that a lot of this discussion is about the classifications obviously, to come out of algorithms. Is Section 5 the right way to address that? </p><p>      I mean, when we think about Section 5 would it be, with at least three out of the four of you here on the table have been in the position of an enforcer and is this the -- leaving aside whatever statutory or regulatory authority Congress has given the FTC to enforce discriminatory, Is Section 5 should it be, address an algorithm unfairly classify someone as being getting subprime loans for instance. Is that stretching Section 5 beyond where you think it should go? Or is that the right place for Section 5 to be or should it, instead should it be Congress making cuts of what is unfair discrimination? </p><p>      BEALES:  It's beyond where I think Section 5 should go. It is the -- obviously, the FTC has a role in places where Congress has given it a role like equal credit opportunity. </p><p>      COOPER:  Right, yes. </p><p>      BEALES:  Where it enforces and that is -- it's reasonable and appropriate for them to do that. That's what it should do. But to look for discrimination even of the same sort in other places is a whole different set of considerations than what the commission knows about and has expertise in. </p><p>      In one of the proposals that was kicking around at the time of the Unfairness Policy Statement was, well, maybe we should use Section 5 to say boards of directors should be more representative. </p><p>      Elizabeth Warren, call your office. And that was the kind of thing that the commission and Congress were trying to get away from, and that's why the subjective kinds of values I think is something that the Unfairness Statement says in general, we can't do that. And even if it's something that we might do, it's probably more appropriate for a different agency to do it. </p><p>      COOPER:  David? </p><p>      VLADECK:  I have a slightly different answer. I agree with Howard that this kind of issue would rise mostly under ECOA or FCRA or some of the other statutes the agency enforces. But I think to the extent that there is some intentionality here, then it would fit under the unfairness doctrine. </p><p>      That is if there was reason for the designers or the users of the algorithm to know that it somehow either inadvertently or because of the training data, systematically excluded X people based on gender or one of the suspect (ph) classes, I think the agency would have would have an unfairness case. But I think the burden on the agency in the case like that would be very high. </p><p>      COOPER:  I imagine you probably don't want to weigh on it, so. The... </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  It's been covered. </p><p>      COOPER:  Yes. It has been covered adequately. Just, while we're on this about and you had raised something, David, I think it's interesting about when we -- early on in your earlier response thinking about some of the problems. </p><p>      Do you think that -- and really both David and Howard's people enforced and sat there and looked at the complaint recommendations and thought about what relief you should get. Do you think the FTC, its 13(b), equitable powers, I mean do you think it's hamstrung strong at all in its ability to get adequate relief in privacy cases? </p><p>      Or do you think there should be -- I realize the commission I think on a bipartisan basis has been on record and saying that in data security cases civil penalties authority would be good and I could be wrong, but I think that's right. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  That's right. </p><p>      COOPER:  But leaving aside that, I mean do you think that in privacy enforcement, do you think some -- there needs to be a bigger stick than what we have now, which it seems in many cases when these are apps that are free and collect data, it may be very difficult to get an equitable relief under 13(b). </p><p>      VLADECK:  Yes. I mean I do think that, I mean, in my view and I don't think this is the commission's view is that there ought to be original fining authority under 13(b). And take Ashley Madison, I mean, there's no way to do meaningful redress there. </p><p>      Injunctive relief is not going to give much solace to peoples whose marriages ended or whose spouse committed suicide. So I do wonder about sort of the ability of the agency to forge any kind of effective remedy in those cases. </p><p>      I also think that if you look back at some of the cases that we brought earlier on in -- during the Leibowitz era, I think that a civil penalty for example against Google or Facebook initially would have had a deterrent value. </p><p>Facebook is currently under investigation again. Google, it took only two years before it violated the consent decree. I do think there ought to be initial fining authority under 13(b). I think the commission would have to use it carefully, particularly where other remedies were just simply inadequate. </p><p>      But I do think 13(b) cases ought to be -- I think civil penalties ought to be available in these cases. </p><p>      COOPER:  Howard, I don't know if you want to weigh in on that or ... </p><p>      BEALES:  Sure, yes -- no, I don't like the idea of civil penalties, I like -- and especially in an area like privacy, I like the original scheme of the FTC Act that was the -- essentially the one bite at the apple because the precise meaning of unfair and deceptive is not that clear. </p><p>      And the way the act was set up, the commission could get an order and if you violated the order, you were subject to civil penalties for that. But civil penalties sort of presume a really clear standard I think of what's a violation and what's not. </p><p>      And that's not so clear in a lot of privacy areas. I think it is a lot clearer in data security. I do think civil penalties there make a lot more sense. But I think in a lot of privacy and some other areas, I think it's not -- I think monetary relief is not appropriate. </p><p>      COOPER:  All right. So, Howard, I -- while I have you -- now turning to kind of how we -- or seeing a shift, we look at the GDP or some changes in the landscape of privacy regulation around the world and throughout the United States. We see GDPR, California, the FCC privacy rules is now at in funk. They all seem to be taking a -- like more of a FIPPs-based approach, a notice and consent, deletion rights, correction rights. </p><p>      We see in the GDPR and California. On the other hand, we have the FTC which has been really based on demonstrating likely consumer harms or deception. And this tees off a little bit. We've discussed a little of this in the ex-ante versus ex-post discussion. </p><p>      But do you have any thoughts on why you think we've seen a trend towards this at least in recent evolution, of these newer privacy schemes, away from a harm-based and more toward a consent-based. </p><p>      BEALES:  Well, I think two things. One is and I think this remains true. There's a remarkable unwillingness to articulate what are the harms we're worried about, or inability to articulate what are the harms we're worried about. </p><p>      And if you can't do that then you can't -- then it's hard to do a harm-based approach, especially as an across the board regulation that applies to absolutely everything. You've got to think through the harms that you're trying to prevent first. And there's been to me a remarkable unwillingness to do that. </p><p>      Second, I think the FTC in the last few years has -- it certainly hasn't abandoned worrying about consequences, but it's also moved towards a more what I would call FIPPs-plus in its enforcement actions. I mean the VIZIO case is a really good -- a good example. </p><p>      There is just no way to tell a story about that case that doesn't come down to notice and choice. People were surprised to learn, did it violate their expectations to learn that their internet connected TV was connected to the internet? </p><p>      Really? And did they think that it was making recommendations for the next thing they should watch without knowing what they had been watching in the past. Really? </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  It didn't make recommendations, Howard. It said that's what it was collecting the data for. </p><p>      COOPER:  But it didn't make recommendations. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  But it didn't make the recommendation. </p><p>      BEALES:  Well, that's -- the complaint doesn't charge the failure to make recommendations. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  No. But it charges that if it's collecting the data and sharing it. </p><p>      BEALES:  For ratings purposes. This was a completely inaccurate use -- innocuous use. There's no harm there at all. No harm there at all. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Wait, wait... </p><p>      BEALES:  People didn't know, it violated their expectations. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  But it was also... </p><p>      BEALES:  Why is that there? </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  It was also collecting data like even if you weren't watching something streaming, you were watching a DVD or something. It was collecting and reporting that this television watched this DVD. That's not a ratings. </p><p>      BEALES:  Well, and again what's the -- I mean it is a rating purpose because it's how are people spending their time with the set which is what you, well, I mean, it's what the television rating services are busy measuring is how much time -- or is this set on that's what the boxtop is recording. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  But that's not what was being collected. </p><p>      VLADECK:  Right. </p><p>      BEALES:  But this is complementary to that data. It is -- it would help you... </p><p>      VLADECK:  Well, in addition to that data. </p><p>      BEALES:  Yes. Well, this is competition for Nielsen, right? It's got a box that measures what the TV is on and what channel is it tuned to. And that's about it. It's additional information about whether people are actually watching a TV show on the channel that it's tuned to or watching something else. I mean there's -- you can say it was unexpected but I don't know why it's bad. </p><p>      SOLOVE:  Well, this is a lot of dispute about harm. This is one of the problems when it comes to harm is that you say, well, that harm is never articulated. Well, maybe the harms that you would think what harm is not articulated. I mean there are harms in some of these cases that don't necessarily mean that someone is out financially or their reputation is ruined. </p><p>      And part of it is just consumer trust, that you buy a product. You think something is going to be used in a certain way and suddenly you discover, well, oh, all of this other stuff is going on. </p><p>      And that doesn't just hurt the consumers. It also hurts other industry. People start to not trust it. Well, gee, I don't want to buy the nest things because they're going to do something with my data. I don't want to buy a Google home. </p><p>      I don't want to go and use these new technologies because they are not -- I can't trust what they're going to do. Nothing they say, and it could be a different company that if consumers start losing faith that what's told to them, what they expect is not what they expect. All these products they're going to start to say why do I want to start bringing this stuff into my home when it seems like that everybody, the common story is they're doing something else with it that I didn't expect. </p><p>      And that hurts other companies. It undermines the companies that are doing the right thing and are saying what they're doing with it and then doing that. And then if they want to use it for something else, tell people. Try to get their consent. </p><p>      VLADECK:  (inaudible) problem. This is why we have the Video Privacy Protection Act because someone went to -- they used to have stores where you could rent videos. </p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  (inaudible) video. </p><p>      VLADECK:  And they got list of what -- and everyone was outraged because who knows whether he was sitting there at night watching Disney shows or porn. </p><p>      BEALES:  But VIZIO says, to me the VIZIO case seems to say the store can't keep the record. </p><p>      VLADECK:  No. </p><p>      BEALES:  That seems crazy. They're not publishing. They're not publishing this. </p><p>      VLADECK:  It's a TV set. It's not your content provider. </p><p>      BEALES:  Let me, let me -- yes. </p><p>      VLADECK:  It's not your content provider. It's a TV set. It's like a radio. It's not a content provider. It's, and what VIZIO was doing is keeping an account of what you watch and selling it not just, with no restraint on selling it and that's why, that's... </p><p>      BEALES:  But they're selling it -- selling it anonymized in aggregate. </p><p>      VLADECK:  Well, OK. That's why we have a Video Privacy Protection Act because Congress... </p><p>      BEALES:  No, there's nothing in the Video Privacy Protection Act that would keep the store from reporting the aggregate rentals by title. </p><p>      VLADECK:  That's true. </p><p>      BEALES:  That's what VIZIO wanted to do with this data, was the stuff by title. But I just wanted to say if we think about the problem the way Daniel just characterized it, then I think it's a problem that has no solution. I mean there are going to be -- this is an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today that I didn't read closely about 5G and why it's important to be first that predicted among other things, we're going to have internet connected tennis shoes. OK? </p><p>      Now, imagine having to read the privacy policy for your shoes and your light bulb and everybody else. If we -- there are going to be things that happen in this new world that consumers will not know about, right? </p><p>      Their cars will do things now that they don't understand how it happens or that it happens. If the goal is for consumers to understand at a technical level what's going on and how all the information is being used, we're not going to get there, guys. Let's think about what's second best. </p><p>      SOLOVE:  Well, I think the consumer -- I totally agree with that point, consumers aren't really going to understand the technical thing, that's why I think the FTC plays a great role here as a backstop to say, \"Look, someone's got your back.\" If the uses are going to start to get so far afield, so unexpected, we're going to stop that. We're going to keep that in check. And I think that it shouldn't be like OK, wow, you're going to be totally ruined, that that shouldn't be the standard or else then I think it should just be obviously, if there is a small variation in use and it's very innocuous, it's not a big deal. I don't think we should go after trivial things. </p><p>      But I think like significant variances in use aren't totally trivial. And it's not like it's impossible, and you can also look at circumstances, how hard would it have been just to try to shape expectations a bit better about what this product is going to do. </p><p>      Companies should have an -- some kind of an obligation not to just hide the ball and secretly do things. Not saying it has to be in a fine print of a privacy policy, but the more people understand a little bit about like, OK, what are these new products doing and what are the consequences, it's an education that needs to happen as we make these changes. And it's not happening because there's no incentive to do it. So like, great, I can get away with just doing it on the sly and no one is going to come after me. </p><p>      BEALES:  I think the important backstop though is not that there's something that I know there's nothing surprising happening with my data, because I'm sorry, whatever your data is there's something that would surprise you that's happening with it almost for sure. And even if you're quite sophisticated about what's being done with information and how it's being used, that's probably true. </p><p>      The question should be is there something that's being done with that data that's creating a problem? But the mere fact that I didn't know it was there is not the problem. </p><p>      COOPER:  Well, now that Daniel and Howard agree on the role of consumer expectations in privacy, great, that we solved that problem. </p><p>      I want to -- we are going to -- I want to make sure we have time for some of the questions we got, but I want to turn back to David and in my introductory remarks I kind of posited that we're at an inflection point, that there is something out there seems to be at least have a lot of people talking or suggesting that we need to rethink privacy here in the U.S., maybe moving us closer to the EU, we see this in California. </p><p>      So, I -- to David, do you think that the pressure for national and international conformity is going to drive federal privacy law closer to these other models whether we like it or not? </p><p>      VLADECK:  I think that -- well, first of all, I think that the California -- the enactment of the California statute and the, sort of the slow implementation of it, deliberately slow implementation has created an interest in many other states to see if they can replicate what California has done. </p><p>      And so, I don't think that Congress is going to immediately race to enact federal privacy legislation, but many of the most important statutes that we have the environmental protection laws, the occupational safety and health laws, these were all enacted basically in response to an emerging -- emergement of state law. </p><p>      And so, my guess is that unless the business interests that are unhappy with the California law succeed in either scuttling it back in the California legislature, or attacking it successfully in court, you'll see other states moving to adopt a regime based on the California statute, which is to some extent based on the GDPR. And so, the other force that is very much at work in the privacy lawyers in this, either here or watching this on the web, they know this because they spent the last six months advising clients nonstop, compliance with the GDPR. </p><p>      So I do think it's going to have an influence on United States. I think that that's problematic in and of itself. I think there are many laudable goals in the GDPR. I think for the United States to adopt that kind of approach would be very difficult. I mean we are not based on a code system of laws. And the GDPR reads a little like Napoleonic Codes updated. </p><p>      So I think there is some friction in the joints, but I do think that particularly California has got 37 million people. It's the fifth largest economy in the world. It is the locus for much of the development of the tech community. And I think it's going to be highly influential. And I think the FTC has to sort of be very conscious about what's going to take place as a result. </p><p>      And I do think that Congress has basically made itself irrelevant in this debate. And that may be a good thing.</p><p>      COOPER:  Howard? </p><p>      BEALES:  I agree with that. I would point to a slightly different example of what I actually think is probably the most likely outcome. There's a lot of -- and California is big enough to sort of drive things substantively. </p><p>      It turns out, so is Vermont. Vermont passed a law requiring labeling of anything that had genetically modified organisms. That provoked industry support for a preemptive federal law that says you've got to label if it's got genetically modified ingredients. But you can label by a QR code that people can scan and go to a website to figure out whether it's genetically modified or not. </p><p>      Now, it is -- there will be pressure for preemptive federal legislation. What that federal legislation will look like is not so clear. But I think there will be that pressure. </p><p>      SOLOVE:  In the early days of breach notification, I remember I testified before Congress right after the ChoicePoint breach, this is 2005. And there was interest, very strong interest in Congress, look, all these states are starting to pass breach notification and industry was all behind it. We have to comply with all these different standards and this is going to be very complicated and expensive and, you know, we really need some federal pre-emptive law. There was even a couple of bills kicking around. Nothing happened.</p><p>      So I have very little faith that this Congress really can -- can pass a law let along tie its shoes. So I think that it -- it really -- I'm not expecting, even though I think that some of these laws could benefit consumers and benefit industry to have some in these areas, I just don't think it's likely. And so I think, you know, Congress just will have not have the role unless it somehow gets it act together. Really won't.</p><p>      I mean, the most significant privacy legal change that was passed was passed as part of Obama Care. It was the HITECH Act's updating of HIPAA and passing the notification rule and -- and that's really the big accomplishment for Congress in the last, you know, since 2000 really. Not much has gone on.</p><p>      So yeah, I don't hold out much hope, so I think it's going to be what it is and I think there's some problems with that approach, when we're going to have a lot of different varying state legislation on privacy, breach notification's at least something that's more, you know, focused on one thing, you have variances. And all the different -- you know, all sorts of different laws like California's with different variations is really going to be a big nightmare for industry to comply with and I don't necessarily think that's a good thing.</p><p>      BEALES:  I will say when I started at the FTC in 2001, everybody said the Internet legislation and privacy legislation is going to pass right away and you guys better get behind it, but well.</p><p>      VLADECK:  Well, we said that at the beginning of the Obama Administration too.</p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Well, I was just going to point out that Congress isn't the, and the FTC aren't the only actors in this drama or the states. And so NTIA, and NIST and the Department of Commerce and the White House are all considering paths forward, do we look at some sort of approach that would allow more of a uniform privacy framework to be put in place. So I would encourage people to pay attention to that process as well.</p><p>      COOPER:  I just got a card that, I was going to wait for the audience, but it says point of fact, HR 6743 Federal data breach is going to the full House and it was just voted out of committee today, so breaking news here. So I'm guessing it was prompted by this panel. Taking immediate action, immediate action.</p><p>      So we're, I want to -- we're talking here about the pressure on the U.S.. One -- one thing that we have here in the U.S. that is the first amendment then, that seems to push back against privacy regulation, so I wanted to, Daniel turn to you and I know you've written and thought about this, the international or at least the comparative privacy law a lot, do you see any problems with extraterritorial application of elements of the GDPR?</p><p>      For instance, we see that the European Court of Justice is now considering the extraterritorial application of the right to be forgotten. We saw a Canadian court deal some of that early this year with Google. So do you see that as a potential push back?</p><p>      SOLOVE:  I mean there are definitely certain problems with that. I mean a lot of laws including U.S. laws have extraterritorial application as well, including the California law. And yes, I think that to some extent every country in every region has a right to regulate those who do business in its borders.</p><p>      And I guess one thing is good luck enforcing that over in the U.S.. If a company is not in Europe, GDPR says it applies, but I don't see what they're going to do to really enforce it. So it's there in paper. It looks scary on paper, but in practice, it's kind of a joke. They really can't enforce it.</p><p>      There are certain aspect of GDPR that wouldn't fly under the first amendment, but there are a lot of aspects under it that are fine under the first amendment, that are embodied in various laws. I can look to a lot of different provisions of GDPR and find analogs and similarities in U.S. laws including even rights to be forgotten. There are already right to be -- COPPA has one for example. So a lot of these aren't like foreign, radical concepts. There are certain things about GDPR that just will not fly in the U.S. for first amendment reasons as well as just general U.S. approaches.</p><p>      So the idea that you need to have a lawful basis to process data, that you have to be somehow authorized to do it. And there's only justifications that allow you to even use or collect data. I don't think that would really work in the United States. It's just so contrary to the U.S. approach which is generally a permissive approach. Like you can use it unless there's a problem that's caused by it, and it's generally U.S. approach is not to just say, you know, you need authorization. Do something unless what you're doing starts creating an issue.</p><p>      So I don't see that being carried over. But I think a lot of the things that GDPR does and a lot of things these laws do are not so radical and foreign and different to the U.S. You look at HIPAA, you look at GDPR, there's a lot of similarities, actually much more than the California law. HIPAA has a lot of similarities. A lot of GDPR is just having a privacy program, doing basic risk assessments and other things all of which HIPAA requires. </p><p>      And the GDPR often doesn't say a lot about like what those things should entail. It just say, hey, do privacy by design and do it early, but it doesn't say what you're supposed to do for that, it's largely empty. It says do a privacy impact analysis, but it doesn't have a lot of specificity on these things. And sort of how HIPAA is in a lot of ways too.</p><p>      So in a way, I don't think there is like -- things are so radically at odds with each other and that the GDPR approach is radically incompatible with the United States. I think there are certain things that are -- that won't transfer over, but I think the things that transfer over, the commonalities and the things that could work are more than the things that can't.</p><p>      COOPER:  Anyone else want to jump in on that? All right, well so with a little bit of time, I've gotten lots of great questions, I unfortunately we don't have time to ask all of them, but I want to direct one to Maureen because it's right in your bailiwick. It has to do with the FTC taking advantage of it dual role as both having consumer protection and a competition side and using that to examine the impact of data, not just in the consumer protection dimension but on the impact on small business competition and entry.</p><p>      And I know you've written about that and thought a lot about the mixing privacy and competition.</p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Certainly in a competition analysis, data could be considered if it is an asset that is being combined in a merger in a way that is going to reduce competition in some way. I mean much like combining two distribution systems or combining two factories. I think one of the questions though is really a lot of times concerns about privacy are really what's it driving, concerns about trying to use privacy in a competition analysis, so it's not really about hurting competition, it's about hurting privacy. So I think there certainly are examples one could think of, right?</p><p>      So say there were two very privacy-protective handset manufacturers, right, and they sort of have that big part of the market and say you can say that was a separate part of the market than other handsets, and they were going to merge, right, and then they were going to have a high market share of handsets that compete on privacy attributes. That could be in any trust case just like you could have two manufacturers of super premium ice cream who want to merge, right?</p><p>      COOPER:  Just hypothetically.</p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Just hypothetically, super premium ice cream, that was the case. And anyway, so I -- so I think it's not that data cannot be a part of it. It just has to be -- the concern has to be about competition. Now on the other hand, we have had situations where one company is buying another company and they're going to be combining data sets. They're not -- it's not -- they're not horizontal competitors, right? It's not that it's taking the competitor out of the marketplace, but that data that is going to be transferred over to the merged company was collected with a certain set of promises.</p><p>      And so what we've said through the head of Bureau of Consumer Protection is that the promises travel with the data, right? So if you collected this data and said we're not going to use it for marketing and they're going to combine it and then use it for marketing, they would have to get a new set, well basically a new consent from the consumers. So if consumer says well no, no, that's not what I wanted, then they would have to take them out of that data set.</p><p>      And so I think that's -- that's the way it has been handled. I mean there are merger cases where you do -- you're combining two very unique datasets, like we had a case about mapping use for insurance. And we had a competition remedy, because it was going to reduce competition and so we actually had a remedy that required sort of replication and sharing of this data set.</p><p>      But so often, these types of mergers that involve a lot of data are, they're being combined to create what we would consider in antitrust like a new product, like a new efficiency as long as it's not harming consumers as a consumer protection matter and that wouldn't be considered a negative kind of thing.</p><p>      So I actually have an article about this, called Competition, Consumer Protection, and the Right Approach to Privacy.</p><p>      COOPER:  She'll be outside signing it on the way out.</p><p>      OHLHAUSEN:  Right, it's in the Anti-Trust Law Journal in 2014, but -- so it's not to say these values aren't important. It's to say what tools you use are, that's an important consideration. If you are concerned just about, you know, someone is going to use data in a way that harms consumers, that's a core consumer protection issue and you might -- you should use those tools. If you are concerned that this transaction that involves data sets is going to reduce competition, either competition on privacy or competition in another -- some other form, then antitrust is the right tool.</p><p>      COOPER:  Anyone else? Yes.</p><p>      BEALES:  Yes. I just think there's a different perspective on it that is also important. As we -- as we look at it and as states and Congress look at additional regulatory requirements, those often have differential effects on competitors, and in particular in the privacy world, it is a whole lot easier for a consumer-facing company like Google or Facebook to get consent than it is for the behind-the-scenes somebody that does exactly the same thing using exactly the same information, but they collect it via cookies, planted by a host of different publishers participating in an advertising network.</p><p>      But that is the competitive fringe in the online advertising market, and regulations that make it harder for them helped to entrench Google and Facebook and that's not necessarily a good thing, but it's very much a competitive concern.</p><p>      COOPER:  Okay, so here is a question in our 2 minutes and 21 seconds left, about the -- the -- it didn't come up surprisingly, but we kind of touched around on it, the privacy paradox. You know, maybe Daniel, I'll aim this one at you first, but the audience member says, how do you reconcile the fact that consumers readily value privacy highly even asked, but they tend to do things that contradict these stated values and I think we all know that as the privacy paradox, that stated preference seems to diverge from revealed preference in the privacy space.</p><p>      SOLOVE:  Yes. Alessandro Acquisti, an economist at Carnegie Mellon, has done some really great work on this and studied this very effect of, you know, people and what they say and what they do are at variance. And that's often the case. And part of it is that, you know, the choices that people have and the way that they make those choices are shaped by how those choices are presented to them and a bunch of other factors that could lead them to make choices that are not always consistent with their stated attitudes.</p><p>      And so we might say, well, what is true? Do you say the behavior is the truth about what they really value or is it what they say? I actually think it's neither. I don't think what they say is actually reflective of how they actually value something, but I don't think behavior is always a good metric either, because there're a lot of things skewing the behavior. And Acquisti does a great job of pointing out all the different skewing things on behavior.</p><p>      So in a way, it's very difficult to measure what consumers actually value, because I think both metrics are problematic for doing that, because a lot of it is how informed the consumer is and what information they're given and so on. And you get very odd effects. One of his studies is very interesting. He had two groups and one group, he told like they're going to collect very sensitive data and one group he said, we're going to protect it, we're going to give all sorts of privacy protections and security protections on it and the other group, he said nothing.</p><p>      And guess which group disclosed more, the group he said nothing to. And so it's almost figuring out like punishing you for actually doing the right thing, and that's because when you told people all the privacy and security protections, people's minds suddenly woke up, oh my gosh, maybe there are these risks that I didn't think about and that made them more cautious.</p><p>      So a lot of interesting effects and I just urge you to read his work. It's very illuminating, and he'd do a much better job than I did at tackling this issue.</p><p>      COOPER:  I'm sorry David.</p><p>      VLADECK:  Yes, I'll make one other -- you know, people are generally presented with take it or leave it offers. I mean either of you are on Facebook or you're not, or you use Google Search or not and, you know, we did some research when I was at the FTC about these issues and part of it just -- and this is, just sort of echoes what Dave says, how the choice is presented.</p><p>      COOPER:  Yes. Howard?</p><p>      BEALES:  I think how you frame it clearly matters, but, you know, consumers have all sorts of preferences where it's a perfectly valid preference and a perfectly real preference, but when they confront the cost of satisfying that preference, they make a different choice, and that's -- there are issues of how you pose the question and how you define it and what consumers know, but there's also these choices have costs and consumers may make them differently.</p><p>      An example I like is organic foods, something like 48 percent of consumers say, \"yes, I prefer organic.\" Organic's market share is about five percent.</p><p>      COOPER:  All right, well I wish we could go on forever. I'm sure the rest of you all do, but we are out of time by the 6-0s on the clock up here. So join me in thanking this great group to -</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      COOPER:  I will await my instructions from below.</p><p>      SAYYED:  If -- we have one more little end note, if Howard Shelanski, professor here will give closing remarks and here he comes now. The Price is Right style.</p><p>      SHELANSKI:  All right great, thanks very much to all. And thanks to all of you for being here. I'm used to at academic conferences saying I'm standing between the audience and cocktail hour, there're no cocktails here, so you guys are stuck. I will nonetheless keep things brief.</p><p>      I want to start by just reiterating what Dean Treanor said this morning, it's a real honor for us here at Georgetown to be able to host these first days of these series of hearings that the FTC is hosting. It's really -- we have a deep connection to the FTC as Dean Treanor explained and it's really just wonderful to have such a vibrant debate and so many of you here today and special props for my antitrust students who showed up, I appreciate that, former students so they're not getting any benefit from this since I'm not teaching at this semester.</p><p>      One of the things that I think has been particularly heartening about today's discussion is we really see the full integration of the agency's consumer protection and competition missions. I think both of those are front and center, certainly the last panel makes that very clear, in the issues that these hearings are tackling. And you heard Bilal say earlier that the Bureau of Competition and the Bureau of Consumer Protection are really complementary.</p><p>      I might add Bilal left one thing out of his formulation which was the Bureau of Economics, and it's my view that with a small handful of FTEs, the Bureau of Economics could actually be completely substituting of both of those other bureaus, but that's perhaps a chauvinistic view from someone who spent some time at that agency and in that bureau.</p><p>      The importance of these hearings really can't be understated. I think one of the great things of the American regulatory system writ large and one that, sort of a distinguishing set of characteristics that one sees when one goes around the world and sees how regulation and law enforcement is done in many other very sophisticated jurisdictions, is the level of transparency and accountability that characterizes the way our federal agencies act.</p><p>      And to be sure, one could be cynical about certain actions that those agencies take, but when one takes a broad view, it really is quite impressive. Agencies have to justify their decisions. Agencies have to have a coherent framework and they have to have evidence, and those agencies don't get to make those decisions on their own because they are subject to accountability through the courts, and you just have to open up the paper today to see an example of a court overruling a federal agency that did not meet those standards.</p><p>      So the agencies have a real obligation. These hearings fall into that framework of transparency and accountability. An agency that fails to justify its actions in a particular case to a court loses the case. An agency that fails to justify its program and its approaches and framework loses its -- loses its relevance before the public, and that is I think a very damaging and harmful thing to have happen.</p><p>      So for an agency periodically to hold sustained public hearings where it examines both the sets of problems on which it is focusing and the analytical framework with which it's approaching those problems is really a very important aspect of maintaining that relevance, maintaining that legitimacy with the public, and that is exactly how I see these hearings and what I see the FTC as doing.</p><p>      The FTC has always been an agency that cannot stand still and rest too comfortably with the problems it's focusing on or with the tools with which it's analyzing its approaches to those problems. Indeed, that was the spirit which Chairman Pitofsky launched the hearings nearly a quarter century ago. We were in a time of very interesting economic turmoil with the rise of high technology industries, economics and other tools for assessing where there were competitive harms, where there were harms to consumers, were changing and developing.</p><p>      And it was his judgment as chair that the agency needed to go out and make sure that it was well understanding what problems the public is focused on, that it was understanding the industrial changes that were before it and that it was understanding the state of the art of the knowledge with which it would assess those problems.</p><p>      Well, I think all of those forces are even stronger today. And when Chairman Simons came into office, he came into office at a moment that most of us in the antitrust field and many of us in the consumer protection field recognized as a sort of a historic moment. I think there was sort of unprecedented debate, but I don't want to say unprecedented but certainly unprecedented for the last 40 years, debate over some of the fundamental framework and conventional understandings of how antitrust should be enforced.</p><p>      There is a recognition that we have much sharper tools out there for understanding how consumers behave and process information. It's time for the agency to step forward and make sure that it is fully taking account of and understanding that public debate, because if it doesn't, it will keep looking over here and the public will be thinking about problems over there. </p><p>      So if you open up again, the paper over the past week, you'll read that there is a lot of public debate, a lot of debate in academia, a lot of debate in think tanks about whether the consumer welfare standard and as conventionally conceived in antitrust enforcement is adequate to address some of the concerns about market structure changes or wealth distribution changes, things that the first panel this morning talked about.</p><p>      I had people come up to me and say, can you believe the FTC invited so and so? Those are flaky ideas. They shouldn't be giving air time to those. And the FTC and I firmly disagree. These are things that people are thinking about and they are motivated by the problems that everyday consumers are perceiving. And if the agency turns its back on those voices in the debate and doesn't take into account what might be legitimate in those arguments, the agency will lose its transparency and it will fail the test of accountability before the public.</p><p>      So recognizing that, we see on all of the panels today and on the panels that we will see in the other 19 days of hearings that I think are scheduled, are real diversity of views that explore the outer boundaries of what would traditionally be thought of as competition enforcement or consumer protection enforcement. And only by taking into account that thinking at the outer boundaries, of hearing about the problems that might be novel or different in form from the way we've seen them before given the rise of large digital industries and AI and new kinds of technology, only by fully exploring them and doing what Chairman Simons said we should do and that he would do in his opening remarks, follow the evidence, follow the evidence to identify where there is really a problem, follow the evidence for where we have a good understanding of tools that can resolve those problems.</p><p>      In that way the agency will do two things. The agency will modernize its thinking. It will better be able to explain its actions even where the action is inaction, it will better be able to say action is not warranted or we don't know enough to have action. And we're making that decision having taken into account the state of the art thinking and having really heard from the public, from stakeholders of all kinds about what the problems are that they are feeling and that they are sensing out there in the marketplace.</p><p>      By doing that, the agency will become more effective, it will modify its framework as it needs to to be more effective, but it will also be more effective and transparent in justifying what framework it eventually arrives at after these hearings.</p><p>      So these are more important as events than the one-off kinds of conferences that very often characterize a field. They are a sustained and iterative process over 20 days where some of the same issues will come up again and again. Everything is documented, everything is public, and at the end, there will be reports very transparently explaining what evidence the agency is crediting, what arguments it's crediting, what arguments it doesn't feel it can credit, and the technology if you will of consumer protection and competition enforcement under Section 5 at the agency will all be the better for it.</p><p>      So this is an important enterprise. It's an important enterprise not just for the people on the different panels, but it's an important enterprise for all of you to participate in, commenting, sending your comments to the agency, the agency has got an open window for those comments right now, because it is a unique moment that we might not get again for another 20 or 25 years, or else it will occur only incrementally though the case by case kinds of transparency and accountability. So this is a critically important moment. I think this is a really auspicious start today to that moment. I look forward to following and participating in some of at least the remaining 20 days, I would encourage all of you to do so as well. Thank you.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SAYYED:  So I'm just going to say thank you and say five percent down. And then our next session, September 21st, Constitution Center, so not very far from here and that will get us I don't know, 10 percent down. Thank you, thank you to the panelists. Thank you, everybody.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2105093237</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T92-98X1-DY0W-4186-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"51564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bloomberg Government</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 17, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009QT6</classCode><className>SIDLEY AUSTIN LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0004N36</classCode><className>KELLEY DRYE &amp;

And we at Georgetown Law are very pleased to be hosting this event. a And I think it's very fitting that we're here. Georgetown Law's connection to antitrust and consumer protection is longstanding and very deep. Dean Robert Pitofsky served as Bureau Director, commissioner, and then Chair of the FTC over his long distinguished career.   </p><p>      Numerous agency leaders have been graduates of Georgetown Law; most recently, our current FTC chair, Joe Simons, we'll be hearing from him shortly. Also commissioner Nominees Christine Wilson, former DOJ Assistant Attorney General, Christine Varney. Monique Fortenberry, Deputy Executive Director of the FTC.   </p><p>      We're very proud of having educated so many of the leaders of the FTC. And among our current faculty, David Vladeck, who is at the end of our panel today, was director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection.  </p><p>      Howard Shelanski was director of the Bureau of Economics. Professor Steve Salop was both a senior official of the FTC's Bureau of Economics and a mentor to Chairman Simons and Christine Wilson.   </p><p>      Actually, the chair, the chair and I were just talking about how his time in Georgetown had really prepared him in every way that you had. We're just very proud.   </p><p>      And it's appropriate and it's particularly appropriate I think because in some ways these hearings are intended to follow the path that was set by the FTC's global competition and innovation hearings which were held in 1995 when Bob, Bob Pitofsky, was the FTC's chair.   </p><p>      So we can look forward over the course of these hearings to a serious, insightful, and interesting set of discussion, some of the most pressing questions facing antitrust and consumer protection policy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FURMAN</emphasis>:  And don't take my thunder, okay?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TREANOR</emphasis>:  Okay. Let me just kind of -- don't expect too much until you hear from the chair who will bring up your expectations. The FTC will be continuing its hearings and locations across the country. And over the next several months, it'll be exploring new ideas and approaches to its historic statutory mission.   </p><p>      And for those of you who want to hear more about the antitrust issues of today right here at Georgetown Law, our global antitrust symposium which is now in its 12th year and is one of the most prominent antitrust conferences outside of the ABA Spring Meeting will take place this room in about two weeks, so.  </p><p>      Thank you all for coming. I want to congratulate the FTC for its initiative and hard work in organizing these public hearings. And now, I'd like to call to the podium the director of the Office of Policy Planning, Bilal Sayyed.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Okay. I won't take long except to thank everybody for coming and to tell people a little bit about what we'll do today. We'll turn to the chair in just a minute. But I just want to tell everybody this event is being webcast. The webcast will be posted to the FTC's website shortly after we conclude. This session is being transcribed and the transcript will be posted quickly.   </p><p>      Tomorrow's planned session -- excuse me -- tomorrow's planned session has been cancelled because of concern about the weather, but it will be rescheduled and the, we'll make the effort to reschedule it here at Georgetown fairly, fairly quickly.  </p><p>      Some of my FTC colleagues will be passing out question cards. If members of the audience have questions that they'd like to put to the panel, they should write them on the card and raise their hand, and we'll come collect them.   </p><p>      We have an open comment process. And so we encourage people to continue to comment. That comment process will be open through probably the end of February.   </p><p>      But we encourage people to comment on what they hear today, both what is presented and what is discussed. And then, all presentations made here will be posted on the website. And as I noted, the transcript of the session will be posted, so I'd say with that, I'll turn it over to the chairman and he'll kick us off to get started.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SIMONS</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you so much, Bilal. Good morning, everyone and welcome.   </p><p>      On behalf of all of us at the Federal Trade Commission, I want to thank you for coming to the opening of our Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century. Our goal is to make these hearings as informative, insightful, and consequential as possible, covering some of the most important competition and consumer protection policy and enforcement issues of the day. We believe we are situated to do just that.   </p><p>      These hearings, as has been discussed already, are modeled on the ones that were held back in 1995 by then-Chairman Bob Pitofsky, who in his opening remarks said at the time, \"These hearings are designed to restore the tradition of linking law enforcement with a continuing review of economic conditions to ensure that the laws make sense in light of contemporary competitive conditions.\" We intend to continue that same tradition with these hearings.   </p><p>      We are very fortunate to have a large group of highly respected participants representing a diverse range of views, including academics, practitioners, enforcement officials and representatives from public interest groups.   </p><p>      And I am proud that we are opening the hearings at the Georgetown University Law Center, where Chairman Pitofsky spent much of his career when he was not otherwise at the FTC, and where I received my initial antitrust education to a significant extent from Professor Pitofsky.   </p><p>      So, today, I want to talk about why the commission is holding these hearings. Almost 30 years ago, I came to the FTC, the first of my three times here at the tail end of the commission's adoption of a significantly revised approach to antitrust enforcement. This change, which began in 1981, and was implemented to a large extent by Tim Muris who is two or three people to my left here.   </p><p>      This change, which began in 1981, reflected new learning that had begun to influence the Supreme Court antitrust doctrine. It was primarily driven by the scholarship of academics; the most prominent -- Phil Areeda, Don Turner, Frank Easterbrook, Richard Posner, and Robert Bork, were associated with either Harvard University or the University of Chicago.   </p><p>      They applied microeconomic principles to antitrust questions and paid attention to empirical work, which led them to conclude that a lot of pre-1970s antitrust case law was inconsistent with rational, pro-competitive, and economically beneficial behavior.   </p><p>      By the time I left the agency for the first time in 1989, application of microeconomic principles and simple economic models was routine and encouraged. Notwithstanding some initial criticism, the Clinton administration's antitrust leadership, including Bob Pitofsky, Anne Bingham, and Joel Klein, largely adhered to the same principles.   </p><p>      So, when I returned to the commission as director of the Bureau of Competition in 2001, there was substantial support for and acceptance of the antitrust reforms that had been initiated 20 or so years prior. In other words, there was a general consensus on how we ought to think about antitrust enforcement and policy.   </p><p>      But now, at the beginning of my third stint at the commission, things have shifted. The broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged in at least two ways.   </p><p>      First, some recent economic literature concludes that the U.S. economy has grown more concentrated and less competitive over the last 20 to 30 years, which happens to correlate with the timing of the change to a less enforcement-oriented antitrust policy beginning in the early 1980s. These concerns merit serious attention, and they will be part of today's discussion.   </p><p>      Second, some are debating the very nature of antitrust itself, calling for antitrust enforcers to take account of policy goals beyond consumer welfare. Inequality, labor issues, and excessive political power are perhaps the main examples.   </p><p>      We will discuss some of these suggestions during later sessions. These concerns raise a challenge for antitrust agency leadership, the courts, and legislators to think hard about whether significant adjustments to antitrust doctrine, enforcement decisions, and law would be beneficial to our country, in order to accommodate these concerns.  </p><p>      As I noted in announcing the hearings, it is important that the antitrust enforcement agencies be at the forefront in thinking about these issues, not bystanders to this debate. To that end, today and continuing through the fall and early winter, we have invited interested parties to discuss these issues, both through public comment and public sessions, with us and each other.   </p><p>      We do this with the goal of understanding whether our current enforcement of policies are on the right track, or on the wrong track or on the wrong track, and if they're on the wrong track, what should we do to improve them.  </p><p>      I approach all of these issues with a very open mind, very much willing to be influenced by what I see and hear at these hearings. I am old enough to have witnessed in my own career dramatic changes in antitrust policy and enforcement. These changes have largely been driven by developments within the economic community, which were then adopted by the legal community. The movement by the economists, however, has not always been in the same direction.   </p><p>      In the 1950s and 1960s, a substantial body of empirical economic work purported to show significant anticompetitive effects at relatively low levels of concentration. In 1968, the DOJ issued merger guidelines based on these studies. But just about the time the guidelines were issued, the economic studies on which they were based were being substantially discredited.   </p><p>      As a result, the agencies over time raised the concentration levels at which mergers were seen as problematic. A more recent example where developments in economics increased the level of successful merger enforcement involves hospitals.   </p><p>      In the 1990s, the government lost a large number of hospital merger cases in a row, and the agencies considered whether to give up on hospital merger enforcement. Fortunately, we did not. Instead, we engaged in empirical economic studies that demonstrated the anticompetitive effects of hospital mergers, and we revitalized our hospital merger enforcement program.   </p><p>      So the developments in economics can suggest, depending on the circumstances, that our enforcement has either been too aggressive or too lax. This episode involving hospital merger enforcement really drove this point home for me personally. The use of economics should not be thought of as a one-way ratchet, only driving down the level of antitrust enforcement.   </p><p>      Good economics might point us toward more or less enforcement, depending on the facts and the analysis in front of us at the time. In my view, basing antitrust policy and enforcement decisions on an ideological viewpoint, whether from the left or the right, is a mistake. Whether or not we expand antitrust beyond the consumer welfare standard, I would rather make policy and enforcement decisions based on the best evidence and analysis, including in particular, empirically grounded economic analysis that enables the analysts to weigh the costs and benefits broadly defined to help determine the best approach.   </p><p>      My hope is that these hearings will significantly improve our ability to do so, and help to bring about a new and improved consensus among our antitrust stakeholders.  </p><p>      But we are not focused solely on competition issues today or throughout the hearings. The strength and direction of the agency's consumer protection mission is also something that we are going to explore at some length at these hearings.   </p><p>      Today, our most significant and difficult consumer protection issues often revolve around the use and abuse of technological capabilities not likely imaged during Bob Pitofsky's chairmanship.   </p><p>      As a result, we will be having multiple sessions on data security issues. And our upcoming hearings on platforms, big data, and artificial intelligence will address consumer protection issues, including privacy, as well as competition issues.   </p><p>      Before closing, I want to thank not only the participants in these sessions, but the many groups and individuals who have filed comments in response to our initial hearings notice. We have received over 500 non-duplicative comments, many of substantial length and thoughtfulness. We are reading them and considering them carefully. We expect more comments as we proceed, and I encourage those interested to comment on what you hear today and throughout the hearings.   </p><p>      I also want to thank our co-sponsor and host, the team at the Georgetown University Law Center, for helping us pull this initial effort together. I also want to recognize the staff of the FTC for their efforts in both preparing for the substance of this event and undertaking all the logistics to bring us together.   </p><p>      I, and all the commissioners, are grateful for the work of so many people both within the FTC and outside the FTC, who are engaged in making this a successful effort. Thank you for attending, and I hope you enjoy the hearings.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And I'll turn it over to Bilal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Okay. So, I'll just take a few minutes the panelists and then try to get out of the way, in no -- in no particular order, or maybe some particular order.  </p><p>      Jason Furman will speak first. Jason is presently a professor at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, and was formerly the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.  </p><p>      Tim Muris, just to Jason's left, it was most -- is presently a senior counsel at Sidley Austin but was also chairman of the FTC from 2001 to 2004. And previously, director of both of the Bureau of Competition and the Bureau of Consumer Protection but not of course at the same time.   </p><p>      Just to the left of Tim is Alysa Hutnik. She's a partner at Kelley Drye, and really an expert in consumer protection law.   </p><p>      Immediately to my left is Jim Rill. Jim is senior counsel at Baker Botts presently, but was head of the Antitrust Division for about 1989 to 1992.   </p><p>      And then we also have Janet McDavid, who was not a head of the either agency but certainly is one who has been considered to head either, maybe even both agencies, had in the past. Jan is a partner at Hogan Lovells.   </p><p>      And, finally but by no means least, Professor Vladeck, who serves as director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection just a few short years ago. And, of course, is a professor here at Georgetown.  </p><p>      So, with that I'm going to turn it over to Jason. And just remind everybody if they have questions, raise your hands, pass your questions over to some of my colleagues who are collecting question cards.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FURMAN</emphasis>:  Thank you so much. And I thought Chairman Simons' remarks were perfect in three respects. One is you want somebody to be open-minded coming to this question, because thinking really is evolving very rapidly.   </p><p>      Second, he had a really excellent capsule history of antitrust thinking, and third, I think he made it clear that he was deferring completely to economists in how he was proceeding on this matter.  </p><p>      I'm a little bit of an interloper on this panel. I think I'm one of the only economists. And anyone that knows any economics would know I'm even more of an interloper than that, because my main focus has been on macroeconomic issues, labor market issues, inequality, not on industrial organization and antitrust narrowly defined.   </p><p>      When I was chairing the Council of Economic Advisers, I came to this issue partly out of what I'll now admit was paranoia. There was a crime that had been committed and we were looking for suspects.   </p><p>      The crime was low productivity growth and high inequality, something clearly going wrong in the economy. Productivity growth being about a percentage point lower over the last decade than it had been previously; at the same time, high levels of inequality continued to move higher.   </p><p>      And those were the two factors that were underlying the slowdown of the growth and income for the typical families that I think is the central challenge for economic policy. So, what can you do to raise productivity growth, to reduce inequality?  </p><p>      And we were looking around a lot of different suspects. And just to be clear, there is more than one cause of this set of phenomena. But one thing we alighted on was this area. Part of what motivated it was a few sub-facts under those two big ones. And let me just list a few of them.   </p><p>      One, a number of economists had documented that throughout the economy, there was less churn and dynamism. Fewer businesses being created, fewer older businesses, larger businesses increasingly dominating the economy, fewer people moving from job to job. So, a little bit more of a sclerosis than we like to think is the case for the U.S. economy.   </p><p>      There was, in terms of inequality -- I'm sorry -- reduction in investment, a trend down in investment. Partly, that's shift to intangibles, but not completely, and trying to understand that.   </p><p>      On the inequality side, there was a rise -- fall in the reduction. I'm sorry. A fall in the share of income going to labor. And, finally, an increase in markups in the rate of return to capital relative to the safe rate of return. And an increasingly skewed rate of return to capital, with some very successful companies having persistently very high returns, much higher than the median, relative to the median than they had before.   </p><p>      So, this was a fact pattern about aggregate data that made us to look beneath the aggregates in terms of what was going on at the firm and the industry level.   </p><p>      Now, one way to look at what's going on in the firm and the industry level is to use aggregate industrial data, and to divide up the economy into 10 industries, into 800 industries, and look within each one of those what's going on in concentration.  </p><p>      And then, numbers did that -- a number of people did that. Grion et. al., Archer et. al. -- we did at the Council of Economic Advisers, and you saw it in the press as well and places like The Economist. And we generally find that in about 75 percent of industries defined in this way concentration increased.   </p><p>      Now, as the antitrust community was quick to point out, there is some dispute as to whether it was 35 years ago people realized this was an idiotic procedure, or 50 years ago that people had realized this was an idiotic procedure. But that these aren't antitrust markets.  </p><p>      Now, the people that put this forward from the very beginning, including ourselves, understood that. No one would bring in an antitrust case based on these types of aggregate data. Everything has pluses and minuses.   </p><p>      But we're trying to look at economy-wide phenomenon and really needed to use economy-wide data because the type of relevant antitrust market analysis we have for some parts of the economy -- and I'll talk about it in a moment, but we don't have it for all of them, and can't really aggregate up, synthesize, and add it all together.   </p><p>      When looking at this macro data, I think the question is not ex ante, what do we think about it? Of course, these are the relevant markets for antitrust. It's does it work, does it help explain some of what we're trying to explain.   </p><p>      And subsequent research by Gutierrez [ph] and Philepon [ph], among others, has found actually that as this aggregate level, increases in concentration are tied to reductions in business investment, are tied to reductions in R&amp;D by business, and also are associated with rising markups in those industries and rising rates of profit in those industries. So, you see these different measures seemed to, in a broad sense, work and explain some of what we are interested in.  </p><p>      The next set of measures that one could look at aren't the aggregate macro data but are doing what you would do in an antitrust case, which is looking at a particular relevant market properly defined, and asking is the level of concentration high? Has the level of concentration increased?   </p><p>      There have been a range of studies, some done by the FTC, a number done by economists for a whole lot of markets. Ad services, health insurers, hospitals, refrigerators, airlines, telecommunications, beer, all of which have consistently found very high levels of concentration, and in many cases, rising levels of concentration well in excess of the levels that would trigger a review if there was a merger under the merger guidelines.   </p><p>      Moreover, a new strand of research, one that is still very new, I wouldn't necessarily go and make policy on it with certainty tomorrow, but one that so far as turning out to be empirically more convincing than, frankly, I would have expected on common ownership finds that when the same few companies own all of the airlines and own all of the banks that that increases concentration above and beyond what you would measure if you thought that American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta were three different companies, when you realized they're all owned by the same companies.   </p><p>      And you see that in a variety of data including remarkably at sort of a root by root level in terms of the pricing, so there's a wealth of microeconomic, more traditional antitrust evidence for this.   </p><p>      So the question now is why have we seen this increase in concentration? And what are its consequences? I don't think there's any single answer to the why question.   </p><p>      In some cases, the increase in concentration may be for good reasons and reflect increases in efficiency, increases in competition that weed out some of the less effective firms, globalization, and the like. This is an explanation that's been stressed by economists including David Ardor [ph], et al.   </p><p>      That's the story that probably works pretty well in the retail sector where it wasn't that there were a few big mergers. It wasn't that there was some collusive common ownership. But the company Wal-Mart figured out how to have better supply chain management and grew. And then Amazon did the same online. And as a result, there's more concentration in that sector, and it reflects that increase in efficiency.   </p><p>      For a lot of the economy, though, the story is much less benign than that one, and it gets to -- has its roots in what Chairman Simons described as a large change in the way we thought about antitrust.   </p><p>      Kwoka has documented for example the FTC's oversight challenge looking into mergers, used to look at six to five, now we'd never look at something like that. So you have changes in antitrust enforcement. Some of it may be grounded in other parts of the economy.   </p><p>      We should be looking also at things like regulations and rent-seeking that allow companies to create rules that benefit themselves at the expense of others; certainly, in questions like intellectual property. And I think a lot of these competition issues are about antitrust, but they go more broadly.   </p><p>      And then if you look at labor markets, you want to look at occupational licensing, something the FTC has been at the forefront of for a long time, land use restrictions and a whole bunch of ways that reduce competition in the economy.  </p><p>      So, I think you have this combination of good reasons, bad reasons. And then you have some that are ambiguous. If you look at something like the tech sector, you've seen a lot of innovation, but you also have platforms with network effects that lend themselves to scale that might say that it's efficient to have a single producer at scale.   </p><p>      It's also efficient to have a single municipal water company, but that doesn't mean we would want to let it go off and charge whatever it wanted to charge. I'm not saying that we want to regulate technology the same way we regulate municipal water. It's much more complicated. And it's an issue that I'm currently looking at as head of an expert panel for the UK government reviewing digital competition by trying to understand the combination of good reasons that you've seen companies grow with innovation and competition and bad.  </p><p>      I want to talk about why we care about this. Traditionally in economics, this is just about prices, and it's about prices being higher. I think that issue matters. Airlines prices and cellphone bills are higher in the United States than they are in Europe, because European competition enforcers have been more vigorous. They have more players in those industries than we do. So, I think the price issue matters. The price issue may be a lot smaller than some of the others I talked about. One is innovation, what this does to the incentives for business investment for R&amp;D, for productivity growth.   </p><p>      There's a longstanding debate between a review of Arrow and Schumpeter in economics about the impact of competition on innovation. But there's a number of ways in which it could be deleterious.  </p><p>      And then, finally, inequality. And there's been, at the same time that there's been this increase thinking about these types of macro issues in competition, there are also has been in labor markets as well. And that's grounded in the observation that every employment relationship has a bit of monopoly power a and a bit of rent that's being divided between the two because there's a cost of finding a new job and shifting a job, and so market power matters a lot.  </p><p>      If you have one hospital in town, it's a lot harder for a nurse to threaten to move to another hospital to get a pay raise. If you have two hospitals in town, it's much easier for the two of them to collude tacitly or even illegally to hold down the pay of nurses.  </p><p>      Even in the fast-food industry, there's evidence that anti-poaching and non-compete agreements have a deleterious impact on workers' bargaining power, help to hold down wages, and have been part of the reason that the labor share has been reduced.   </p><p>      In summary, I think this evidence is coming from a variety of different places, and a variety of different perspectives. If you're trying to ask a question about the economy as a whole, you're not going to have one definitive data source or one definitive study that's going to answer that question. You have to take a collage of views. And I think that collage involves looking at the pattern of what we've seen in the data that I talked about in terms of falling labor share, falling investment, rising markups.  </p><p>      Looking at the industry level and seeing whether those phenomenon are industry by industry tied to concentration, and they are. Looking in a deeper, more careful way where we can, and we can -- we've done that in a lot of different industries.   </p><p>      And then no single story comes out of this, but on balance and on average, this does seem to add up to a reduction in competition, a reduction in dynamism. And one that I think that we need to be concerned about and think about what ways we need to update our policies to address if we want to have more investment, more dynamism, more productivity growth, less inequality, in addition of course to the traditional focus on lower prices for consumers. Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Jason. We're going to turn to Tim Muris now. I will note that although Jason is the only economist on this panel, we have if I count correctly, five economists; 100 percent of the panel, on our second panel in the afternoon. So, we are trying to balance just about everything in these hearings. Right. Okay.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Bilal. I'm honored to be here, once again following in the giant steps of my friend and predecessor, Robert Pitofsky.  </p><p>      We first met in 1976. But it was 1988 working on this second Kirkpatrick Commission that we realized we shared a vision for the FTC.   </p><p>      Not that Bob and I always agreed, of course. Minutes after being sworn in as chair, I announced to a somewhat nervous reaction that there was indeed a new majority. I said there was no longer majority of New York Yankee fans on the commission.   </p><p>      The FTC has enjoyed great success for decades. And I'll address a few topics here. First, what durable success means for an agency like the FTC; then the vision that Bob and I shared that has led to the agency's success.  </p><p>      Next, I consider recent challenges from two Ps, paternalism in consumer protection, and populism in antitrust. Because both of these isms once dominated FTC work particularly in the 1970s. I discuss history. I lived through the 1970s, and the decade was disastrous for the FTC. Nostalgia expressed explicitly in recent literatures is misplaced. I have no desire to relive those years and neither should you.  </p><p>      I'm submitting a longer paper with lots of footnotes, like lawyers do. And I'll make a lot of assertions for which those footnotes provide support. But starting with success, it has to be built on something more ephemeral than headlines. A definition that is less ephemeral starts with the recognition that an agency needs a clear understanding of and support for its core mission among its constituents.   </p><p>      Second, this core must derive from a vision clearly shared not just today but enduring -- enduring through electoral cycles. Over time, perhaps, decades, stakeholders adjudge favorably the core mission of successful agencies.   </p><p>      Finally, a successful public institution needs a coherent strategy. The positive agenda must direct the institution at all levels from the staff to the managers to agency leaders. Without a general strategy and positive agenda, an agency merely reacts.  </p><p>      The FTC has such an agenda, the heart of which is to attack practices that harm consumers by hampering the competitive process and violating the basic rules of exchange. The FTC's success in large part reflects this shared vision.   </p><p>      Take antitrust first. Until recently, antitrust reflected bipartisan cooperation. Disagreements existed in close cases but there was widespread agreement that antitrust should protect consumers, that economic analysis should case selection, and that horizontal cases were central to enforcement.  </p><p>      Regarding cases, Robert Bork once remarked that firms either make war on each other or they make peace. This framework reflects the consensus that the most harmful practices occur when firms stop competing vigorously; making peace to hurt consumers. Horizontal mergers with likely anti-competitive effects are one fertile area for firms to make peace. Firms also make peace through non-merger conduct. As with mergers, of course, collaboration is not itself sufficient to assess consumer welfare.  </p><p>      Many collaborations are beneficial. And the peacemaking of most concern lacks offsetting efficiencies, what antitrust lawyers call naked horizontal agreements. The FTC has pioneered development of the law here, especially among professions, generic drugs, and the process to analyze collaboration.   </p><p>      In rare instances, a single firm with market power can exclude competition to harm consumers. The 2001 Microsoft case, probably the most famous recent example, it's, those kind of cases are important to any antitrust program.   </p><p>      A particularly fruitful category of troubling single-firm conduct involves misleading the government. Misuse of courts and government agencies is effective way, this rent-seeking, to stifle competition. Such strategies are not limited to single firms, of course. They're the cheap exclusion which is a felicitous phrase that the people at the FTC have invented.   </p><p>      Two antitrust immunities helped protect this rent-seeking, NOR and state action. Some courts have broadly interpreted these immunities for -- and for decades, 40 years in fact, the FTC has sought to circumscribe both with three Supreme Court victories and state action.   </p><p>      On NOR, the agency saved consumers billions of dollars at the gas pump in Unocal and provided large benefits for pharmaceutical consumers in Bristol-Myers Squibb among many other successes.   </p><p>      The vision for consumer protection is identical to that in antitrust. When competition alone cannot defer dishonesty, private legal rights help, there's government-developed common law. When the market forces are insufficient and common laws ineffective, there's a role for a public agency. And consumer protection and the antitrust naturally complement each other. Under the FTC's positive agenda, robust competition is the first and most important way to protect consumers.   </p><p>      And the FTC's role is crucial but it's a referee, not the star player. The foundation and core of consumer protection is the systematic attack on fraud begun in 1981. And the FTC has continued to expand in each administration the fraud program.  </p><p>      The commission has long evaluated advertising by legitimate businesses, and in this century has expanded into privacy, and with many successes. The National Do-Not-Call Registry being one of the most popular government initiatives in history.  </p><p>      But yesterday's success has become today's challenge with robocalls clogging our phones. In terms of robocalls, the FTC has been aggressive and ingenious but ultimately, robocalls are like spam.   </p><p>      Spam was, ultimately, the most effective way to deal with spam was when the ISPs developed tools to be able to screen out the majority of spam. And in the same way, robocalls I think will be best dealt with when those who deliver phone services and others develop the legal and technical tools to block unwanted calls.   </p><p>      Now, I've written and with Howard Beales that we criticized the Obama FTC on occasion. But compared to the paternalism of the CFPB to which I turn next, the FTC has been a paragon of virtue.   </p><p>      Let me turn to those two P's and their contrary vision for the FTC. The first is the return of the paternalism of the 1970s. The FTC of that era sought to become the second most powerful legislature.   </p><p>      In one 15-month strength, the FTC issued over a rule a month seeking to transform the entire industries along the vision of the then-very young people in charge of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, as proposed most of these rules were market supplanting with adverse consequences.   </p><p>      There was an exchange in the 1972 National Commission of Consumer Finance which is illustrative, and I'm not making this up. There was a debate about whether poor and middleclass people should borrow money to buy color televisions. With some people saying they shouldn't do it because they didn't need such luxuries, and other people defending their right to buy on credit color televisions. That, unfortunately, was illustrative.   </p><p>      This paternalism has returned with a vengeance in the CFPB. And by this, I mean the Obama CFPB. Whatever one thinks about what's going on, the powers of the CFPB are there. They haven't been touched when President Warren comes in in a few years. If she or someone likes her -- like her comes in, the incredible power of the CFPB which is insulated from any effective control will still be there.   </p><p>      Substantively, the CFPB has broad undefined powers to regulate. It adds the word \"abuse\" to the more defined FTC termed of deceptive and unfairness. And abuse is akin to the FTC use of unfairness in the 1970s. And like the FTC, the CFPB -- like the FTC in those days, the CFPB prefers to use its discretion as opposed to a definition.   </p><p>      You can look at the effects of the CFPB on consumer credit and they've been significant, in the paper, I discuss the qualified mortgage rule and the criticism of the Federal Reserve on that rule in slowing the return of the housing market, and the adverse effect particularly on minorities.  </p><p>      Now, those who defend the CFPB sometimes raise behavioral economics, which is a recent challenge to the benefits of markets. In its extreme version, it's based on the idea that errors that -- and people, obviously, sometimes make mistakes. But the idea is that those errors are systematically irrational.  </p><p>      Now, some people will tell you that normal economics assumes that consumers have perfect knowledge in their economic calculators. Well, I was schooled by those normal economists, and I learned about transaction cost and imperfect information from those individuals. So, I think that that parody of economics is simply inaccurate.   </p><p>      Moreover, there are numerous problems with using behavioral economics. For one thing, the behavioralists don't agree on which biases they talk about are relevant. For another thing, there is not empirical evidence to support what they want to do. For yet another problem is that consumers invest in various ways to improve decision-making.   </p><p>      Now, I'm not saying there aren't important papers and empirical work here to be done. I cite an example in the paper of the credit card market, where people do choose accurately and are learning from their mistakes. There are lots of papers like that in the healthcare market. I mean, in the credit market.   </p><p>      In the healthcare market, on the other hand, Fiona Scott Morton has written a very good paper where there are systematic -- there are systematic mistakes. Now, I believe that healthcare markets are different, but I would hope these hearings and the FTC pay attention to those empirical issues.   </p><p>      The second P, populism, is reflected in calls -- and Chairman Simons mentioned this -- on the left and the right to use antitrust to dismantle the highly successful companies, or at least the so-called tech companies, or at least regulate them as public utilities.  </p><p>      These are misguided calls. For one thing, what a tech or digital company is, is hard to know. We have new technologies but they're being diffused through the economy. Moreover, these companies have different positions in the market. Some have big market shares; some don't.   </p><p>      Equally important, we've been down the populist road before with disastrous consequences. John Nuechterlein and I discuss some of this history in a new paper that John will discuss in detail later. And let me talk about the highlights.  </p><p>      Before Wal-Mart and Amazon, another company used the same kind of tools to become the largest retailer in the United States for over 40 years. This company was so important, the company was the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company that John Updike, the young John Updike, used the company as the title in the setting for his iconic short story which every one of my generation had to read in high school. And what happened was A&amp;P success triggered a backlash, and the government went after A&amp;P for two decades.   </p><p>      First, they passed the Robinson-Patman Act which embarrassed the antitrust world for much longer than two decades, and took a long time for the antitrust world from which to recover.  </p><p>      This new legislation was not enough. First, the government prosecuted the A&amp;P successfully criminally. They still weren't done. They sued to break the A&amp;P up. Finally, a new administration came in, the Eisenhower Administration, and settled for some vertical divestiture.   </p><p>      The problem was this long war of attrition caused the leadership of the A&amp;P to focus on fighting the government, not on its new competition. And today, all that's left of the A&amp;P are the coffees. Eight O'clock, I think it's called Eight O'clock. And the company itself is gone.   </p><p>      Now, it's true that the FTC largely abandoned RP in the 1970s, but there are two vestiges of populism that were strong at the FTC in the 1970s and the first was predatory pricing.  </p><p>      There were three important cases, probably the most prominent of which was the coffee case. In the -- in the early -- in the mid-1970s, Proctor &amp; Gamble, then the most feared marketer of consumer goods had Folgers Coffee. Folgers Coffee expanded into the heartland, into the East, into the heartland of Maxwell House.  </p><p>      Maxwell House General Foods responded, massive price war, benefiting consumers enormously. How did the FTC respond? It sued General Foods for responding against the best marketer in the world. I'm not making that up either. And there were -- and there were other such cases. And a call for return to predatory pricing is an important plank of the new populist agenda.   </p><p>      Another bulwark of the 1970s antitrust was reliance on the simple market concentration doctrine. And the concentration levels were levels that no one today would regard as significant.   </p><p>      The prominent example was four firms with 50 percent share. This theory was sometimes married to a populist animus toward bigness, which led the commission to seek vertical disintegration of the then very unconcentrated oil industry.   </p><p>      And through 1980, the FTC was pursuing de-concentration long after the majority of the economics profession had dominated or had abandoned extreme versions of the market concentration doctrine.  </p><p>      Well, let me conclude. With the creation of the CFPB, the FTC has another federal agency performing each mission. The original CFPB model, mirroring the 1970s FTC, contrasts to the modern FTC. Perhaps the regulatory world runs in cycles. But one hopes that the FTC will not be in a future Groundhog Day where it awakes each morning to 1975.  </p><p>      In contrast, consider the current, in antitrust -- I'm sorry -- consider the impact of the current reformers who which to return antitrust to focus less on consumers and more on protecting less efficient businesses.   </p><p>      Imagine how the companies they would now punish would have fared in their desired legal environment. Once the newcomers had grown beyond a certain size, perhaps by the late 1990s, their lawyers would have counseled them to be cautious about expansion, innovation, and price cutting, lest they face antitrust liability for disadvantaging their less efficient rivals.   </p><p>      Luckily, because this advice would have badly misstated antitrust law, lawyers did not give it. Let us pray for the sake of American consumers that such advice never becomes sound. Rather than condemn innovation, whether in the 1930s or today, we should applaud.  </p><p>      Companies like the so-called tech giants have been built from the ground up in the United States rather than in Europe or China, largely because the U.S. legal environment is stable, predictable, and uniquely hospitable to vigorous paradigm-shattering competition by all businesses. That legal environment is a hallmark of American exceptionalism, long may it continue. Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Okay. Thank you, Tim. And we'll turn to Jim Rill now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILL</emphasis>:  Thank you, Bilal. It's indeed an honor to be here, the commemoration of the work that was done by Bob Pitofsky and the leadership of the commission in 1995. And a particular honor to me. I go back relationships with Bob in 1969 when he was basically the author of the first Kirkpatrick Report on the Federal Trade Commission, and we worked together in the ABA.   </p><p>      In 1992, he was a very important and direct consultant on the 1992 horizontal merger guidelines. So, it's indeed an honor to be a participant in these, in these programs.   </p><p>      I want to talk today about the developments in the antitrust world that's created by the globalization of antitrust, which I think is one of the most significant developments in the competition world in the last decade since the first Pitofsky hearings.   </p><p>      I think the most important thing we can see is there's been a cascade, a tsunami of antitrust agencies across the world. In the 1995, there was a handful of agencies that had antitrust, and some agencies that had an antitrust law -- Japan, a gift of 1946, really didn't enforce it.   </p><p>      Now, we see something like 130 or more agencies with an antitrust regime. And those agencies that have had an antitrust regime are increasingly engaged in enforcement, often with a very controversial, very controversial, very controversial results.   </p><p>      So, what we need to think about, what I think needs to be thought about at the commission and the other antitrust agencies is what is the response of the antitrust agencies to this global tsunami of antitrust agencies around the world. And I don't want to suggest that that's a bad thing. I think it's a good thing, properly founded, property principled, properly directed, because I think a sound competition policy is essential to the operation of a market economy.   </p><p>      So, what have the agencies done, and what is the challenge facing them in the future? The agencies were responsible, I think particularly the FTC and the Department of Justice in the formation of the International Competition Network in 1990 -- in 2001, following on the report of the Department of Justice International Competition Policy Advisory Committee, the ICPAC that was put together in 1997 and reissued its report in 2000.   </p><p>      The International Competition Network was founded on the platform of the Fordham Program in 1991 with 12 members. Tim Muris was very instrumental in putting that together. Now, we have well over 100 members, 100 agencies that are members of the International Competition Network. And the ICN has been extremely important in producing guidance that's based on market economics and due process for its member countries and for other countries around the world, essentially soft guidance, but nonetheless effective and responsible guidance.   </p><p>      The ICN has produced merger notification and procedure guidelines, has put out through its unilateral conduct working group of guidelines on predatory pricing, guidelines on dominance. Most interestingly I think the work that the ICN has done in the area of procedural due process and the antitrust, the working group -- excuse me, the working group on agency effectiveness which was headed -- task force was headed by the Federal Trade Commission, the work of Randy Tritell and Paul O'Brien has been extremely effective in putting out guidelines on due process, guiding principles, annotated guidance and similar documents.   </p><p>      These are extremely important contributions that are made towards convergence, if not harmonization in the antitrust world. Similarly, the OECD again under U.S. leadership has put out a protocol on hardcore competition. Also, documents on the merger notification and procedure really anticipating ahead of time the ICN's work in that area. The OECD has also issued a very monumental report under the leadership of then-Chairman and then Assistant Attorney General Varney on due process and procedural fairness.   </p><p>      So, most recently, in 2017, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission issued revised guidance for international enforcement. This guidance document I think broke some new ground. And providing for the government's involvement in advocacy across the globe, that it would attempt to foment adherence to sound principles of not only process, but substance and would advocate decisions as the occasion rose in particular situations.   </p><p>      It extolled the benefit of bilateral agreements which the United States antitrust agencies have several, calling for cooperation in particular cases, it set forth principles of comity, and establish a principle that criticized extraterritorial reach of antitrust enforcement where that extraterritorial reach was not based on the immediate impact, substantial reasonably foreseeable direct, immediate impact on the host nation, consistent with our legal principles in that particular area.   </p><p>      On the question of its advocacy, what we have is a fairly general statement, however, not one that gets into the specificity of when and how that advocacy might be best advanced and effected and implemented. And I think that's a challenge as we will indicate going ahead. The ICN, the International Competition Network, is continuing its effort towards promoting convergence in substance and procedure through workshops and similar efforts to bring about convergence and harmonization and sound principles.   </p><p>      Non-governmental agencies as well since the last time, since the 1995 hearings increased their efforts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has issued a so-called expert report -- I say \"so-called\" because I was on it, so therefore I've got to be modest -- expert report on due process and the way forward, somewhat controversial in that it advocated the establishment of a cabinet-level coordinating committee for dealing with international antitrust.   </p><p>      I think one head issue that I personally had some -- it was on the report, had some skepticism as to its efficacy although there should be more coordination among the agencies of the federal government. The American Bar Association has had several task forces, several reports in this area, a due process report and currently a program going forward, soon to be I think finalized on sort of a, if you will, not a report card but an analysis of the implementation of due process, task force headed by my partner, John Taladay and Melanie Akin (ph). Also, the ABA is soon to present a paper on the use of public policy issues in antitrust globally.   </p><p>      That is the extent to which non-antitrust factors flying under the flag of antitrust tend to adulterate -- that's my pejorative, not theirs, I expect -- tend to adulterate the efficacy and substantial foundation for antitrust enforcement. The ICC, International Chamber of Commerce has issued a report in this area that is of significance and extols again the need for global consensus and fair procedures. The private sector is active -- is it enough active? No, but increasingly active in this particular area.   </p><p>      So, what are the challenges going forward? There are limits I think to the efficacy of soft guidance, of soft convergence. It's necessary, essential, but is it enough? Is it sufficient? My answer to that is I think you need to go beyond it. There are -- there's no structured mechanism right now for establishing, if you will, ambassadors (ph) for evaluating the extent to which the guidance of the various international organizations and national organizations that I referenced are being actually implemented and then can -- then followed in the nations around the world, including sometimes I might say the United States.   </p><p>      We see action in China involving a merger by Coca-Cola which I think has questionable economic foundation, the denial of a transaction involving NXP which had been approved by every other agency in the world on grounds that are difficult to discern any kind of link through it to sound antitrust. We seeing in Korea in expanded reach for extraterritoriality, in an area where there may be no effect, whatever on consumer welfare in Korea. We see in Taiwan enforcement actions with no printed, published and maybe not even any practiced sound standards for due process.   </p><p>      All of these issues I think are a challenge, a huge challenge to global antitrust including the United States going forward. And sometimes, frankly, the United States has been criticized for its use of CFIU.S., criticized overseas by its use of CFIU.S. to in effect undermine sound antitrust analysis and engage in national championship work. I'm not trying to agree. I don't agree with that in many respects, but I know that has been criticized overseas and recently.   </p><p>      In a speech, former Director General -- former commissioner for competition of the European Union Mario Monti said that Europe has much sounder antitrust leadership, foundation, correctness than the United States. We have to be aware of that and be sensitive to it.   </p><p>      So, what should be the response going forward? And I don't pretend that I have any particular wisdom here, but throw out some ideas and actions that I've seen. First, there is an increasing, I think, demand, interest for the United States agencies to become directly involved in individual enforcement actions overseas where the effectiveness on important interests of the United States, not to protect the U.S. champion but where there's an important interest to the United States that bears on effective competition policy.   </p><p>      We have in our agreements and then in other international principles, mechanisms for cooperation, notification, and transparency. These I suggest should be implemented. They have been implemented by the United States. In BoeingMcDonnell Douglas for example, the U.S. was very much involved in attempting to I think put on -- I'll say put on the right track the European Commission's analysis of that transaction even to the point where this guy was an antitrust professor at Arkansas, I think named William Clinton got involved in the lobbying before the European Commission on that transaction.   </p><p>      The actions of the Federal Trade Commission in certain circumstances have been salutary. I think in discussing a matter involving Intel in Japan, it was effective outcome. Press reports indicate there was effective outcome involved in U.S. involvement with Qualcomm, a principal issue in China. And of course the -- I'm not sure how, I think effectively about greater convergence in understanding and consultation, the U.S. criticism of the European and the commission's action in G.E. Honeywell.   </p><p>      We must respect foreign agencies' interpretation of their own law. We don't necessarily need to surrender to it. In our efforts to converge, to consult, I think the decision by my classmate, Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the vitamin C case sets a good principle for the question of respect, but not total deference to foreign law.   </p><p>      So, I think what we need to do going forward, what I suggest would be an appropriate role for the Federal Trade Commission and consider the really excellent work it's done and the work that the Department of Justice has done. I think the Federal Trade Commission under the guidance of Randy Tritell has made great strides in this area. But the question is testing the implementation.   </p><p>      And I'd like to close with reference to the initiative that's recently been announced and promoted by Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim to establish a multilateral framework for procedure in antitrust cases. He recently spoke at the Fordham Conference indicating that there's significant progress in that area, that some 12 or so countries are signing on. We haven't seen what they're singing on to in detail yet, but signing on to the principle. It's a major first step by a national antitrust agency to attempt to persuade other countries that there needs to be some system -- joint system for assisting in the implementation and review, not a scorecard, but a review of the extent to which the guidance document for the so-called soft guidance is actually adopted and fomented in the international arena.   </p><p>      I think that is the challenge going forward to the FTC, to the Department of Justice, and I think it's a challenge of enormous importance for international antitrust and international competition policy. And so, with that, thank you very much.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you, Jim.   </p><p>      And, Alysa, (inaudible) I note that I'm very envious of the ICPAC, that they had apparently three to four years to do their report.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTNIK</emphasis>:  So, switching gears to consumer protection and privacy, and like most consumer protection lawyers, I have pictures.   </p><p>      So, I do want to first strongly support the commission's objectives for these hearings. I'm a firm believer in that there is value in self-examination and being willing to both solicit and consider constructive feedback from constituents and practitioners inside and out. And indeed, from a similar process, the 1995 hearings positively shaped subsequent FTC policy and approach and one would expect similar outcomes from these hearings.   </p><p>      So, taking the time machine, let's see if we can get there, back to the 1990s and while some of us might have had Mariah Carey on the radio, hopefully no one is going to raise their hands on that, here at the FTC in 1995 hearings had technology front and center in the focus.   </p><p>      And there, the focus was innovative changes and convergence happening with the online marketplace, television, cyberspace, even radical new technology issues such as purchasing compact disks over your telephone. And notably even then, the FTC was already anticipating issues with the amount and the type of data collected online, who was accessing that data, how many people who were accessing that data, cyber security issues with the data and the associated other consumer protection considerations.   </p><p>      The resulting Pitofsky Report from those hearings provided an effective roadmap for consumer protection business guidance and policy for over 20 years. Tim Muris mentioned durability. This policy has been extremely durable. That report centered on several key tenets:  one, consumer sovereignty. This is a point that's been echoed in the 1980 FTC policy on unfairness and in decades before in adjudications and business guidance, the idea that we would give consumers access to material information and allow them to make their own choice without regulatory intervention, to do it conveniently.   </p><p>      Two, the agency would prioritize enforcement to fight fraud and deception and unfair business practices that caused consumers harm. The agency also would support industry self-regulation as a way to make limited agency resources go further and to provide businesses with greater clarity on compliance expectations. And finally, the commission would provide consumer education to empower consumers to navigate through emerging marketplaces.   </p><p>      And while some might argue that the application of these concepts has ebbed and flowed over the years, they're viewed by many as the successful foundation to the FTC's approach in consumer protection. It's an approach that is largely consensus-based. It's not largely political. It's measured and it intentionally considers competition concerns with those of consumer protection. It's also a framework that supports our nation of innovation. We are experiencing and witnessing a technology revolution that has no end in sight and a robust marketplace that provides feedback when a line has been crossed. Through both consumer choice, a vibrant press and government enforcement.   </p><p>      And while there may be growing pains from time-to-time and sometimes criticisms that the FTC does not act fast enough to prevent unlawful business conduct, it is the flexible nature of the FTC's Section 5 authority that is such a critical part of our country's economic success.   </p><p>      Now, like any balanced framework, we should continue to ask tough questions to determine if and what changes may be warranted so that the agency's consumer protection mission can continue to be fulfilled for the next 20 years.   </p><p>      And in looking at the comments filed in response to these hearings, these certainly raise several themes. One of the main themes that Chairman Simons started out with was the concept of technology, whether the technology marketplace of today and tomorrow requires the change to the FTC's organizational structure and allocation of resources. And just as the 1996 Pitofsky Report following those hearings observe that there would be challenges to the agency's consumer protection mission with the evolving technology marketplace, today's cyber threats and technology changes and innovations will absolutely test the FTC's expertise and its resources.   </p><p>      Technology plays an integral part of the consumer experience whether at work, at home, in educational settings, healthcare, facilitates the way we interact with each other and with the world around us. So, it's no surprise then that technology should play such a key role in most of the FTC's consumer protection enforcement cases. And given the technology emphasis of commerce today and tomorrow, does the current FTC's organizational structure and investment of resources in technology expertise reflect the present and foreseeable needs in order to fulfill the consumer protection mission.   </p><p>      One of the second themes and many might call it a pain point reflected in the comments is the ever-growing patchwork of consumer protection and privacy laws around the globe and here in the United States. The 1996 Pitofsky Report recognized the obstacles that a multitude of conflicting laws would pose for commerce, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses and new entrants. Today, these compliance obstacles have only grown, particularly in the area of privacy where there appears to be a race to become the most comprehensive in regulating data practices.   </p><p>      And given the examples that we are seeing in Europe, California and elsewhere, it remains an open question on whether the commission's risk-based approach will have to yield to a national and uniform approach to privacy. But that may be easier said than done with respect to passing federal legislation particularly in an election year.   </p><p>      So, in the near term and in the absence of a uniform federal standard, what type of guidance and policy leadership can the agency provide that could be helpful to the national and global discussion on the costs and the benefits of more prescriptively regulating business practices?   </p><p>      And the third theme from the comments underscored a point that this agency has always faced, where to focus its enforcement efforts, what shall be the priorities given finite and limited resources. And with lots of shiny objects and headlines to choose from, the agency has most advanced its consumer protection mission when it's focused on business practices causing real harm.   </p><p>      Financial and physical harm have rightly had the agency's attention, but importantly, given the role of technology in our lives, the agency under then-acting Chairman Ohlhausen has also explored how informational injury can cause real harm and how the agency can measure such harm and seek to deter and to remedy unlawful business practices with such results.   </p><p>      Doing more with less also might involve all aspects of the commission's in-house expertise with more visible collaboration with the bureaus of competition and economics. Indeed, the unfairness prong of Section 5 requires that competition be taken into account and more transparency on this involvement in the competition analysis in consumer protection cases would provide helpful guidance to businesses, which in turn will help consumers.   </p><p>      The last theme that was raised that I'll touch on by the comments and which played an important role in the Pitofsky Report as well is how important the FTC's supporting and incentivizing company participation and meaningful self-regulatory programs is. They're not a substitute for government oversight, but they can enhance the agency's consumer protection mission with a lot less cost. History has shown that self-regulation is more nimble and able to move more quickly to address innovation and technology changes.   </p><p>      And when the FTC promotes the use of self-regulation and incentivizes companies to embrace such standards, industry responds time and time again and consumers benefit directly from this carrot rather than stick approach, incentivizing rather than purely focusing on punitive deterrence.   </p><p>      So, I will keep my comments shorter. It lead me to concluding remarks that with the rapid changes that were happening and all the discussion around technology, we're largely discussing many of the same types of issues that were discussed in some form at the last set of hearings in 1995. And as we hear from many voices during these hearings, I can say from my personal experience working with startups, working with large companies, new entrants, those that have been around for decades, most companies are motivated to do the right thing while also remaining competitively viable.   </p><p>      Straightforward laws that do not pick winners or losers, clear regulatory guidance, and vigorous support of self-regulation enable companies to achieve those goals without unnecessarily fencing in opportunity or innovation. And for the fraudsters and companies that are bent on causing consumer harm, the FTC has its tools -- existing tools -- to address that.   </p><p>      Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Okay. Well, Alysa, thank you. We're going to -- and thank you for getting us almost back on schedule. That's why friends know, being off schedule just a few minutes would be a major achievement in my life.   </p><p>      So, anyway, we're going to take about a 10-minute break. So, let's come back here just a little slightly after 10:30 and we'll start up again.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Okay. Thank you. I just want to remind everybody that we do have some of my FTC colleagues collecting question cards. So if you have a question for the panel members, just write it on the card, raise your hand, we'll pick it up, and we will try to get to it. But before we turn to both of sort of the panel Q&amp;A and audience Q&amp;A, we're going to ask separately, both Jan McDavid and David Vladeck to both comment on what they've heard and honestly comment on whatever they'd like to comment on.  </p><p>      But I'm sure it'll be germane. So I'll first turn it over to Jan and then turn it over to David when Jan is complete.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCDAVID</emphasis>:  Thank you, Bilal. I want to applaud the Federal Trade Commission for again using its statutory authority to consider whether changes in our economy require adjustments in the FTC's enforcement priorities. Such hearings were part of the FTC's original statutory mandate and have been used very effectively throughout its history most notably in the Pitofsky hearings that were discussed extensively this morning.  </p><p>      I'm honored to participate again as I did in the Pitofsky hearings. And I'm returning to my antitrust roots here at Georgetown because my antitrust career started my final semester in law school at Georgetown when I studied antitrust law with Bob Pitofsky.   </p><p>      Hearings provide the FTC an opportunity to step back and consider broad philosophical issues without the pressure of fact and time deadlines arising out in particular proceedings. That's a real luxury that most agencies don't have and the FTC does.  </p><p>      That kind of introspection allows the FTC to identify opportunities for improvement. It also offers an opportunity for democratic participation, which is one of the objectives recently outlined by commissioner Chapra in his paper last week.  </p><p>      I speak here as a practitioner who advises clients everyday on antitrust issues. And I share the FTC's view. That competition produces the best, most innovative, lowest price products and services for consumers. Most antitrust enforcement actually takes place in conference rooms in law firms and boardrooms in corporations where people like me advice our clients on where the lines are and how they can achieve their business objectives without crossing those lines.  </p><p>      Our ability to do that effectively is significantly enhanced if our clients know that the antitrust cop is on the beat. That was true in the Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations because antitrust has always enjoyed bipartisan support. And based on our early impressions, it's also true with the current Federal Trade Commission and Antitrust Division.  </p><p>      I've always viewed the antitrust laws as sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing market conditions, such as those involving the growth of technologies or foreign competitors. It also has been sufficiently flexible to be applied across a broad range of industries involving defense, healthcare, consumer goods or technologies, which don't particularly have anything in common.  </p><p>      The antitrust statutes as they've been interpreted by the agencies and the courts in recent years, in the last 30 years or so, provide a framework that knowledgeable council can apply as we consider the unique facts brought to us by our clients. And of course, we also bring the bear the economic concepts that are so important to underlying antitrust analysis today. Over the course of my career, I've seen the development of sound antitrust doctrine rooted in a principled analysis, and above all the positive role, the economic analysis played starting really with the Supreme Court's decision in General Dynamics, which was decided just before my final law school exam by Bob and the GTE Sylvania decisions and leading to various iterations, for example, of the merger guidelines.   </p><p>      In contrast, one of my mentors, former FTC commissioner Tom Leary, said that during his early career, when they would be defending a merger before the agency, they would say, \"God forbid it would achieve any efficiencies,\" because that was suspect in the '60s and early 1970s.   </p><p>      As I was trying to do antitrust research as a young lawyer and as a law student, I had a very hard time discerning any consistent thread through the cases I was reading. And that made it really hard to advise clients. That's not true anymore, because we have a framework that lawyers and even our clients understand.  </p><p>      During my career, antitrust analysis has been grounded in fundamental principles and focused on consumer welfare. Contrary to the concerns expressed by some, prices are not the only touch point in our analysis. We have handled many matters in which issues like innovation and product quality were much more central than price.   </p><p>      And in my experience, the agencies have done a very good job of identifying those issues and resolving them in the matters. The way they have done so has also made it possible for advisors like me to tell our clients where the antitrust lines are. I'm a progressive Democrat. So you might expect that I would be applauding the development of populist antitrust theories. But I think that including populous antitrust concept would make the task that I undertake for my clients much more difficult.  </p><p>      Instead of well-established principles grounded in consumer welfare and sound economic analysis, we would be applying amorphous concepts of bigness and fairness, some of which turned traditional principles on their heads, such as lower prices that don't have the underpinnings of a predatory pricing analysis, or penalizing large successful technology company simply for being successful because they created new products and services that consumers genuinely desired.  </p><p>      This could return us to the era of Von's Grocery where the dissent lamented, \"the court grounds its conclusion solely on the impressionistic assertion that the Los Angeles retail food industry is becoming concentrated because the number of single-store concerns has declined.\" This led Justice Stewart to complain that \"the sole consistency I can find in the antitrust laws is that the government always wins.\"  </p><p>      But even that wouldn't be true in a populist system because ultimately we don't have an administrative system in the United States. We have a system of enforcement and the agencies and private plaintiffs bear the burden of proof. In Europe and many other countries, the government can simply say no.   </p><p>      Here, they have to go to court, and they do so grounded in facts and economic analysis that supports their case, but with a framework that everyone understands. Where there are legitimate concerns about fairness or employment effects, for example, those issues should be addressed under different regimes as it's done today with the CFIU.S., unless as in the case for example of the no poach cases, there is a legitimate antitrust concern directly affecting employment and arising out of particular conduct.   </p><p>      Antitrust is a well calibrated tool to achieve competition and consumer welfare. But it is poorly designed to tackle social issues that are more appropriately addressed under other kinds of legislation. We should respect the limitations of antitrust.   </p><p>      And finally, antitrust analysis that includes amorphous concept of bigness and fairness could lend itself to politically motivated enforcement, which we certainly should eschew, especially now in the current political environment.  </p><p>      Thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  David? We'll turn to David now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Okay. Thank you. Let me start by thanking Chairman Simons for holding these hearings. I think this is the right way for the commission, for a new commission to get its bearings and to figure out what its priorities are going to be and what its agenda should be.   </p><p>      I also think it's right to honor Bob Pitofsky, his legacy still looms large at the FTC when I was there, I'm sure it still does. The influence he's had, not simply on the antitrust side of the agency, but on the consumer protection side is enormous. And it's only fitting to do this here at Georgetown Law School.  </p><p>      So I generally agree with Alysa. I'm going to try not to repeat the points that she made. What I'd like to talk about or what I think are three-main challenges the commission faces going forward. And the first and this I think Alysa brought up is tech, tech, tech. Virtually everything the agency does today has some connection with emerging technologies.   </p><p>      When Chairman Leibowitz and I got to the FTC, we did not have a tech infrastructure. We did not have a single technician on staff, to the extent we needed to engage in forensic analysis, we had to outsource it. Today, because each of the successive chairs has built upon the tech infrastructure that we started to build, the agency has more technology capacity than ever.   </p><p>      But I still wonder whether it's sufficient. The agency needs deep expertise in things like artificial intelligence. It needs the forensic ability to conduct investigations in data breaches and in other kinds of consumer injuries. We need better forensics, better tools. And so, one challenge I think the agency faces going forward is to make sure that its infrastructure, its resources match the challenges that the agency faces.   </p><p>      So I think that's one. One of my former colleagues, Cradmaker (ph), Professor Cradmaker, suggested that maybe it was time that the FTC added a new bureau, a bureau of technology. I don't know whether that's the right way to address the technology deficits that the FTC faces. But that's something that ought to be considered.  </p><p>      Second, the challenges of protecting consumers in a digital economy. Now, the FTC in 2012 issued a report that tries to set out a framework about how consumer protection matches the FTC mandate. And I think there's a lot of very valuable advice in that report. I would urge the new commissioners to dust it off and take a look because it provides, I think, a blueprint at least for dealing with some of the difficult questions the commission is going to face.   </p><p>      For example, automated decision-making, I'm not necessarily a foe of artificial intelligence. After all, we all know that human decision making is not necessarily great. Right? But it provides all sorts of challenges for regulators. It's a black box system. You can't interrogate an algorithm and it can be a breeding ground for disparate treatment that is based on impermissible factors.   </p><p>      And rooting out those kinds of problems is very difficult for the agency. Data driven offers in pricing. The marketplace is full of variable pricing and variable offers. I mean there have been challenges about Facebook's ads for housing and so forth.  </p><p>      These are very difficult challenges the agency faces to ensure fairness in the marketplace. And the lack of transparency in the algorithmic decision-making process runs a real risk that at least some consumers are going to face tyranny by algorithm. The commission needs to figure out how it can be an effective regulator in this space.   </p><p>      It faces enforcement challenges. Yesterday, there was a New York Times article about the New Mexico attorney general bring a COPPA case and criticizing the FTC for not beating his office to the punch. Well, COPPA enforcement has been a thorn on the side of the agency since apps were developed.   </p><p>      The app market, the app developer market is highly diffused. There are thousands of people making apps, some in their parents' basement. And it's very hard, unless you're going to carpet bomb the industry, to have an enforcement regime that really works well. And now the agency's brought many, many CAPA cases and it's done so against high profile violators. But that's a problem.  </p><p>      And Alysa talked about the usefulness of self-regulation. This is in the area where we've encouraged self-regulation. We actually detailed a lawyer to work out of our San Francisco office to be an outreach person to the app development community or encouraging some kind of self-regulatory body. But we didn't succeed.  </p><p>      So there are some enforcement challenges that the agency faces as well that are magnified by outdated statutes that the agency has to enforce. Neither (inaudible) nor some of the other statutes that were enacted before anyone could envision a digital economy like this need to be updated. And I would hope that the commission can work with Congress to do so.  </p><p>      I think the lack of civil penalties in Section 5 cases has been a serious lack for the agency, particularly in data breach cases. The RAND Institute is not a number of studies, making clear that the economic incentives, particularly for box stores and other kinds of consumer-facing companies don't push hard enough to ensure robust security defenses.   </p><p>      That is it's economically rational to risk a data breach because the cost of strengthening one's defenses may outweigh. I think civil penalty availability in those kinds of cases would add a necessary deterrent. And my help stem the (inaudible) ID theft. I think we need to update the unfairness doctrine.  </p><p>      It's interesting because the unfairness doctrine seems to at least be interpreted by some to require some form of economic or economic-like harm. But the statutory mandated the FTCs to prevent unfair and deceptive practices. Now I try to remediate them when they take place. And there are many harms that are just not actually well-remediated by money.   </p><p>      I mean for example, the Ashley Madison data breach. This was a secret dating site. Well, marriages broke up, people commit suicide. These are serious harms that ought to be prevented. There's at least an argument that the Unfairness Statement as it's currently constituted doesn't really take into account some of these reputational injuries that have been made possible by a digital economy.   </p><p>      My last point is the regulation of big data. There's now pervasive data collection. It's ubiquitous. In fact, the last bastion in privacy, our homes is now yet another side of data collection. People have always on, always love devices of the internet of things. They're going to put censors in people's homes, all of these -- these serve useful purposes. But they involve enormous data collection.  </p><p>      And we need to figure out how to protect consumers in this area of ubiquitous data collection. We don't have laws that really deal with this. The aggregation of data is a real sort of enticement to data thieves. So, Apam Ohm (ph), who worked at the FTC when John and I were there, wrote in a law review article about 10 years ago where he forecasted there might become a time where there would be databases of ruin.   </p><p>      That is, that the data collection would be so ubiquitous that whatever fact that you would be mortified to have revealed to the public or to other people, that those facts will be in a database. Well, given the ability of data sharing, data lakes, the ubiquitous movement of data, there really is no answer to those questions now.  </p><p>      And those are questions that the FTC has to address. We did -- when I was at the FTC, we did a 6B on the data collection by data brokers. And I think that was a good start. And I think one of the things that I'd urge the commission to think about is using a 6B authority to get a better handle on basically just how consumer data flows, where does it go, who has access to it, what kinds of constraints, if any, ought to be imposed?   </p><p>      So I think -- I commend the FTC for holding these hearings. I think this is going to be a challenging but interesting time. And I urge that the commission think about these things. Thank you so much.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  So thank you, David. What I'd like to do now is I have a series of questions and in frankness we've shared them with the group in advance. But, of course, they were prepared before I knew what anybody would say. What I'd like to do is first ask the panelists, maybe to ask questions of each other or comment on what others have said.   </p><p>      And because he has to leave at 11:30, and in fact squeezed us in to do this panel, I'd like to ask Jason if he's got some thoughts on what he's heard, particularly because he comes from this -- from a different perspective or different background than the rest of us. And then I'll ask folks maybe to put some questions to Jason.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FURMAN</emphasis>:  Yes. I guess we've heard two references to populist antitrust. And I'm not sure whether I agree or disagree with those comments. If those comments are saying you should replace the current disciplined approach with the sort of wooly-headed if you don't like the company and you want to promote democracy and like ground your approach in something big and cosmic like that, then I certainly agree with you.  </p><p>      If what you're saying is that there were certain papers written decades ago and those papers are still a hundred percent correct, and we should base all everything on these tablets that were handed down and any change would be populist and barbarian, then I think I quite disagree with that. In fact, even some of the assumptions and arguments of people like Bork and Posner and others made, economists in IO have long known that they were quite fragile, and based on very specific assumptions that weren't very robust that the world was much more complicated.   </p><p>      As you said, Janet, people do take into account a broader set of considerations. But to some degree, economists need to do a better job of understanding this broader set of considerations too. So I think this is an evolving area.  </p><p>      As the chairman said at the very beginning of the remarks, I think that continued evolution is important. I think that if some of the macro evidence data and motivations that I said lends more impetus to that, I think that would be a welcome development and an important one. But I still would then use that to motivate -- you saying micro market by market techniques to think about cases, not some of those types of macro data.   </p><p>      But I don't think that irrelevant in motivating us to push further and think harder about ways that frankly enforcement has gotten more lax. And that has had deleterious consequences for the economy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Well, Tim, it looks like you want to -- yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Sure. Let me address the Chicago point about the sacred texts. Bruce Kobayashi and I published a paper subtitled \"Time To Let Go of the 20th Century.\" And -  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  When did you publish it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  2014. I think Bilal sent it to you. And what we said there -- essentially -- look, the way to think about Chicago is the way to think about the American revolutionaries. There was this revolutionary band of brothers. But what they were -- they were opposed to the old order. And the older order was overthrown.  </p><p>      But once it came to running a government, they split like Adams and Jefferson. If you take a list and put this in the paper, Baxter, Bork, Boman, Posner and Stigler, they either hadn't thought of or they disagreed radically on how to approach antitrust policy, mergers for example. Those guys were all over the lot from the most aggressive, Posner to the most restrictive, Bork.  </p><p>      And the point was they just hadn't thought about it. And when they did, they disagreed. And so, this idea, which is rife in this populist literature that there's this economic cult from the University of Chicago which dominates antitrust thinking is simply inaccurate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Any other reaction or anybody would like to put questions?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCDAVID</emphasis>:  I agree with Tim. But I also agree, Jason, that this has to be evolutionary. We don't regard them as the tablets that came down with Moses. Economic theory has evolved. We had three iterations in the merger guidelines. And the ones we have in place now actually reflect how the agencies have been analyzing mergers for quite a long time. And they introduced new concepts such as unilateral effects analysis that weren't in the original versions.  </p><p>      So we do evolve. But I am very concerned about the inability to discern the consistent thread that I found when I was a young lawyer, and I'm very worried about how clients are then going to have to handle this stuff.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILL</emphasis>:  Well, Jan, you've touched on merger guidelines. Let me ask a question that I have asked people to think about. And this is not been to reflect on a particular administration or not. But in 2010, the previous administration revised the horizontal merger guidelines and changed the whatever you want to call it, safety thresholds or presumption thresholds from HHI of 1800, post-merger HHI of 1800 being -- under some conditions presumed anti-competitive to level -- HHI level of 2400.   </p><p>      And also, in fairness, I think Tim Muris and I wrote an article suggesting that some change was appropriate and we may have landed at around 2400. But let me put that out there. I mean to be able to think the -- the thresholds in the merger guidelines should be adjusted downward.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCDAVID</emphasis>:  Well, I deal with the guidelines all the time. And my view of the HHIs is that they are useful as an initial screen to identify the deals that need additional scrutiny. And then they show up in the complaint if the agency challenges the deal as part of the basis who either doing so, and in between we don't talk about them very much because we talk about competitive effects analysis.   </p><p>      Where is the real competition that takes place? And having numbers attached to it and squaring market shares creates a sense of precision about this process that simply doesn't exist in reality or in the way the guidelines are applied. So I don't think it's necessary. I have clients who come to me and say, \"Well, as I run the HHIs, we've got an 1800.\" And then I discover that they've defined the market in a way that the agencies would never agree with. And therefore, the client has assumed something will be fine, when in fact, they're going to run into a real buzzsaw.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Look, the guidelines do tell you something significant if you think -- forget the HHIs, think about -- I heard John Baker gave a good talk on this Friday after our retrospective analysis came out when I was chairman. Think about it in terms of the number of significant competitors.  </p><p>      Bill Baxter, we argued with him when he put the guiidelines out in '82. Six to five was his marginal case and we wanted to make it five to four. But Bill, Bill was a structuralist, much more than modern people are and he thought that there wasn't very many competitors, six or five. Jim Rill essentially, when he put out his guidelines, made it much more of the focus that Jan was talking about.  </p><p>      But when they did the guidelines in 2010, they were relying on data that said four to three was the marginal case. And in fact, John Kwoka, among others, had published papers out of the FTC's line of business data that showed the importance of the strong number three to ensuring competition. But it's the marginal case. There are lots of four to three's challenged and occasionally higher.   </p><p>      But it does turn on a lot of factors. But the number of significant, if you want very simple tests, the number of significant competitors and how consumers react if they're significant business consumers, those -- answer to those two questions predicts a fair number of the results.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCDAVID</emphasis>:  And on the point of the number effective competitors, the FTC has done a number of reports, looking back at its data about the deals that challenged, the deals that it didn't challenge and what the factors were. And those papers which talk about how many competitors there were in deals of the challenged, whether there were customer complaints, whether there were bad documents, range of other things. Those are really useful guidance. And it's terrific work that the FTC has done. I wish the division would join in doing that kind of analysis.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FURMAN</emphasis>:  I mean just briefly on the previous one, Tim, I thought you were much more modest about the Chicago school in this discussion than you were in your remarks. Your remarks actually claimed that they had accomplished quite a lot in terms of changing the way antitrust was. And I think that's right. That was -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Well, they overthrew the old order. That was forty years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FURMAN</emphasis>:  Right. But anyway, I don't think we need to -- so I think sort of everyone treats them that way. I don't think one needs to re-litigate that. I think the question is do we need to make some changes. On the HHI, I would just do the average of whatever Fiona and John think it should be. But I think the argument for raising them also involved focusing and making sure you were refocusing and being vigorous above them in terms of a screen and everything else you're taking into account.   </p><p>      So I think it's not just the number, but a whole bunch of other things. And some of that is also frankly dependent on the courts. When you're bringing hospital cases and you're still losing hospital cases even when you have, I think, unanimous commission voting for them, that means there's a set of thinking, some of which was shaped in the past and is -- that needs to probably be modernized and updated to deal with changing research, including issues like wages, which I think is an important one when thinking about hospitals.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Well, the FTC is mostly winning, as the chairman said, mostly winning hospital mergers. And the problem was there was this silly belief in the Elzinga-Hogarty test. And we got Ken -- I went to Ken and Ken testified, he had very -- two very simple propositions. He said, \"I can't believe anybody would apply that test to hospitals.\"  </p><p>      And second, \"I can't believe anybody would pay me to say anything so obvious.\" And those two -- those two propositions, believe it or not, helped carry the day in two circuit courts very recently blessed the FTC's opinion. But Jason, you're right in this sense, because these cases are decided out there by individual district court judges, the FTC actually had to overturn some of the district court judges in circuits. But I think the FTC's way of looking at it is correct. And it mostly wins. But obviously, in the world of individual judges, you could get some variance.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Let me ask -- I know Jim have some comments.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILL</emphasis>:  Just really quickly. I think what probably wasn't recognized very much in the change from the '82 guidelines to the '92 guidelines was a treatment of the structural paradigm. If you recall in the '82 guidelines that there's certain concentration levels of the guideline that provided there would be a likelihood of challenge.  </p><p>      In the '92 guideline, we said, this is presumption that's carried on with further analysis and then went into then the other factors including entry and competitive nature of the marketplace, which I think that's the major change from the '82 to '92 guidelines. I think one of the interesting things about the 2010 guidelines, very creative and very interesting. was probably in order, is the distinction between the analytical framework and the guidelines and the analytic framework when the commission goes to court.   </p><p>      The 2010 guidelines are very, I don't say critical but somewhat almost dismissively market definition issues, as a proxy for the -- base for the analysis. Shortly after those guidelines, we not only analyzed, the commission went to court.   </p><p>      And if you look at its brief in the Polypore case, it doesn't appear that the 2010 guidelines existed. They were very much the traditional analysis, '82, '92 approach. So I think there is a distinction that one has to draw between what the agencies do in their analysis, which is obviously extremely important if you don't want to go to court, and the practice of the agency's -- put into their court pleadings, which are more traditional because I think the judges had become comfortable and accepting the analytical framework of the '82, '92 guideline approach. So I think there's a distinction there that we have to be aware of.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Well, if I could -- I don't want to forget the other mission. Actually, the FTC is a bigger consumer protection agency in both dollars in people than it is antitrust. And if you ever go out as an official, and we've got some here and do an interview, unless there's a big antitrust case in the press, the questions are overwhelmingly going to be about consumer protection.  </p><p>      I think David is 100 percent right about not -- strictly non-monetary protection. I as a young scholar wrote a couple of papers about how contract law protects subjective value. But I'm not at all sure you need to revise the unfairness guideline. I think another speech would be also because the FTC has protected that non-monetary, as David mentioned, the first -- the first security breach case that we've got and it was when I was chairman involved Eli Lilly where what happened was a non -- not just poorly trained, an employee who wasn't trained at all managed to send out a list to the world of -- I think it was 600 people who were taking Prozac.   </p><p>      And email addresses are very easily identifiable. A lot of people have their names, certainly their last names. And obviously we thought that was -- that was private information that ought to be protected. And you could -- you could spin a case of monetary loss, but utility functions when I talked about those economists who trained me, Gary Becker was one of them and he was one of the first to put other things in utility functions.   </p><p>      And the -- that's the way the FTC thinks and David's right that the commission ought to stress that. I think you can read that in the Unfairness Statement now but certainly statements to that effect would be useful.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Yes, and to Tim's credit, Tim and Howard published an article that's a classic, I think a classic in the Mark Twain sense that it's something that everybody talks about but no one's ever read. But in it -- but I didn't read it. And in it, Tim makes exactly that point which is that the Unfairness Statement ought to be construed to cover kind -- the kinds of behavior that we would think of as invasion of privacy toward.   </p><p>      But in fact, oftentimes when a bureau director brings a case like that to the commission, there's real pushback. And not every commissioner unfortunately is quite as enlightened as Tim is on this matter. And so I think that going forward some clarity needs to be injected into the process, either through a revision of the Unfairness Statement or some declaration by the commission writ large that these kinds of harms are subsumed in the Unfairness Statement because there are some case that Tim actually raises questions about in that article, and the result was I think you said was sort of hard to reconcile.   </p><p>      The order was hard to reconcile with the complaint language, cases like DesignerWare, Aaron's, and that's because there was friction within the commission. And so we need some resolution to this issue because increasingly, the harms that are caused through data breach, other forms of revelation of privacy information are not necessarily economic in nature and the Unfairness Statement should simply make that clear or the commission should make it clear in some other way. So I don't disagree.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Well, I appreciate the fact that we had at least one reader and -- but I think maybe the solution is the next time the commission brings a case like that is just to issue a public statement that interprets the Unfairness Doctrine.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCDAVID</emphasis>:  Or perhaps in these hearings and the report...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Sure. Another good suggestion.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Let me ask Alysa I think on this panel counsels clients most directly on these issues if she's got some thoughts on this area.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTNIK</emphasis>:  Well, one of the things that we hear from clients a lot are, what's the law and what's the best practice. And in counseling clients we -- it's the interpretation of the cases and really focusing on those fundamental policy statements. And so where you have the statement on deception and statement on unfairness from 1980 and '83 which are very helpful and we continually go back to that.   </p><p>      I think to David's point, modernizing them even with current examples rather than adding kind of the 75th, the 77th document that you need to put in an email to a client on what they need to address, I think with current types of challenges both in advertising and data practices and et cetera.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  That leads right into a broader question and the commission takes -- I think takes seriously its obligation to provide clear guidance, business guidance on consumer education. So I wonder if folks up here think there are other areas where new or updated policy statements or materials are needed. It ties in as well to the idea of the self-regulatory model as well. Put that open maybe to David and Alysa initially but, of course, that is just as potentially true on the antitrust side of things.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Yes. Let me just make a quick comment, which is the agency spends enormous amount of time on guidance documents. When I was there, the endorsement guides came out, the Green Guides, 300 pages of narrative. These are really important documents. We understand why regulated parties need the kind of guidance that the agency can provide. But doing a good guidance document is an enormous undertaking.   </p><p>      And there are areas where I think the guidance needs to be updated. And native advertising I think is an issue that the agency is going to have to continue to grapple with. The Green Guides left a lot of questions unanswered simply because there was no real consensus about what certain words mean like renewable.   </p><p>      And so I think -- I think one core part of the agency's mission is providing the kind of guidance that Alysa's talking about, that her clients need. It is quite a formidable undertaking, but I do think it's part of the commission's core mission.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTNIK</emphasis>:  Right. And I would just say that while the reports are well-read by private practitioners, it's the business guides that the clients use, the TSR business guidance the Green Guides, every one of those. I have some of those sections memorized as do some of my clients.   </p><p>      And so I think taking concepts like the 2012 privacy report and taking the Unfairness statement and really bringing it up-to-date, that would be relevant for the clients, the innovative clients that are thinking of how to use machine learning and using AI, and using facial recognition and having it consolidated in some ways where the topics overlap so that they can use that and not feel like they are targeted with gotcha enforcement down the line when they are trying to interpret necessarily flexible standards and to do the right thing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Well, and this goes back to the 6B question, which is in order to issue some of these guidance documents. For example, the use of biometrics in the marketplace. I think the commission might do well commission a study to get a sense of how widespread these practices are, where companies are going, what the immediate future looks like, because this is a topography that the commission needs to understand but I don't know whether it has the knowledge base today to issue a guidance document on these issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  You know, I think I completely agree about guidance and the best guidance the commission gives is in mergers. And an area that's badly in need of guidance on the consumer side is data security. And there's enough investigations and cases. There's over, I think, 50 cases and probably at least half that many serious investigations to do maybe not a merger guide, but at least a commentary on the -- which the agencies did in the, I don't know, 2006, '07 timeframe.   </p><p>      Because -- and something that would be important would be to talk about as examples and that can -- parties can be disguised -- when the agency didn't act. That's really important information because the complaints have tended to be vaguer and vaguer over time. And data security guidance I think is badly needed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Okay. Well, let me ask if there's any reaction to that. If not, I'd turn to another topic. Well, this is -- this ties in to a question we got from the audience. I'll raise it in two ways. And I think this -- first, there's a common critique that the U.S. has lost or is losing its leadership role on antitrust policy globally, that what we see developing outside the U.S. is a model predicated on the framework of the European Union or European countries. And that this is being adopted by some of the newer agencies and newer countries.   </p><p>      I'd make the same point -- well, maybe slightly different as a question. What can we learn from the -- and is there a divergence between the U.S. and other agencies on the consumer protection side? So two-part question, right, why -- have we lost our leadership and why? And then what can we learn from other agencies both on the competition and consumer protection side?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILL</emphasis>:  Let me start out with the competition side because I don't think I've done much consumer protection work since we put Joe Camel out to stud. The -- there is a challenge here in the global framework of competition agencies. I mentioned in my earlier remarks the recent speech by Mario Monti in effect claiming that the European methods of antitrust, the European foundations for antitrust were far superior to those in the United States.   </p><p>      The challenge has been there for a long time. I think there is a concern that there is a divergence of enforcement principles and due process principles, substantive as well as, procedure and substantive around the world. And one that's increasingly being affected. I think that the U.S. has not lost its attempt, its leadership in the sense of the work that's done within the ICN. Largely the U.S. pressure, for example, to put out -- the U.S. initiative that put out the guidance documents on due process for the agency effectiveness working group, U.S. leadership of the working party on (inaudible) cooperation in the OECD.   </p><p>      This had a profound effect and produced a major report on due process, so I think that we're not running up the white flag any time soon. I think it is responsible -- it is a responsibility of the U.S. in two areas to preserve I think leadership not only for, it's not America first. America first sometimes could be America not there. I think it's America trying to present some of the principles that have underlined antitrust enforcement in our country and in our -- in our jurisprudential base to try and put those across.  </p><p>      I think two areas where this can be done is continuing the guidance through the international organizations. And I think further attention should be given to the -- if you will, the moral suasion, the publicity effort that I think underlines initiatives such as Assistant Attorney General Delrahim's multilateral framework for antitrust procedure deserve attention. And I think the increasing use of bilateral agreements on competition policy, bilateral memoranda of understanding is a good way to go about it.   </p><p>      And I think also that the agencies need to be perhaps attuned more as they have somewhat in the past to actually engage in consultation and advocacy if you will, in particular instances where the agency, foreign agency seems to be departing from a globally accepted principle, procedure, or substance, and in effect didn't engage in consultation as provided for in a number of instrumental -- instruments of cooperation.   </p><p>      I think those are important. I think the final point that the agencies need to be concerned about, the United States need to be concern about is the problem sometimes of an agency action being misused by a foreign agency that say, \"Well, you're doing it so we can do it.\" There's a lot of copycat misuse of U.S. agency. We need to be -- the U.S. agencies need to be conscious of the risk of that copycat. Recent article by Koren Wong-Ervin, Josh Wright lists a number of areas where that's happened following up on some, actually some consents being used as an expression of law. Bosch, for example, Motorola Mobility -- GoogleMotorola Mobility by foreign agencies as well. The U.S. -- this is an expression of U.S. law. They misuse that and have that as a copycat for the misapplication of antitrust law.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  I want to take that and ask Jason a question. I know he's doing a lot of work on artificial intelligence and I assume big data is part of that. And, Jason, is what's going on overseas, is that important for the U.S. and what should the -- what should the FTC do about those issues?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FURMAN</emphasis>:  I'll -- can tell you the answer in like six months, but for now, I mean I think a lot of the issues around big data, the -- I think the empirical question that I don't know the answer to is -- talking about before is, if you think there's diminishing returns to data, then you're a lot less worried about it than if you think there's some region of increasing returns. And there's -- you know, people do computer science and say with machine learning when you get past a certain point, you get to this place where you can do the AI in a certain way that you couldn't do before you got to that scale.   </p><p>      If you have that, then I think you have -- do have to start to worrying about data becoming a barrier to entry, that there will be some large economies of scale in the machine learning AI space. And that you have to try to look at issues about who owns, for example, and something consumers may overlook and not fully understand and have those property right defined more properly.   </p><p>      On the other side of argument, the -- in a world where you think it's intangible capital producing things rather tangible capital makes it easier to enter and anyone can come up very little computer algorithm and enter the market. So I think this -- in question of, is it just a really cheap -- the AlphaGo reinforcement learning, the latest iteration of it that DeepMind did isn't that long or complicated a program, doesn't actually use any data. It just plays itself and generates the data, anyone in this room could have done it although none of you did.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  No, we couldn't.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FURMAN</emphasis>:  But -- and so if technology is like that, then I think we don't need to be that worried. Anyone in a garage can do it. If technology is this increasing returns to data, then I think we do need to be more worried and I -- I don't know which, so I apologize.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Thank you. I'll use that as a plug. We are doing two days on big data at American University's Washington College of Law in early November and two days on AI, artificial intelligence algorithms at Howard University's School of Law in the middle of November. So maybe you can come back, that would be great.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Let me just be clear. Algorithmic collusion is a whole different issue from the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  ... big data one and another.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Exactly. Although we are having some difficult separating out the people to do one or the other, but anyway. No, we're going to devote a lot of time to it. And that was a key -- one of the things the Pitofsky Report did was just sort of think about things that were going to come up over the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years and that's part of what we're doing on -- in that space.   </p><p>      Let me -- Jason, because you have to leave, I hope this doesn't put you on the spot, but I wanted to raise it since you are doing some platform-related work since you mentioned you're doing some platform-related work. To go back to merger law and you may have less familiarity with the doctrine, but to get your thoughts on this.   </p><p>      How should we think about acquisitions of new technologies by established players? Sometimes we use the term nascent competition or nascent competitors, but it's sort of -- it's something we're going to spend at least an afternoon on and maybe while you're here if you have some thoughts.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FURMAN</emphasis>:  Yes, no, absolutely. And you're creating a real incentive to leave panels early. I think (inaudible) It's working out really well for me. I think that's a really important issue. I think there's a sort of longstanding view that everything in technology is evolving so quickly that there's no point enforcing anything, because by the time you do, it's changed and there's some new competitor. And MySpace has disappeared or Internet Explorer has been dethroned or whatever else.   </p><p>      I think there's something to that. I think there's a lot of irreversibility, too, though. It's easier to stop an acquisition now and change your mind five years from now and allow it than it is to take a company that's already acquired and split it up. The second is basically impossible. The first, the cost of making an error in not allowing the acquisition may not be that high if you can change it later.   </p><p>      So there's a little bit under uncertainty, of literature and economics, there's an option value of waiting when you're making irreversible decisions and allowing a merger is one. I think you have to figure out how to think not just about market share but about the ecosystem as a whole, and if you are buying up something that could be a competitor later, then I think you're affecting the ecosystem and something that, prices, especially if there are no headline prices isn't a useful guide to market share, isn't a useful guide to -- but it's competition for creating a type of market and ecosystem. So I think that does require a new thinking and probably under that option value of waiting the uncertainty is an argument for more, not for less in those cases.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Okay. Let me ask if anyone has a reaction to that. We're going to have a whole afternoon of reaction to that. Okay. Okay. Well, not to kick Jason off, but I want to thank Jason for coming.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCDAVID</emphasis>:  Thank you, Jason.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  He made a special effort to be here. So let me -- we -- unless members on the panel want to ask each other some questions. We have a number of questions from the audience and I don't want to be too selective because we did ask for questions, but I would like to get to them, so if people are ready, we'll do it. And Jason did leave in just the right time.   </p><p>      But maybe others could think about this either narrowly or more broadly. How -- and here's the question, how do we analyze -- how do we analyze the harm to small businesses who rely on large platforms to reach new customers in ways they never could before? So that may touch on two specific topics.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Yes, that sounds like a benefit, not a harm, if they're using these platforms to reach people that they never did before. Look, obviously there are a whole set of rules, disclosures, consumer protection rules. It's important that the -- just from a simple contract law standpoint that the contracts not be devised unilaterally as they sometimes can be, which is an obvious problem under contract law.  </p><p>      One of the things I'm surprised with is the number of times people bring me antitrust issues that are really contract law issues. I used to teach contract law. I don't think in the big picture sense that the platform -- so-called platform issues need to be analyzed any differently. The toolkit we have is perfectly adequate and it goes back decades when the -- you know, when the new industries were evolving. We're talking about going back to the 1990s.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  I took a little bit of this question. We focused on the use of antitrust to protect small businesses and I wonder if other folks have additional comment on that question. Is that a proper role for antitrust or is it just too hard for us to measure that particular factor in our analysis?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCDAVID</emphasis>:  I share Tim's criticisms of the Robinson-Patman Act. I try to give those questions when they come up to someone else in the office. Or I tell my clients that whatever the right answer is, the Robinson-Patman answer is the other side of it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Let me just add one thing. You know, dealing with platforms is an issue that rises both -- on both sides of the building. For example, I mean, one of the ironies in the Google investigation were the companies that were complaining about anti-competitive conduct were the very companies that wouldn't have exist but for Google. And that interaction becomes very challenging.   </p><p>      Also some of the platforms raise serious consumer protection issues because they are essentially bazaars selling multiple products on the same page. And so questions about deception, who's responsible for the deception arise with some frequency. So I think one un-sort of-met challenge on both sides of the building is what do we do about platforms? I mean, we do have -- there are certain immunities for baseline content, but that doesn't really resolve some of the consumer protection problems and some of the antitrust issues that arose, for example, in the Google investigation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTNIK</emphasis>:  I would just add. On the consumer protection side, we're talking about platforms and responsibilities and, David, I hear you earlier in terms of talking about the limited resources for enforcement, some of the things that we've seen is deputizing platforms to be responsible for those that they let into the bazaar, and that may be all well and good but there's a lot of interpretation and a lack of guidance on what is reason oversight and monitoring, what's scalable, and not doing a gotcha on that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  And they're all fair questions.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTNIK</emphasis>:  So if we go towards that point, what I would strongly encourage thoughtfulness is what are the standards to avoid third party monitoring whether it's a safe harbor, whether it's other types of incentivizing, but clarity on those points.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Let me -- okay. Any other comments on that? Let me turn to a question that is -- I think I'll direct it to everybody. It's a similar question. So the question says that former Chairman Muris mentioned imperfect information in contrast to behavioral economics. But in standard economic models, imperfect information causes transactions not to happen. It does not cause buyers to be fooled.   </p><p>      So here -- I think here's the question. Aren't buyers sometimes simply fooled and should they protected for being fooled? Or from being fooled? I think that's both a consumer protection and in some ways a competition question but I'll turn it over to David first.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  The answer is yes. The commission has struggled with what is a reasonable consumer and what percentage of consumers must be deceived by a message, but the mission of the commission is to prevent deception in the marketplace and Tim and I may disagree at the margins about this but I agree with Tim's fundamental point, that the core mission of the agency is to protect against fraud. And the statute doesn't really use the word fraud, it uses deception.   </p><p>      And I -- that's -- in my view, that's always been the core mission of the agency. The first cases the agency brought consumer deception cases. They were the sale of silk which was really cotton and it was sold C-I-L-K. And those were literally the first enforcement cases the commission brought. So, historically that's been at the center of the agency's mission.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTNIK</emphasis>:  I would also just add to that. We have to reconcile with the reasonable consumer and the gullible consumer standard, and one of the other parts of the FTC's mission is consumer education, and particularly as we go through the emerging marketplaces and people are learning even about those marketplaces, consumer education plays a key role on that, so that we don't dilute the reasonable person standard.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  I agree with both of those points and let me take the economic modeling part of that. It almost 60 years since Ronald Coase's famous article and the applications of that are all about transactions costs. And shortly thereafter, George Stigler won his Nobel Prize in significant part for discussing that advertising was an extremely powerful tool for the elimination of ignorance. Well, obviously there's -- if there's ignorance, we're talking about a world with transaction costs and that's the world in which you need an FTC enforcement, as I was talking about.   </p><p>      And so the whole -- this straw man that you -- in the popular press, that economists talk about these automatons who only react, consumers with perfect knowledge who only react to price. That just hasn't been proven in any sensible economic application to what the FTC does for decades.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Okay. Well, thank you. Let me follow up on a point David made as well about a bureau of technology in the FTC. I'm going to depart a little bit from the question, but ask, first of all, to the other panelists think about that, is it something that's relevant on both the antitrust side of house as well as the consumer protection side of the house?   </p><p>      And what might it look like and I raise that, maybe it's a little unfair because I didn't raise it earlier but we have, David was a bureau director, Tim as well as being chairman was a bureau director. How do you set up these things for success, really? That's maybe my question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  I defer to someone who's the chair -- the chairman. I think that would be the chairman's mission, not -- I mean I think it would be important to retain some of the technology infrastructure in the bureaus. I mean much of what the Bureau of Consumer Protection uses technologists for are forensics for investigations, but there are a lot of, there's a lot of value to having access to skill technicians for the policy issues that the agency is going to have to confront moving forward. Biometric identification, things like that. These are difficult technical questions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Look, the bureaus are complementary. They're not substitutes. As the only person ever to head both of them, they are significantly different. They're different in their personalities, they're different in the career paths. And they are, in many ways, autonomous, and it's important -- let me give you an anecdote. I wanted the Bureau of Consumer Protection to do more in working with criminal authorities. And I unfortunately insulted them and told them that they were being -- they were too self-satisfied. Those were not the words I used.   </p><p>      And I regrouped and after about a year, they decided it was their idea. And they now have a very successful criminal liaison unit which, of course, they take complete -- a hundred percent credit for which is fine with me. And it was a mistake on my part to criticize them in the first place, but it's a wonderful organization. It reminds me of working in OMB in the old days where you have people who -- it's their career. And it's not as transitory as the Bureau of Competition, but embedding in the bureau like David says would be a very sensible way to go. Anybody else?   </p><p>      Anybody else? Okay. I will answer one of the questions. There is a reference in the question to the Office of Technology Research and Investigation, what we call OTEC which does sit in BCP. Question is, why this is unit insufficient to get the job done now? Without commenting too much on whether it's insufficient or what job they are focused on, we are -- it is a very small group and more resources would probably be appreciated by the chair, by the commissioners, and even by the bureau directors.   </p><p>      So maybe I'll end with a question that maybe I have, and it's a real question given the difficulty of managing agencies, do you think the FTC should have more resources to do its mission, and maybe how would you, if you were to allocate those resource, how would allocate them? So I have no particular -- I'd like the private perspective as well as the, the folks who have not been at the agency as well as folks who have been at the agency to maybe give some thought to it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILL</emphasis>:  I think a question like that to be addressed by is like asking the Protestant minister what he thought about the latest papal encyclical. But when I was at the division, one of our major efforts was to enhance the workforce at the division, both from the standpoint of law and economics. And it was shorthanded when I got there and we were able to build it up and I think increase the efficacy of the agency with more resources.   </p><p>      It is difficult to get those kinds of resources with all the other budgetary demands and we ran into a number of problems. Partly solved by the filing fee issue, but I think the agencies do need, but certainly the division needed more resources at that time sensibly used and sensibly coordinated. The commission I leave to the people who've worked there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  Well, I have a long-running view about this and when -- in '81 when we came in, we were asked to reduce resources. The way to think about it is FTE, we put the agency on a path from 1800 to 1200. And that's where it was when we -- in the mid 1980s.   </p><p>      When I came back in 2001, I asked for a comparison with the mid 1980s and Bob had had about a thousand and it turned out, in professionals, a thousand and 1200 were about the same, very small difference. And what had happened, there was a lot of outsourcing and a lot of productivity improvements. Technology had had a significant effect. I think the agency is up to 1150, something like that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RILL</emphasis>:  That's right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MURIS</emphasis>:  And I don't know how that compares with 2001. I suspect there have been some more productivity improvements, probably not as dramatic as in the 1990s. But Bob did a hell of a job with a thousand. I think we're headed for another retrenchment era, so I think it's probably wishful thinking to ask for significantly more resources, and besides the people, there's -- BCP, for example, has a significant infrastructure burden that we managed to satisfy with the money from Do Not Call which we used for building up the infrastructure for Do Not Call, which was very helpful for the rest of the agency.   </p><p>      But I think at the present, the present rate strikes me as significantly more, we ended up about 1260, about 1060. And I thought we did a lot. I thought Bob did a lot, so I'm not -- I don't think more resources are in the cards and I think they're doing a lot with what they've got.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUTNIK</emphasis>:  This is not from an internal perspective but I think it's all about the priorities, right, where do you want to focus the resources that you have. And some of the themes from today were -- we have division of enforcement and we need more manpower in terms of business guidance and I think to not get distracted by calls for regulation which would take a whole bunch of people off of doing some of those things now. That may not be as productive.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCDAVID</emphasis>:  Speaking only on the competition side, the lawyers and economists with whom I work regularly at the commission are incredibly dedicated and hardworking. The general populace has a view of government employees that is deprecating, and it's not fair. They do yeoman's work. They work weekends, they work nights. And a lot of the competition mission is consumed with things they can't predict. What's the merger wave going to be? All of which are time-sensitive. So they have to at least retain the kinds of resources they've got because you'll burn them out.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Yes, I would argue for more resources. I understand Tim's argument and I realize this is probably swimming against the tide, but since the 2001 or 1981, Congress has added considerable workload to the agency, and changes in the marketplace have required the agency to do more work. The Bureau of Consumer Protection at its height when I was there and I don't think we've added any resources to it had fewer than 450 people, including most of the people in the regions.   </p><p>      People work extremely hard. They're incredibly dedicated, but there are lots of people with fingers in the dikes and the water is just coming over the transom. So I would urge the commission to think about asking for an increase in resources. And I think -- of course, most of it should go to BCP, but I think the agency could well use a couple hundred more FTEs.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Okay. Well, I think we'll conclude right there. We were on -- targeted for 11:45 and I think this is where we are. Before we conclude, I'd like to thank a bunch of people. First, I thank the panelists including Jason who had to leave very much for devoting some time and effort to this. I'd like to thank my colleagues in the Office of Policy Planning who have been working very hard on what will probably be about 20 days of sessions, and this is only five percent of the way through once we're done today. They're just a wonderful crew to work with and I'm very proud to work with them. And I think have the best job at the commission.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      And finally, thank also the staff of the executive director for helping put this thing together, and you'll see more of it this afternoon, but I won't be on stage, I wanted to put that out there. And then thank everybody for showing up and paying attention. We'll be back here at 1:30, so if you come here slightly before, that'd be great. There's a cafeteria across the courtyard if people want to eat law school food.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      But it's good. It's better than I remember. So hope to see you back here slightly before 1:30.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      (RECESS)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  Start it in a -- in a minute or so. Let people coming in if they're trying to hit the 1:30 mark.   </p><p>      Okay. I'm just going to say welcome back, and remind people in the audience or new people that two of my colleagues, maybe more, are collecting questions that you may write on the question card, and they'll be brought up to the panel the end of the panel for some audience Q and A.   </p><p>      So, with that, I'm going to turn this over to Greg Werden from the Antitrust Division, and he's going to discuss with the panel whether the U.S. economy has become more concentrated and less competitive.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Thank you. I'm not a fan of introductions, so I will not introduce our speakers, they can introduce themselves if they want to spend their time that way, that they have total control over their time. The way we're going to organize this is Jon is going to give a long slide presentation and then each of our other panelists will give much shorter presentations, and they will go to a series of questions that I pose, and then finally questions from the audience. So, Jon.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you, Greg. And nice to see all my co-panelists, and thank you Bilal, and the FTC for inviting me, I was involved in the hearings in 1980 -- '95, and I'm delighted to be back for the -- for these today.   </p><p>      So, the FTC hearings two decades ago that I just referred to, were spurred by two challenges for antitrust policy. Markets were becoming increasingly global and innovation competition was becoming increasingly important. And today, we have an additional challenge for antitrust policy, the economic evidence has been accumulating since the 1995 hearings and much of it for the past five years or so, that shows that market power has been growing for decades. And I think of what we're seeing as today's antitrust paradox, a conjunction of substantial and widening market power with well-established and extensive antitrust institutions.   </p><p>      Oh, what's with that one? All right. So, in my presentation I'll sketch the evidence that market power has been growing over the past quarter century and has become substantial in the United States. And I'm going to go through nine reasons, none of them is individually decisive, there are ways to question or push back on each, but their weaknesses are all, are different.   </p><p>      And so if -- so when you take them collectively, they paint a compelling picture of growing market power. And I'm also going to explain why the recent economic trends I point to reflect growing market power, not solely increased scale economies and temporary rents to early adopters of new technologies in competitive markets.   </p><p>      And to fit my presentation into the allotted time, I will say less about most of the reasons than will appear on the slides. And the very last slide will reference my forthcoming book, the first chapter of which goes into more detail on this topic including full cites for the research that's referenced on the slides. And it will also mention criticisms of the research that I don't have time to bring up in my presentation, although I'd be happy to talk about them during our discussion with, later.   </p><p>      Before I get into the nine reasons, I want to make clear what I mean when I use the term market power. Firms exercise market power in their output markets as sellers by raising prices or by altering other terms of trade adversely to buyers relative to what would prevail in a competitive market. Market power is not just about prices, it can be exercised on other competitive dimensions, too. And market power can also be exercised in input markets, exercised by buyers, and that's defined analogously.   </p><p>      The first of the nine reasons to think that market power has been growing is that we insufficiently deter anticompetitive coordinated conduct. The Justice Department keeps on covering cartels year after year. They seem to form at the same rate that we catch them. And that suggest under-deterrence because the penalties are probably too low to deter collusion, and there's no reason to think that the threat of penalties chills pro-competitive conduct or leads to excessive compliance expenditures. And under-deterred express cartels are probably the tip of an iceberg, because tacit collusion is probably even harder to deter.   </p><p>      We also insufficiently deter anticompetitive mergers and there's several empirical studies that support this conclusion. Now, what happened here? Did I hit a wrong button? All right. I need a tech guy -- there we go. Okay. The third reason is insufficient deterrence of anticompetitive exclusion. Since the late 1970s, the courts have targeted rules governing exclusionary conduct for extensive relaxation, and in some cases the new rules conferred de facto legality on such conduct.   </p><p>      The empirical evidence that exclusion is under-deterred is about the competitive effects of vertical practices. Now, vertical conduct an exclusionary conduct are not the same thing, but there are correlated, and the evidence shows that vertical restraints often support collusion and there are a number of examples of competitive harm from vertical restraints and vertical integration.   </p><p>      That interpretation -- oops, let me go back here. Yes. That interpretation of the literature on vertical conduct may surprise some of you. So, I want to make an important methodological point. Most empirical studies about the effects of vertical restraints are looking in the wrong place to learn about whether stronger antitrust enforcement would be beneficial.   </p><p>      If you want to know whether oligopolists can use vertical restraints to harm competition, you won't learn much by looking at markets with competitive structures or in markets where the firms could be deterred but from anticompetitive conduct with a threat of antitrust enforcement. Looking in those kind of markets lets you learn about potential pro-competitive consequences, and about ways that firms can craft their vertical arrangements to limit the inefficiencies and costs that they may impose.   </p><p>      Now, you might see some instances in which vertical restraints harm competition, but the markets aren't randomly selected, you'd expect in general the studies would not often find harm to competition, even if the conduct could be harmful in other settings that are not being studied, where one might want to think about antitrust enforcement.   </p><p>      And you're not going to learn much about whether relaxing antitrust constraints has or would lead to greater competitive harm. If you want to identify the effects of antitrust enforcement in the econometric sense, you have to compare outcomes with and without antitrust constraints, and the -- there's a McKay Smith study that's in the small print on the slide of -- about resale price maintenance, and that's a rare example of a study of a vertical restraints that addresses this identification problem. And it finds it on the whole, competition was harmed when the antitrust constraints on resale price maintenance were relaxed.   </p><p>      Fourth, market power is durable, markets are not invariably self-correcting, cartels and monopolies often last a long time. The eight-year lower bound on the length of the average cartel compares favorably with the time it takes to create -- to correct rather, erroneous judicial precedents, even Supreme Court decisions through later court decisions that overrule them or narrow them procedurally, or substantively, or through lower court decisions that distinguish or limit them, or through legislative abrogation.   </p><p>      Our fifth, the increased equity ownership of rival firms by diversified financial investors is another reason to worry about growing market power. Rival airlines, or banks, or pharmacy chains, or other competing firms increasingly have overlapping ownership by financial firms like Blackrock, State Street, Fidelity, and Vanguard. The initial studies have found that common ownership leads to higher prices, and this is an active research area where we're likely to learn more soon.   </p><p>      Sixth, increased governmental restraints on competition. Over the past few decades, the U.S. has broadened patent scope substantially, and granted too many patents after inadequate review. This trend may have halted, but it's not really been reversed. And other examples of governmental restraints that may be on the rise include occupational licensing and lobbying to limit rivalry.   </p><p>      All right. The seventh is the rise of dominant information technology platforms. Now, the empirical evidence suggests that price cost margins have been growing economy-wide since 1990 in the United States. And the trend seems clear, although the magnitude of the margin increases has not been measured precisely.   </p><p>      Growing price cost margins are probably tied to investments in information technology. Dominant information technology and internet platforms aren't the only firms making those kind of investments, or likely exercising some market power as a result. But the platforms are an important part of the story, because they're likely insulated from competition in some of their major markets.   </p><p>      All right. So, eighth. Oligopolies are common and concentrations increasing in many industries. The best evidence that increasing concentration allows firms to exercise more market power comes from studies of particular industries like airlines, brewing, and hospitals. The economy-wide evidence on concentration suggests only modest increases in concentration and in many -- and many industries with rising concentration remain unconcentrated.   </p><p>      But the economy-wide evidence is less reliable than the industry specific studies and that's because the economy wide studies often use broad product markets when it would be better to look for competitive problems in more narrow markets. And they often use national markets when it would be better to look at regional or local markets.   </p><p>      Now, some of the evidence involving broad national aggregates is consistent with rising overall concentration, but could instead reflect increased multi-market contact. But that could equally raise competitive concerns about coordination. And there are recent studies that also find concentration is high and possibly growing in many labor markets, potentially making it more possible for businesses to exercise monopsony power to depress wages.   </p><p>      The final reason to think that market power has been increasing is a decline in economic dynamism. And Jason Furman highlighted this reason this morning. Growing market power is a leading explanation or a plausible contributing explanation for a range of economic trends. A secular slowdown in business investment, rising profits as a share of U.S. GDP, a slowed rate at which firms expand when they become more productive, a declining rate of startups, a shift in growth and productivity gains from entrants to incumbents, and a growing gap in accounting profitability between the most and the least profitable firms.   </p><p>      So I've interpreted the evidence in these nine categories that I highlighted as indicating growing market power. And I want to explain now I think that's a better interpretation of the most plausible alternative, namely increased scale economies and temporary returns to the first firms to adopt new information technologies in competitive markets.   </p><p>      Now the benign alternative has an initial plausibility, because the efficient size of firms has likely grown over time in many industries, as a result of the high fixed costs of investments in information technology, network effects, and an increased scope of geographic markets. That means that firms could grow larger, and concentration could rise, and price cost margins could increase even if markets are competitive. And in addition, the first firms to invest in new information technologies might earn substantial rents which should be temporary if those investments don't confer market power and their rivals follow suit with investments of their own.   </p><p>      But the first six reasons I gave for thinking market power is substantial and widening in the U.S. cannot be reconciled with the benign alternative, anticompetitive coordination, mergers, and exclusion are under-deterred, market power is durable, and increased equity ownership of rivals by financial investors of the -- well, can soften competition, and governmental restraints on competition have grown.   </p><p>      Also, market power is a better interpretation in the benign alternative for the other three reasons. The growth of dominant platforms probably does owe a lot to scale economies and first mover advantages. But those platforms may still have the ability to exercise market power by excluding rivals. Scale economies and rents to early adopters of new technologies probably did contribute to rising concentration in various industries.   </p><p>      But there's often independent evidence that the firms in those concentrated markets exercise market power, which is not surprising because the same fixed expenditures that make scale economies and rents to movers possible can deter entry and soften competition.   </p><p>      Now, some of the evidence for the loss of economic dynamism could be consistent with the benign alternative of growing scale economies and returns to early adoption of new technologies in competitive markets, as well as consistent with increasing market power. And that might include the rising profit share of GDP and the growing gap in accounting profitability between the most in the least profitable firms.   </p><p>      But other aspects of declining dynamism cannot be reconciled with the benign alternative. The benign interpretation assumes that profits rise because markets are increasingly dynamic, with higher rates of entry, investment, and business failure. In competitive markets, growing scale economies yield higher profits because entrants have a greater risk of failure when fewer firms can succeed.   </p><p>      Early adopters of new technologies would earn profits, but they'd be temporary, competed away by new or expanding rivals making their own investments. But the benign interpretation is inconsistent with the evidence showing the reverse, a slowing rate of new entry, a declining rate of expansion when firms and plants grow more productive, and a secular slowdown in business investment.   </p><p>      And in addition, the financial markets appear to view corporate profit streams is less risky than in the past, and yet if markets are increasingly dynamic as the benign alternative supposes, those streams would be viewed as riskier. The bottom line is that growing market power is a better explanation for declining dynamism, and for all nine reasons taken as a whole, than the alternative of increasing scale economies and early adopter rents in competitive markets. The benign alternative might -- may well be a partial explanation, but increasing market power is likely an important part of the story too.  </p><p>      Now, I don't need to spend much time with this audience explaining what's wrong with market power. The harms within markets are described on the slide from a partial equilibrium perspective within an industry, within a market, the harms that they can arise regardless of whether market power is exercised by sellers or buyers.   </p><p>      Market power can also harm the economy as a whole by slowing economic growth and increasing inequality. And the adverse economic consequences of the exercise of market power could be reinforced if firms and industries can use their market power to secure political power, and use their political power to protect or extend their economic advantages.   </p><p>      So, just to summarize, the evidence I presented shows that market power has been growing in the U.S. economy for decades. From an error cost point of view, we've learned that we are deterring anticompetitive conduct less than we thought we were in 1995 when the FTC last held hearings. And that means we should take steps now to strengthen our antitrust rules, institutions and enforcement. And, Greg, I think I'm going to reserve my remainder of time for rebuttal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  I'm sorry. You have to check in with the clerk before you start talking. If you've ever argued the Court of Appeals, that's the rule.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  Oh, okay, good.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Steve?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  Okay, good. So we got new slides here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  Good. Okay. I want to give a talk that -- only about six minutes that I think is complementary to what Jonathan is talking about. And I want to talk about what kind of evidence we should weigh more or less as we're looking at this debate. And in particular, I think that Jonathan's mix of evidence was quite different than the evidence you often see in presentations in the -- in the press, by macroeconomists, and by other non-specialists. And I wanted to indicate what some of those distinctions are so that we can think about what evidence is the most convincing, and also what kind of things we'd like to look forward to in the future.   </p><p>      So, I'm going to divide things a little bit starkly into good and bad. And to talk about the relative bad, I want to go all the way back to the year 1989. And in the year 1989, there were two I think magisterial chapters that were published in the handbook of IO. One by Dick Schmalensee and one by Tim Bresnahan and Dick Schmalensee was a participant in and a sympathetic observer of decades worth of work that did something like what people are doing today, which is try to look at the correlation of various outcomes like prices and markups with measures of concentration like the Herfindahl Index.   </p><p>      And his chapter laid out a whole host of problems with that, but I want to emphasize particularly one. The Herfindahl Index in particular is probably better thought of as the cause of market competition, an interesting summary statistic of what is going on rather than as an effect that causes outcomes. The Herfindahl Index itself is a function of market shares, which one function of outputs which are codetermined simultaneously with price.   </p><p>      The most famous example that people used in those days is that differences in firm heterogeneity where, cost heterogeneity where you had some firms with very low prices, that those low marginal cost would feed into their market shares, their market shares feed into the Herfindahl Index, but their low marginal costs also flow into markups, and you see a positive correlation between markups and concentration that has to do with efficiency rather than with competition. That's the problem of simultaneity, the problem that in this case, correlation is not causation, and we should be very skeptical I think of these studies that in some ways naively regress an outcome on a Herfindahl Index.   </p><p>      Now, some people in this literature I think are actually quite aware of this, and they think of this is a problem with the Herfindahl Index itself, is correlated with other things, is endogenous, they look for purely statistical ways of dealing with that endogeneity, they look for what's called an instrumental variable or just a more plausible exogenous variation in market structure.   </p><p>      And that brings me to the second of those great handbook chapters written by Tim Bresnahan, and what he pointed out is that even if we grant that you have discovered the true causal effect say of the number of firms on price, you haven't established anything about the role of markups, either on the output side or on the input side.   </p><p>      And let me just give you one example of that. I teach freshman micro, and on the third day, we teach them that supply slopes up, and there are a bunch of shifters, among them are the number of firms that shift supply back and forth, and that's because of the upward sloping marginal cost curves of the individual firms.   </p><p>      Demand slopes down, as you move the number of firms to the supply curve, moves against that demand curve, and it shows that as the number of firms goes up supply shifts out, prices fall. In the perfectly competitive output market, decrease in concentration drops prices. But there are no markups, you haven't found evidence of markups, you may have found evidence of increasing marginal cost.   </p><p>      The same thing happens on the input side, it is an implication of the perfectly competitive model of wage determination that an increase in the number of firms will drive wages up. That's not evidence of monopsony power. What Bresnahan said is that we actually have to separately consider demand and cost and competition. And we can't do that and one equation or one correlation.   </p><p>      I think that kind of evidence with -- by the way did not feature greatly in conference discussion, should be downweighted a lot, right? We thought it died with the publication of these two chapters 25 years ago, and some of us woke up and were a little startled to see it suddenly outside of our window looking in, and that's trouble.   </p><p>      I want to talk for just two minutes about possible alternatives. One is just to look at, directly the facts of policy that have changed, and what effect did they have, we can learn about policy that way. Let me skip a couple slides though. Another thing though is to back away for one minute, to back away form -- for one minute from causation, and just think about measurement, what has happened to markups, and we heard about these papers just a minute ago. I think they do show that regardless of cause, our best evidence is that markup are going up. It's sensitive to measurement like whether you include certain intangible and fixed costs in that or not.   </p><p>      But that kind of simple descriptive cross-industry measurement is very valuable for telling us what has happened, but not why, not why. So, I think ultimately, we're going to have to do what Jonathan suggested, we're going to have to do studies of individual important industries and ask what is going on. So, here's an example a graduate student of mine did as a -- as a part of his thesis. He looked up the wholesale sector, that's pretty important, that's a pretty important sector, right? And what does he find? Concentration is up, aha, concentration is up.   </p><p>      On the other hand, output is up, that doesn't sound like monopolization, does it? Output is up. The product itself has changed, multi-warehouse wholesalers are locating closer to their customers, they're investing in IT for logistics, they're dual sourcing goods, you can shop between China and the United States with one stop at a wholesaler. The nature of the good is changing. And when you put this to a Bresnahan-like series of models, you'll see that markups are going up in the industry just like in the cross industry analysis, but for a mix of all of the reasons that Jonathan mentioned, not for one or the other, but for all of them.   </p><p>      Product quality is going up, that's pushing prices up that pushes margins up. The marginal cost is going down as firms get better logistics and locate closer to their customers, marginal cost is falling, that's efficiency, but markups go up, competition is really going down. And that also contributes to the markup effect.   </p><p>      Why don't we see the entry that Jonathan talked about? Implicitly there must be fixed costs or some costs that are preventing new entrants from somehow competing away these profits. It's costly to build all of those plants near your rivals and that's a sunk cost, and it's very hard for that to be competed away.   </p><p>      This is a complicated story. And what I want to finish with is a substantive hypothesis. What if this is true in broader sections of the economy, what if it's happening in broader sections, not just wholesale, maybe IT, maybe other parts of retail, maybe broad sectors of the economy, that firms for endogenous reasons or changing their production methods and their -- and the quality of their products so that marginal cost is falling and fixed cost is rising. Markups are going up, concentration is going up.   </p><p>      If that's happening in a broad scale way, it doesn't seem just that big is bad, but we're way, also, we're way far from the theory of perfect competition as well. We're in this very complex setting where there's some good and bad things happening, like Jonathan, it's not just economies of scale, there are other things too, there are competitive effects as well. We can't just wave our hands and say it's all fine.   </p><p>      I also don't think we can just simply say, big is bad. And I think it's these better kinds of evidence, these descriptive studies at the broad level and causal studies that are within industry level that we ought to emphasize, and I think are the ones that are going to eventually tell us what the correct policy path forward is, and these guys are better policy experts than I am, so I'm mostly going to listen for the rest of time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Thanks very much, Steve.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Good job. I'm not sure who's going next, but why don't -- why don't you do it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  Okay. There are a few of my students in the audience who are laughing at the idea that I'm going to do anything in six minutes. But let's give it a shot nonetheless. I think sort of extending the discussion from Jon and Steve to move on, probably start in the same place as Steve which is I went to grad school in economics and studied in IO in the early 2000s and those handbook chapters were sort of taken as the starting point for learning empirical IO, we didn't read studies that attempted to infer causations and changes to HHI on the effect on price, we read Steve's stuff.   </p><p>      I think the fundamental challenge in this area, and then I'll dive into the data is that while it is probably true that zombie IO economics has died in economics departments a long time ago, I think the fundamental challenge in part is making sure we don't get antitrust policy that adopts zombie IO, and I think that's a challenge for the agencies, I think it's a challenge for IO economists. because the punch line for some of this is going to be on the real questions that matter for designing policy, my interpretation of the evidence is that we know -- we know a lot less, and probably need to know a lot more before we start playing much with policies, I'll spend the rest of my time talking about that.   </p><p>      For starters, I think it's important to separate, we're going to talk about testable hypotheses, and testing with empirical data, I think it's really important for these discussions, Especially, if we're going to attach any policy relevance to them, to separate claims. One of the claims around is that we've got a rise in concentration at the aggregate sort of of non-market level, sort of really aggregated industry sectors, stuff made with metal, not necessarily just capturing firms that are competing against each other.   </p><p>      There's a second -- a second set of claims that try to do relationship between what's happening in markets, changes in concentration in markets, and relate those to a price or output or markets, so are we getting more or less competition.   </p><p>      And I think there's a third set of claims that is, is any of this caused by lax antitrust enforcement. I spend most of my time talking about why it is so important for discussion of antitrust policy that we focus on markets, and not sort of broad, aggregated sectors, that doesn't mean that the sector-based research isn't incredibly useful. It is, we learned things like at a rough level what's happening to markups over time, that is interesting as a descriptive matter.   </p><p>      We don't, and often these studies are used to sort of glom on causation and make claims about whether antitrust is doing too much or too little. The reason that we care fundamentally about markets and not sectors in antitrust is because the fundamental lesson of those IO handbook chapters, and I think most of modern IO in this area is that competition and concentration are different things.   </p><p>      Concentration can be caused by more competition. It can be caused by less competition. I think Steve had this as the Chicago critique on his slides, I'm at UCLA guy, I'm going to call it the Demsetz critique, or else I'll lose my Bruin lunch card. So, but the fundamental idea that we grapple with and what makes antitrust hard is that changes in concentration can be the outcome of more or less competition, that makes identification difficult. It makes broad claims about whether we have too much, or too little, or sort of goldilocks just right levels of concentration really difficult to do, and probably outside the scope of the ability of modern IO.   </p><p>      And that really was the lesson of sort of the big empirical revolution of IO in the 1970's and 1980's. So, punch line for me is I think a lot of the evidence that we see are attempts to do some of these broad industry sector stuff, where we do exactly what we learned not to do in the 1970s. We regress markups or price, or profit on really broad, aggregated industry data. And then the policy world sort of jumps on and make causal claims, and sort of we're off and running, and I think that's a dangerous place to be in.   </p><p>      There are attempts to do better work, there are attempts to do sort of more sophisticated merger retrospectives and tradeoff, the broad general insights, we're learning about one case, and maybe I think in discussion, we'll talk a little bit more about that. But my read of the evidence is at the aggregated sort of relationship between aggregated concentration and competition outputs, we don't know much that's relevant to formation of antitrust policy, I think there are interesting questions, I think it is important for modern sort of IO economists and for the agencies, for the FTC and the DOJ who have great collections of IO economists inside those buildings, to engage in answering those questions.   </p><p>      And I'd say, it's great that we all get to come up here and engage in those questions, but I'm hopeful that the economists inside the agency who are experts and have access to data, things like agency predictions in individual cases that they can test against data, that they're also an active participant in that discussion.   </p><p>      So, I think the real challenge moving forward is if you've got data that isn't what you need to have the type of discussion that you want to have about whether it is desirable to move policy one way or another, whether it's mergers or something else, the challenge I think both for the academy and for the agencies is to invest in producing those data, producing tools, producing studies to move the ball forward in that literature, because I certainly agree, there are interesting questions here that require investment and are sort of worth the time. I'll stop there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Fiona?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Great. Hello, everybody, and thanks to the FTC very much for being invited to contribute to this panel. I agree with both Jon and Steve on the IO research here. It seems very easy to run the wrong regression, to someone without a PhD, it looks tempting. We need to resist that temptation, because it is in fact just wrong.   </p><p>      But we need to find another way to answer the question, that's not an excuse for not answering the question. And as Josh said, concentration and competition are not the same thing, it's not actually I think very informative to learn about aggregate concentration in the United States, I'd like to know about competition in the United States.   </p><p>      And I think as Steve said, the markups are a good way to get there. I think the real reason that we're -- that there is consensus among a large fraction of the people who do this work for a living and the people who read the newspaper, that we have a competition problem in the United States comes not from papers published in academic journals, but from two main sources.   </p><p>      One is, for people who work in this area, the actual experience of litigating. So it took 23 years from the time the FTC first found a pay for delay agreement in the record to getting the Supreme Court to say, yes, under certain conditions those could be anti-competitive.   </p><p>      Twenty three years, and a pay for delay is when a branded monopolist pays the generic to stay out of its market, okay? That is pretty straightforward. It's exclusionary conduct, it harms consumers, it keeps prices very high, why did we have to wait a quarter of a century to get that practice banned, or it -- never mind banned actually, to get that practice scrutinized properly.   </p><p>      The American Express opinion by the Supreme Court completely misses the locus of competition between American Express and Discover. It's all about American Express' consumers versus the retailers and so on, and gives a complete miss to the issue of competition, which is what the antitrust laws are supposed to protect.   </p><p>      So when you look at litigation, and you look at what the agencies are trying to prove in the courts, it's all really heavy lift, and as Bill Baer said when he was at DOJ, why are some of the mergers we're reviewing even getting out of the boardroom? They're just obviously anticompetitive, and yet we had to litigate them anyway. So, I think that's one big area that we look to for evidence as to why there are anticompetitive effects.   </p><p>      A second one is our experience as consumers. Look around at hospitals, airlines, beer, media, big tech, I think people in the economy walk around buying things, and the experience they have is of less competition. And I think also consumers can get can easily confused between what is regulated and what's not. So, for instance, pharmaceutical prices and cable prices are not fundamentally something that antitrust can do a lot about, and yet those things are exhibiting less competition, also for the reason that Jonathan covered in his talk about lobbying to get government protection.   </p><p>      So, what's my response to this emerging consensus? We need to revisit the economics, and I will say this slowly because it's worth saying 25 times, and I don't have that long, so I'll just say it once slowly. Economic analysis is not the same thing as less enforcement, okay? Chairman Simons said it exactly right this morning. Economics is a tool, if you feed a set of facts into the economic analysis box, okay, you can come out of this merger is competitive or this merger is anticompetitive. It works beautifully, okay?   </p><p>      But what happened in 1975 as we applied economics to antitrust and we got the pendulum swinging down, okay? Arguably we had too much disorganized enforcement, the pendulum swung down, and now we have these things as sacred texts, and the answer is always if you believe in the sacred texts of Chicago, to enforce less. Obviously, if you enforce less for 30 or 40 years in a row, you're eventually going to pass the optimum, okay? And that's what we've done, I think.   </p><p>      And we need to recognize -- I luckily was too young to be part of that project, and so it's -- I mean, perhaps easier for me to see that we've well overshot the optimum. And that we need to go back and look at the economics fresh and try to get the right answer. And let me remind you all that there's a big drumbeat of dollars in favor of keeping those sacred texts, because the parties that have monopoly profit would like to keep the monopoly profit, and they will spend their monopoly profit to fund people who say that less enforcement is always better.   </p><p>      So it's a -- it's going to be difficult to achieve progress in this area, because the parties that have financially gained from less competition are going to work hard to keep their status. So I just want to alert all of you in the media and the enforcement community to be battling courageously for the consumer.   </p><p>      But I think that the bottom line is that we have the tools, and we have the ability to get the right answer, and we should use them, and we should not be trapped in paradigms from 30 years ago, because those are really outdated to the extent they were even correct 30 years ago, which I would not stipulate to. All right, that's all.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Thank you. We're going to turn now to a series of questions that I will pose to our panelists, they've gotten the questions in advance, and actually done some negotiating. And there's a designated first answerer on each of the questions, but after that it's up to them to work it out. So, the first question which is directed initially to Josh, it goes like this. Jon's basic point is that we have more market power than we used to and that's bad. Assuming that we do have more market power than we used to, and that it's a significant increase in market power, my question is, do you agree that it's necessarily bad, and do you think something ought to be done about it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  First, no one ever told me there was negotiating. I always get -- I always get left out. So let me spend ten seconds fighting the premise and then I'll give up an answer. The question is sort of assuming arguendo, the increase in market power then sort of -- is that of -- is that a bad thing? And I think my ten seconds is almost up, but I will say I'm not sure that the premise has been established. But assuming per the question that it is, again, I think we get back to the fundamental point, and some of these old Chicago texts are pretty good including Demsetz's on the point about identification which I still think is very relevant to our discussions about concentration and price.   </p><p>      I have a feeling you meant a different one. But I think here, we don't know ex ante, and this is the fundamental problem whether increase -- we in antitrust want to care about changes in market power that are attributed -- attributable to reductions in competition. That is not all of the ways in which market power can be increased, if we want to do antitrust that is sort of consistent with IO, if we want to get the economics right, we need to have a set of tools that enables us to distinguish between those propositions.   </p><p>      So, what do I think can or should be done? There are simple answers floated around, we could have -- we could sort of go back, I don't think anyone here wants to do that, we could go back to really simple structural rules that equate competition and concentration. We could pool, dust off the 1968 merger guidelines, do antitrust with our fingers, count the firms, and pretend as if we can make causal inferences from changes from concentration to competition.   </p><p>      We could have bright line rules that have presumptions of liability if mergers are above and X share or above X dollars. We have one of those in the Supreme Court, I count that as one of the bad cases we ought to get rid of. But there's pending legislation that does something like this.   </p><p>      None of that I think is based in sound economics, so I think what we're left doing if we properly reject those ideas is making a serious investment, both in the academy and in the agencies to improving our tools and being able to answer better some of the questions that we struggle with now with identification.   </p><p>      I think we're starting that with merger retrospectives, I think if you look at the evolution of the way inside the agency empirical analysis of mergers happens now versus 10 years ago, much less 20 years ago, the improvement is remarkable, but I think it is a burden on the agencies and on the academy in these areas who like to publish journal papers and whatnot but sort of engage on these questions, both to fight against sort of oversimplified fixes that will probably do more harm than good, but also to subsidize investment in more knowledge to do a better job designing and calibrating policy with these questions.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Anybody else?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Yes, I would disagree. I think we have the tools. I don't think we need to spend 10 years developing new tools. I think we could start now. There isn't anything wrong with our existing standards or economic analysis. I think the problem comes when you try to apply it.   </p><p>      So if you're in court and it's -- and the judge is taking the view of recent cases that we have seen, which is either ignoring the facts or ignoring the economic principles or not applying the horizontal merger guidelines, for example, in terms of are efficiencies merger specific, are they verifiable, are they cognizable.   </p><p>      I think that's where the problem comes and, of course, if an agency is confronted with -- at the end of the day, they disagree with the firms and they have to go to court, that's the outside option. And if you have a very weak hand when you go to court, then there's not much you can get as a settlement. So I don't think actually think we have a problem with the economics. I think we're ready to go there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  Greg, I don't know the rules on, like, random intervention so I'm going to make one in the absence of a rule. So the thing that I have in mind in terms of getting the -- I think we're all for getting the economics right. But, for example, some of these areas go the other way so it's not a Chicago text but in 1968, Oliver Williamson wrote a pretty well-known paper on efficiencies and mergers.   </p><p>      Fifty years later, there's not a single federal court decision -- no merging parties have prevailed on an efficiencies defense, so 50 years is a heck of a good winning streak. I agree parties sometimes do a bad job presenting efficiencies. I've been inside an agency -- but I think there are places where we could do better. That's one that comes to mind that sort of cuts the other direction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  The -- just on that last point, I just want to observe that if the overall overriding problem is we're worrying about growing market power, sure, there's a good -- there might be good government reasons to think about ways in which we could do reforms that avoid showing less beneficial conduct but there problem is to strengthen antitrust enforcement and that should be the overriding focus at the moment.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  All right. Let's move to the second question. You've heard from a number of our speakers today about the evidence of -- or related to increased corporate profits. This evidence seems fairly clear. The trend is worldwide. But it is more pronounced in the United States than elsewhere and here, the profits are highly concentrated in relatively few hugely successful companies. My question for the panel is -- and Jon's going to first on this one -- does the presence of a relatively small number of hugely successful technology companies in any way suggest a failure of antitrust?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  So the answer is not per se. I mean a large and profitable firm size and successful alone doesn't mean antitrust has failed. Firms can and do grow large and become successful, you know, providing customers with valuable products and services and that includes large technology companies. We want to encourage firms to grow successful and profitable by offering better and cheaper products and services.   </p><p>      We should also be concerned if firms including large and successful ones exercise market power in some other major markets or threaten to do that through exclusionary conduct or collusive conduct or merger. Now, I pointed to the growth of dominant information technology platforms as a reason for concern about increasing market power because I think their high margins probably reflect market power in part, not because of their success per se.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  Yes. So I think I would combine my answer a little bit to these last two questions which is that -- and the IT example is good. I think they have high markups, they have high profits. For many good reasons, they have high markups. I'd just sort of say it slightly opposite from Jon, it's not just market power. I think it's a combination of market power and doing things that people want and gaining efficiencies. And so it's not -- but as I said before, it's not bad per se but I do think it has implications for antitrust even if it's not bad per se.   </p><p>      Take two of these firms. Take two of my big wholesaling firms that have an overlapping set of locations. If the markups are already very high, the stakes for a merger become that much more severe because they're already operating on inelastic parts of their demand curve. So I think in many cases, we can sort of litigate whether it was bad -- whether we got here or not. And I personally think we're going to figure out -- it's a mix of things and we're going to say some bad and some good.   </p><p>      I think what I'm more interested in is the forward-looking discussion of what are the implications, now that we're here, is there something that we should be doing, is there a kind of scrutiny that we should be offering that we haven't offered before. And I'd really like to hear from my closer to practitioner colleagues what those things might be.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  You want to get in on this?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  I'll answer it as answer to the next question you're about to ask me, how about that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Okay. That's fine. Next question. Steve sketched a scenario in which technology is changing in a way that increases the sunk costs and decreases the marginal costs of companies. That scenario rings true even if lots of other forces are at work. I would like to hear from the panelists on what they think likely accounts for the empirical observation of increased markups over the past four decades.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Okay. So I'm going to take the first half of that question and then Steve's question on what do you do enforcement-wise. I think what we need to do is adjust our enforcement analytics to fit the market structure as Steve suggested. So let's take, for example, the presence of network effects. Network effects are when the value of the product rises in the number of users. So a social media platform is more valuable to me, the more other people are on it. What do we get when we have network effects? We get concentrated market structures. Everybody wants to be on the same network because all their friends are there.   </p><p>      Okay. So we get market shares that go 99 percent and 1 percent or a few little epsilons. We don't see market structures of 70/30 or 50/50 in a world with network effects. Okay. So we necessarily are going to see concentrated markets. Is that a problem? No. As we've said already, just per se, just that fact, that's not a problem.   </p><p>      But we need to recognize that the locus of competition has shifted. Competition in that market does not display itself in the market. The 30 is not competing with the 70. No, it's competition for the market. Who is going to be the winner-take-all? Who is going to get to be the 99? There are some firms that start out together and one of them gets ahead and the market tips and that winner gets 99 percent.  </p><p>      Okay. So now that we know that the locus of competition is for the market, not in the market, how would we do antitrust? We would care an awful lot about entry. We would care an awful lot about potential competition. We would care an awful lot about acquisitions by the 99 percent of a teeny little epsilon percent. Why? Because that epsilon percent doesn't have a lot of share, but that's where the competition's coming from. That 99 percent guy is afraid the epsilon is going to become one and attract all the teenagers and there's going to be a flip.   </p><p>      Okay. So we care a lot about that little epsilon and that's where the competition's coming from and we need to dust off our theories of harm when it comes to potential competition. We need to stop investing so much importance in market share. The market share of the little guy is not big and when you calculate the Herfindahls, nothing's going to happen when you do this -- when you analyze this merger. Does that mean there was no competitive significance to this little player? Quite the contrary.   </p><p>      All those little players are the only ones that are making the 99 percent pedal faster and work harder to keep consumers because they're all potentially able to overthrow the incumbent. So that's a way in which we have standards, lessening competition and so on that work perfectly well in an internet platform or a network effects market. But we need to think about focusing our enforcement efforts at the place where the competition is, which is a little bit different in some of these markets than it would be historically in, say, automobiles. So I think there are big implications for antitrust enforcement and I would point people in that kind of direction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Do you want to weigh in, Josh?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  I think I agree with probably everything in that in terms of description of that and other contexts being appropriate to worry less about the shares and worry more about the competitive constraint imposed by the rival. I think that's sort of a common theme, focusing on the competitive constraint directly rather than using shares as a proxy that probably holds across a bunch of areas. I will make the observation that it is with respect to Steve's explanation with the sort of increasing sum cost and reduced marginal cost.   </p><p>      That -- one of the implications and I think this is a hearing for another day. But one of the implications is that a lot of those industries are industries that are intellectual property intensive, and one of the potential tensions that arises and I think the agencies have to engage with and be thinking about as do academics who are thinking about these things is, you know, the idea that we sort of are chasing markups leading us into those industries, invites a risk of having antitrust and IP sort of go back to the '60s and 1970s eras where they ran directly into each other.  </p><p>      I think a lot of work has been done to try to get antitrust and IP to serve as complements in the direction of competition innovation rather than substitutes. And there needs to be in those areas -- if that indeed is the right story, I think there needs to be sort of significant thinking about how to make sure that complementary relationship stays intact.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Okay. Let's move on to the next question which concerns dynamism. You've heard quite a lot about that today as well. And Jon refers to some evidence on dynamism as one of the major reasons for rejecting a benign explanation for some of the trends that have been observed. But I will point out to our panelists and our audience that the databases on which economists rely may be missing a lot. The broadest database that I'm familiar with is the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics Statistics, which is a very high quality longitudinal database that includes every business in the United States with at least one employee.   </p><p>      But it doesn't include any of the businesses with zero employees. And you say, \"Well, how big a deal can that be?\" Well, the answer is a presentation done by Census economists a few years ago revealed that between 1997 and 2010, 75 million startups in the United States had zero employees while only 7.6 million had one or more employees. So over 90 percent of the startups in the United States are being missed in the data that shows entry rates going down. So my question is, well, what data, if any, is telling on dynamism? And Steve is going first on this one.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  Okay. So I'll start off confessing my confusion a little bit. So when we talk about market power -- I know what we're talking about, we're talking about the ability to hold price above marginal cost. When we talk about dynamism, a few things come to mind and they seem different. One is a simply descriptive question which we might want an answer to which is has turnover in some sense changed? Is -- are the rates of entry and exit from various industries fundamentally changed?   </p><p>      I think one of the things Greg is asking is how good is the data on that. I don't actually have a great independent opinion on how good is the data on that. But there's another thing that I think Jonathan suggested, which is it's not a descriptive matter of entry and exit. It's a question of whether the economy is delivering important innovations to consumers in the form of lower costs that are actually passed through to lower prices and/or better products. And it's possible as with our last question that you have a set of really big, great innovative firms who protect their position by being very innovative. In that sense, we'd have a lot of innovation and not much turnover and I don't know if that's dynamism or not.   </p><p>      It does make me think hard though about Fiona's point about potential competition. And I think maybe this is what Jonathan is getting at. If there are firms who got where they are by being innovative, how do we ensure that the innovation continues? Surely not by seizing their intellectual property, for example, that seems bad.   </p><p>      But I duly take more seriously potential competition, is the data that Jonathan's referring to evidence of a lack of potential competition? I'm a little confused by that. It's more on sort of actual entry and exit. But these are always first order questions, these questions about innovation are always first order questions, and I think if we accept that we have these very large, very profitable, certainly firms that got where they were by innovating, again, I would sort of say, well, let's start from where we are and ask how we move forward. And I don't know that we have dispositive evidence, but it seems like an important question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  I would agree with everything Steve just said and I think then, the purpose of antitrust enforcement is to ensure that the large firm that got where it initially got on the -- by innovating and serving consumers continues to do that. If there isn't effective antitrust enforcement, then you have the possibility of entrenchment and monopoly profits and a decline in -- in the kind of innovation and price competition that we would like to see.   </p><p>      So it's very important that we have effective antitrust enforcement in this sector so that -- and if we do and we continue to have high concentration, then they're competing hard and we're getting what we want as a society, but if we don't enforce here, then I think we can't be sure that we will.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  And I'd like to just respond by reminding you that I talked about six different indicators of declining dynamism, and really only like one or two depend on the data set that Greg was working -- is worried about -- I was talking about the secular slowdown in business investment and rising profits this year, GDP, slowed rate which firms expand when they become more productive and shift in growth and productivity gains from entrants to incumbents and the growing gap in accounting profitability between the most and least profitable firms, and then also a declining rate of startups, which is more about the data set Greg is emphasizing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  One small point on the relationship between business dynamism, I think for this purpose, however, we defined it in antitrust is that, you know, of course, there are issues to explore here on potential competition, but a point of agreement with Jon is, you know, public restraint scenario where the FTC has been very active, sort of state or locally imposed barriers to entry that reduce the ability for entry are a big deal here and an area I don't think the FTC needs to be convinced that it is worth spending time on. It has done for a really time. It has done in a bipartisan and consensus oriented way for a really long time.   </p><p>      My own view is that area is probably -- if we're looking for an area to agree on for more cases to bring, I think those cases have legal issues with state action defense and whatnot, but if you want to target the resources of the agency at stuff you know is anticompetitive, state barriers to entry including occupational licensing is a -- is pretty good stuff and stuff that I think the agency would be well-served, and we do lots of competition advocacy but used to be an area where we brought a few more cases.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Shall we go after the lawyer monopoly first? I think we can get an agreement right here. That's the one that's really problematic.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I'm in, Greg.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Okay.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  You're asking an economist that question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  They know. Anybody want to say anything more about dynamism? Are we done? Okay. Good. So my final prepared question for the panelists is a broad policy question. If the plan is to somehow ramp up antitrust and the solution is not just to spend more money at the agencies which, of course, is always welcome, what should be done and by whom? Congress, the courts, the agencies? And in particular I ask, one change in substance or procedure do you recommend and what one change would you most strongly caution against. And start with Jon.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  So in the book that I mentioned that I -- that's coming out next spring, I talk about a number of substantive presumptions for ramping up antitrust that I'd like courts to adopt but I don't want to do the equivalent of, you know, picking a favorite child. I can't really describe them all here. So instead, I'm going to give you two cautions rather than one of each. So on substance, I would caution against presuming that vertical conduct is pro-competitive and I think I talked about why in my presentation, and on process I would caution against introducing direct political influence into antitrust enforcement.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  So why don't we just go down? Steve, next?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  Okay. So I really wanted to hear the practitioners talk to this more -- more than I wanted to hear myself talk about it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  You can pass if you want.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  But let me just say one quick thing which is -- it falls upon this last point. I think in general the state of the evidence and I think this is even consistent with Joshua's concentration about the state of the evidence, is that I think we could do with some flattening of priors and some less presumptions in general, that I think that's -- it's a time when things are changing, when there's a lot of interesting data and we're not quite sure what it means and the idea that we have strong presumptions, say, about what is vertical or potential competition being bad, I think a lot of presumptions should be at question and that we should be acting as though before we do the analysis, before we get the data to a specific situation, we should be more modest and are basing in priors should be flatter I think just in general.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  And since current practice is to be extremely worried about over-enforcement and not at all under-enforcement, that would flatten, I agree. I don't have any cautions, so I'm going to do three recommendations, make up for Steve's one. so we're symmetric.   </p><p>      I think it would be -- I'm going to identify who should do this because I'm not enough of an expert in that area, but I think it would be helpful if courts were to actually follow the definition of consumer welfare that is correct and the horizontal merger guidelines. In particular, that efficiencies have to be cognizable and merger-specific and benefit consumers. That would be a big help.   </p><p>      A second big help would be if we were explicit about our concern for potential competition and instructing courts to consider that as an important element in that markets where it is proven to be an important element.   </p><p>      And third, I would say that there is, as Josh mentioned, I think an increasing use by firms of government processes to protect themselves from competition and to exclude, and I think it would be helpful if someone could figure out a way to adjust Noerr-Pennington and similar kinds of laws to make it less possible for incumbents to keep out potential competitors and entrants. Those would be my three.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  Steven, Fiona stole my thunder. But let me say, I would sort of, one co-sign Steve's proposal that priors be flattened here and we take sort of hard looks at presumptions that are driving enforcement, whether they are structural presumptions in favor of more enforcement, whether they are presumptions that go the other way. I think flattening priors and reevaluating those is sort of -- no time like the present to take out zombie presumptions while we're reevaluating the economics.   </p><p>      I would say for the agencies that certainly includes -- Congress has such bright line proposals in front of it. And I'm sure would like to hear from the agencies about what they think about those bright line presumptions but I would also say in addition to quickly co-signing the reallocation -- I guess I'm not allowed to increase the budgets. Reallocation toward public restraints where I think a disproportionate amount of the harm, you line up a hundred economists and 99 are going to agree that that stuff is harmful, we're not going to have sort of big reasonable fights over which way that the welfare effects cut, so I say reallocation in that direction.   </p><p>      And the last one I would say which is more procedural and resource allocation inside the agency -- I do think -- there are a lot of really tough questions facing the agencies and facing IO economics and helping guide through what I think is a really interesting time and how we calibrate antitrust policy there.   </p><p>      A hundred-some PhD economists between the agencies and I guess I'm not allowed to raise the number to 200 without firing some lawyers which will not be popular here. But I think there are ways to more deeply involve economists inside the agency in these discussions. I think the more of that whether it is through 6Bs at the FTC, whether it is -- a lot of ways to do that. And I think the more of that, the better.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  I'd like to comment on something that Josh and Fiona, talking about the -- I really don't think -- I mean sure, there are public restraints that are harmful and appropriate to be concerned with if you want to enhance competition, but I don't think the idea of reallocating the FTC and DOJ budgets towards public restraints is necessarily a good idea.   </p><p>      What I'm worried about is that a lot of public restraints, there are other mechanism that are outside of antitrust laws, legislative and, for example, for addressing them and probably more effectively and where advocacy in front of other regulatory agencies and the like.   </p><p>      But it's the antitrust agencies, you know, (inaudible) too in the states but the antitrust agencies are really the most important actors in stopping private anticompetitive conduct, you know, at least along with other actors. And I'm worried that of taking enforcement resources away from those important efforts by the antitrust agencies, the way that Josh's proposal would suggest.   </p><p>      So it's clear, we think the budget should go up.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  No argument from me on that. I think start with my pay. We have a bunch of questions from the audience and two of them are almost identical, so obviously there is a consensus that this is the most important issue because we have two who agree on...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  They were sitting next to each other.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  ...on this. The handwriting is almost identical. I think this is not two independent draws but what the heck. So I will rephrase. What, if anything, should the antitrust agencies be doing about Amazon?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  About what?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Amazon.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  Doing the same thing they do in all of -- analyzing -- I mean the -- I think the point of the conversation and the reason for the silence is that I think we are all believers in the idea that you get the toolkit right and you fight over how to get the toolkit right and you work out how to get the toolkit right and you apply it evenly across the economy. You could take account of differences but you don't have different sort of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  You don't pick out a firm and say, how do we do...yes.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  So if I rephrase the question, are you aware of any antitrust case that the government should have brought against Amazon but didn't, would you say no?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Well, if they should've brought it, then they should've brought it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Are you aware of it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Oh, am I aware of one? No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  No. Okay. Okay, that's enough for Amazon. We have a question about static versus dynamic view of market power. And this came up quite a few times in the conversation, but since I've got question, I'll put it again.   </p><p>      Because profit is the necessary incentive for innovation and investment, how should we think about many of the things we're observing today like high margins and network effects in terms of a dynamic view of how competition works?   </p><p>      And, Fiona, you addressed this quite a bit already but is there anything you would like to add?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  I mean, this is why Steve and I have been saying let's look forward and let's try to keep firms honest. You have a good idea, you do something really well, you innovate, you get enormous amounts of revenue, people are very happy. That's excellent. But then it's very easy if we look at the historical record for such a firm to find it easier to exclude rivals rather than compete. Competing is hard. It's hard work.   </p><p>      And so we need to have a toolkit that's up-to-date and used to make sure that as we move forward, a firm that has significant market power is getting it honestly by competing on the merits and delivering innovation and low prices. And if that's what we're getting, that's excellent, but it would be not efficient and not good for consumers to stop enforcing against these firms.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  Yes, I mean Fiona mentioned, you know, earlier the idea of rivals buying competitors just to -- just to remove the potential competition. We've talked about that a bit. And you're -- I don't think you're blaming the innovative firm or punishing the innovative firm by trying to see if we can stop that from happening. And my -- I have a question. I'm not quite sure whether we should be looking at acquisitions by these firms differently than we would, and I don't think that's blaming them or depriving them of the benefits of their innovation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Let me slow things down a little. You -- after I ask a question you can go next. Somebody who's worked in an agency realizes and I'm sure our panelists do, too, that none of these questions are as simple as they might appear in a panel discussion.   </p><p>      So if you get some, let's say, dominant technology platform and it's proposing to buy some nascent competitor that might come up with the next greatest idea or might have it already but hasn't got it to market. How do you know whether to think this is bad because this threat to the incumbent monopoly is being squelched, or this is good because this is the way that this new idea will come to market?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  So here I think we rely on Jon and his error cost framework to think about this. Right? If you don't know whether the acquisition's going to going to be pro-competitive or anticompetitive, you have to think of the harms you're creating by getting it wrong. And if under-enforcement creates tremendous harm because the dominant technology platform has lots of market power and that's going to be a huge problem, then we have to make sure we're weighting that risk appropriately.   </p><p>      And it may be that we don't have very much information about -- or as much as we would about the potential competitor as we do in markets where we're assessing whether a 15 percent share should be allowed to buy a 20 percent share.   </p><p>      There's a lot of more information about the products, about the way competition arises, about the prices and so forth when you have competitors already in the marketplace. When it's potential, the problem is much more difficult. Does that mean there's less welfare at stake? Not at all. So just because there's less information doesn't mean we get a free pass to do nothing about it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  And I wanted to add -- sort of going back to the original question about where they're talking -- which was asking about static and dynamic competition. Some people have the idea that competition is somehow bad for innovation, and that when we are acting as antitrust enforcers if that's what we're -- who we are, to increase competition, we're just going to -- we're going to benefit the buyers with lower prices but somehow will impede innovation and that there's some -- a trade-off. And that's not necessarily right. And it probably isn't right on average.   </p><p>      There's lots of evidence that competition spurs productivity, lots of economic studies. And on innovation particularly, I read the literature saying the motive that firms have to innovate by escaping competition is probably stronger on average in the data than the motive to innovate that comes appropriating more returns on the margin.   </p><p>      And it's not surprising, because firms that are making major R&amp;D investments always have -- usually have a lot of reasons other than preexisting market power to appropriate submission returns to -- even if there's some imitation and successful incumbents may be discouraged from developing new products because they're -- that would cannibalize their existing rents, and because as Steve and Fiona have been emphasizing, firms with market power can discourage new competition with exclusionary conduct. And so there's every reason to think that more competition is good for society for dynamic innovation oriented productivity reasons, not just for static price and quality reasons.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  So long as we are including the -- maybe the caveat or the definition that in Jon's claim that more competition is good, that we're not equating competition to the number of firms. I get nervous about these discussions when they convert to policy, because the temptation is when I've got a really, really hard, ballsy problem to figure out, like is that acquisition of the nascent or small competitor a good or bad thing on net -- on welfare, the trade-offs are really difficult to figure out. And it is sometimes tempting and I think history teaches us certainly in antitrust that there is a temptation that is often succumbed to by agencies to sort of cling to those bright line presumptions, because you can do them.   </p><p>      And that I think is something that in that area, we certainly don't have enough empirical evidence or economic theory to do, it involves -- this may be an area I think Fiona and I disagreed some about whether we've got all the tools we need. And I think -- I think we probably agree, we've got most of what we need, but I think there are areas where we could do better and even if that means doing better means learning more about the distribution, potential competition's one of those areas...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  But here's the problem, Josh, if you say we don't know enough to draw a line, I'm fine with that, but that's not the same thing as saying because we don't know anything, we're going to decide all the cases so that it's fine for the big firm to buy the potential competitor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  You certainly didn't hear the latter claim I've made. I voted these cases.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Okay.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  And to bring them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Yes, let's not go there. But yes, I -- then I agree.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Okay. Good. So rephrasing this -- these next two questions. Economists are really on top of how goodly or badly market concentration tells you that there is competition or not competition in an industry. So we don't want to further that conversation. The question is what else, what would you look at if you wanted to know how competitive a market sector the whole economy is.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  Well, it's easier on the sector, right? And the fact of the matter is there are a lot of tools of merger analysis looking at the close substitution of products and differentiated products markets, for example, which I think are well-accepted as being much better than concentration measures. And in my understanding concentration is used largely as a screen, I'm not the practitioner. And I think some of us maybe even questioning that a little bit. But in horizontal mergers really I think practice has moved very, very far away from concentration measures and toward the closeness of substitution of merging parties.   </p><p>      I think there's less consensus in vertical mergers, but there are a new set of tools that look at changes in bargaining that result as a -- as a result of vertical competition, I think those are not as well-accepted outside of economics, and I understand some of the legal fights going on right now are not even over the specifics of whether a particular merger should go forward as much as they are about whether those economic tools have value.   </p><p>      So I think there are, in both horizontal and vertical cases, real tools of economics that focus on I think what is actually at issue in these cases both horizontally and vertically. If horizontally, they're well-accepted maybe less so vertically.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  When you get to a case, you're going to have information that a researcher wouldn't have, a lot of it. And it can be very useful. And we have tools for analyzing it. I think where the question was coming from is as a researcher, you know, as a policymaker, if you're looking at the whole big picture, what is it you should look at?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  Yes, okay. So since I'm such a micro guy and I find it hard to move past the aggregation as the sum of its components. I think it's very hard to do at the broad aggregate level. Broad evidence on markets, broad evidence on profits are interesting and they do not particularly get to the whys. I think they're a flag of interests I would say.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  The field of IO is a micro-field so we're just really bad at answering this question. And if you look at Jon's list of cites, a lot of those people are in finance or macro or labor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  Or labor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  That have come in to this empty space that we generated, which is how do we describe the economy as a whole because our field doesn't do that. And so that's partly why we have these conflicting methodologies...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Don't you wish we had some occupational licensing here?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  You know, it's -- you know, in all honesty, as I said before, it's actually excellent that those papers are raising these questions. That's an excellent thing that these questions are being raised by those papers. And I think people deserve a response. In the meantime, we don't necessarily believe the causal conclusions of those papers.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  I was just handed this emergency question. Are there important competition issues that antitrust can't handle? And I take this to be antitrust enforcement as we know it. So these would be problems that would be addressed in some other way than antitrust cases.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  So, sure. Natural monopoly, you know, the heart -- you can't -- you have to regulate that. You can't use...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  We did that. We're kind of past it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Well...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  Well, it's important...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Wait, it's almost all gone.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Your electricity bill I'm afraid to say has some regulation in it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  A little bit. But I'm at the mercy of am unregulated water monopolist...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  And then some of the governmental restraints we were talking about have to be dealt with legislatively.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Apart from regulating monopolies which is an old but still good idea, is there anything else you wish to do?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  Well, I mean I do think when people talk about the tech companies, they -- and this is a good question for the FTC is that people are sometimes talking about data and other forms of social relationships that I think are difficult to handle outside of the existing antitrust framework and may be subject to different kinds of regulation. And I think sometimes when people talk about old-fashioned antitrust they are also talking about, for example, political power and I think that's way outside the realm of traditional antitrust regulation. I think it should stay there. But it doesn't mean that -- it doesn't mean there shouldn't be some response.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  And then also leader follower conduct that leads to tacit coordination, that's very hard to address through antitrust laws.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Do you think it should be addressed at all?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  Well, I -- you mean do I think someone -- some other actor could do a better job than the courts, like that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  So I don't want to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  It's the same problem that the antitrust agencies have.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  So that would be a no.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  I -- you know, I mean it would be nice to be able to do that but I don't -- I'm not sure how.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  So I'd like to follow up on what Steve said. I mean there's political power, there's things like privacy, there's misinformation. It's not clear that vigorous competition fixes the problems that people want to see fixed in those domains and it might be that you want another agency or some other law to do that if that's what the community would like to see done.   </p><p>      So I think there are calls -- you read in the paper about people who would like antitrust to -- or perhaps think that antitrust can fix everything and my view is that that's not going to work. That antitrust is very well-geared. It's a set of economic tools, it's very well-geared to certain kinds of problems and that we should look elsewhere to other kinds of regulations if we have different kinds of problems to fix.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  Greg, let me come back, in fact I'm completely baffled that you're subject to a -- to an unregulated water monopoly and I know we're here and I still am confused by it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  It's not my house here.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes, no, I just mean...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  There are many unregulated monopolies in this country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  I agree and why we gave up on so many of them, I'm still baffled by.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Okay. Running out of good questions here. So I'm tempted to say we're done but I will give the last five minutes to our panelists to say whatever they choose to say to wrap up.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BERRY</emphasis>:  Remind them about the book, Jon.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  My publicist says this. That every one of you go out and buy it when it's available.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Are you offering a discount?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  You'll have to discuss that with my publisher.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Have you set the price yet?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAKER</emphasis>:  I don't think it's even available yet.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Okay. It's too soon to talk about.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORTON</emphasis>:  I think it's great we're having these hearings.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WERDEN</emphasis>:  Okay. Well, then we're going to take our break now a few minutes early.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  All right. I think let's get started. It's the last panel for the day. And as I mentioned at the beginning for those who haven't read the website or when I hear at the beginning, because of at least the potential for what our difficulties tomorrow. We're going to reschedule tomorrow's sessions until probably sometime late in October. So, this -- we turn now from mostly antitrust, but not exclusively, to consumer protection issue with respect -- and James Cooper now with the FTC will moderate this panel.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  All right. Thanks, Bilal. Welcome everyone. Good afternoon. I'm James Cooper. I'm the deputy director for economic analysis in the Bureau of Consumer Protection here at the FTC. It's my great pleasure to be here and take part in these hearings and moderate this august panel.   </p><p>      Before I get started, I have to, recently -- I'm on leave from academia, so I'm not used to doing this. But anything -- I'm going to try to say zero of substance today. And in the off chance I do, anything I say is just my opinion only and not necessarily that of the Federal Trade Commission or any individual commissioner including the one sitting next to me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Most especially not.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Most especially the one sitting next to me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  No, kidding. James and I have worked together for many years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes. All right. Nearly, you should probably already heard today, nearly 25 years ago, Chairman Pitofsky, he began the FTC's journey on the path to become the nation's privacy and data cop. Along the way, much has changed, when this all began, things like the iPhone, Facebook and Google didn't even exist.   </p><p>      But today, we find ourselves in a digital economy that lives on consumer data. Clearly, this evolution has provided tremendous value for consumers. We have vast troves of information in our fingertip, most of us can't get anywhere without our phones anymore, myself included. And we can connect with millions of people instantaneously as I'm sure many of you are doing right now via Twitter. I could go on.   </p><p>      But at the same time, the fact that consumer data is so tightly woven into the fabric of today's economy, it's presented unique consumer protection challenges. Part of what I think makes these issues so tricky may stem from the fact that it's not agreed upon framework for analysis. As we've heard a lot today, antitrust is married up with microeconomics, it has been for about the past four decades.  </p><p>      Privacy and data security, however, yet to find similarly suited mates. So, the FTC, or clearly economics is an important role in shaping privacy and data security policy. For example, the seminal work of the economics in information that garnered Nobel Prizes for people with names like Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz teaches us generally that reducing the cost of information flows typically improves market performance because it helps consumers make better choices.  </p><p>      But at the same time, privacy and data security policy also involves significant consumer values such as dignity, the right to be let alone and autonomy, which are really difficult to balance in a typical benefit cost framework, though they're equally important.  </p><p>      Never the one to shy from a challenge, the FTC has been in the forefront of trying to tackle these complex and weighty matters. As I mentioned before in the beginning of 1995, when Chairman Pitofsky conveyed a series of -- when Chairman Pitofsky convened a series of workshops designed to educate the FTC and the public on consumer protection issues surrounding the online use of consumer data and continuing with the 2012 policy report and subsequent reports on -- and workshops examining issues like big data, the internet of things, data brokers, and most recently, informational injuries through what former Chairman Kovacic called Policy, Research and Development, the FTC has continually attempted to calibrate its enforcement posture to balance consumer interests and privacy in data security with the remarkable benefits that -- with the remarkable benefits that the digital economy provides. And I think that these hearings will continue that tradition.  </p><p>      So this brings me to the subject of our panel today. Today, we appear to be at an inflection point. Many of the same intercurrence that are animating the challenges to the antitrust status quo that were addressed earlier today, and that will be addressed another hearings, couple with catalysts of high profile data breaches, the use of social media to attempt the influence of 2016 election, Cambridge Analytica and the coming online of GDPR have caused many to -- have caused many to question whether the current privacy and data security framework needs a rethink.   </p><p>      For example, some have suggested the U.S. should adopt a more European-like approach. And it appears that California has already taken up the mantle. We see legislative proposals in various forms kicking around Congress. So, today we hope to work through some of these thorny issues, examining where we are, where we might go, and what that might mean for both consumer privacy and the digital economy, which has provided us with so much.  </p><p>      So we're very -- I'm very happy, we would all be happy to have an all-star panel to help us on this journey today. So to my immediately left is Maureen Ohlhausen. Maureen is currently a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. She was acting chairman from January 2017 through April 2018. Before that, Chairman or Commissioner Ohlhausen was a partner Wilkinson Barker Knauer where she focused on FTC issues, including privacy and data protection.  </p><p>      She was also, served at the FTC for 11 years prior to that, where she was the director of the Office of Policy Planning. And prior to that, she was a clerk for Judge Sentelle on the D.C. Circuit.   </p><p>      So next to Commissioner Ohlhausen is Howard Beales. Howard is a professor of strategic management and public policy at the George Washington University. Importantly for the purposes of our panel today, Howard from 2001 to 2004 served as the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection. In addition, in his earlier stint at the FTC, he helped think about and really develop a lot of the framework today for how we analyze informational issues surrounding consumer protection.  </p><p>      Next to Howard is Daniel Solove. He's the John Marshall Harlan Research Professor of Law at the George Washington University. Daniel is one of the leading privacy scholars in the country. In addition to writing some of the seminal articles in privacy, he along with his co-author Paul Schwartz are the author of a casebook on information privacy law, that everyone including me uses to teach that subject.   </p><p>      He is also the CEO of Teach Privacy and runs a myriad of privacy programs, which unfortunately for us may mean he has to cut our early. I don't think he will. Because he's got something going on tonight, including his annual privacy forum, Privacy Salon, things like that.   </p><p>      And then finally, last but definitely not least, David Vladeck is the A.B. Chettle Junior Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center. And he, like Howard, was the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection from 2009 to 2013. And before that, he spent 25 years at Public Citizen litigation group.  </p><p>      So we're kind of lucky here, I mentioned, to have Howard and -- Will, Howard and David because in their timeframe with Lydia Parnes and kind of -- in between as well really took the -- really helped usher in the era of the FTC being involved in privacy and data security and really kind of being at the helm of that in large part.  </p><p>      So what I want to do with the format today, we're just going to have a discussion. We don't have any presentation. But we're going to drill down on some questions. And we also will have -- if you have questions from the audience, we would -- we'll be taking note cards to -- I guess there are designated people to take those questions and we'll certainly save some time at the end to address these.  </p><p>      So, let me get started, and we're -- the big picture headline question of this panel is to kind of see, take stock of where we are in the privacy and data security regulation in the U.S. and where we need to go. And I think that if we're going to assess that, maybe in sort of a high level, we should think about what would be the goals of the privacy and data security program?   </p><p>      So at a high level, what should a privacy and data security program be concerned with -- what sort of values should it protecting and how might we think about measuring whether that goal is accomplished? So, Maureen, I want to have you take a first crack of the question and invite others to respond or react.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Great. Well, thank you James. And I'm delighted to be here. Thank you to the organizers for including me in the panel.   </p><p>      This is a topic I've thought a lot about, what are the values that we are trying to protect and pursue in our privacy and data security enforcement in the U.S. I would say one of the first values -- because our authority under the FTC, whether it's deceptive or unfair acts or practices and are affecting commerce. So first of all, it's commercial. Right? Everyone forgets that one at the end. But it's in Commerce.  </p><p>      And then deceptive. That means that there was a promise made to a consumer that isn't kept, or unfair, which means there was an act or practice that caused substantial injury to a consumer that the consumer couldn't reasonably avoid, that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to competition or the consumer protection.  </p><p>      And of course, the FTC isn't the only actor in the space. We already have lots of other or certain number of other privacy laws. You think about HIPAA. You think about financial privacy. You think about the CPNI rules for communications data. So those are areas where in a way if you think about it, we've already as a society through our political system decided there are special buckets of information that need special protection.  </p><p>      So where does FTC fit in there? First of all, to talk about deception. I was actually at the FTC back when we brought the first online privacy case, Dan Caprio was there with me as well, and some other people in the audience probably too, under Chairman Pitofsky in the Geocities case So, they had made a promise about how they would collect or use data and they didn't keep that promise.  </p><p>      And we've brought lots of privacy cases alleging deception since. And what we're trying to protect there, I think, is two-fold. One, it's consumer sovereignty. Right? The consumer made a choice and that choice wasn't respected. So I think that's the primary thing.   </p><p>      There is also a competition element there, because you certainly want to allow the marketplace to operate in an efficient way where you have -- someone not getting competitive advantage because they've lied about what they're doing and they actually aren't adhering to it. Maybe it's costly. I mean that was like an Uber case that we brought, it was -- they had initially promised that they were going to do certain things with the data. And then it turned to stop accessing it. And then it turned out to be kind of expensive to keep that promise. So we had to modify our order. So I would say the first thing is consumer sovereignty.   </p><p>      But then the second thing, I think that we are supposed to be protecting is protecting consumers from substantial injury. And that is captured in our unfairness authority. Now, what is substantial injury is really the question. And you don't always need a promise made to consumers. In fact, unfairness, I think, works particularly well when there hasn't been a promise made to the consumer. But there is sort of an expectation that consumers won't be injured through data collection and use.  </p><p>      So some of the cases that we've brought in that space involve things like collecting and sharing real-time location data about consumers, because that can be abused in a way that can be used for stalking, right? So there's a health or safety risk. Certainly, the collection of financial information or the failure to protect financial information that could -- that's sensitive. So it could be used to hurt consumers financially.  </p><p>      One of the things -- we mentioned the informational injury workshop. And so one of the things that I tried to do with that is actually come up with a little bit of a taxonomy of the different harms that we have addressed through FTC enforcement. And what I came up in doing a review of all the cases that we've brought in the privacy area, the first one I already mentioned, which is the distortion or not respecting consumer sovereignty and through deception.  </p><p>      Financial harms, health and safety. I mentioned that one already, and unwarranted intrusion. So cases -- we'd have some where we had the TRENDnet case where there was an internet-enabled camera that had a pretty obvious flaw in its software, so that anybody who had the IP address could hack into this camera that was sold to be used for home monitoring and watching your kids, right?   </p><p>      So we think, well, that is intrusion. We also had the rent-to-own, that was Aaron's case. David and I agreed very, very aggressively on that one.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Well, it was the DesignerWare case.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  DesignerWare, that was it. Right, right. Very good. But where the laptops had a program that could turn on the camera and companies could use that or take screenshots.   </p><p>      And then last one is reputational injury. And my view is that the FTC, we've never brought a case purely to -- based on reputational injury but reputational injury has been certainly present in some of the cases that we've brought such as the Ashley Madison case.  </p><p>      So I would say those are the -- reputational is a little I think more controversial. But otherwise, I think those are the types of things that the FTC's approach, the authority that we've been given, those are the values that we should be pursing in privacy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes. Would anyone else like to weigh on that? Sort of at a high level? Perhaps even leaving aside the FTC's goals. What are some things that -- what would we think of? What should we be thinking of when we think about an enforcement program or regulatory program to protect privacy? What sort of values should we be protecting? What should we be thinking about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  So let me just add to Maureen's point about the DesignerWare, Aaron's kinds of cases. Ashley Madison, I'm not sure is a reputational harm case only. And I think part of the struggle -- and I'm glad we had the workshop on informational harms, is they all sort of fit generally into what we used to think of as an invasion privacy tort. But they're very hard to label. So with Ashley Madison, marriages were broken up and -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  People committed suicide.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  People committed suicide. So labeling that kind of harm is difficult. But I think partly, what we ought to focus on is the nature of the intrusion. So in Ashley Madison, it's intruding into very personal relationships, in DesignerWare and Aaron's, it was intruding into the home. I mean the real problem in those cases was that cameras can be activated remotely when people are sitting on their couch or doing whatever.  </p><p>      And so, I agree that it's important to try to see if we can come up with a taxonomy. But why would this really just sort of depends on context.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Since David taxonomy, I don't know -- Daniel, if you'd like to jump in. Daniel is one of the taxonomy and privacy lawyers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Right. That was not inadvertent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  Well, I would say like to the -- there's obviously protection of consumers from harm, which I think is important, and a lot then depends on how we define harm. I tend to define harm broadly to also encompass risk, which I think is a very important concept.   </p><p>      There's also the broken promises. That it's very important that if a company makes a promise, that it be held to that promise. Otherwise, the entire self-regulatory regime collapses because the privacy policies are meaningless then. So it's nice that the FTC has a backstop to that and enforces.  </p><p>      I think there's also an important component to an enforcement regime that I think the FTC can and sometimes has gotten involved in, which is consumer expectations, even if it's a direct promise, consumers have expectations about how their data is going to be handled and used that are often -- and sometimes at variance with what's said in a privacy policy or with what companies do.  </p><p>      If you take -- there's been studies about like consumer attitudes about privacy and a vast majority of people agreed with the statement that if a company has a privacy policy, it does not share data with third parties. So there's definitely a lot of misinformation out there. Consumers have incorrect expectations. And the FTC can play a very important role in helping to make sure that faulty consumer expectations aren't exploited.  </p><p>      So companies knowing that consumers kind of already have this -- maybe unjustified trust in them don't exploit that trust, that what companies do that start becoming at great variance with the consumer expectations, that those outliers be stopped. The Sears case, I think, is a wonderful example of that where they installed spyware into people's computers.  </p><p>      And this was actually disclosed in the fine print in a very lengthy privacy policy. So it was actually there. But it wasn't very salient. It wasn't very noticeable, so most people missed it. And FTC said that it was not sufficiently disclosed and not conspicuous enough. And I think that's great, because what we had is a practice that was very unexpected to consumers that caught a lot off-guard.  </p><p>      And so, I think it's very important that consumers can use sites and engage in e-commerce and other commerce and know that their -- what they expect generally is going to be the case. And there aren't going to be unpleasant surprises down the road. And so, I think it's very important that the FTC police that, especially because we know from a lot of studies that a very, very small percentage of people actually read the privacy policies or privacy notices, something like less than 1 percent.  </p><p>      So we really are in a world that consumers come in with this baggage, these expectations. And I think we have to play in that world. I know that that's how people are going to make decisions on what -- how to share their data. And there should be some protection from that being exploited.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Howard, did you want to jump in? One thing just to -- it may be completely orthogonal to what you're going to say, but maybe it'll be related. It sounds listening to David and Daniel, and I don't know if it's -- to what extent should a privacy regulatory framework -- should we think about privacy in sort of the rights-based framework? Or is it something that needs to be balanced with other values as well? Is it something that can be balanced or is it just a right? And I don't know -- it's something that's kind of I was thinking about it as David and Daniel were talking. And so anyway, Howard, I'll let you speak to that or whatever you want, whatever -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  I did want to comment a little on the discussion that's gone before it. Firstly, I wanted to take you to task for listing a Nobel Prize winners for the economics of information without listing the guy who founded the field, which was George Stigler, first and foremost. But he was one of my advisors too.   </p><p>      But I'll forgive you. I mean I think the attraction to me of the consequences based approach to thinking about consumer privacy, which is what we developed in that time that I was at the commission, was that it makes explicit what ought to be there all the time, which is that particularly in the commercial context, this is a balancing issue.  </p><p>      There are tremendous benefits that come from the ability to use information, even if it's an unexpected use of the information. And we don't want to sacrifice those benefits because somebody didn't think to include that in the list of things that might be done with information in the privacy policy because it wasn't thought of at that time, that the privacy policy was written. We didn't know this was a possible use of the data.  </p><p>      Those kinds of benefits, we have an enormous number of services that are built on exactly those kinds of secondary uses of information that was collected for a different purpose that may or may not have fit with consumers' expectations.  </p><p>      What we want to make sure of is that that information is not being used in ways that are harmful to consumers, that's doing damage to consumers. And that's where privacy regulation and privacy enforcement really ought to focus. If there's not a harm, it's not something that the FTC in particular should be worried about.  </p><p>      Now, I also have a reasonably broad concept of harm, perhaps not as broad as some. I certainly think that the things that fit -- the kinds of subjective harms that fit within the traditional privacy torts are the kinds of harms that are actionable privacy harms. But I note that the torts standard in -- virtually all of the privacy torts is highly offensive to a reasonable person. Right?   </p><p>      If the intrusion or the putting somebody in a false light is something that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, that's an essential element of the tort, not just any intrusion, not just any false light that might be held -- might be held out.   </p><p>      But including those kinds of harms, I make, I think makes complete sense. We've had two mentions of DesignerWare and Aaron's and there's a part of that case that I completely agree with. And that's the turn on the camera part of the case. There's a part of it that I've always found really troubling, and that is, this is a computer that -- when somebody stopped paying, you could activate the software and the computer would call home and tell this company that had rented the computer to somebody who was no longer paying for it where it was.  </p><p>      That's really useful. The complaint says -- well, this is location tracking, and location tracking is bad. But the complaint doesn't say why location tracking is bad, and especially when it's every two hours. And the remedy that's in the complaint or in the consent order is, \"Well, if you disclose when you first turn this on and track continuously, that'll comply with the order.\"   </p><p>      So to fix tracking every two hours, we track continuously. I don't get what harm we thought we were fixing there, and that's -- it's that harm that really needs to be the focus. If we can't articulate why we think this is a problem, we're not going to be able to adopt sensible and low-cost ways to control that problem. We've got to think first about what's the harm we're trying to prevent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thanks, Howard. So, after hearing kind of a high-level view of what sort of values we should be concerned about when we're thinking about a privacy program or regulatory framework, maybe it's important now to take stock of actually where we are. So I wanted to turn to Daniel, who as I mentioned before, has written a seminal textbook on this and lots of articles defining and thinking about what privacy is.  </p><p>      So Daniel, just kind of help us characterize the current U.S. system of privacy and data security regulation in about five minutes maybe?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  Sure. Well, at the high level, the bird's-eye view. My sophisticated way of synopsis of it is it's a mess. We have a sectorial approach with laws have risen in various economic sectors over a very long span of time. Then you have common law torts that have risen, the private torts. Plus, there's the forgotten breach of confidentiality tort that I'd like to mention too that doesn't require highly offensive.  </p><p>      There are all sorts of other common law torts that could apply in these contexts, such as negligence. That's making a resurgence and data breach cases. Then you have various state statutes in the states. You have dozens of federal laws. Not as many recently, but certainly in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, you had a real series of laws that were passed to deal with various privacy issues in various economic sectors.   </p><p>      And then you have the FTC, kind of an overarching -- the broadest jurisdiction of any federal agency regulating privacy that regulates most companies, except for some carve-outs. And that's the U.S. approach. And there are inconsistencies in the various laws, some of them are a lot weaker than others.   </p><p>      On the stronger side, you have HIPAA, which is very, very broad. It has a broad reach. It follows the data through the chain of its custody. But you also have laws like FERPA that regulate schools, that buying large are kind of -- for lack of a better characterization, a bit of a joke that are not really enforceable. They lack a lot of the features that more recent privacy legislation has.   </p><p>      Contrast this to a number of other countries in the world, including especially the EU. They have a comprehensive privacy law baseline of protection, so they can articulate, \"Here are the basic rules of the road that we follow.\" Here in the U.S., it's very hard to articulate, well, how is this particular data protected?   </p><p>      We really can't. It depends on -- well, who holds it, if it's held by certain entities and it's regulated by HHS, then it can also be regulated by the FTC, and it depends on new enforces. And it depends on what the sectors are. And one of the challenges with the sectorial approach is that the sectors change.   </p><p>      So, in the 1970s and 1980s, what various types of companies are doing in the sectors make sense then. But now, as we see, different companies are jumping into different areas. And so, when we build laws around sectors and -- they don't stay fixed. And now, there's a lot of overlap in company saying, wow, we're regulated by five different agencies and five different bodies of law, and we don't know what to do. There are so much.  </p><p>      Plus, and all the different state laws that are overlapping, and it becomes a bit of a nightmare. I'm not sure we can dial this back in the United States. I'm not sure we can kind of go and say, hey, we're going to do the other approach. But I think there are some sensible aspects to the other approach that are quite efficient, and to some extent I think could be particularly business friendlier than the U.S. sectorial approach, which I think the -- a lot of industries were happy with initially because they liked the idea of a law tailored to them or they liked the idea of a law that -- the fact that laws didn't apply to them and they fell through the crevices.   </p><p>      But those crevices have been largely -- a lot of them have been plugged up by the FTC which regulates. The other problem too with the U.S. approach is that we get no respect from the rest of the world. We're kind of the Rodney Dangerfield of privacy in the U.S.   </p><p>      But I think we have some very effective, some really good laws. I think the FTC has done tremendously effective work. We do have a lot of protection. It's just that it's inconsistent. It's hard to articulate. It's very hard to explain to other countries, especially the EU, how the U.S. system works and how information is protected here. It's so haphazard.   </p><p>      So I think the biggest challenge is what do we do going forward when we have so many laws that are locked into antiquated visions of the economy from 30 years ago, and a world that is increasingly been, the leadership role has increasingly been ceded by the U.S. Congress ever since I think around 2000, where we really haven't seen a tremendous amount of legislative activity on privacy. It really has tapered off. I mean, really seeing the states, especially California and the EU take the lead.   </p><p>      And I think if you ask most large multinational companies, what privacy law are they focusing on for their compliance efforts? GDPR, the new California law, hardly anyone will say anything about any other U.S. law. Maybe a little bit of HIPAA. FTC, I barely hear whispered these days. Although I think a few years ago, the FTC was spoken about it a little bit more.   </p><p>      But increasingly, what we're seeing I think is the companies, and these are U.S. companies, not really looking to the law here as to what they're doing and how they're building their privacy programs and practices. So, that's where we are. And I think the big question is what should we do in the U.S. for what's the next step.   </p><p>      Do we kind of say, hey, we'll just let the -- be regulated by Europe and California or will we have meaningful regulation at the federal level that reflects the balances and approaches that the U.S. would like to have.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Well, thanks, Daniel. I'd like to invite anyone to react to that, and also kind of throw out there -- it seems as you -- when you think about the landscape of the U.S. privacy regime, it seems to be a mixture of ex-ante, sort of an ex-ante regulation with notice and choice in some areas, you know, HIPAA, COPPA maybe.   </p><p>      But then we also see -- we also see enforcement, you know, private and the FTC. I mean, what are the pros and cons in -- of those approaches, and what might be, you know, you think about whether -- there should be a mixture, we should hew to one, or another, or it makes sense to kind of mix it up, and in some ways the way that we have here in the U.S. So, throw that out to anyone as -- well...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Let me comment on that briefly, because, you know, until at least a few years ago, the difference between the EU and the United States was, we did a lot of enforcement, but we had this patchwork, this crazy patchwork of laws. On the other hand, in the EU, they had even before the GDPR they had a general regulation which was much more comprehensive than any U.S. privacy law but there was almost no enforcement.   </p><p>      And some scholars have done a lot of work looking at sort of privacy on the ground both in the United States and in the EU, and they found that the privacy commitments in the EU were met only to the extent that there was a real enforcement or culture of compliance, which left out large swathes of the EU</p><p>      And so, I think that somewhere in the middle with the desired outcome, but strict rules without enforcement, at least according to the studies that have been done, didn't work all that well in the EU, and I think that was one of the major driving forces for enacting the GDPR and to basically base the new system on commitments of compliance and enforcement. And it will be interesting to see the extent to which the new GDPR is enforced by the data protection authorities in the EU who are not used to doing FTC-like enforcement cases.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Anyone else like to jump in on the ex-ante versus ex-post question or in -- anything?   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I guess -- oh. Go ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  I was going to say, well, I, you know, I agree that regulation, very -- if there's clear regulation that says, like the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Congress drew the lines there and the FTC implements and enforces it.   </p><p>      But one of the things that I had -- I think has been a real strength of the FTC's approach has been its case by case enforcement, maybe a little less predictable in some ways, but it trades that from great flexibility, right? So, a focus on harm in case by case enforcement reduces the need for you to have, predict the future to design some overarching regulation that foresees all innovations, Howard mentioned this, and I think we all would agree consumers have got enormous benefits from a lot of these technologies.   </p><p>      And consumers have gotten a lot of free content, and they've gotten a lot of information at their fingertips, as you mentioned, and so that doesn't mean like, well, anything goes, but I think we need to be careful about coming up with a system that is too regulatory, because it can't predict what the new innovation's going to be and perhaps it's going prevent it from happening.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  OK.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Yes, I just to -- just to pick up a little on the ex-ante versus ex-post problem, I think part of the -- I put -- I think part of the problem with the ex-ante regulation is that the we have now, and particularly the approaches that are embodied in the GDPR and in the California statute are really based on a premise that won't work. That people are going to read privacy policies and pay attention to these notices about what's going to be done with the information and make choices based on that.   </p><p>      And Dan says, and I think he's right, nobody reads privacy policies, it's probably a good thing because there's a study out of Carnegie Mellon that said that if people actually did read their online privacy policies, the opportunity cost to the U.S. economy would be $787 billion.   </p><p>      It's just out of all proportion to what might be at stake in commercial privacy decisions. And with the ex-ante approach that difficult, if you will, the focus ex-post on where do -- where have things gone wrong that need to be fixed, and what can we do to keep them from happening again, seems like a much more sensible way to approach the problems.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Howard, I just wanted to weigh in a little bit on your point about people not reading privacy policies. I agree, probably the average consumer doesn't, but we have academics in the U.S., I bet Daniel reads the privacy policies, I bet David reads privacy policies, and academics, and consumer groups, consumer organizations, and competitors.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I don't read them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Right. So, James doesn't, I'm just kidding, but...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Well, you said academics, I just want to make sure that you know that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Well, I -- oh, academics other than James. But there -- I think there are mechanisms for if there is a problematic term in a privacy policy for it to get noticed and surfaced, and that's one of the things we've seen I think with social media that when something is discovered, that people don't like, that news get out there pretty quick.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Well, I just, you know, I -- if that's the goal, then that points to a very different kind of a privacy policy, because you don't want something that's understandable to consumers, you want something that is understandable to geeks and competitors, who can figure out whether there's something wrong going here.   </p><p>      That's sort of not where we're headed, it's not where the Europeans are headed, it's not where California is headed, we want simple privacy policies that anyone can understand that tell you nothing, and mostly aren't read. I mean, no doubt, some people read them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  A while ago I wrote a piece about privacy self-management, which is this idea that people manage their own privacy by reading these policies and making choices. I think this is a flawed approach, not just because people don't read privacy policies, and also I think the point that there's this tension, privacy policies are useful to regulators and advocates, and academics and others who can read them carefully, and they get a lot of information, but the average consumer really can't get all that.   </p><p>      So there's a tension, you almost need two different things, which is what, you know, Paul Schwartz and I have proposed in a -- in our ALI project, which is a transparency statement for the regulators and then something simpler for the consumers.   </p><p>      But as a consumer, reading the privacy policies is relatively meaningless, I don't -- I don't read them because it's too many, and the amount of entities I do business with, and the sites I visit, you know, hundreds, thousands, I don't have time, and then the choices I think, do I share this piece of information on Facebook? I don't know.   </p><p>      The implications for privacy depend on how that information is combined and aggregated with other information over time, and how that information might line up, and what someone might do with something, and what algorithms someone might create five years from now, and a whole litany of things that I can't even figure out, so I really can't make the judgment as a privacy expert on exactly what the implications and costs and benefits to me, especially the costs over time are going to be for me to release a certain piece of data.   </p><p>      So, it's very, very difficult, and now multiply that by a thousand, and have to make that decision all the time, just really, really hard to do for the consumer. So, I'm just not sure that that approach, it's great if there's like one company that you actually do business with, I mean, only on Facebook. But it's not, I'm on all the sites, like the professors who, you know, I give an amount of homework every night, and I think like, hey, it's reasonable for my students to read 30 pages a night, but what if they have 10 professors and each assign 30 pages?   </p><p>      And that's what the companies are doing, every company thinks, hey, you know, they can pay attention, we think this is a great mechanism, yeah, multiply it, it doesn't scale, that's the problem. And the consumer, if you say, hey, we protect your data with reasonable data security, well, what's that? As a consumer, I can -- how do I assess your security? How do I know how prepared your employees are to not be phished? I can't -- how do I know what kind of encryption you're going to use, and all these other things?   </p><p>      I can't really make an informed the assessment, which is why, you know, we need an agency like the FTC to be looking out for people, just like when, you know, I would travel abroad, and the taxi fares were -- they didn't have a meter, and I didn't know what the right fare was, and they would just say like it's X whatever, and I had to trust them or make some, I didn't know, it's nice to know that someone's looking out for me. And there's a meter in someone's thought of what the right there is going to be, and I don't have to worry about someone cheating me.   </p><p>      Or I can pick up a jug of milk and know that I can drink it, and I'm not going to be poisoned. They don't have to do research, imagine that, you know, you didn't have that food safety and actually have to go online and research like the safety conditions that each farm to figure out that you buy food from there. I just like to know like I pick up a product in the supermarket, it's safe. And I think we want the same thing for privacy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  It's amazing how whenever you use the phrase privacy policy, everybody watches into a diatribe. So, I'm going to take a minute and launch into my own. One is, they're not privacy policies, you know, the original sin was calling them something that they're not. None of them really deal with privacy, they deal with data daily use. And part of the problem is they misnamed.   </p><p>      The other problem, of course, and this gets back to the question that James started with, the difference between ex-ante regulation and something else, if you have a regulatory regime that is clear, so you know that everything you do on the internet is safe, or at least you have that promise, even if it's not enforceable, then the privacy policy where the data use statement becomes less important.   </p><p>      And part of the problem that we have and the FTC has done a lot of work on simplified notice and Dan and the ALI have done a lot of work in trying to figure out a better system for this. But these are really notice systems, and they need to be simplified, many of them are written by lawyers, so they're bound to be incomprehensible. And they're often designed to be incomprehensible. So this is an issue then that plagues us and I just, don't think we've collectively figured out a way to escape it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  I think actually Mick Jagger had the answer to what's been happening here, in 1964, the technology was a little different but he said, the man comes on the radio, like, I said the technology is a little different, telling me more and more about some useless information supposed to fire my imagination. What happens, I can't get no satisfaction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  There we go.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Nice. All right. So, David, well, I'll -- with that segue, thank you, Howard. To our, you know, what or now we've kind of set the stage for where we are in the U.S., what do you see is any of the problems, because the -- again, the headline picture of this, and the headline of this, this panel supposed to think about, what or kind of rethinking the current privacy data security regime, what are -- what are some of the problems, if any of the current status quo, are there any harms that you don't think are being addressed? Is there inefficient enforcement, either over-deterrence, under-deterrence? So what do you think, David?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  So, let me just use a few examples, because we've, time does not permit me to go through the concerns that I have. But one is, I don't think we have effective tools to really understand what's going on with big data, let alone to regulate it sensibly. So, we all know the data collection is now ubiquitous, we bring it into our own homes through always on devices or sensors of the Internet of Things. We know that this data is being collected, but our laws really don't have any restraint on the sale or renting of this data.   </p><p>      We know it moves, we know it has a substantial economic value, but we don't have any real information on the velocity or volume of this kind of data aggregation. So, that presents risks. Paul Ohm, one of my colleagues both at the FTC and here, wrote an article ten years ago, in which he sort of cast in dystopian light what would he called the database of ruin. Well, we don't know yet whether there are these kinds of enormous databases, but there's nothing in U.S. law that really restrains that development.   </p><p>      And these kind of databases pose risks to consumers, there's the risk of data breach, after all these would be honeypots, they'd be a magnet for identity thieves, and we know identity theft is still rampant. So, one question that the FTC I think is going to have to grapple with is sort of where is this data, what's it being used for, how is it being transmitted to whom, and for what purpose? So, that is one issue that I think the commission is going to have to grapple with going forward.   </p><p>      Second, the rapid, the rapid initiation of algorithmic decision making in the marketplace. Now, I said this morning, I'm not a fan of human decision making. You know, we generally don't do such a great job, and machines may help. But for regulators, these kinds of decisions are very difficult to oversee, they're not transparent, machine learning algorithms are impossible to interrogate, you can't put them under oath. It's hard to root out disparate treatment based on factors that are impermissible, age, gender, race, things like that. You know, nor is there necessarily due process at the end of the -- at the end of the decision making chain.   </p><p>      And so, I know the agency's already done a fair amount of work on this, but this is an issue that I think demands greater attention, because I do think it poses enormous risks to those who come out on the bottom, in terms of these kinds of decision making.   </p><p>      In terms of enforcement, my concerns are not really with over-enforcement, because the agency resources are too scarce for that. Indeed, when I was the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, I don't know whether Howard had the same concern, but I spent a lot of my time doing triage, deciding which cases to bring and which cases not to bring, even though many of those cases in the latter category were meritorious and we should have brought them if we could have.   </p><p>      So I don't think that's the problem. I do think they are enforcement challenges. So one is, how do you enforce against an industry like the mobile app industry, which is highly diffuse, diverse industry, thousands and thousands of app developers, many of whom either don't really know what the law requires, or just don't really care.   </p><p>      So the New York Times did a story yesterday about COPPA violations, violations of the Children Online Privacy Protection Act by app developers that were tracking kids 12 and under without explicit parental permission. Sure, the FTC could, you know, bring 20 or 30 enforcement actions against this kind of industry. But it's not at all clear to me that you get any of the kind of deterrent value that you really need.   </p><p>      So one question is, with respect to these kind of diffuse industries, how do you make them comply with the law? That's one problem. Another is, we have to figure out to what extent machine learning decision making tools are staying within the statutory guidelines. That is an enforcement problem.   </p><p>      And last, we have a lot of companies under order, and order violations are hard for the agency to detect and to deal with, simply because of the high volume of companies under order, that's a serious enforcement matter. I mean, for a company to violate an FTC order undermines the ability of the agency to do its work, it undermines the deterrent value of consent decrees or enforcement cases. And I think my -- the new -- sort of the new management at the FTC is going to have to grapple with that. There are many others, but I'll stop there.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes, anyone else like to weigh in?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Oh, one thing, building on what David said, I want to -- I agree that one of the challenges for the approach that we have, and when I talked about privacy policies it was not certainly to say privacy policies are it and take care of everything, it's just that I don't think they are as totally is useless as some other people seem to think they are.   </p><p>      But the other problem is these kinds of harms that we, you know, you may have a lot of little bits of data that weren't sensitive, that weren't even person identifiable when they were collected. But through these new tools, they can be assembled into a more complete mosaic and identified to a certain person. And then I think the question there is, is there a harm, is there a risk there? And that is where I think we need to start thinking, how do we address that?   </p><p>      Because a lot of those uses may be great, they may be very beneficial, we don't want to stop those, but for the harmful ones. And if we look at something like the -- going back to the pre-internet days, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it was trying to get at those kinds of issues, to allow some kind of balancing and use of this data, but to allow consumers to know if it was being used in a way that disadvantaged them in connection with an important decision like employment or insurance or some other -- some other ones blend in. And then gave them insight into what it was and the right of correction.   </p><p>      So I think that is where we see need to start thinking about like a kind of a risk -- a risk based approach, because I don't think we can necessarily foresee all the uses, I'm a little concerned about the data use specification requirements, because as Howard said, there may be great uses down the road that consumers would like. But they still need to be protected from some of these, you know, new abilities to use, these little bits of data in a new -- in a new way.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  But that, you know, I don't know why the -- I don't know why the more complete mosaic is itself a problem, I mean, the one -- the one part of that, there clearly is a problem is if the government to get that, but that -- there's another tool to control that problem. And it's the one we ought to use and not worry about the possibility that this might be put together.   </p><p>      I want to say two things about, I think big data is a really interesting question, and it does -- there are certainly potential costs there, but there's also been big benefits, I mean, that's where our fraud control tools come from, is data aggregations, often data that was collected for a different purpose that's put together in an algorithm that predicts the likelihood that a particular person is really who they say they are.   </p><p>      And if it weren't for those tools, there'd be a whole lot more identity theft than there is which is way too much. But that's a big data I think, you can't do that with little pieces of data one at a time, you got to aggregate the data in order to get a more comprehensive picture.   </p><p>      The other thing I wanted to say about algorithms which raise some potentially interesting questions. But I think the algorithms that ought to be of concern are the ones where the user of the algorithm doesn't face the costs of mistakes, because an algorithm is just basically a way to classify. You're a good risk, you're a bad risk, you're a good prospect, you're a bad prospect.   </p><p>      There is a really interesting example of Reuters, which wants to get scoops on international news, and it does that in part by following tweets, but there's a lot of bogus tweets. And so they built an algorithm to figure out whether this was likely a real story that they should follow up on or a bunch of fake tweets that they should ignore.   </p><p>      They face the costs of both mistakes, right? They're going to miss a story if they misclassify these tweets as false tweets and ignore it, they're going to waste resources if they misclassify these tweets as true and pursue it and they're false. So, they know what the tradeoff is, they know what the costs are of both kinds of mistakes, there's no reason to think they make the wrong tradeoff.   </p><p>      And I think that's true of a lot of marketing applications where if I screen out \"bad prospects,\" I'm turning away business. I don't want to do that by mistake. I want to turn it away if it's bad business, but I don't want to turn it away if it really is good business. So, there's some fairly strong incentives within the system to make sure the algorithm works well. Where you don't have those incentives is where somebody using the algorithm only pays part of the costs and the rest of the costs are shifted to somebody else.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  What, suppose with the algorithms, I think there's a lot of concerns, because suppose especially a predictive algorithm, suppose the hotel chains, like, you know, get together or create an algorithm for determining when a particular hotel guest is going to damage the hotel room or treat the hotel room badly or do misconduct in a hotel room. And they basically come up with the algorithm and it comes up and says that you're one of those people, and starts...you're booked.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  Along with Mick Jagger too. And, you know, you started not be able to get, rent hotel rooms or suddenly you're charged more. And what are your rights there? Because you're targeted in a predictive sense, it's like well, hey, I never did any damage. Well, we're not saying you did, the algorithm's just saying that we think there's a high probability that you might. So the algorithm -- there's something wrong with the algorithm, it's just taking into account factors, and, hey, it might actually be true, but you haven't done it. Should people have rights to say just because it says I'm likely to, how do I disprove that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Or how do you even know it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  Exactly, how do you know it? How do you disapprove it? How do you argue with the prediction? So the FBI says, our algorithms says you're going to commit terrorism, we won't let you the plane and so how do I prove it?   </p><p>      It's like, well, live your life and die. And then if you die and you haven't terrorism, then we'll take you off the list because we know you didn't do it. The algorithm was wrong. But there has to be something to say like who regulates, what are the concerns with the incorrect thing. How much transparency do we have? How can it be used? What about people's rights to challenge it and say the prediction is wrong and either inaccurate. I mean how do we -- but to just kind of leave it to industry to do whatever they want without looking to the harms that consumers might suffer from this I think is something that we definitely don't want to do.   </p><p>      We need this, why I think is very important that if we look into this and have good regulation on it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Yes. Let me push back a little on Howard's point. And maybe that Reuters bears the risks on both sides of this. But in consumer finance or creditworthiness or anything else, the consumer who is misclassified by the algorithm bears the risk, may not be informed and there are no shortage of stories that have been publicly discussed where people have been disadvantaged based on correlations, not on their actuals.   </p><p>      So, American Express had a serious problem because it was reducing the credit limits for black customers who went to certain kinds of black stores that were deemed to be indicative of a credit risk. And when that became public, their answer was we screwed up but we relied essentially on an algorithm. And so, again, I know I'm not trying to suggest that we -- that machine learning can't help us make better decisions.   </p><p>      But there needs to be both some transparency and some due process here, particularly where it's not the company that bears both sides of the risks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Well, I mean I think in the financial transaction, it often is a company that bears both sides of the risk, because they're turning away business that would be profitable business and they -- there's an incentive to not do that. I mean, we can argue whether it's the perfect incentive or not. I think the other thing that we have to recognize and, is human decision-makers have all those same biases.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  And they're every bit that's hard to tease out. They are probably less transparent than algorithms. And I know when I was at the FTC in the 1980s, in the early 1980s, and we were bringing a lot of equal credit opportunity cases, every time we looked at a judgment creditor, right? The guy who sits down and looks at the applicant across the table and say, \"You look honest. I'll loan you money.\" There was discrimination. It varied whether it was women or race or what kind of discrimination, but there was discrimination.   </p><p>      Credits scoring guys didn't have that problem. Credit scoring reduced the discrimination problems that were inherent in judgmental creditors. And that's the potential gain from algorithmic decisions. More data is usually better because it can challenge your preconceptions about what's going on and what's the right answer here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  Sometimes. I mean I think that's true sometimes. But sometimes algorithms are no better than the humans that design them and there are hidden biases that can crop up in algorithms.   </p><p>      Not just the people who design them, in fact, the data being inputted into them. If you input data that is infected with human biases into algorithms, the algorithm spits out a data that also is infected as well.   </p><p>      So there's a lot of concerns all around, absolutely, algorithms can improve human judgment. Absolutely, human judgment can be problematic. But I do think that the cost of let's say for a business, just say, hey, I don't want this business, I'm going to turn a consumer away is not enough. It's not the same level of harm to the consumer.   </p><p>      Because the business can say on the aggregate we just think certain types of consumers are just not very profitable for us. So who cares if we don't -- if we lose a little bit of business, we ultimately gain.   </p><p>      For those consumers who can't have access to credit, who can't get a loan, it's a much, much bigger deal and a much, much bigger cost. So I actually don't think it's -- the market would always work itself out because I think that businesses might be, make a good economic decision. Hey, if we do this, yes, we lose a little business but we also lose some risk but that doesn't always look the same way on the consumer side.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Maureen, do you want to...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Yes, I wanted to weigh in on this. I do think that there is the mechanism of the market, where if one company has a poorly designed algorithm, and it is leaving good business on the table, someone else has an incentive to try to capture that.   </p><p>      And that's one of the things I think we are seeing in the lending area. There are finer distinctions being made with better targeting tools that allow lending to occur at better rates than really going by the rough calculation of a credit score, that you kind of fall on this side of the line or that side of the line.   </p><p>      So, I want to certainly take into account the fact that there are competitive pressures to have a better algorithm to expand your business.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Just to kind of follow up. It seems that a lot of this discussion is about the classifications obviously, to come out of algorithms. Is Section 5 the right way to address that?   </p><p>      I mean, when we think about Section 5 would it be, with at least three out of the four of you here on the table have been in the position of an enforcer and is this the -- leaving aside whatever statutory or regulatory authority Congress has given the FTC to enforce discriminatory, Is Section 5 should it be, address an algorithm unfairly classify someone as being getting subprime loans for instance. Is that stretching Section 5 beyond where you think it should go? Or is that the right place for Section 5 to be or should it, instead should it be Congress making cuts of what is unfair discrimination?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  It's beyond where I think Section 5 should go. It is the -- obviously, the FTC has a role in places where Congress has given it a role like equal credit opportunity.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Right, yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Where it enforces and that is -- it's reasonable and appropriate for them to do that. That's what it should do. But to look for discrimination even of the same sort in other places is a whole different set of considerations than what the commission knows about and has expertise in.   </p><p>      In one of the proposals that was kicking around at the time of the Unfairness Policy Statement was, well, maybe we should use Section 5 to say boards of directors should be more representative.   </p><p>      Elizabeth Warren, call your office. And that was the kind of thing that the commission and Congress were trying to get away from, and that's why the subjective kinds of values I think is something that the Unfairness Statement says in general, we can't do that. And even if it's something that we might do, it's probably more appropriate for a different agency to do it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  David?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  I have a slightly different answer. I agree with Howard that this kind of issue would rise mostly under ECOA or FCRA or some of the other statutes the agency enforces. But I think to the extent that there is some intentionality here, then it would fit under the unfairness doctrine.   </p><p>      That is if there was reason for the designers or the users of the algorithm to know that it somehow either inadvertently or because of the training data, systematically excluded X people based on gender or one of the suspect (ph) classes, I think the agency would have would have an unfairness case. But I think the burden on the agency in the case like that would be very high.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I imagine you probably don't want to weigh on it, so. The...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  It's been covered.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes. It has been covered adequately. Just, while we're on this about and you had raised something, David, I think it's interesting about when we -- early on in your earlier response thinking about some of the problems.   </p><p>      Do you think that -- and really both David and Howard's people enforced and sat there and looked at the complaint recommendations and thought about what relief you should get. Do you think the FTC, its 13(b), equitable powers, I mean do you think it's hamstrung strong at all in its ability to get adequate relief in privacy cases?   </p><p>      Or do you think there should be -- I realize the commission I think on a bipartisan basis has been on record and saying that in data security cases civil penalties authority would be good and I could be wrong, but I think that's right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  That's right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  But leaving aside that, I mean do you think that in privacy enforcement, do you think some -- there needs to be a bigger stick than what we have now, which it seems in many cases when these are apps that are free and collect data, it may be very difficult to get an equitable relief under 13(b).   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Yes. I mean I do think that, I mean, in my view and I don't think this is the commission's view is that there ought to be original fining authority under 13(b). And take Ashley Madison, I mean, there's no way to do meaningful redress there.   </p><p>      Injunctive relief is not going to give much solace to peoples whose marriages ended or whose spouse committed suicide. So I do wonder about sort of the ability of the agency to forge any kind of effective remedy in those cases.   </p><p>      I also think that if you look back at some of the cases that we brought earlier on in -- during the Leibowitz era, I think that a civil penalty for example against Google or Facebook initially would have had a deterrent value.   </p><p>Facebook is currently under investigation again. Google, it took only two years before it violated the consent decree. I do think there ought to be initial fining authority under 13(b). I think the commission would have to use it carefully, particularly where other remedies were just simply inadequate.   </p><p>      But I do think 13(b) cases ought to be -- I think civil penalties ought to be available in these cases.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Howard, I don't know if you want to weigh in on that or ...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Sure, yes -- no, I don't like the idea of civil penalties, I like -- and especially in an area like privacy, I like the original scheme of the FTC Act that was the -- essentially the one bite at the apple because the precise meaning of unfair and deceptive is not that clear.   </p><p>      And the way the act was set up, the commission could get an order and if you violated the order, you were subject to civil penalties for that. But civil penalties sort of presume a really clear standard I think of what's a violation and what's not.   </p><p>      And that's not so clear in a lot of privacy areas. I think it is a lot clearer in data security. I do think civil penalties there make a lot more sense. But I think in a lot of privacy and some other areas, I think it's not -- I think monetary relief is not appropriate.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  All right. So, Howard, I -- while I have you -- now turning to kind of how we -- or seeing a shift, we look at the GDP or some changes in the landscape of privacy regulation around the world and throughout the United States. We see GDPR, California, the FCC privacy rules is now at in funk. They all seem to be taking a -- like more of a FIPPs-based approach, a notice and consent, deletion rights, correction rights.   </p><p>      We see in the GDPR and California. On the other hand, we have the FTC which has been really based on demonstrating likely consumer harms or deception. And this tees off a little bit. We've discussed a little of this in the ex-ante versus ex-post discussion.   </p><p>      But do you have any thoughts on why you think we've seen a trend towards this at least in recent evolution, of these newer privacy schemes, away from a harm-based and more toward a consent-based.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Well, I think two things. One is and I think this remains true. There's a remarkable unwillingness to articulate what are the harms we're worried about, or inability to articulate what are the harms we're worried about.   </p><p>      And if you can't do that then you can't -- then it's hard to do a harm-based approach, especially as an across the board regulation that applies to absolutely everything. You've got to think through the harms that you're trying to prevent first. And there's been to me a remarkable unwillingness to do that.   </p><p>      Second, I think the FTC in the last few years has -- it certainly hasn't abandoned worrying about consequences, but it's also moved towards a more what I would call FIPPs-plus in its enforcement actions. I mean the VIZIO case is a really good -- a good example.   </p><p>      There is just no way to tell a story about that case that doesn't come down to notice and choice. People were surprised to learn, did it violate their expectations to learn that their internet connected TV was connected to the internet?   </p><p>      Really? And did they think that it was making recommendations for the next thing they should watch without knowing what they had been watching in the past. Really?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  It didn't make recommendations, Howard. It said that's what it was collecting the data for.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  But it didn't make recommendations.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  But it didn't make the recommendation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Well, that's -- the complaint doesn't charge the failure to make recommendations.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  No. But it charges that if it's collecting the data and sharing it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  For ratings purposes. This was a completely inaccurate use -- innocuous use. There's no harm there at all. No harm there at all.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Wait, wait...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  People didn't know, it violated their expectations.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  But it was also...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Why is that there?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  It was also collecting data like even if you weren't watching something streaming, you were watching a DVD or something. It was collecting and reporting that this television watched this DVD. That's not a ratings.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Well, and again what's the -- I mean it is a rating purpose because it's how are people spending their time with the set which is what you, well, I mean, it's what the television rating services are busy measuring is how much time -- or is this set on that's what the boxtop is recording.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  But that's not what was being collected.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  But this is complementary to that data. It is -- it would help you...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Well, in addition to that data.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Yes. Well, this is competition for Nielsen, right? It's got a box that measures what the TV is on and what channel is it tuned to. And that's about it. It's additional information about whether people are actually watching a TV show on the channel that it's tuned to or watching something else. I mean there's -- you can say it was unexpected but I don't know why it's bad.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  Well, this is a lot of dispute about harm. This is one of the problems when it comes to harm is that you say, well, that harm is never articulated. Well, maybe the harms that you would think what harm is not articulated. I mean there are harms in some of these cases that don't necessarily mean that someone is out financially or their reputation is ruined.   </p><p>      And part of it is just consumer trust, that you buy a product. You think something is going to be used in a certain way and suddenly you discover, well, oh, all of this other stuff is going on.   </p><p>      And that doesn't just hurt the consumers. It also hurts other industry. People start to not trust it. Well, gee, I don't want to buy the nest things because they're going to do something with my data. I don't want to buy a Google home.   </p><p>      I don't want to go and use these new technologies because they are not -- I can't trust what they're going to do. Nothing they say, and it could be a different company that if consumers start losing faith that what's told to them, what they expect is not what they expect. All these products they're going to start to say why do I want to start bringing this stuff into my home when it seems like that everybody, the common story is they're doing something else with it that I didn't expect.   </p><p>      And that hurts other companies. It undermines the companies that are doing the right thing and are saying what they're doing with it and then doing that. And then if they want to use it for something else, tell people. Try to get their consent.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  (inaudible) problem. This is why we have the Video Privacy Protection Act because someone went to -- they used to have stores where you could rent videos.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  (inaudible) video.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  And they got list of what -- and everyone was outraged because who knows whether he was sitting there at night watching Disney shows or porn.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  But VIZIO says, to me the VIZIO case seems to say the store can't keep the record.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  That seems crazy. They're not publishing. They're not publishing this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  It's a TV set. It's not your content provider.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Let me, let me -- yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  It's not your content provider. It's a TV set. It's like a radio. It's not a content provider. It's, and what VIZIO was doing is keeping an account of what you watch and selling it not just, with no restraint on selling it and that's why, that's...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  But they're selling it -- selling it anonymized in aggregate.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Well, OK. That's why we have a Video Privacy Protection Act because Congress...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  No, there's nothing in the Video Privacy Protection Act that would keep the store from reporting the aggregate rentals by title.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  That's true.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  That's what VIZIO wanted to do with this data, was the stuff by title. But I just wanted to say if we think about the problem the way Daniel just characterized it, then I think it's a problem that has no solution. I mean there are going to be -- this is an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today that I didn't read closely about 5G and why it's important to be first that predicted among other things, we're going to have internet connected tennis shoes. OK?   </p><p>      Now, imagine having to read the privacy policy for your shoes and your light bulb and everybody else. If we -- there are going to be things that happen in this new world that consumers will not know about, right?   </p><p>      Their cars will do things now that they don't understand how it happens or that it happens. If the goal is for consumers to understand at a technical level what's going on and how all the information is being used, we're not going to get there, guys. Let's think about what's second best.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  Well, I think the consumer -- I totally agree with that point, consumers aren't really going to understand the technical thing, that's why I think the FTC plays a great role here as a backstop to say, \"Look, someone's got your back.\" If the uses are going to start to get so far afield, so unexpected, we're going to stop that. We're going to keep that in check. And I think that it shouldn't be like OK, wow, you're going to be totally ruined, that that shouldn't be the standard or else then I think it should just be obviously, if there is a small variation in use and it's very innocuous, it's not a big deal. I don't think we should go after trivial things.   </p><p>      But I think like significant variances in use aren't totally trivial. And it's not like it's impossible, and you can also look at circumstances, how hard would it have been just to try to shape expectations a bit better about what this product is going to do.   </p><p>      Companies should have an -- some kind of an obligation not to just hide the ball and secretly do things. Not saying it has to be in a fine print of a privacy policy, but the more people understand a little bit about like, OK, what are these new products doing and what are the consequences, it's an education that needs to happen as we make these changes. And it's not happening because there's no incentive to do it. So like, great, I can get away with just doing it on the sly and no one is going to come after me.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  I think the important backstop though is not that there's something that I know there's nothing surprising happening with my data, because I'm sorry, whatever your data is there's something that would surprise you that's happening with it almost for sure. And even if you're quite sophisticated about what's being done with information and how it's being used, that's probably true.   </p><p>      The question should be is there something that's being done with that data that's creating a problem? But the mere fact that I didn't know it was there is not the problem.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Well, now that Daniel and Howard agree on the role of consumer expectations in privacy, great, that we solved that problem.   </p><p>      I want to -- we are going to -- I want to make sure we have time for some of the questions we got, but I want to turn back to David and in my introductory remarks I kind of posited that we're at an inflection point, that there is something out there seems to be at least have a lot of people talking or suggesting that we need to rethink privacy here in the U.S., maybe moving us closer to the EU, we see this in California.   </p><p>      So, I -- to David, do you think that the pressure for national and international conformity is going to drive federal privacy law closer to these other models whether we like it or not?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  I think that -- well, first of all, I think that the California -- the enactment of the California statute and the, sort of the slow implementation of it, deliberately slow implementation has created an interest in many other states to see if they can replicate what California has done.   </p><p>      And so, I don't think that Congress is going to immediately race to enact federal privacy legislation, but many of the most important statutes that we have the environmental protection laws, the occupational safety and health laws, these were all enacted basically in response to an emerging -- emergement of state law.   </p><p>      And so, my guess is that unless the business interests that are unhappy with the California law succeed in either scuttling it back in the California legislature, or attacking it successfully in court, you'll see other states moving to adopt a regime based on the California statute, which is to some extent based on the GDPR. And so, the other force that is very much at work in the privacy lawyers in this, either here or watching this on the web, they know this because they spent the last six months advising clients nonstop, compliance with the GDPR.   </p><p>      So I do think it's going to have an influence on United States. I think that that's problematic in and of itself. I think there are many laudable goals in the GDPR. I think for the United States to adopt that kind of approach would be very difficult. I mean we are not based on a code system of laws. And the GDPR reads a little like Napoleonic Codes updated.   </p><p>      So I think there is some friction in the joints, but I do think that particularly California has got 37 million people. It's the fifth largest economy in the world. It is the locus for much of the development of the tech community. And I think it's going to be highly influential. And I think the FTC has to sort of be very conscious about what's going to take place as a result.   </p><p>      And I do think that Congress has basically made itself irrelevant in this debate. And that may be a good thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Howard?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  I agree with that. I would point to a slightly different example of what I actually think is probably the most likely outcome. There's a lot of -- and California is big enough to sort of drive things substantively.   </p><p>      It turns out, so is Vermont. Vermont passed a law requiring labeling of anything that had genetically modified organisms. That provoked industry support for a preemptive federal law that says you've got to label if it's got genetically modified ingredients. But you can label by a QR code that people can scan and go to a website to figure out whether it's genetically modified or not.   </p><p>      Now, it is -- there will be pressure for preemptive federal legislation. What that federal legislation will look like is not so clear. But I think there will be that pressure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  In the early days of breach notification, I remember I testified before Congress right after the ChoicePoint breach, this is 2005. And there was interest, very strong interest in Congress, look, all these states are starting to pass breach notification and industry was all behind it. We have to comply with all these different standards and this is going to be very complicated and expensive and, you know, we really need some federal pre-emptive law. There was even a couple of bills kicking around. Nothing happened.  </p><p>      So I have very little faith that this Congress really can -- can pass a law let along tie its shoes. So I think that it -- it really -- I'm not expecting, even though I think that some of these laws could benefit consumers and benefit industry to have some in these areas, I just don't think it's likely. And so I think, you know, Congress just will have not have the role unless it somehow gets it act together. Really won't.  </p><p>      I mean, the most significant privacy legal change that was passed was passed as part of Obama Care. It was the HITECH Act's updating of HIPAA and passing the notification rule and -- and that's really the big accomplishment for Congress in the last, you know, since 2000 really. Not much has gone on.  </p><p>      So yeah, I don't hold out much hope, so I think it's going to be what it is and I think there's some problems with that approach, when we're going to have a lot of different varying state legislation on privacy, breach notification's at least something that's more, you know, focused on one thing, you have variances. And all the different -- you know, all sorts of different laws like California's with different variations is really going to be a big nightmare for industry to comply with and I don't necessarily think that's a good thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  I will say when I started at the FTC in 2001, everybody said the Internet legislation and privacy legislation is going to pass right away and you guys better get behind it, but well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Well, we said that at the beginning of the Obama Administration too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Well, I was just going to point out that Congress isn't the, and the FTC aren't the only actors in this drama or the states. And so NTIA, and NIST and the Department of Commerce and the White House are all considering paths forward, do we look at some sort of approach that would allow more of a uniform privacy framework to be put in place. So I would encourage people to pay attention to that process as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I just got a card that, I was going to wait for the audience, but it says point of fact, HR 6743 Federal data breach is going to the full House and it was just voted out of committee today, so breaking news here. So I'm guessing it was prompted by this panel. Taking immediate action, immediate action.  </p><p>      So we're, I want to -- we're talking here about the pressure on the U.S.. One -- one thing that we have here in the U.S. that is the first amendment then, that seems to push back against privacy regulation, so I wanted to, Daniel turn to you and I know you've written and thought about this, the international or at least the comparative privacy law a lot, do you see any problems with extraterritorial application of elements of the GDPR?  </p><p>      For instance, we see that the European Court of Justice is now considering the extraterritorial application of the right to be forgotten. We saw a Canadian court deal some of that early this year with Google. So do you see that as a potential push back?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  I mean there are definitely certain problems with that. I mean a lot of laws including U.S. laws have extraterritorial application as well, including the California law. And yes, I think that to some extent every country in every region has a right to regulate those who do business in its borders.  </p><p>      And I guess one thing is good luck enforcing that over in the U.S.. If a company is not in Europe, GDPR says it applies, but I don't see what they're going to do to really enforce it. So it's there in paper. It looks scary on paper, but in practice, it's kind of a joke. They really can't enforce it.  </p><p>      There are certain aspect of GDPR that wouldn't fly under the first amendment, but there are a lot of aspects under it that are fine under the first amendment, that are embodied in various laws. I can look to a lot of different provisions of GDPR and find analogs and similarities in U.S. laws including even rights to be forgotten. There are already right to be -- COPPA has one for example. So a lot of these aren't like foreign, radical concepts. There are certain things about GDPR that just will not fly in the U.S. for first amendment reasons as well as just general U.S. approaches.  </p><p>      So the idea that you need to have a lawful basis to process data, that you have to be somehow authorized to do it. And there's only justifications that allow you to even use or collect data. I don't think that would really work in the United States. It's just so contrary to the U.S. approach which is generally a permissive approach. Like you can use it unless there's a problem that's caused by it, and it's generally U.S. approach is not to just say, you know, you need authorization. Do something unless what you're doing starts creating an issue.  </p><p>      So I don't see that being carried over. But I think a lot of the things that GDPR does and a lot of things these laws do are not so radical and foreign and different to the U.S. You look at HIPAA, you look at GDPR, there's a lot of similarities, actually much more than the California law. HIPAA has a lot of similarities. A lot of GDPR is just having a privacy program, doing basic risk assessments and other things all of which HIPAA requires.   </p><p>      And the GDPR often doesn't say a lot about like what those things should entail. It just say, hey, do privacy by design and do it early, but it doesn't say what you're supposed to do for that, it's largely empty. It says do a privacy impact analysis, but it doesn't have a lot of specificity on these things. And sort of how HIPAA is in a lot of ways too.  </p><p>      So in a way, I don't think there is like -- things are so radically at odds with each other and that the GDPR approach is radically incompatible with the United States. I think there are certain things that are -- that won't transfer over, but I think the things that transfer over, the commonalities and the things that could work are more than the things that can't.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Anyone else want to jump in on that? All right, well so with a little bit of time, I've gotten lots of great questions, I unfortunately we don't have time to ask all of them, but I want to direct one to Maureen because it's right in your bailiwick. It has to do with the FTC taking advantage of it dual role as both having consumer protection and a competition side and using that to examine the impact of data, not just in the consumer protection dimension but on the impact on small business competition and entry.  </p><p>      And I know you've written about that and thought a lot about the mixing privacy and competition.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Certainly in a competition analysis, data could be considered if it is an asset that is being combined in a merger in a way that is going to reduce competition in some way. I mean much like combining two distribution systems or combining two factories. I think one of the questions though is really a lot of times concerns about privacy are really what's it driving, concerns about trying to use privacy in a competition analysis, so it's not really about hurting competition, it's about hurting privacy. So I think there certainly are examples one could think of, right?  </p><p>      So say there were two very privacy-protective handset manufacturers, right, and they sort of have that big part of the market and say you can say that was a separate part of the market than other handsets, and they were going to merge, right, and then they were going to have a high market share of handsets that compete on privacy attributes. That could be in any trust case just like you could have two manufacturers of super premium ice cream who want to merge, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Just hypothetically.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Just hypothetically, super premium ice cream, that was the case. And anyway, so I -- so I think it's not that data cannot be a part of it. It just has to be -- the concern has to be about competition. Now on the other hand, we have had situations where one company is buying another company and they're going to be combining data sets. They're not -- it's not -- they're not horizontal competitors, right? It's not that it's taking the competitor out of the marketplace, but that data that is going to be transferred over to the merged company was collected with a certain set of promises.  </p><p>      And so what we've said through the head of Bureau of Consumer Protection is that the promises travel with the data, right? So if you collected this data and said we're not going to use it for marketing and they're going to combine it and then use it for marketing, they would have to get a new set, well basically a new consent from the consumers. So if consumer says well no, no, that's not what I wanted, then they would have to take them out of that data set.  </p><p>      And so I think that's -- that's the way it has been handled. I mean there are merger cases where you do -- you're combining two very unique datasets, like we had a case about mapping use for insurance. And we had a competition remedy, because it was going to reduce competition and so we actually had a remedy that required sort of replication and sharing of this data set.  </p><p>      But so often, these types of mergers that involve a lot of data are, they're being combined to create what we would consider in antitrust like a new product, like a new efficiency as long as it's not harming consumers as a consumer protection matter and that wouldn't be considered a negative kind of thing.  </p><p>      So I actually have an article about this, called Competition, Consumer Protection, and the Right Approach to Privacy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  She'll be outside signing it on the way out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OHLHAUSEN</emphasis>:  Right, it's in the Anti-Trust Law Journal in 2014, but -- so it's not to say these values aren't important. It's to say what tools you use are, that's an important consideration. If you are concerned just about, you know, someone is going to use data in a way that harms consumers, that's a core consumer protection issue and you might -- you should use those tools. If you are concerned that this transaction that involves data sets is going to reduce competition, either competition on privacy or competition in another -- some other form, then antitrust is the right tool.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Anyone else? Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  Yes. I just think there's a different perspective on it that is also important. As we -- as we look at it and as states and Congress look at additional regulatory requirements, those often have differential effects on competitors, and in particular in the privacy world, it is a whole lot easier for a consumer-facing company like Google or Facebook to get consent than it is for the behind-the-scenes somebody that does exactly the same thing using exactly the same information, but they collect it via cookies, planted by a host of different publishers participating in an advertising network.  </p><p>      But that is the competitive fringe in the online advertising market, and regulations that make it harder for them helped to entrench Google and Facebook and that's not necessarily a good thing, but it's very much a competitive concern.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Okay, so here is a question in our 2 minutes and 21 seconds left, about the -- the -- it didn't come up surprisingly, but we kind of touched around on it, the privacy paradox. You know, maybe Daniel, I'll aim this one at you first, but the audience member says, how do you reconcile the fact that consumers readily value privacy highly even asked, but they tend to do things that contradict these stated values and I think we all know that as the privacy paradox, that stated preference seems to diverge from revealed preference in the privacy space.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOVE</emphasis>:  Yes. Alessandro Acquisti, an economist at Carnegie Mellon, has done some really great work on this and studied this very effect of, you know, people and what they say and what they do are at variance. And that's often the case. And part of it is that, you know, the choices that people have and the way that they make those choices are shaped by how those choices are presented to them and a bunch of other factors that could lead them to make choices that are not always consistent with their stated attitudes.  </p><p>      And so we might say, well, what is true? Do you say the behavior is the truth about what they really value or is it what they say? I actually think it's neither. I don't think what they say is actually reflective of how they actually value something, but I don't think behavior is always a good metric either, because there're a lot of things skewing the behavior. And Acquisti does a great job of pointing out all the different skewing things on behavior.  </p><p>      So in a way, it's very difficult to measure what consumers actually value, because I think both metrics are problematic for doing that, because a lot of it is how informed the consumer is and what information they're given and so on. And you get very odd effects. One of his studies is very interesting. He had two groups and one group, he told like they're going to collect very sensitive data and one group he said, we're going to protect it, we're going to give all sorts of privacy protections and security protections on it and the other group, he said nothing.  </p><p>      And guess which group disclosed more, the group he said nothing to. And so it's almost figuring out like punishing you for actually doing the right thing, and that's because when you told people all the privacy and security protections, people's minds suddenly woke up, oh my gosh, maybe there are these risks that I didn't think about and that made them more cautious.  </p><p>      So a lot of interesting effects and I just urge you to read his work. It's very illuminating, and he'd do a much better job than I did at tackling this issue.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I'm sorry David.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VLADECK</emphasis>:  Yes, I'll make one other -- you know, people are generally presented with take it or leave it offers. I mean either of you are on Facebook or you're not, or you use Google Search or not and, you know, we did some research when I was at the FTC about these issues and part of it just -- and this is, just sort of echoes what Dave says, how the choice is presented.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Yes. Howard?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BEALES</emphasis>:  I think how you frame it clearly matters, but, you know, consumers have all sorts of preferences where it's a perfectly valid preference and a perfectly real preference, but when they confront the cost of satisfying that preference, they make a different choice, and that's -- there are issues of how you pose the question and how you define it and what consumers know, but there's also these choices have costs and consumers may make them differently.  </p><p>      An example I like is organic foods, something like 48 percent of consumers say, \"yes, I prefer organic.\" Organic's market share is about five percent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  All right, well I wish we could go on forever. I'm sure the rest of you all do, but we are out of time by the 6-0s on the clock up here. So join me in thanking this great group to -  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I will await my instructions from below.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  If -- we have one more little end note, if Howard Shelanski, professor here will give closing remarks and here he comes now. The Price is Right style.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHELANSKI</emphasis>:  All right great, thanks very much to all. And thanks to all of you for being here. I'm used to at academic conferences saying I'm standing between the audience and cocktail hour, there're no cocktails here, so you guys are stuck. I will nonetheless keep things brief.  </p><p>      I want to start by just reiterating what Dean Treanor said this morning, it's a real honor for us here at Georgetown to be able to host these first days of these series of hearings that the FTC is hosting. It's really -- we have a deep connection to the FTC as Dean Treanor explained and it's really just wonderful to have such a vibrant debate and so many of you here today and special props for my antitrust students who showed up, I appreciate that, former students so they're not getting any benefit from this since I'm not teaching at this semester.  </p><p>      One of the things that I think has been particularly heartening about today's discussion is we really see the full integration of the agency's consumer protection and competition missions. I think both of those are front and center, certainly the last panel makes that very clear, in the issues that these hearings are tackling. And you heard Bilal say earlier that the Bureau of Competition and the Bureau of Consumer Protection are really complementary.  </p><p>      I might add Bilal left one thing out of his formulation which was the Bureau of Economics, and it's my view that with a small handful of FTEs, the Bureau of Economics could actually be completely substituting of both of those other bureaus, but that's perhaps a chauvinistic view from someone who spent some time at that agency and in that bureau.  </p><p>      The importance of these hearings really can't be understated. I think one of the great things of the American regulatory system writ large and one that, sort of a distinguishing set of characteristics that one sees when one goes around the world and sees how regulation and law enforcement is done in many other very sophisticated jurisdictions, is the level of transparency and accountability that characterizes the way our federal agencies act.  </p><p>      And to be sure, one could be cynical about certain actions that those agencies take, but when one takes a broad view, it really is quite impressive. Agencies have to justify their decisions. Agencies have to have a coherent framework and they have to have evidence, and those agencies don't get to make those decisions on their own because they are subject to accountability through the courts, and you just have to open up the paper today to see an example of a court overruling a federal agency that did not meet those standards.  </p><p>      So the agencies have a real obligation. These hearings fall into that framework of transparency and accountability. An agency that fails to justify its actions in a particular case to a court loses the case. An agency that fails to justify its program and its approaches and framework loses its -- loses its relevance before the public, and that is I think a very damaging and harmful thing to have happen.  </p><p>      So for an agency periodically to hold sustained public hearings where it examines both the sets of problems on which it is focusing and the analytical framework with which it's approaching those problems is really a very important aspect of maintaining that relevance, maintaining that legitimacy with the public, and that is exactly how I see these hearings and what I see the FTC as doing.  </p><p>      The FTC has always been an agency that cannot stand still and rest too comfortably with the problems it's focusing on or with the tools with which it's analyzing its approaches to those problems. Indeed, that was the spirit which Chairman Pitofsky launched the hearings nearly a quarter century ago. We were in a time of very interesting economic turmoil with the rise of high technology industries, economics and other tools for assessing where there were competitive harms, where there were harms to consumers, were changing and developing.  </p><p>      And it was his judgment as chair that the agency needed to go out and make sure that it was well understanding what problems the public is focused on, that it was understanding the industrial changes that were before it and that it was understanding the state of the art of the knowledge with which it would assess those problems.  </p><p>      Well, I think all of those forces are even stronger today. And when Chairman Simons came into office, he came into office at a moment that most of us in the antitrust field and many of us in the consumer protection field recognized as a sort of a historic moment. I think there was sort of unprecedented debate, but I don't want to say unprecedented but certainly unprecedented for the last 40 years, debate over some of the fundamental framework and conventional understandings of how antitrust should be enforced.  </p><p>      There is a recognition that we have much sharper tools out there for understanding how consumers behave and process information. It's time for the agency to step forward and make sure that it is fully taking account of and understanding that public debate, because if it doesn't, it will keep looking over here and the public will be thinking about problems over there.   </p><p>      So if you open up again, the paper over the past week, you'll read that there is a lot of public debate, a lot of debate in academia, a lot of debate in think tanks about whether the consumer welfare standard and as conventionally conceived in antitrust enforcement is adequate to address some of the concerns about market structure changes or wealth distribution changes, things that the first panel this morning talked about.  </p><p>      I had people come up to me and say, can you believe the FTC invited so and so? Those are flaky ideas. They shouldn't be giving air time to those. And the FTC and I firmly disagree. These are things that people are thinking about and they are motivated by the problems that everyday consumers are perceiving. And if the agency turns its back on those voices in the debate and doesn't take into account what might be legitimate in those arguments, the agency will lose its transparency and it will fail the test of accountability before the public.  </p><p>      So recognizing that, we see on all of the panels today and on the panels that we will see in the other 19 days of hearings that I think are scheduled, are real diversity of views that explore the outer boundaries of what would traditionally be thought of as competition enforcement or consumer protection enforcement. And only by taking into account that thinking at the outer boundaries, of hearing about the problems that might be novel or different in form from the way we've seen them before given the rise of large digital industries and AI and new kinds of technology, only by fully exploring them and doing what Chairman Simons said we should do and that he would do in his opening remarks, follow the evidence, follow the evidence to identify where there is really a problem, follow the evidence for where we have a good understanding of tools that can resolve those problems.  </p><p>      In that way the agency will do two things. The agency will modernize its thinking. It will better be able to explain its actions even where the action is inaction, it will better be able to say action is not warranted or we don't know enough to have action. And we're making that decision having taken into account the state of the art thinking and having really heard from the public, from stakeholders of all kinds about what the problems are that they are feeling and that they are sensing out there in the marketplace.  </p><p>      By doing that, the agency will become more effective, it will modify its framework as it needs to to be more effective, but it will also be more effective and transparent in justifying what framework it eventually arrives at after these hearings.  </p><p>      So these are more important as events than the one-off kinds of conferences that very often characterize a field. They are a sustained and iterative process over 20 days where some of the same issues will come up again and again. Everything is documented, everything is public, and at the end, there will be reports very transparently explaining what evidence the agency is crediting, what arguments it's crediting, what arguments it doesn't feel it can credit, and the technology if you will of consumer protection and competition enforcement under Section 5 at the agency will all be the better for it.  </p><p>      So this is an important enterprise. It's an important enterprise not just for the people on the different panels, but it's an important enterprise for all of you to participate in, commenting, sending your comments to the agency, the agency has got an open window for those comments right now, because it is a unique moment that we might not get again for another 20 or 25 years, or else it will occur only incrementally though the case by case kinds of transparency and accountability. So this is a critically important moment. I think this is a really auspicious start today to that moment. I look forward to following and participating in some of at least the remaining 20 days, I would encourage all of you to do so as well. Thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAYYED</emphasis>:  So I'm just going to say thank you and say five percent down. And then our next session, September 21st, Constitution Center, so not very far from here and that will get us I don't know, 10 percent down. Thank you, thank you to the panelists.

Wilson at a hearing entitled \"The FTC's Role in a Changing World\":</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm delighted to be here today at the hearing on the FTC's role in a changing world. Our next panel will discuss how to ensure that we have sound policies in place for international cooperation in the next decade.</p><p>\"I should also give some perspective on my interest in this area. As a young associate, I was privileged to practice law with James F. Rill, former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust at the U.S. Department of Justice, who will speak at this hearing later today. It was Jim who instilled in me an understanding of the importance of focusing upon international competition issues and participating in events like this. While working with Jim, I helped prepare submissions to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). We also collaborated on activities involving the U.S. Council for International Business (USCIB) and the Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC), the voice of the business community at the OECD. And perhaps most memorably, I worked with Jim on the International Competition Policy Advisory Committee (ICPAC) hearings and final report, including the recommendation to create what later became the International Competition Network (ICN).1</p><p>\"Then, as Chief of Staff to FTC Chairman Tim Muris, I was privileged to help launch the ICN.2 I have watched with pride in the ensuing years as the ICN has grown and succeeded. Indeed, it has exceeded my loftiest expectations, and I know I am not alone in marveling at the good work done under its auspices.</p><p>\"Given these experiences, I have great faith in the ability of jurisdictions to nurture constructive dialogues through bilateral and multilateral forums. But things have changed significantly since I began practicing antitrust law in the 1990s.</p><p>\"Indeed, we have seen a sea-change in the international aspects of competition law. For example, as we were preparing the final ICPAC report, I eagerly described that work to a relatively senior antitrust partner at our firm. Perhaps frustrated because I did not have time to work on his matter, he responded indignantly that \"there is no such thing as international antitrust!\"</p><p>\"Today, there is no disputing that antitrust law has a clear international dimension. Its internationalization reflects a number of factors, including an increase in the number of jurisdictions with antitrust laws and the increasingly global scope of many industries.</p><p>\"This growth has been coupled with a second significant development, the growing digitization of our economy. Apart from Microsoft, many of today's business titans did not even exist when I graduated from law school. (Neither did email or the Internet, but that's another matter.)</p><p>\"These technology firms are now at the center of the next great debate: Whether we should abandon, or at least radically alter, traditional antitrust principles to address what many believe to be a \"technology\" problem.</p><p>II. Today's Great Debate</p><p>\"This question is being debated not only in the U.S., but also worldwide. I was recently in Berlin for the excellent biannual conference sponsored by the Bundeskartellamt (BKA). In speech after speech, panel after panel, I heard the same watchword, \"choices,\" as shorthand for the need to make choices about how to adapt antitrust law for the 21st century economy. Indeed, several speakers argued that we have reached an inflection point, particularly with respect to Big Tech, and that decisive action must be taken.3 Both at that BKA event and at an earlier International Competition Network (ICN) event in Tokyo,4 I've heard agency heads discuss various proposals to significantly change the way we enforce the antitrust laws.</p><p>\"This theme is also apparent in the news. For example, in the last month, organizations in several other jurisdictions, including the U.K. and Australia, have issued reports recommending significant changes to their respective competition regimes.5 These reports have, among other things, recommended expanding regulations governing the conduct of large technology companies.</p><p>\"Here at home we hear similar calls for big changes, from wide-ranging structural and behavioral remedies to changes in the underlying goals of antitrust law. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren recently proposed rules that would break up technology platforms with annual global revenues over $25 billion and impose various behavioral regulations upon the remaining platform.6 For smaller companies, she would impose the same behavioral rules, but not structural separation.7</p><p>\"Others have called for revisions to the U.S. antitrust laws that would require enforcers and courts to consider whether the challenged conduct increases fairness, reduces income inequality, preserves jobs, benefits small businesses, and protects \"competitors, workers, customers, and suppliers.\"8 Oftentimes these calls are accompanied by conclusory statements asserting that the American economy is less competitive than in some ill-defined golden age of yore.9 Sometimes these claims are even supported by rudimentary statistics measuring the total number of mergers, the valuation of these mergers, the size of the largest businesses, or the share of the \"eCommerce\" industry controlled by the largest online retailers.10</p><p>\"So it strikes me that we are at an inflection point, and we do have important choices to make. To name three:</p><p>* Should we abandon our present focus upon a single goal of antitrust, presently the consumer welfare standard, in favor of a standard that requires us to weigh several different factors?</p><p>* Should we abandon our present reliance upon economic principles to inform our understanding of whether a given merger or trade practice is anticompetitive?</p><p>* Should we return to the days of Pabst Brewing and Von's Grocery,11 when antitrust analysis began and ended with a simple rule tied to a simple number, such as prohibiting any increase above a given threshold concentration threshold?</p><p>\"As I have said in recent speeches and statements, I myself would answer each of these three questions with an emphatic \"no.\"12 But regardless of my views on the substance, I have confidence that we are well-equipped to study these questions and reach sound conclusions. And perhaps more importantly for today's purposes, I also have confidence in the ability of the international antitrust community - including its many bilateral relationships and multilateral institutions - to examine these important questions.</p><p>III. This Debate Highlights the Value of International Engagement</p><p>\"Discussing these questions with our international partners is especially important in today's interconnected antitrust environment. The antitrust rules we adopt in the United States may have repercussions abroad, and antitrust rules adopted by other jurisdictions may affect us here in the United States.</p><p>\"Comparing notes with our international partners generates at least two benefits. First, it helps each agency, including the FTC, sharpen its own analysis. Second, it helps us identify areas for collaboration and, if appropriate, convergence.</p><p>\"Given the importance of these discussions, we are fortunate to have strong teams in charge of international cooperation. Here at the FTC, Randy Tritell and his team do yeoman's work managing our extensive network of bilateral relationships with sister agencies around the globe. Our Office of International Affairs (OIA) leads our daily cooperation on competition, consumer protection, and data privacy cases in order to reach compatible analyses and outcomes.</p><p>\"OIA is also instrumental to the success of our other international initiatives, including our international assistance missions and our international fellows program. Even more impressively, the Office maintains high quality over a very large volume of initiatives; in 2018 the FTC conducted 24 international assistance missions abroad and hosted 10 International Fellows from foreign agencies here at home. Roger Alford and his team have done similarly excellent work at the DOJ.</p><p>\"We also benefit from exchanging ideas in order to promote convergence with our international partners through both bilateral relationships and multilateral organizations such as the ICN, the International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network (ICPEN), and the OECD.</p><p>IV. Conclusion</p><p>\"In conclusion, there is a growing international debate about whether and how to revise the antitrust laws, particularly as they apply to the digital economy. Given the potential impact that changes in antitrust law would have upon large global businesses, it is critically important that we think through these issues together with our international partners.</p><p>\"Thankfully, we can lean upon Randy, his team, and his counterparts to facilitate this discussion and help us identify areas for further collaboration. This meaningful international collaboration is no small victory, and certainly something that I would not have predicted more than twenty years ago.</p><p>\"And now I will turn it over to our panelists to advise us on how to make the next decade of international collaboration even more successful.\"</p><p>1 INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION POLICY ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR ANTITRUST, FINAL REPORT (2000), available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/atr/legacy/2006/04/27/cover.pdf\">https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/atr/legacy/2006/04/27/cover.pdf</url>.</p><p>2 Timothy J.

The nominees are Joseph Simons (Chairman Designate), Christine Wilson, Noah Phillips and Rohit Chopra. The hearing covered a range of antitrust and consumer protection issues before, or potentially before, the Commission, including healthcare competition and pharmaceutical pricing; competition in technology and telecommunications sectors; industry concentration; cybersecurity breaches and privacy; and online or telemarketing deception and scams.The general tone of the hearing was positive. No member of the Commerce Committee raised concerns with any specific nominee or suggested opposition. Chairman John Thune (R-SD) indicated his intention to seek a floor vote quickly on the nominees. </p><p>The Committee shortened the period for additional written questions from members to one week, from the typical two weeks. Senator Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) indicated that the chair hopes to schedule the nominees for a Committee vote in the Commerce Committee's next executive session.A detailed summary of the hearing is linked below, along with links to member opening statements and witness testimony.Links to Written Statements and TestimonyChairman John Thune (R-SD)[1]Ranking Member Bill Nelson (D-FL)[2]Nominees: Joseph Simons (Chairman Designate)[3], Rohit Chopra[4], Noah Phillips[5], Christine Wilson[6]Opening StatementsChairman John Thune (R-SD) said he has appreciated the FTC's increased focus on the technology sector and that he hopes the agency will continue that focus. Ranking Member Bill Nelson (D-FL) said he hopes the FTC will continue to work in a bipartisan and independent manner.Introductions. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced Joseph Simons, the nominee for FTC Chairman. He said the FTC will be facing complex challenges in the next few years and that Mr. Simons is \"just the man this moment requires.\" Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced Noah Phillips, formerly of his staff. He said Mr. Phillips is an expert in IP, antitrust and technical issues, and has a gift for building consensus across the aisle. Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) introduced Christine Wilson. She said Ms. Wilson is motivated by her view that competition is the best protection for consumers and the strongest prescription for a robust economy.Nominee Opening Statements. Mr. Simons said that he intends to continue to lead the FTC in a bipartisan way. He said the agency will focus on protecting and improving consumer welfare. Ms. Wilson said that the FTC should wield its authority appropriately and cautioned against the commission trading its role as referee in the market for the role of manager or star player. Mr. Phillips said in his opening statement that he believes the mission of the FTC is to protect consumers and competition, maintain predictability, and keep abreast of advancements in technology. Mr. Chopra said in his opening statement that he sees challenges ahead for the FTC in handling data breaches, sophisticated scams targeting seniors and veterans, and a large volume of upcoming M...ctivity. He said it is the FTC's responsibility to protect consumers as well as honest businesses.Question and AnswerThe hearing covered the FTC's enforcement priorities and its antitrust and consumer protection missions.Enforcement PrioritiesSenator Tom Udall (D-NM) asked how the commission will prioritize all of the issues currently pending. Mr. Simons said he intends to focus resources on areas where the potential for harm is the greatest. Senator Udall asked Mr. Simons for several commitments. Mr. Simons agreed to examine the FTC's budget and identify any concerns for the committee; he also agreed to examine the issue of bots in public comment systems, false labeling of sports equipment, and internet connectivity of children's toys. Mr. Chopra said the collection of data on children and service members warrants very specific attention. Mr. Phillips said consumer education is a crucial tool to get the word out to parents about data collection risks. Senator Udall said he hopes the FTC will work with state attorneys general to amplify that message.Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) asked if merger enforcement should be a priority of the FTC. Mr. Chopra said there are barriers to entry in many industries, and that it is very important that the commission is sufficiently flexible to adapt its resources to keep up with the enforcement challenges presented by rapidly changing markets.AntitrustInjunction Standard. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) mentioned his legislation, the SMARTER Act, which would align the standards that the DOJ and FTC must meet to obtain preliminary injunctions and which would require the FTC to litigate merger cases in federal court (rather than in administrative proceedings). He asked the nominees if there is any good reason for different injunction standards to govern DOJ and FTC merger challenges, and if they would ever authorize the filing of an administrative complaint without seeking a preliminary injunction in federal court. Mr. Chopra said he believes market participants should not have to navigate multiple standards whenever possible, but one concern is the overall speed of the proceedings. Mr. Phillips said he does not believe there is any good reason to have different standards. Ms. Wilson said she believes businesses should have predictability and clarity when considering potential transactions, and that there is no good reason for different standards. She said she would be inclined to seek a preliminary injunction in federal court for unconsummated mergers. Mr. Simons said he believes in practice that the two standards lead to the same results, but agrees that that should be made more clear. He said litigation should be in federal court and there should only be one bite at the apple. Senator Lee said he was encouraged by those comments and that the fate of a litigant should not be determined by a coin toss determining which agency reviews the merger.Competition in Technology Sector. Senator Thune (R-SD) asked about the state of competition in the technology sector. Mr. Simons said big is not necessarily good or bad, but he has concerns that big and influential companies could use anticompetitive means to stay big. Ms. Wilson said she believes the antitrust laws as written are sufficiently broad and flexible to adapt to new technology. Mr. Phillips said technology companies have a large impact on our lives, and he sees the FTC playing a role in ensuring competition. Mr. Chopra said large tech companies compete not only with each other but with several other sectors of the economy also, and that creates interesting challenges for the Commission.Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) asked about the scope and size of big tech and how the FTC should approach the rapid growth. Mr. Simons said he believes the sectors most likely to face antitrust problems are those in which firms have the most market power, and he intends to pay particular attention to those areas.Competition in the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industries. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) questioned the nominees about drug pricing and whether they agree the FTC needs to vigorously enforce against anticompetitive conduct in the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Simons said he is very concerned about drug pricing and would like to explore the possibility of creating a task force that could monitor drug price increases and identify cases where anticompetitive conduct has played a role. Mr. Chopra said the FTC needs to focus on sectors in which enforcement can have the greatest effect on consumer pocketbooks, and the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries must be a top priority.Senator Capito (R-WV) asked the nominees about prescription drug pricing and consolidation in the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) industry. She raised concerns about retail competition in the healthcare industry and asked how the FTC will deal with these issues. Mr. Simons said he strongly agrees with that concern and hopes to establish a program to retrospectively examine mergers and determine if past enforcement has been effective. He said the healthcare industry may be part of that initiative. Mr. Phillips said the FTC should be focusing on this issue because healthcare costs may be the number one issue for many American households. Ms. Wilson said this is an area where the FTC has spent a lot of time, and she expects they will continue to do so.Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) asked Ms. Wilson about protecting consumers in the face of consolidating healthcare markets. In particular, he raised concerns about PBMs lacking transparency and abusing market leverage. He asked what role transparency should play in ensuring competition in the pharmaceutical segment. Ms. Wilson said she firmly believes transparency is crucial for free and efficient markets. As to PBMs, she agreed with Mr. Simons that merger retrospectives would be important to determine whether the FTC has achieved the right enforcement balance. Senator Wicker said that pharmacists are often frustrated by the regulatory burdens placed on them.Senator Klobuchar (D-MN) asked about reverse paymentsmdash;i.e., where a branded pharmaceutical supplier is alleged to have paid a generic company to drop a patent challenge and stay out of the marketmdash;and pointed out that pharmaceutical prices have continued to rise. Mr. Phillips said the FTC has a long bipartisan tradition of policing anticompetitive actions in the pharmaceutical industry and said he looks forward to continued FTC focus there.Competition in the Telecommunications Sector. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) read a statement from FTC Commissioner Terrell McSweeny about gaps in the FTC's authority and expertise in the telecommunications sector over privacy and data security. Mr. Chopra said he shares the concerns Commissioner McSweeny raises. Mr. Simons said he believes if the FTC's authority to enforce in this sector is restored, the FTC will be a vigorous enforcer. Senator Markey said the FTC lacks sufficient rulemaking authority in this area; Mr. Simons said the FTC and FCC both have rulemaking authority but of different types. Mr. Simons said that he would like to consult with the FTC's general counsel's office before reaching firm conclusions regarding these issues.Competition in Agriculture. Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) asked about concentration in the agricultural industry. Mr. Simons said he would likely include agriculture in the merger retrospective program. Senator Tester asked if the review could affect the Syngenta/ChemChina merger. Mr. Simons said a retrospective would have implications for every merger going forward, but that generally past mergers are a done deal. The other nominees agreed.Competition in the Airline Industry. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) expressed concerns about the airline industry. He said he hopes the commissioners will use their platform and bully pulpit to advocate for competition there, even if the FTC lacks jurisdiction. Mr. Phillips said he would like to make the Commission a resource for other agencies seeking expertise on the topic. Senator Blumenthal said beyond the FTC being a resource, he would like to see it \"be a champion.\"Consumer ProtectionConsumer Protection Policy. Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV) asked for all nominees to make a commitment that the FTC will be an active consumer protection agency on their watch. Each of the nominees agreed. Senator Cortez-Masto asked what they see as the biggest challenge the commission will face. Mr. Simons said data breaches, and Ms. Wilson agreed. Mr. Phillips agreed as well, but added that those topics should not distract from the bread-and-butter issues of the agency like protecting children and the elderly. Mr. Chopra said the FTC should make enforcement against credit reporting agency misconduct a paramount priority.Data Protection and Data Breaches. Senator Blumenthal (D-CT) inquired about protecting consumer data in cyber breaches. Each of the nominees expressed concerns about whether the FTC has sufficient authority to create incentives for companies to protect consumer data.Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) asked whether there should be more rigorous guidelines regarding notification about data breaches and whether, for example, waiting five weeks to disclose a breach was too long. Mr. Simons said it was worth examining the possibility of new guidelines, but that he does not yet have a good basis to reach a conclusion on whether five weeks is too long. Mr. Chopra said as a general matter and not specific to any one case, several weeks does not sound fast enough to him. Mr. Phillips said data breach notifications raise serious issues that he is looking forward to working on. Ms. Wilson agreed this area raises serious issues and said she anticipates the FTC will spend a great deal of time on these questions.Credit Reporting. Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) asked the nominees if they believe the FTC has the authority to do more in the credit reporting industry. Each of the nominees said they were interested in exploring whether the commission would benefit from more authority. Mr. Chopra said the industry is an example of one where consumers cannot vote with their feet and the commission needs to \"amp up\" its work in the field. Senator Schatz raised predictive algorithms and asked if the FTC would commit to looking into that issue. Mr. Chopra said he would.Senator Klobuchar (D-MN) asked about a recent data breach in the credit reporting industry. Mr. Simons said he expects the commission to be \"all over\" any major issue involving data breaches.Student Loans. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) asked about student loan scams and what the FTC can be doing at the federal level. Mr. Chopra said the situation resembles the foreclosure crisis. He said he knows the FTC has been criticized for being late on the issue, but believes the staff has done good work that they need to amplify and not allow history to repeat itself.Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) asked about student debt relief scams and how the FTC should work with the Department of Education and other agencies to address them. Mr. Chopra said there is no question the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and DOE must tackle the problem by working together, along with state attorneys general. He said the debt relief scams are the symptom, and that the authorities also need to address the underlying cause, which he believes to be subpar student loan servicing.Child Privacy. Senator Markey (D-MA) asked what the nominees will do to ensure child-directed applications are fashioned to protect privacy and asked each of the nominees to pledge to promote pro-child privacy policies. Each of the nominees agreed. Mr. Chopra said the market has evolved very quickly with technology and pledged to notify the committee if he feels the FTC lacks the authority it needs.Online Gaming. Senator Hassan (D-NH) asked about violent video games and \"loot boxes\" (a form of reward in online gaming). Each of the nominees agreed that children becoming addicted to gaming is a problem that warrants the FTC's attention and agreed to examine issues with loot boxes.Telemarketing. Senator Capito (R-WV) asked about the new age of telemarketing. Ms. Wilson said the Do Not Call initiative was initially successful but technology has now outpaced that effort. She said the FTC must evolve on the issue.Senator Tester (D-MT) asked about telemarketers. Mr. Simon said he expects there is a technological solution to the problem. Mr. Phillips said a solution must be a priority for the Commission. Mr. Chopra agreed it should be a priority but expressed concern that the agency does not have the resources and tools to solve it.FTC Telecommunication Authority. Senator Blumenthal (D-CT) asked about the Ninth Circuit's recent panel decision FTC v. AT#38;T Mobility, which overturned an FTC enforcement action against AT...obility for allegedly \"throttling\" data usage for certain customers. He said the decision creates a major gap in the FTC's jurisdiction. Mr. Simons said he expects the en banc Ninth Circuit will reverse the panel decision. He said he would support eliminating the common carrier exception from the FTC Act entirely. Senator Blumenthal expressed concerns about \"mobile cramming\" (including third-party charges in bills for telecommunication services).Other Topics. Senator Wicker (R-MS) asked the nominees specifically about proposals to change the FTC's \"contact lens rule,\" expressing skepticism about whether a rule that is currently working well should be changed. Mr. Simons said he believes that if it \"ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Ms. Wilson agreed. Mr. Chopra said the agency should be careful about imposing unnecessary burdens on the smallest industries.Senator Baldwin (D-WI) asked about travel-rating websites and the potential that they may be incentivized to promote positive reviews to collect click-based compensation. Each of the nominees agreed to look into that issue.Senator Capito (R-WV) asked about the role the FTC plays in addiction issues. Mr. Chopra said addiction can create conditions where consumers are susceptible to serious scams and fraud, including body brokering in the opioid epidemic.Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) asked about deceptive and unfair marketing practices surrounding the use of fake bots and social media followers. Mr. Chopra said sales and marketing are often more effective with more trust, and said he looks forward to addressing that trust problem. Senator Moran asked about ticket bots, saying someone needed to be made an example of. Ms. Wilson agreed to vigorously enforce the BOTS Act and make sure violators are held up as examples.OtherFederal vs. State Enforcement. Senator Cortez-Masto (D-NV) asked how the nominees expect to interact with state attorneys general. Each of the nominees said they plan to work very closely with state attorneys general to use them as a \"force multiplier.\" Senator Cortez-Masto asked Mr. Simons how he will incorporate other commissioners into everyday decision making. He said he foresees it being \"Team FTC,\" and each nominee has significant expertise that he intends to make use of.Influence of Former Chairman Muris. Senator Cruz (R-TX) asked Mr. Simons and Ms. Wilson what lessons they learned from working with former FTC Chairman Muris. Mr. Simons said he learned to set clear priorities and communicate them well. He said he values high staff morale and intends to follow former Chairman Muris in promoting morale. Ms. Wilson said she learned the value of having a positive agenda to implement rather than just reacting.Appropriations. Senator Moran (R-KS) asked about the Commission's appropriations and if Mr. Simons had anything on which he would like the Appropriations Committee to focus. Mr. Simon said he didn't know enough yet to say whether they might need more or less money in certain areas, but his bias at this point would be to \"keep the ship steady.\"* * *Senator Capito closed the hearing on behalf of Chairman Thune. She said that given the committee's intention to get the nominations on the next committee markup, the record would remain open until Tuesday, February 20, and responses would be due by Monday, February 26.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

This follows the FTC investigation that began more than a year ago after reports that Cambridge Analytica had gathered personal data from tens of millions of Facebook users. The data firm worked with President Trump's 2016 election campaign. The Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer joins us now with more. Hi there.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY GLAZER:                 Hi. How are you?             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 What specifically is this $5 billion fine for?             </p><p>EMILY GLAZER:                 So the FTC began an investigation after these reports came out about Cambridge Analytica and these privacy missteps by Facebook. And the FTC investigation centered on whether there was a lapse that violated this 2012 consent decree that the FTC had with Facebook where Facebook agreed to better protect user privacy. So, of course, in this case, the answer in many ways was no. And the FTC has had this long-running probe going on for quite some time, and it also got very politicized and partisan. And finally we learned that they voted this week to approve a $5 billion settlement, a record for the agency.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 And the vote was 3 to 2. Why the split?             </p><p>EMILY GLAZER:                 It got really politicized and partisan, which I guess is resembling our country overall right now. Basically the Republican majority, the commissioners within the FTC were voting for the settlement, but the Democratic commissioners have objected, and they really have for months, which is why this was so drawn out. They wanted the agency to be, you know, even more tough. And it wasn't just about the amount; it's also about the terms.             </p><p>                Unfortunately we don't know too much about the terms right now, but a big sticking point for months was whether or not Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and head of Facebook, would be named and any kind of governance that could be action that could change, and we don't know where that stands right now.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 You said $5 billion is a record fine, but Facebook is a record-setting company. Is that fine actually going to cause them much pain?             </p><p>EMILY GLAZER:                 It really won't. You know, $5 billion is a huge amount of money, but it is not going to hurt Facebook as a company. In fact, you know, they just had earnings, and it really won't even - it'll definitely matter, but it doesn't hurt them too much financially. And this does matter a lot for the FTC because it's a record for - record penalty for violating an FTC order. The prior one was a $22.5 million...             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Wow.             </p><p>EMILY GLAZER:                 ...Fine against Google in 2012. So this is just, like, leaps and bounds more.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 And does this conclude the investigation, or is there more to it?             </p><p>EMILY GLAZER:                 There is more to come. So we don't know exactly how much time it will take for it to totally be finalized. What we know right now is that the matter has been moved to the Justice Department's civil division, and from there, it'll have to be finalized. But again, it's really unclear how long that will take.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 There are other investigations of Facebook happening in Congress, the Justice Department. Does this FTC fine have anything to do with what's happening in those other parts of the government?             </p><p>EMILY GLAZER:                 I think that it's all related at the end of the day, and regulators are always looking to see what their peers are doing. But this doesn't cancel out other investigations or probes necessarily. And right now we're in a place where big tech is certainly in the spotlight. So I think there's a lot that's ramping up right now because big tech is largely unregulated, and there are so many calls, especially around privacy and antitrust and the public and politicians that are really calling for more oversight.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 So a lot more to come on this story. Emily Glazer of The Wall Street Journal, thank you very much.             </p><p>EMILY GLAZER:                 Thank you.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF PYRMDPLAZA'S \"DROWNING\")            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2019071216</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-PKR1-DY1J-T1R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
