And how can policy facilitate the use of big data while taking account of data protection requirements? Mr Agust\u00edn Carstens, General Manager of the Bank of International Settlements, gave a thought-provoking keynote speech on these topics at the 55th SEACEN Governors\u2019 Conference in Singapore. The bottom line? Regulators and policy makers need to incorporate data protection into their thinking about the role of data-driven scoring and risk allocation.</p><p>Could you estimate someone\u2019s reputation based on the way they format their email address? What about their personality by monitoring when they choose to shop? Big data harvested from today\u2019s wide digital footprints means that big tech and financial services can make valuable predictions and conduct analysis as detailed as this.</p><p>Big data has widened financial inclusion for those with thin credit histories \u2013 in China, for example, as we heard at Data Amplified 2019, big tech has facilitated credit for hundreds of millions of those typically underserved by banks and insurance companies. When it\u2019s at its best, personal data analysis can increase market efficiency and enable financial services to offer personalised products.</p><p>New technologies making use of personal data clearly show promise, however, there are fundamental questions about data privacy, regulation and policy that need to be answered.</p><p>Carstens outlines the importance of determining ownership of personal data \u2013 is it owned by big tech firms, or the individual? And how can policy surrounding data privacy prevent data fragmentation which could preclude the benefits that make big data valuable in the first place?</p><p>With no formal standard-setting body responsible for personal data use, regulation diverges wildly from country to country. On a domestic level, banks and financial services regulators are often failing to coordinate with data protection authorities, and their mandates are not always compatible with data policy.</p><p>Where to next? Carstens suggests that BIS could convene discussions between various international public sector authorities and help identify policy issues. With big data being intrinsically international and ever more key to the world economy, it\u2019s clear that regulatory and policy matters need to be further explored.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2651053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKT-8WG1-JDG9-Y171-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"401\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It\u2019s good that the sheer volume of information that\u2019s part of the big data landscape is almost impossible to comprehend. It\u2019s good that, according to a recent Gartner poll, big data is falling into the trough of disillusionment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All these things are good because big data wants you to forget it exists.  Look the other way as algorithms begin writing themselves without human input, codifying the biases of original programmers with technologies that will soon surpass human sentience.</p><p> SEE ALSO: 11 Big Tech Trends You'll See in 2013</p><p> It\u2019s easier to let disillusionment with data inspire inertia than work to fully tame the binary beast.</p><p> But if we don\u2019t view data science via a framework based on sound hypotheses, we\u2019re a sorcerer\u2019s apprentice sweeping code in haphazard directions to take a life of its own.  The interconnected systems of our technically enhanced planet are making decisions without coordinated ethical or human guidance, which leaves us two choices: dystopia or discipline.</p><p> Context Over Code</p><p> \u201cMy biggest fear is that data science is used as a blunt tool and that people don\u2019t understand the cultural implications of quantifying our world,\u201d says Jake Porway, founder of DataKind, an organization that brings together leading data scientists and high impact social organizations through a comprehensive, collaborative approach that leads to positive action through data. He\u2019s as much a data philosopher as scientist.  Gifted at navigating the channel between hacking and hypothesizing, he is adamant about helping people understand how to create context as well as code for insights based on big data. He says, \u201cThis due diligence should be embedded in our craft.\u201d</p><p> For the industry to evolve, it has to move beyond the debate of domain versus data science expertise. Porway's data scientists team up with departments in outside organizations, for example, in a recent project involving DC Action for Children. The non-profit focuses on understanding childhood well-being and sought DataKind\u2019s help to build an interactive visualization that would allow it and policy advocates to navigate government indicators in one coherent fashion. Data designers from the Gates Foundation and the Washington Post rallied to build an interactive map that was eventually unveiled to the mayor of Washington, D.C. and will now be used for public policy change.</p><p> \u201cDC Action for Children had a cause, childhood well-being, that they wanted to improve with data,\" says Porway. \"The data scientists didn\u2019t come in with arrogance but worked with the group as a team.  Now it\u2019s a piece of software that accelerates how the group achieves their mission of helping kids.\u201d</p><p> From Siloes to Singapore</p><p> Image via iStockphoto, scanrail</p><p> \u201cBig data is just a marketing term. We\u2019ve had problems understanding how to organize large pools of information for the past 20 years,\u201d says Stewart Townsend, business development director EMEA at Zendesk. \u201cBut now organizations really need to get smart about removing siloes from their data to extract the best overall value for their work.\u201d</p><p> As an example of the power of these merged data sets, he cites the work of Palantir, a Virginia-based company with a holistic approach that helped the DEA track down a Mexican drug cartel member who shot a U.S. drug enforcement officer.  \u201cIf you\u2019re not working to bring your data sets together, you\u2019re jeopardizing your future,\u201d says Towsend.  \u201cIt\u2019s a direct business angle.\u201d</p><p> Along with his role at Zendesk, Townsend is one of the founders of Big Data Week, a global event taking place April 2013. It launched last year in over 20 cities with over 2,000 attendees. Townsend and fellow founder Carlos Somohano created the organization to bring together communities focused on big data. Somohano is also the founder of Data Science London, which created the Data Science Academy to further spread education around these issues. Data Science London launched the first ever Global Data Science Hacktahon in partnership with Big Data Week and Kaggle. The hackathon challenged 212 data scientists in 10 cities around the world to create an early warning system for air quality control.</p><p> Both Townsend and Somohano feel the industry needs to address the issue of anonymizing data.  \u201cThere\u2019s a group in the UK focused on using non-personally identifiable data as a standard,\u201d notes Somohano, \u201cbut the challenge with that approach is the potentially significantly less meaningful insights you can extract that can still lend value.\u201d</p><p> Added to this ethical challenge are the complexities of dealing with natural language processing techniques and how big data is perceived in multiple markets.  To help forge new paths along these lines, Big Data Week is going east this year, to locations like China and Korea.  \u201cWe want to understand the challenges in those countries and cultures around data,\u201d explains Townsend.</p><p> Data by Design</p><p> Design-driven data, however, is flourishing in the east, as exemplified by cities like Singapore.  \u201cSingapore is our model of a city where a living environment that is constructed to optimize beauty and efficiency is nonetheless built entirely on analytics and statistics,\u201d says Roger Wood, founder of The (ART + DATA) Institute, which examines how data insights are used to make better products and experiences, which in turn, are designed to collect more useful data.</p><p> While planning for Singapore was pre-meditated, it was based on people\u2019s actual experiences in city settings. Green spaces \"appear\" in the city where they feel most natural, and street layouts are designed via analytics, versus haphazard cow paths of old.</p><p> One encounters a similar synthesis of design and data in properties like the New York Times and most modern websites.  Articles appear to readers based on a statistical analysis of a piece generating interest, versus the whim of an editor.</p><p>This design element marks another critical component needed for big data\u2019s evolution: understanding how the value of a user can be best served in a seamless, if not invisible, fashion.  Wood notes, \u201cIn the future, you won\u2019t understand that products are collecting data about you -- it will be invisible.\u201d  He cites Zipcar as a company to watch -- it has recently improved mobile capabilities for users.  He envisions a scenario where a future Zipcar app will only recommend nearby cars that match your preferences, rather than simply a list of vehicles in your zip code.</p><p> \u201cDepending on where you are and when you ask the question, the app will be intelligent enough to know what you want,\u201d says Wood. For instance, the app won't recommend a smaller car if it\u2019s a Saturday and you enjoy mountain biking.</p><p> SEE ALSO: How Big Data Can Make Us Happier and Healthier</p><p> Wood also feels these types of experiences could expand into people\u2019s social lives; a matchmaking scenario would combine your preference data with your immediate context to optimize an otherwise traditional blind date. As Wood notes, \u201cData doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p> \u201cBy creating a context around lifestyle design, we\u2019re enabling a world where anybody can find data relevant to them,\u201d says Martin Blinder, founder of Tictrac, a platform that aggregates apps to help create and manage user projects to better manage their day to day lives.  In the example of Singapore, the power of the platform comes from helping users analyze the behavior they\u2019re already focusing on and providing a context for moving forward.</p><p> What\u2019s unique about Tictrac, however, is it doesn\u2019t want to function as a quantified self app, but rather, essentially become the iTunes marketplace for all \"life project\" apps. The company has already brokered deals with multiple partners to help achieve this goal, and its platform also syncs with over 40 APIs.  This means users don\u2019t need to grant permissions to dozens of apps to create a life project on the platform -- a valuable time saving element.</p><p> Functioning as a data dashboard, Tictrac will eventually begin to learn a user\u2019s behavior to personalize information. So if you\u2019re focusing on improving your diet, the system would tell you to eat more protein.</p><p> Blinder believes this type of evolved adaptation will help people design their lives in the future. He says, \u201cI feel we\u2019re reaching a point in history where we can really empower ourselves based on an understanding of our own data.\u201d</p><p> The Priority of Privacy</p><p> Image via iStockphoto, Mari</p><p> Edd Dumbill is a principal analyst for O\u2019Reilly Radar, and program chair for the O\u2019Reilly Strata Conference.  The conference, launched in February 2011, is thought to have originated the term \"data scientist.\"</p><p> Dumbill notes a number of trends for 2013, but the subject of privacy is an especially hot button issue that needs to be addressed sooner than later. \u201cWhen the car was invented, a lot of people died until the seat belt was invented,\" he says. \u201cThe industry has to arrive at a level of self-regulation or it will get regulated by people who don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p> But unlike most discussions around big data privacy hinged on philosophical debate, Dumbill provides a welcome pragmatic insight to the mix.  \u201cWe simply don\u2019t currently have the technological infrastructure to manage privacy.\u201d</p><p> Once you have a user\u2019s data, you not only have to manage it but store it and create systems to identify who has touched it.  It\u2019s the technological reasons surrounding privacy for most organizations that keep them from fully leveraging big data.  This is why vertically integrated data solutions will provide the ability for people to make better decisions. This integration will help us move beyond a granular scrutiny of the technology behind big data and focus on the massive insights it can bring when managed by a team of connected experts.</p><p> In regards to the future, Dumbill notes, \u201cI would prefer not to look at the phenomenon that\u2019s feeding the IT trend of big data and focus on our increasingly programmable world.\u201d</p><p> The Rise of the Personal Data Economy</p><p> Another danger with big data is focusing on the granularity of specific implementations before helping users understand an overall paradigm for how advanced analysis will look in the enterprise.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s more of an economic discussion than a technology discussion,\u201d says Brandon Barnett, director of business innovation at Intel Corporation.  Barnett works in conjunction with Ken Anderson, senior researcher at Intel Labs, and Eric Berlow, founder of Vibrant Data labs, on We The Data, an initiative designed to utilize complexity science to create the portrait of a future data economy that doesn\u2019t currently exist.  As their site explains, \u201cHow do we balance our anxiety around data with its incredible potential? We the Data can create new forms of social cooperation and exchange, or give us more of the same corporate obsession with better targeted advertising.\u201d</p><p> Note this language isn\u2019t about demonizing marketers -- it\u2019s about shifting the conversation. We can't think of the ROI of innovation in quarterly terms, but rather, determine how the full breadth of big data can be understood within our current business environment.</p><p> Barnett notes, \u201cThe data economy is one example where our research suggests the world is moving, and yet traditional tools of market analysis fall short in identifying the products, services and business models that companies can pursue to begin to add value to the consumer.\u201d This is why We The Data utilizes complexity science applied to business ecosystems to generate information about an economy that could be created.  The goal of the work is to catalyze the imaginations of business leaders to envision a future where a unifying infrastructure that makes sense in the big data world doesn\u2019t yet exist, but could.</p><p> We the Data also addresses the fundamental issue of privacy by creating awareness around treating personal data as a resource.  Today we primarily utilize our data as a transactional tool leveraged in the identification and purchasing of products.  This limited landscape will soon evolve, Berlow notes: \u201cThe anxiety towards privacy is real, but what is much more difficult to communicate are the potential opportunities to improve the lives of everyday people \u2013 not just if we can address the issues of privacy and trust but because we address them.\u201d</p><p> As examples of these opportunities, he cites the categories of health, open government data for citizens and micro-entrepreneurship. \u201cImagine what we might learn if more people shared their health data because they could easily control other aspects of their anonymity?  Imagine if small entrepreneurs had easy-to-interpret access to market research data that is now only available to large corporations?\u201d</p><p> We the Data provides an important model to follow as the personal data economy becomes codified over the next five to 10 years. As people begin to understand the power their data holds beyond commercial transaction, openness and value-creation can help shape the business landscape of the future. Our new focus will be on the word \u201cshare\u201d versus \u201cholder.\u201d</p><p> The Global Human Being</p><p> Through the Internet, we are developing a species-level nervous system, capable of transmitting thoughts, ideas and information. The resulting meta-organism -- this \u2018global\u2019 human being -- is also beginning to exhibit physiological reactions and even \u2018higher\u2019 human traits like empathy and compassion.</p><p> The author of this excerpt is Jonathan Harris, the artist, and co-creator of We Feel Fine. He is also quoted in The Human Face of Big Data, a multimedia book/ app experience created by Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt. In the book, lush visualizations and photos document dozens of existing scenarios for readers to fully understand the context and breadth of the existing big data era.</p><p> It\u2019s not always pretty, though. \u201cI\u2019m worried that the people spending the most time thinking about big data are corporations and governments,\" notes Smolan. \"Our legislators are not being informed about where this tech stands right now and where it\u2019s heading.\u201d</p><p> In the book, stats like \"Facebook has 955 million monthly active accounts using seventy languages\" and \"one in three children born in the United States already has an online presence\" paint a portrait of how pervasive data has become in our lives.  Then you discover the massive positive discoveries from companies like Proteus Digital Health, which have created ingestible event markers (EMIs) with hardware that provides ongoing real-time data from within a patient\u2019s body.</p><p> The overarching effect of big data is we\u2019ll soon be able to perform real-time polling of the human race, or literally listen to the heartbeat of the planet. But there\u2019s no ethical framework guiding this massive expanse of data infrastructure.</p><p> \u201cI\u2019m not worried about privacy -- I\u2019m worried about proclivity,\u201d Smolan says. \u201cThere is no set of laws that says, \u2018This is how you should be judged.\u2019 Algorithms are writing algorithms and we\u2019re losing the connection of what guides the technology that\u2019s beginning to govern our lives.\u201d</p><p> The Devil\u2019s Had His Due</p><p> It\u2019s wise to see software not only as a product or service, but also as the staging ground for humanity\u2019s future, affording us the time and space to get our ethics right before the stakes are raised. Big data is powerful, but ethically neutral -- we have to choose how to use it.</p><p> Above and in his \"Data Driven\" essay, Jonathan Harris explains that, while big data is ethically neutral, it can be used like any tool: for good or evil.  If two people look at a stick, one sees a lever and the other sees a weapon.  But without an ethical framework to guide the context of what people are looking at in the first place, even the question \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense.</p><p> So in the end, big data isn\u2019t the devil.  We just need to focus on issues like collaboration, context and design to guide our analysis, or give way to disillusionment and dystopia.</p><p> In other words, the devil is in the details.  So let\u2019s work them out before he does.</p><p> Homepage image via iStockphoto, Henrik5000</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSHNWS-1701665xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MSHNWS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57V7-HGF1-F0NV-F2M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Mashable, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In a 15-second burst, the camera would have generated a \"print\" of Wang's face, then sent this image to the Public Security Bureau for matching against China's national database.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If identified, via facial recognition software, our would-be jaywalker could expect a 20 yuan ($5) fine, a phone call from the police and possibly a public shaming, by displaying his photograph on a nearby bus stop.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that's not the worst of it.</p><p>This simple act of attempting to cross the road while the light was still red could count against Wang for years to come if China's current plans for a national \"social credit ratings system\" are realised by 2020.</p><p>Using a combination of data from the local police, banks, government agencies and the big internet companies, China plans to give each of its citizens a personal credit score.</p><p>This will then potentially determine at what price they can borrow money, if they can buy train tickets during busy holiday periods, work for the public service and even send their children to private schools.</p><p>It's all part of a grand plan to \"civilise\" this country of 1.4 billion people and has been likened to \"Big Brother meets big data\".</p><p>But more than this it signals a desire by the Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping, to play a larger role in people's lives, reversing a three-decade-long trend of gradually allowing the population more personal freedoms. This extends to people's interaction on social media, what they watch and read, as well as where and how they worship. It is also a move to impose a general moral code and centralised set of values on the population.</p><p>Technology and most particularly, facial recognition software, is a key plank in this push by the party, which will gather in Beijing from Wednesday for its twice-a-decade leadership conclave. The week-long National Party Congress will anoint Xi as the country's leader for another five years and thus the march of technology and the state further into people's lives is set to continue.</p><p>Jaywalker Wang, who spoke to AFR Weekend shortly after being admonished by the policeman and having his image captured, said he was unaware of the Shanghai government's trial program to use facial recognition software to crack down on petty misdemeanours - there are no nearby signs publicising the trial although it has been reported in the local press.</p><p>\"It's probably a step too far,\" says Wang, smiling nervously. \"That's our private information.\"</p><p>But at the same time as Wang was repeatedly apologising for his mistake, he was also expressing support for the government's broader push towards greater enforcement of the law and the idea of keeping a score card on citizens.</p><p>\"If someone did it [jaywalking] 10 times then, yes, this should count against them,\" says Wang, who has a master's degree and recently moved to Shanghai in search of work. \"I'm not against it [the social credit system] as we need a society where people follow the rules. Not just traffic rules but rules more generally, like people keeping their word or obeying contracts.\"</p><p>John Fitzgerald, a long-time China scholar from Melbourne's Swinburne University of Technology, says the rollout of new technology, which has allowed the party to push deeper into people's lives, is exploiting a \"tangible level of distrust\" that runs through Chinese society. But unlike societies where the rule of law and civil society provide a check on the worst authoritarian tendencies of those in power, there are no such counterbalances in China.</p><p>\"Those in positions of authority can do as they please. There is no restraint on the exercise of power in China, no law above the toughest guy on the block, usually the local Communist Party head,\" says Fitzgerald in an interview.</p><p>The end game for the party is greater control and technological advances have only increased this ability to monitor and surveil.</p><p>Not even churches are off limits. Earlier this year local authorities in Wenzhou, a city south of Shanghai known as \"Little Jerusalem\", ordered that all churches install CCTV cameras. This allows direct monitoring of those in attendance and possibly what is said during services.</p><p>The reasons given were familiar; \"anti-terrorism and security purposes\" which has prompted an angry reaction from some church leaders.</p><p>\"This is shameful and immoral,\" said one priest contacted by AFR Weekend.</p><p>\"Church is a place for people to worship. It is the place we pray and kneel down before God. We can't have cameras there.\"</p><p>The priest's surprisingly forthright response, albeit off the record, suggests congregations across China may not be as accepting of the cameras as others. More importantly, so far the measures don't appear to be deterring worshippers.</p><p>\"In spite of the increased surveillance, people are still joining churches. I don't see signs of slowing growth in Christianity across China,\" says Yang Fenggang, who heads up the centre of religion and Chinese society at Indiana's Purdue University.</p><p>According to Yang's estimates, since 1980 the number of Christians in China has been growing by an average of 10 per cent a year. If that growth were to continue up to 2030, there would be 250 million Christians in China, more than two-and-a-half times the number of Communist Party members, and the most of any country in the world.</p><p>Such growth in numbers has attracted the attention of authorities and made religion, particularly Christianity, an ideological threat to the party.</p><p>Yang says Beijing has long struggled between adopting a policy of \"enlightened atheism\", where it tries to educate people out of religion and \"militant atheism\", where it uses political measures to suppress and control religious activities.</p><p>\"In recent years, we have seen a return of militant atheism,\" he says.</p><p>In addition to tighter monitoring of Christians, through CCTV cameras, the State Council approved new rules to regulate religion in September. While the rules don't specifically mention so called \"house churches\", where services are often held in people's homes or offices, these seem to be the main target.</p><p>These congregations, which are separate from the officially recognised churches overseen by the party, have been allowed to proliferate over the past decade. Most local governments, particularly in bigger cities, ignored the \"house churches\" as long as congregations didn't grow too big. But the party's tolerance appears to have run out.</p><p>The new laws stipulate that organisers of unapproved religious activities face fines of up to 300,000 yuan ($58,000), while anybody found to be providing a venue for such activities would be fined up to 200,000 yuan.</p><p>\"Landlords renting out places for house churches could be severely punished,\" says Yang. \"One of the goals of the new regulations is clearly targeting house churches. They don't mention them but they are the big elephant in the room.\"</p><p>This crackdown on religion, which began with the tearing down of crosses in Zhejiang Province outside Shanghai in 2014, takes the party back to its roots of being deeply hostile towards Christianity, largely because it is associated with Western imperialism.</p><p>But when it comes to China's ethnic Muslim minority, the Uighurs, who mostly live in the far western province of Xinjiang, this hostility and suspicion is taken to a whole new level. And once again, technology is the party's surveillance weapon of choice.</p><p>Citing the need for enhanced anti-terrorism measures in the midst of a vast security crackdown across Xinjiang, local authorities have forced ethnic Uighurs to install a surveillance app on their smartphones that can automatically detect and delete religious videos, images and documents. The app also keeps a record of all communications on blogs and domestic social media platforms, such as WeChat, while those with overseas communication apps, like Whatsapp, have had their phone services cut.</p><p>This crackdown follows bloody demonstrations in 2009, as Uighurs protested years of discrimination, a series of terrorist attacks in recent years and reports that some radical Uighurs had joined Islamic State.</p><p>As an atheist organisation, the Communist Party banned the practice of any faith during the Cultural Revolution, but in the following decades Beijing relaxed its controls, allowing Protestantism to become the fastest growing of the country's five-recognised religions, which also include Buddhism, Daoism, Islam and Catholicism.</p><p>Such tolerance, rather than acceptance of religion, was part of a larger, unspoken pact made between the party and its subjects after the massacre of pro-democracy protesters around Tiananmen Square in June 1989.</p><p>In exchange for forfeiting their political rights, the party signalled greater personal freedoms would be tolerated. For two decades under the leadership of Jiang Zemin, and then Hu Jintao, this was as true for religion as it was for other areas of society.</p><p>But this trend has been abruptly reversed by Xi who, in the place of religion, is hoping to cultivate \"socialist family values\".</p><p>\"Love the party, the motherland, the people and the Chinese nation,\" in that order, he has said.</p><p>In placing a greater emphasis on \"ideological and political thought\", Xi has also sought to integrate \"morals and virtue\" into what the party views as the rule of law.</p><p>According to the state-run China Daily, Xi called for using \"tools in the rule of law to address prominent moral issues, and making greater legislative efforts to specify penalties for breaches of virtue\".</p><p>One way this could be implemented is through the Social Credit System, which from the party's perspective aims to address the collapse of public confidence in institutions and companies, after a series of scandals around corrupt officials, tainted food, fake medicine and fraudulent investment products. Authorities also see it as a vehicle to better gauge the public mood through the use of big data collected from the internet and its latest tool of choice, facial recognition software.</p><p>A scan of the state-owned press shows that Wang's jaywalking experience in Shanghai is far from an isolated example. It is being replicated in at least half-a-dozen cities across the country, where local authorities are trialling facial recognition software to solve all manner of law enforcement problems and social ills.</p><p>Privacy and the implications for how the data might be used appear secondary and there is seemingly no problem that can't be solved using the technology.</p><p>\"In China, the rapid development of facial recognition technology has led to its use in a number of innovative ways,\" the official Xinhua news agency said in an article on September 8.</p><p>One such \"innovation\" has occurred at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. At the 15th-century World Heritage site, which is one of the capital's major tourist attractions, authorities were said to have been battling toilet paper thieves.</p><p>To combat the theft, authorities installed facial recognition software outside the toilets. Those wanting toilet paper while using the facilities must submit to having their face scanned and are then issued with a length of paper between 60cm and 70cm.</p><p>The supposedly \"innovative\" part of the solution is that the facial recognition software will not issue the same person another length of toilet paper for a further nine minutes.</p><p>\"It's a machine for toilet paper ... how funny,\" said one local tourist when AFR Weekend visited to confirm this most peculiar of stories was actually true.</p><p>The example may appear trivial, yet it shows how quickly the technology has been deployed, even by the most junior of officials, without the slightest pushback or questioning of its necessity.</p><p>And while curbing toilet paper theft may have its merits, the technology has quickly spread to other institutions, including the Beijing Normal University. It has installed 44 facial scanners across the campus's 19 dormitory buildings, covering 18,000 students, according to Xinhua, which said all newly enrolled students were required to submit to a facial scan.</p><p>Relieving the burden on security guards and stopping unauthorised hawkers and visitors entering the dorms was the technology's stated purpose.</p><p>\"Outsiders won't be able to follow our students into the dorms,\" said Li Jinjun, the dormitory services director at the university.</p><p>But Li was also very upfront about the cameras serving another purpose. \"We can now find out who does not return to the dorm or returns late,\" he said. \"The machines will help us better monitor the students' whereabouts.\"</p><p>For Fitzgerald, the proliferation of facial recognition technology in China shows the unchecked power of the party and how efforts to curb this power have faltered under Xi.</p><p>\"I remember sitting in meetings in Beijing around 2011 with very conservative scholars, who would support the party on everything, yet they recognised there needed to be external restraints on the party's power,\" says Fitzgerald, who spent five years in China as head of the Ford Foundation.</p><p>\"That conservative position is no longer articulated under Xi, at a time when new technologies for asserting control have vastly proliferated.\"</p><p>And unlike in Australia, Britain and the United States, where debate is raging over how authorities can capture and use the data, in China there has barely even been an acknowledgment of the issue.</p><p>Just last week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was forced to justify the need for an enhanced national facial recognition database to strengthen counter-terrorism measures, as privacy experts warned of possible abuse and said the new measures may even contravene international laws.</p><p>In China, where there is already a national facial recognition database, there are no such checks or constraints on how the data can be used, as shown in the experience of Beijing Normal University. Safety was the stated objective but officials quickly worked out they could monitor which students returned late or not at all and how often they did this.</p><p>Such moves in China are part of a broader effort by Beijing to build a legal framework to allow the party to exert full control over all data and networks.</p><p>\"China is pushing ahead with its own internet model, where the space for anonymity online is rapidly eroding, and data collected from a single digital identity is feeding into a vast government scoring system [social credit score] that reaches into all aspects of life,\" said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, and Paul Triolo from Eurasia Group in a recently released report.</p><p>Their report focuses on Beijing's effort to put an end to online anonymity, via four new, overlapping internet laws introduced in August and September. The main thrust of the laws is that users must register under their real name and submit mobile phone numbers to participate in chat groups, message boards and online forums.</p><p>Conveners of these groups or those who created them are then responsible for ensuring any content posted does not violate China's censorship laws, most particularly around the \"spreading of rumours\" or other information deemed harmful to the party or state.</p><p>The effect has been immediate. Chat groups on WeChat, which claims 963 million users, have either been disbanded or warned by their conveners about posting sensitive content on subjects such as Hong Kong or Taiwan. The state media also reported that 40 people were disciplined last month for circulating online petitions and one man, who complained in a chat group about police raids, was jailed.</p><p>At the same time, the new laws compel companies operating these platforms to hand over data showing an individual's online activity, which could then be incorporated into a social credit score. It is from this monitoring that authorities have suggested a user spending many hours playing video games would have social credit points deducted, as it would demonstrate idleness, while someone buying nappies would receive a bump to their score as this showed responsibility.</p><p>Such an Orwellian scoring system may not eventuate as the big tech companies resist handing over the required volumes of data, but it has been dangled as a possibility and shows the party's redoubled efforts to tame the internet.</p><p>\"The measures are a fresh attempt, with the guidance of President Xi's speeches, to yet again mobilise the bureaucracy to rein in the internet in China and to ensure that the Communist Party can monitor and control technological developments that allow individuals and groups to communicate outside established media channels,\" says the CSIS's Sacks.</p><p>\"Xi has cast the internet as the main battlefield in the domain of ideological struggles. Hence the need to ensure the 'orderly' development of major platforms such as WeChat.\"</p><p>According to Sacks, the overriding concern of Beijing since the Arab Spring protests in 2011, is that online chatter can quickly morph into action on the streets. And therefore by controlling the internet, the party feels it can better control society, helped by tools such as the Social Credit Score.</p><p>\"If a sensible version of the social credit system operated within a legal framework that was rigorous and predictable, then it might have a beneficial effect,\" says Fitzgerald. \"But the systems that are in place for managing and controlling the information which is gathered are not up to the task. It [the social credit system] is intrusive enough in the first place but the potential for abuse by private players or party officials who want to get their own way is enormous.\"</p><p>Such potential for abuse of the planned social credit system and the general intrusion of cameras into people's lives has generated only limited public pushback, except from China's Christians. According to Yang from Purdue University, Christians are preparing to challenge efforts by the party to suppress and control their activities.</p><p>\"Some congregations are planning to break down into small groups so it is harder to be hunted down. But the larger house church congregations may resist the suppression,\" he says. \"It will be interesting how much the government will mobilise resources to deal with this. In all the major cities there are multiple large congregations.\"</p><p>That is a battle set to play out early next year when the new religious laws come into effect, but for Fitzgerald it is part of a wider change in the social compact between the party and its subjects.</p><p>No longer, he argues, are people being asked to abrogate their political rights in exchange for a promise of rising living standards and for the party to gradually withdraw from their lives.</p><p>\"Nobody talks about the wealth contract any more; that's because it was supplanted around the time of the global financial crisis [2008/2009] with one around domestic and international security,\" Fitzgerald says.</p><p>\"The party basically said 'the world is a nasty place and we will offer you protection from that'.\"</p><p>Fitzgerald says this shift, which has been missed by many journalists and commentators, helps explain the party's newfound zeal in cracking down on everything from religion to the internet and jaywalkers, believing it is justified in doing whatever is necessary to fulfil its newfound \"security\" compact.</p><p>\"The fact that the party can do what it wants at any time is the ultimate terrifying and arbitrary fact of life in China.\" W</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6x3blawlm1fg0do0g4p</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PPK-04R1-F0J6-J1J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

In a 15-second burst, the camera would have generated a \"print\" of Wang's face, then sent this image to the Public Security Bureau for matching against China's national database.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If identified, via facial recognition software, our would-be jaywalker could expect a 20 yuan ($5) fine, a phone call from the police and possibly a public shaming, by displaying his photograph on a nearby bus stop.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that's not the worst of it.</p><p>This simple act of attempting to cross the road while the light was still red could count against Wang for years to come if China's current plans for a national \"social credit ratings system\" are realised by 2020.</p><p>Using a combination of data from the local police, banks, government agencies and the big internet companies, China plans to give each of its citizens a personal credit score.</p><p>This will then potentially determine at what price they can borrow money, if they can buy train tickets during busy holiday periods, work for the public service and even send their children to private schools.</p><p>It's all part of a grand plan to \"civilise\" this country of 1.4 billion people and has been likened to \"Big Brother meets big data\".</p><p>But more than this it signals a desire by the Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping, to play a larger role in people's lives, reversing a three-decade-long trend of gradually allowing the population more personal freedoms. This extends to people's interaction on social media, what they watch and read, as well as where and how they worship. It is also a move to impose a general moral code and centralised set of values on the population.</p><p>Technology and most particularly, facial recognition software, is a key plank in this push by the party, which will gather in Beijing from Wednesday for its twice-a-decade leadership conclave. The week-long National Party Congress will anoint Xi as the country's leader for another five years and thus the march of technology and the state further into people's lives is set to continue.</p><p>Jaywalker Wang, who spoke to AFR Weekend shortly after being admonished by the policeman and having his image captured, said he was unaware of the Shanghai government's trial program to use facial recognition software to crack down on petty misdemeanours - there are no nearby signs publicising the trial although it has been reported in the local press.</p><p>\"It's probably a step too far,\" says Wang, smiling nervously. \"That's our private information.\"</p><p>But at the same time as Wang was repeatedly apologising for his mistake, he was also expressing support for the government's broader push towards greater enforcement of the law and the idea of keeping a score card on citizens.</p><p>\"If someone did it [jaywalking] 10 times then, yes, this should count against them,\" says Wang, who has a master's degree and recently moved to Shanghai in search of work. \"I'm not against it [the social credit system] as we need a society where people follow the rules. Not just traffic rules but rules more generally, like people keeping their word or obeying contracts.\"</p><p>John Fitzgerald, a long-time China scholar from Melbourne's Swinburne University of Technology, says the rollout of new technology, which has allowed the party to push deeper into people's lives, is exploiting a \"tangible level of distrust\" that runs through Chinese society. But unlike societies where the rule of law and civil society provide a check on the worst authoritarian tendencies of those in power, there are no such counterbalances in China.</p><p>\"Those in positions of authority can do as they please. There is no restraint on the exercise of power in China, no law above the toughest guy on the block, usually the local Communist Party head,\" says Fitzgerald in an interview.</p><p>The end game for the party is greater control and technological advances have only increased this ability to monitor and surveil.</p><p>Not even churches are off limits. Earlier this year local authorities in Wenzhou, a city south of Shanghai known as \"Little Jerusalem\", ordered that all churches install CCTV cameras. This allows direct monitoring of those in attendance and possibly what is said during services.</p><p>The reasons given were familiar; \"anti-terrorism and security purposes\" which has prompted an angry reaction from some church leaders.</p><p>\"This is shameful and immoral,\" said one priest contacted by AFR Weekend.</p><p>\"Church is a place for people to worship. It is the place we pray and kneel down before God. We can't have cameras there.\"</p><p>The priest's surprisingly forthright response, albeit off the record, suggests congregations across China may not be as accepting of the cameras as others. More importantly, so far the measures don't appear to be deterring worshippers.</p><p>\"In spite of the increased surveillance, people are still joining churches. I don't see signs of slowing growth in Christianity across China,\" says Yang Fenggang, who heads up the centre of religion and Chinese society at Indiana's Purdue University.</p><p>According to Yang's estimates, since 1980 the number of Christians in China has been growing by an average of 10 per cent a year. If that growth were to continue up to 2030, there would be 250 million Christians in China, more than two-and-a-half times the number of Communist Party members, and the most of any country in the world.</p><p>Such growth in numbers has attracted the attention of authorities and made religion, particularly Christianity, an ideological threat to the party.</p><p>Yang says Beijing has long struggled between adopting a policy of \"enlightened atheism\", where it tries to educate people out of religion and \"militant atheism\", where it uses political measures to suppress and control religious activities.</p><p>\"In recent years, we have seen a return of militant atheism,\" he says.</p><p>In addition to tighter monitoring of Christians, through CCTV cameras, the State Council approved new rules to regulate religion in September. While the rules don't specifically mention so called \"house churches\", where services are often held in people's homes or offices, these seem to be the main target.</p><p>These congregations, which are separate from the officially recognised churches overseen by the party, have been allowed to proliferate over the past decade. Most local governments, particularly in bigger cities, ignored the \"house churches\" as long as congregations didn't grow too big. But the party's tolerance appears to have run out.</p><p>The new laws stipulate that organisers of unapproved religious activities face fines of up to 300,000 yuan ($58,000), while anybody found to be providing a venue for such activities would be fined up to 200,000 yuan.</p><p>\"Landlords renting out places for house churches could be severely punished,\" says Yang. \"One of the goals of the new regulations is clearly targeting house churches. They don't mention them but they are the big elephant in the room.\"</p><p>This crackdown on religion, which began with the tearing down of crosses in Zhejiang Province outside Shanghai in 2014, takes the party back to its roots of being deeply hostile towards Christianity, largely because it is associated with Western imperialism.</p><p>But when it comes to China's ethnic Muslim minority, the Uighurs, who mostly live in the far western province of Xinjiang, this hostility and suspicion is taken to a whole new level. And once again, technology is the party's surveillance weapon of choice.</p><p>Citing the need for enhanced anti-terrorism measures in the midst of a vast security crackdown across Xinjiang, local authorities have forced ethnic Uighurs to install a surveillance app on their smartphones that can automatically detect and delete religious videos, images and documents. The app also keeps a record of all communications on blogs and domestic social media platforms, such as WeChat, while those with overseas communication apps, like Whatsapp, have had their phone services cut.</p><p>This crackdown follows bloody demonstrations in 2009, as Uighurs protested years of discrimination, a series of terrorist attacks in recent years and reports that some radical Uighurs had joined Islamic State.</p><p>As an atheist organisation, the Communist Party banned the practice of any faith during the Cultural Revolution, but in the following decades Beijing relaxed its controls, allowing Protestantism to become the fastest growing of the country's five-recognised religions, which also include Buddhism, Daoism, Islam and Catholicism.</p><p>Such tolerance, rather than acceptance of religion, was part of a larger, unspoken pact made between the party and its subjects after the massacre of pro-democracy protesters around Tiananmen Square in June 1989.</p><p>In exchange for forfeiting their political rights, the party signalled greater personal freedoms would be tolerated. For two decades under the leadership of Jiang Zemin, and then Hu Jintao, this was as true for religion as it was for other areas of society.</p><p>But this trend has been abruptly reversed by Xi who, in the place of religion, is hoping to cultivate \"socialist family values\".</p><p>\"Love the party, the motherland, the people and the Chinese nation,\" in that order, he has said.</p><p>In placing a greater emphasis on \"ideological and political thought\", Xi has also sought to integrate \"morals and virtue\" into what the party views as the rule of law.</p><p>According to the state-run China Daily, Xi called for using \"tools in the rule of law to address prominent moral issues, and making greater legislative efforts to specify penalties for breaches of virtue\".</p><p>One way this could be implemented is through the Social Credit System, which from the party's perspective aims to address the collapse of public confidence in institutions and companies, after a series of scandals around corrupt officials, tainted food, fake medicine and fraudulent investment products. Authorities also see it as a vehicle to better gauge the public mood through the use of big data collected from the internet and its latest tool of choice, facial recognition software.</p><p>A scan of the state-owned press shows that Wang's jaywalking experience in Shanghai is far from an isolated example. It is being replicated in at least half-a-dozen cities across the country, where local authorities are trialling facial recognition software to solve all manner of law enforcement problems and social ills.</p><p>Privacy and the implications for how the data might be used appear secondary and there is seemingly no problem that can't be solved using the technology.</p><p>\"In China, the rapid development of facial recognition technology has led to its use in a number of innovative ways,\" the official Xinhua news agency said in an article on September 8.</p><p>One such \"innovation\" has occurred at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. At the 15th-century World Heritage site, which is one of the capital's major tourist attractions, authorities were said to have been battling toilet paper thieves.</p><p>To combat the theft, authorities installed facial recognition software outside the toilets. Those wanting toilet paper while using the facilities must submit to having their face scanned and are then issued with a length of paper between 60cm and 70cm.</p><p>The supposedly \"innovative\" part of the solution is that the facial recognition software will not issue the same person another length of toilet paper for a further nine minutes.</p><p>\"It's a machine for toilet paper ... how funny,\" said one local tourist when AFR Weekend visited to confirm this most peculiar of stories was actually true.</p><p>The example may appear trivial, yet it shows how quickly the technology has been deployed, even by the most junior of officials, without the slightest pushback or questioning of its necessity.</p><p>And while curbing toilet paper theft may have its merits, the technology has quickly spread to other institutions, including the Beijing Normal University. It has installed 44 facial scanners across the campus's 19 dormitory buildings, covering 18,000 students, according to Xinhua, which said all newly enrolled students were required to submit to a facial scan.</p><p>Relieving the burden on security guards and stopping unauthorised hawkers and visitors entering the dorms was the technology's stated purpose.</p><p>\"Outsiders won't be able to follow our students into the dorms,\" said Li Jinjun, the dormitory services director at the university.</p><p>But Li was also very upfront about the cameras serving another purpose. \"We can now find out who does not return to the dorm or returns late,\" he said. \"The machines will help us better monitor the students' whereabouts.\"</p><p>For Fitzgerald, the proliferation of facial recognition technology in China shows the unchecked power of the party and how efforts to curb this power have faltered under Xi.</p><p>\"I remember sitting in meetings in Beijing around 2011 with very conservative scholars, who would support the party on everything, yet they recognised there needed to be external restraints on the party's power,\" says Fitzgerald, who spent five years in China as head of the Ford Foundation.</p><p>\"That conservative position is no longer articulated under Xi, at a time when new technologies for asserting control have vastly proliferated.\"</p><p>And unlike in Australia, Britain and the United States, where debate is raging over how authorities can capture and use the data, in China there has barely even been an acknowledgment of the issue.</p><p>Just last week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was forced to justify the need for an enhanced national facial recognition database to strengthen counter-terrorism measures, as privacy experts warned of possible abuse and said the new measures may even contravene international laws.</p><p>In China, where there is already a national facial recognition database, there are no such checks or constraints on how the data can be used, as shown in the experience of Beijing Normal University. Safety was the stated objective but officials quickly worked out they could monitor which students returned late or not at all and how often they did this.</p><p>Such moves in China are part of a broader effort by Beijing to build a legal framework to allow the party to exert full control over all data and networks.</p><p>\"China is pushing ahead with its own internet model, where the space for anonymity online is rapidly eroding, and data collected from a single digital identity is feeding into a vast government scoring system [social credit score] that reaches into all aspects of life,\" said Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, and Paul Triolo from Eurasia Group in a recently released report.</p><p>Their report focuses on Beijing's effort to put an end to online anonymity, via four new, overlapping internet laws introduced in August and September. The main thrust of the laws is that users must register under their real name and submit mobile phone numbers to participate in chat groups, message boards and online forums.</p><p>Conveners of these groups or those who created them are then responsible for ensuring any content posted does not violate China's censorship laws, most particularly around the \"spreading of rumours\" or other information deemed harmful to the party or state.</p><p>The effect has been immediate. Chat groups on WeChat, which claims 963 million users, have either been disbanded or warned by their conveners about posting sensitive content on subjects such as Hong Kong or Taiwan. The state media also reported that 40 people were disciplined last month for circulating online petitions and one man, who complained in a chat group about police raids, was jailed.</p><p>At the same time, the new laws compel companies operating these platforms to hand over data showing an individual's online activity, which could then be incorporated into a social credit score. It is from this monitoring that authorities have suggested a user spending many hours playing video games would have social credit points deducted, as it would demonstrate idleness, while someone buying nappies would receive a bump to their score as this showed responsibility.</p><p>Such an Orwellian scoring system may not eventuate as the big tech companies resist handing over the required volumes of data, but it has been dangled as a possibility and shows the party's redoubled efforts to tame the internet.</p><p>\"The measures are a fresh attempt, with the guidance of President Xi's speeches, to yet again mobilise the bureaucracy to rein in the internet in China and to ensure that the Communist Party can monitor and control technological developments that allow individuals and groups to communicate outside established media channels,\" says the CSIS's Sacks.</p><p>\"Xi has cast the internet as the main battlefield in the domain of ideological struggles. Hence the need to ensure the 'orderly' development of major platforms such as WeChat.\"</p><p>According to Sacks, the overriding concern of Beijing since the Arab Spring protests in 2011, is that online chatter can quickly morph into action on the streets. And therefore by controlling the internet, the party feels it can better control society, helped by tools such as the Social Credit Score.</p><p>\"If a sensible version of the social credit system operated within a legal framework that was rigorous and predictable, then it might have a beneficial effect,\" says Fitzgerald. \"But the systems that are in place for managing and controlling the information which is gathered are not up to the task. It [the social credit system] is intrusive enough in the first place but the potential for abuse by private players or party officials who want to get their own way is enormous.\"</p><p>Such potential for abuse of the planned social credit system and the general intrusion of cameras into people's lives has generated only limited public pushback, except from China's Christians. According to Yang from Purdue University, Christians are preparing to challenge efforts by the party to suppress and control their activities.</p><p>\"Some congregations are planning to break down into small groups so it is harder to be hunted down. But the larger house church congregations may resist the suppression,\" he says. \"It will be interesting how much the government will mobilise resources to deal with this. In all the major cities there are multiple large congregations.\"</p><p>That is a battle set to play out early next year when the new religious laws come into effect, but for Fitzgerald it is part of a wider change in the social compact between the party and its subjects.</p><p>No longer, he argues, are people being asked to abrogate their political rights in exchange for a promise of rising living standards and for the party to gradually withdraw from their lives.</p><p>\"Nobody talks about the wealth contract any more; that's because it was supplanted around the time of the global financial crisis [2008/2009] with one around domestic and international security,\" Fitzgerald says.</p><p>\"The party basically said 'the world is a nasty place and we will offer you protection from that'.\"</p><p>Fitzgerald says this shift, which has been missed by many journalists and commentators, helps explain the party's newfound zeal in cracking down on everything from religion to the internet and jaywalkers, believing it is justified in doing whatever is necessary to fulfil its newfound \"security\" compact.</p><p>\"The fact that the party can do what it wants at any time is the ultimate terrifying and arbitrary fact of life in China.\" W</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6x3blawlm1fg0do0g4p</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PPJ-X3V1-F0J6-J3H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The law leaves it to the companies to regulate, or not regulate, their published content.</p><p>The executive order is also expected to provide for the Federal Communication Commission, an independent body currently headed by Trump-nominee Ajit Pai, an Indian American, to receive and review complaints of political bias of these platforms.</p><p>Lastly, the order is expected to prohibit federal ad-spendings on platforms found in violation.</p><p>Unidentified Trump administration official who spoke selectively to US news publications cautioned that the order was still a draft and could change.</p><p>And experts have said the order is very likely to be challenged and in courts and may not survive.</p><p>Trump and other Republicans have for long been calling for action against tech companies for a while now alleging they are unfairly targeted for censoring.

With money pouring into the cybersecurity sector and a rash of startups aiming to offer solutions for ever-increasing cyberthreats, analysts say market consolidation is needed   and 2019 could be the leading edge of a cybersecurity M&amp;A wave.</p><p>Security software deals are on the rise, with 79 announced year-to-date as of Dec. 19, up from 63 in 2014, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence data.</p><p>As investors prepare to ring in a new year, speculation abounds about the M&amp;A intentions of private equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC, which has been on a cybersecurity buying run in 2018. The firm in October announced the $2.1 billion acquisition of Imperva Inc., then in November followed up with a $950 million transaction for Veracode Inc., both of which are still pending. Also in November, Reuters reported that Thoma Bravo was in talks to make an offer for Symantec Corp. However, a more recent report indicated Thoma Bravo was in discussions to buy security software giant McAfee, owned by Intel Corp. and TPG Advisors LLC, in a deal that unnamed sources told CNBC may fetch a significant premium over McAfee's 2016 valuation of $4.2 billion. Symantec, with a market cap of over $17 billion and about $5 billion in total debt, would represent another massive M&amp;A target.</p><p>Thoma Bravo did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Buying McAfee could signal a shift in strategy for Thoma Bravo, Wedbush Securities cybersecurity analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note. While both Symantec and McAfee claim to effectively provide end-to-end securities solutions for business, government and consumers, a McAfee buy would be a more streamlined \"safer play,\" while Symantec \"would create a security stalwart in the field with massive synergies which remains the underlying goal of this combined PE play,\" the analyst said. He added that recent deal activity in cybersecurity represents \"the tip of the iceberg,\" as players such as Thoma attempt to build end-to-end cybersecurity companies in a highly fragmented landscape.</p><p>Contributing to the deal activity is a market crowded with new players cropping up to address the growing threat of cyberattacks for companies increasingly moving operations to the cloud.</p><p>William Blair &amp; Co. cybersecurity analyst Jonathan Ho in an interview estimated that between 1,300 and 1,400 cybersecurity startups have launched to address a range of problems in the past four to five years. As soon as a new cybersecurity issue arises, there can be 20 companies vying to address that problem, he said. The market fragmentation makes investment in the cybersecurity industry more difficult, despite strong interest, Ho added.</p><p>Another factor likely to drive more cybersecurity consolidation is compressed valuations. While cybersecurity exchange-traded funds like ETF Managers Trust - ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF and First Trust Exchange-Traded Fund II - First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF and the broader tech-focused Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF have outperformed the broad markets over the past year, all three were hit by recent volatility in technology and the broader markets. For the three months ending Dec. 19, ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF was down about 14% while First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF and Vanguard Information Technology ETF each lost about 16%, roughly in-line with the double-digit percentage drops seen at major indexes including the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 over the same period. While the recent declines are little comfort to individual cybersecurity investors, Ives said, the trend creates opportunities for consolidation against less expensive valuations.</p><p>Symantec, for example, saw its stock tumble in the first half of the year due to marketwide volatility, company-specific concerns related to an internal audit, and competitive and acquisition-integration issues. However, the stock saw a bump in November amid speculation that Thoma Bravo might buy the company, though the December report about how Thoma Bravo's sights may have changed erased some of those gains. As of Dec. 19, Symantec's stock had gained 2% since Nov. 5, the day before Reuters reported that Thoma Bravo was considering a bid for Symantec.</p><p>William Blair &amp; Co.'s Ho said some of the most attractive M&amp;A candidates remain private, but relatively high valuations and fewer incentives to sell create a more difficult M&amp;A environment for private companies. Venture capital has been active in cybersecurity, providing startups with plenty of financial runway on large valuations, he said, leaving potential acquirers on the sidelines until companies are more interested in liquidity events and valuations become more attractive.</p><p>Recent threats, such as the Marriott International Inc. breach revealed at the close of November that impacted 500 million consumers, are pressuring companies to increase their spend on cybersecurity, while governments investigate their own options to safeguard data and regulate industry.</p><p>The move to cloud computing is creating a new paradigm for cybersecurity investment as companies across industries take sensitive data off their own closed internal servers and put them into shared cloud spaces. Currently, about 30% of workloads are in the cloud, and Wedbush's Ives expects that to expand to about 55% over the next four years. The analyst expects spending on cybersecurity to expand from 5% of corporate budgets to about 7% to 8%.</p><p>\"These are trends for the next three to five years. I believe M&amp;A is going to hit an inflection point in 2019 in this space,\" Ives said in an interview.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-49029952</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V1Y-9321-JDVW-N2KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

We look at who has the edge both on and off the field.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, I'm Adrian Finighan in for Richard Quest, this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, U.S. stock markets are taking a pounding tonight as a wave of selling sweeps the world. Almost everywhere traders look, there's trouble. In China, in Europe, and in the U.S. worrying signs that the recovery may be at risk. Let's go straight to Alison Kosik, who is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Alison, doesn't look pretty. What's the atmosphere like there on the floor?</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, exactly. It does not look pretty today and so what we're doing today is turning to a trader here on the floor. Alan Valdes, with DME Securities, to find out why we're seeing this sell off today?</p><p>ALAN VALDES, DME SECURITIES: Well, you know, we knew coming into the market, this morning, we looked at the markets in Asia last night. They were selling off. Look like things are getting a little weaker in China. Europe, this morning, they got a big bill due tomorrow-Thursday, rather-of $545 billion, the banks have loans repayment. Hedge traders a little worried. This morning consumer confidence, here in America, all of weighing on the market right across the board, but from the get-go the market was down. Right from the opening bell, we were down 100 points.</p><p>KOSIK: Are we in for a bounce back? I mean, could we see a bounce back tomorrow, with such a plunge today?</p><p>VALDES: Well, you know we hope so, as traders, because we are a superstitious lot. Tomorrow is the end of the half, end of the first six months. Historically, the way the market closes tomorrow will be the way we finish the year. So, right now the Dow is down about 2.8 percent. If we close tomorrow on the downside, we could be in for a tough year ahead.</p><p>KOSIK: You know, there's been a lot of talk about a double dip recession. I mean, we're getting a lot of down beat economic reports, day after day. Are we really in for another recession?</p><p>VALDES: I don't think we'll go double-dip. I think you may see the market contract, maybe down another 8,500, 9,000, in that range; which would be bad enough. I don't think we'll double dip. I think you'll see earnings season be pretty good. I think we'll grind things out, but at the end of the day. It is all about jobs. And jobs have not changed at all. Friday we got a big jobs number and that is going to be a turning point. We'll see where that goes.</p><p>KOSIK: Well, what is it going to take to turn the markets around?</p><p>VALDES: Well, you know right now this administration has lost more jobs than Herbert Hoover. We've lost 4.4 million jobs since Obama has been elected. We have to turn that around. Some way we have to get that turned around. If you look at the U6, that is the under-employed jobs. I mean, that is on the rise. That is 16.6. Last year at this time it was a little lower. Those are the people who were making $30,000 last year and are making $15,000 this year. So that is weighing on the market, too. It's just not the quality jobs out there.</p><p>KOSIK: And there is, once again, the fear about the Friday jobs report?</p><p>VALDES: That's right that is a big number coming out. Again, that is going to kick off the next half and we'll watch that number real closely.</p><p>KOSIK: All right. We'll have to wait and see what happens. But once again, you know what, Adrian, it always comes down to jobs, doesn't it? To bring back that confidence that we lost in June, Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: It does indeed, Alison. Many thanks indeed.</p><p>KOSIK: You've got it.</p><p>FINIGHAN: We'll check back on Wall Street throughout the hour to keep you up to date with what's happening there.</p><p>Well, stock markets here in Europe were on the ropes after the close, a brutal session today. There is deep concern about what will happen when a lifeline for banks expires this week and that is only one of several negatives today. Let's take a look at how things ended.</p><p>All the main markets plunged, every stock on each one of those indices lost value. The FTSE 100 at an eight-month low. Mining, metal stocks, down because of worries about weaker global demand. The big four, that's Rio Tinto, Xstrata (ph), Oslo Metal (ph), Piece &amp; Krupp (ph). Airlines were weak today, British Airways, Lufthansa. Banks, too, Barclays down 6.3 percent, Greddy Agricola down nearly 8 percent in Paris, also BNP Paribas, and Societe Generale, all down. It is payback time for European banks, this week they must repay about $540 billion worth, extraordinary loans to the ECB.</p><p>This will reveal just how much banks still rely on low rate loans from the central bank. Will there be cash flow problems? Even a new credit crunch? That's what the markets are worried about today. Now, banking stocks were hit particularly hard in Spain, Portugal and Greece today. Banks there, of course, could face greater problems getting funds because of their exposure to weak economies, markets and people reluctant to lend, of course. Even on a day like today, you know, we're seeing some signs of optimism though, about the Euro Zone. Some people still think that things are going to get better, according to the European Union. It is economic sentiment indicator, that is a measure of the mood, is rising in the single currency area. It edged higher in June by just a fraction to 98.7, from 98.4, back in May. Now that was contrary to expectations. Consumer confidence is also up in the Euro Zone, by 1 point, on the EU index.</p><p>Well, earlier today I spoke with Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize- winning economist and a professor at Columbia University. I asked him, if he thinks the EU is right to end its emergency loan program on Thursday this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSEPH STIGLITZ, PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: I think it is very similar to the problems that are true about fiscal policy. It is premature to remove the support for fiscal policies and it is almost surely premature to remove the support for the banking system. We are not yet on the basis of a robust recovery. And particularly, as the fiscal policies undermine the recovery, there is a serious risk of a double-dip. And it is not a surprise to me that there is a high level of anxiety on the part of the banks.</p><p>FINIGHAN: I know that you are no fan of Chancellor George Osborne's budget, here in the U.K., last week. Do you think that by implementing cuts, more cuts, austerity measures here in Europe, in particular, we're in danger of repeating Herbert Hoover's 1929 mistake, when he turned the Wall Street crash into the Great Recession (sic).</p><p>STIGLITZ: Precisely, that is exactly-we have ample evidence on this. I mean, Hoover, we call these Hooverite policies, in honor of Herbert Hoover. But the IMF has done that same experiment in Indonesia, Korea, Thailand, Argentina, so we know what is almost surely likely to have happened, and that is, fiscal contraction.</p><p>FINIGHAN: But surely-</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>STIGLITZ: It's understandable that countries are worried about the debt, but there are ways to respond to that, that are not so short-sighted.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, give me some indication of what those ways might be. Surely, governments can't spend their way out of a recession? They can't keep spending money that haven't got.</p><p>STIGLITZ: Well, what you have to do is change the strategy, both the composition of expenditures, and the structure of taxes. So, let me give you an example. If, in the United States, for instance, we spent less money on the military, on weapons that don't work against enemies that don't exist, on a war in Afghanistan that is failing, and take that same money and invest it at home. We will stimulate the economy more. We could then cut back a little bit on expenditure and have the same level of fiscal support.</p><p>But what that will mean is that because the economy will be growing on the basis of this productive investment. Taxes revenues will be coming in, both in the short run, and in the long run. And the result of that is that the long-term national debt will be lower. So, you can't look at this in a very short-sighted way. You really-what is of concern is not the debt today or tomorrow, the concern is the debt 10 years or 15 years from now. And these investment strategies are the way out of this particular conundrum that we've gotten ourselves into.</p><p>FINIGHAN: One final question, here. You're the man credited with having foreseen, predicted this recession. You are far too modest a man to say, well, I told you so. But what have you learned? Has your economic philosophy, if you like, changed or been tweaked as a result of what we've been through over the last two years, 18 months?</p><p>STIGLITZ: So far things have come along pretty much as I had predicted. And, in fact, I think the crisis is a real reinforcement for the kinds of economic theories that I had been developing over a long period of time. And standing on the shoulders of great economists, like Keynes, modifying it as the economy has changed.</p><p>So, there is a wide body of research that had actually anticipated this. But it wasn't the mainstream. The mainstream in the economics profession, quite frankly, said that bubbles don't exist, markets are efficient. Bubbles can't exist because markets are efficient. That is why you ought to deregulate, and if there was a problem the markets will be self-correcting. Well, we know pretty well not that that is not true.</p><p>And the challenge going forward is, two-fold, how to prevent the recurrence, and that is where regulatory reform is very important, but really the main challenge right now is how to get our economies going again. And unfortunately, the same mindset that brought us into the crisis, the same mindset of the financial markets, that had this belief in unfettered markets, that got us into the mess, are now dictating that austerity measures that will just make thing worse. We have so much evidence on this, I hope this is an exception, but I wouldn't bet on it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FINIGHAN: Professor Joseph Stiglitz who is currently here in the U.K.</p><p>Well, it is turning into a summer of strikes in Spain and Greece. Riot police are back on the streets of Athens, as protests over spending cuts turn to anger. We'll take you live to Greece for a look at what's been happening today.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: A fresh wave of strikes is underway in Europe as austerity bites. Police in Athens clashed with protestors as lawmakers debated a new round of spending cuts. Many public services ground to a halt in the country's fifth general strike this year. Let's go straight over to Athens now. Elinda Labrapolou joins us live via broadband.</p><p>So, it turned violent on the streets once again, Elinda?</p><p>ELINDA LABRAPOLOU, CNN INT'L. CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it did turn violent again. This is the fifth general strike we've had this year. We did have less people turning up, however, than we had until now. So, you could say, in a way that things are calming down. But what is being debated in Parliament at the moment, the pension reforms bill, is something that touches a lot of people. So, over 10,000 people took to the streets today, protesting, being angry. About, you know, their retirement age is changing. It is getting-they'll have to retire when they're older. They are getting a lot of benefit cuts, their pensions are being slashed. So that led a lot of people to the streets once again.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Plus the argument that pensions and conditions for people are being changed right across Europe at the moment. Austerity measures are being implemented wherever you look. Does that argument cut any sway with people there in Greece?</p><p>LABRAPOLOU: Well, it does up to a point, but then people look at things on a personal level and they see how it affects them. And they realize that with the new austerity measures that we've had, where the VAT tax on alcohol, tobacco, fuel has been raised. A lot of other things have gone up. They just can't make ends meet. So to most people being asked to give more is just not something that they're prepared to put up with.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Of course, Greece relies heavily upon its tourism industry. We're just a few weeks now from the peak of the season. Are people there not at all concerned that this kind of violent protest is likely to put people off coming to Greece and spending money that the country desperately needs?</p><p>LABRAPOLOU: A lot of people are very much concerned about that. Tourism figures are much lower this year. They're 12 percent down. The tourism industry amounts for about 20 percent of GDP, and one in five jobs. So it is an industry that affects a lot of people. But again, on a personal level, when people realize that they're touched directly by these measures, they're just not prepared to put up with them. So, they realize that it might affect the whole country, but they're just not prepared to put up with it.</p><p>FINIGHAN: And people who work in the tourism industry, they're taking action, themselves, tomorrow?</p><p>LABRAPOLOU: Yes, they're holding a separate strike tomorrow. This is just people in the tourism industry. So that is also going to affect services and obviously for someone who is here on holiday for a short while, you know, you have a general strike on one day. You're not quite sure what works, what doesn't. The same thing happens the following day. It makes it more and more difficult to convince people to come to Greece.</p><p>FINIGHAN: All right, Elinda, many thanks indeed. Elinda Labrapolou, there, speaking live from Athens, via broadband.</p><p>At the other side of the Med, there were signs on the streets of Madrid today that Spain's pretty unhappy with austerity, too. There was traffic chaos in the Spanish capitol, for the second day running. Metro workers went on strike over a 5 percent cut in public sector pay. Today's action closed the entire subway network. Around 2.5 million people had to find other means of getting to and from work. Metro staff are planning another walk out for tomorrow.</p><p>Well, Spanish football fans have plenty to distract them, thank goodness. We're moments away from a crucial match in the World Cup. We'll have more on that in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: So, a couple of hours ago, Paraguay booked their place in the last days of the World Cup by beating Japan. It was the first match at this tournament to end in a penalty shootout, when the game ended goal after extra time.</p><p>There is one more slot to fill in the quarter finals. And both Spain and Portugal want it. CNN's Alex Thomas joins us now live from Johannesburg, with a round up of all today's action.</p><p>And, Alex, what's being said about giving referees some extra help? I assume that is referring to controversial decisions. That affected both England and Mexico.</p><p>ALEX THOMAS, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: You are absolutely right, Adrian. Let's take you through the World Cup action so far on this Tuesday. The pen ultimate of the round of sixteen matches, it took place in Pretoria, at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium.</p><p>This is what happened. Paraguay with the majority of the possession for most of the game, and their best opportunity-or one of them-came as early as the 20th minute. Luca Barrios with a shot that forced Japan's goalkeeper to make a good save. Later in the first half, a chance for Japan as well, Diasuke Matsui rattling the crossbar with a curling shot from about 20 yards away-I thought we were going to show you some of the video action, that's why I was reading it off my black read. But clearly, we're having a big of problems with that.</p><p>It all boiled down to a penalty shootout, Adrian. Five kicks apiece at the end. The third Japanese spot kick taker hit the cross bar, didn't score. Paraguay scored their last two penalties and it meant that Paraguay goes through, 5-3 on penalties. The first shootout in this World Cup so far.</p><p>Paraguay moves (ph) to the last eight for the first time in their history, Adrian, and denying Japan the same achievement, Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, you've got to feel sorry for Japan, really. It's never good to go out in a penalty shootout, Alex. Of course, we've got Portugal and Spain in just a moment. We are going to talk to Al Goodman, who is in Spain, about that match in just a moment. That's I should imagine fairly, it's quite a tight match up, isn't it?</p><p>Let's talk about that, that-those controversial decisions that affected both England and Mexico. Seth Blatter has been talking today about the possibility of looking into introducing goal-line technology?</p><p>THOMAS: That's right, Adrian. It was a news conference that was scheduled before Sunday's matches, between England and Germany, and Argentina and Mexico. And we can all recall that during those games there were two glaring referee errors. Frank Rampart scored a legitimate goal that disallowed. And in the Argentina game, Carlos Tevez's first goal for Argentina should have been ruled offside, but it wasn't. That one was allowed.</p><p>So, massive refereeing mistakes. FIFA have been hammered in the world's media for the last 48 hours. So, President Seth Blatter used today's press conference, as I said, scheduled before the controversies, to apologize to the football associations of both England and Mexico. We should stress that those dodgy refereeing decisions didn't affect the results. Germany and Argentina went through fairly and squarely. Nonetheless a huge embarrassment for world football's governing body.</p><p>And Blatter, as well as the apology, also promised to look again at the possibility of using goal-line technology in a meeting that is scheduled for Wales next month. So maybe it will be introduced in time for the next World Cup. They certainly won't change their stance for this tournament. They've got to keep the rules consistent throughout. It's all about Blatter, Adrian, has ruled out the use of wholesale video replay like you get in other sports. It is just particularly talking about the goal- line technology, whether the ball has crossed the line or not.</p><p>FINIGHAN: I'm sure, Alex, that many people here in England would agree with you there, that England were beaten fairly and squarely. But, Alex Thomas, many thanks indeed. We'll talk to you again soon.</p><p>So, in what, eight minutes' time, Portugal kick offs against their neighbor, Spain. At stake, of course, is that last birth in the quarter finals of the World Cup, as well as a load of national pride. CNN's Al Goodman is in Madrid, no doubt which side he'll be cheering for tonight.</p><p>But, Al, you speak to, um, you speak to anyone in Portugal in Spanish and they're not best pleased; and the same in Spain, there, if you try to talk to someone in Portuguese. Even though they are neighbors there is not love lost between the two countries, is there?</p><p>AL GOODMAN, CNN INT'L. CORRESPONDENT: Not really, especially, on this day, Adrian. Actually, I am on the Spanish/Portuguese border in the town of Batahothe (ph). We've been across the border that way, through Portugal, to the town of Elvis (ph). So both sides are predicting victory and this is a really important day because both of these countries have deep economic problems. They are on the watch list, if you will, of the international ratings agencies; a lot of attention on the economic problems of Portugal and Spain. But this day, the attention is all on this TV screen here in this bar in Batahothe (ph) Spain, and on TV screens like this all across the country. So, both sides predicting victory; these teams have a historic rivalry, they know each other well. We're going to see who is going to come out ahead, Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, it is a chance for people to put their economic woes behind them. Just for what, 90 minutes tonight. How would you describe the atmosphere? You talk about the rivalry between the two neighboring nations? How nasty does that get? Or is it just friendly rivalry?</p><p>GOODMAN: Well, in football it is not exactly a friendly rivalry. And Spain has the upper hand in the matches overall, 15 victories, five losses. But notably they have had 12 ties. Now Spain, of course, is the much bigger economy. Portuguese is always feeling pushed, if you will-I think that is a fair assessment-by their Spanish neighbors on a number of fronts. Certainly economically, and here, this certainly for Portugal a chance to show pride and come back against the bigger more powerful neighbor next door.</p><p>But for Spain, they are the perennial underachievers in the World Cup. They have gone home many times, very early. Everybody thinks they might actually have a chance to get far this time. This is the toughest game they will have faced this tournament, Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Al, you've got a great job tonight. I'm really envious. Enjoy the match, tonight, won't you? And enjoy the atmosphere there, on the border between Spain and Portugal. Al Goodman, there.</p><p>And Al alluded to it just a moment or two ago, that the strength of the two economies there. Let's take a more detailed look at both of them in the Economic World Cup.</p><p>So, let's join Jim Boulden, once again, to see who would win if it wasn't the players, but the economies of Spain and Portugal that were head to head.</p><p>Al, sort of touched upon it there, a moment.</p><p>JIM BOULDEN, CNN INT'L. CORRESPONDENT: Yes, sure.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Of course, that Spain, you would think, being the larger country has a bigger economy. But it's in trouble. Both economies are in trouble.</p><p>BOULDEN: It is in trouble, but it is in more trouble than Portugal, to be honest with you. If you think of Spanish unemployment at 20 percent, and GDP growth negative expected this year; unemployment, as we said, you know, 20 percent. And budget deficits near 10 percent. None of those figures in Portugal come close to that. They're all-it's all better in Portugal. The unemployment rate about half of that. They are expecting growth in Portugal this year. And the budget deficit is nowhere near as bad, even though the banks are always confident (ph). And this is what Portugal always likes to say, don't put a brush on us from Spain.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes.</p><p>BOULDEN: We're not the same.</p><p>FINIGHAN: OK, if we were talking about the strength of the economies it's Portugal that has the upper hand?</p><p>BOULDEN: This year, Portugal. Absolutely.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: What's all this we're hearing about the Portugal, though, being perhaps the next Greece, the next Ireland, perhaps.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Why are we talking about Portugal in that way, and not so much Spain?</p><p>BOULDEN: Well, Spain, the Spanish banks seem to be-have invested a lot and the worry is the amount of debt they have from place like Greece.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Correct (ph).</p><p>BOULDEN: So there is a real worry about the Spanish banks, but the Spanish government constantly says our banks are not a bad as people think. They're going to do a stress test. And we're going to hear very soon, Spain says. We'll see where the banks stand. But Spain has been very transparent about that.</p><p>Portugal is a much, much smaller economy. So they're not having as much exposure like the big, big Spanish banks.</p><p>FINIGHAN: OK, who would you be rooting for tonight, then, Jim?</p><p>BOULDEN: I would have said, before the tournament, that Spain was my favorite. I still say it is my favorite, but not economically.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Really? Ah, I'm going for Portugal. Love-as a man who holidays in Portugal, takes a vacation there, most years, it has got to be Portugal, of course.</p><p>What about the earlier game we saw today? Paraguay-poor Japan, going out on penalties.</p><p>BOULDEN: Well, some country had to be the first one to go out on penalties, it was Japan. Believe it or not, I'm going to say, Paraguay.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yeah?</p><p>BOULDEN: I'm going to say it for economic reasons.</p><p>FINIGHAN: What?</p><p>BOULDEN: And you are going to say you seem crazy.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Hang on? Yeah?</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes, well, let's get the numbers.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Jim Boulden, you're crazy.</p><p>BOULDEN: The budget deficit, Paraguay, a fraction of the budget deficit problems in Japan right now.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Really?</p><p>BOULDEN: GDP growth, because it's a small country, South America, and it's neighbor Brazil. Its biggest export partner is Brazil, so it is doing well.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: It's got a GDP growth anywhere between 4 and 6 percent this year.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: Japan, of course, had well, all the Western nations have a problem in the last year. Now officially, unemployment rate, 5.7 percent in Paraguay. Officially, in Japan, 5.2 percent.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Oh, right.</p><p>BOULDEN: Now, officially Paraguay's unemployment rate isn't much worse. We're not talking about the informal economy here.</p><p>FINIGHAN: So, it is Paraguay on potential, perhaps, then?</p><p>BOULDEN: Yeah.</p><p>FINIGHAN: OK. All right. Jim, many thanks indeed.</p><p>We want to know how you are combining doing a days' work and actually following the World Cup. I'm sure that many of you are managing to juggle the two of them. Like Jim and I, we were in the office today, talking economics, of course, but we were actually watching football on our big screen in there.</p><p>Send your pictures and stories of your World Cup At Work. You can find us on Facebook or e-mail us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Quest@cnn.com\">Quest@cnn.com</email> Your you can Twitter@RichardQuest.</p><p>Now, the electric car maker Tesla is charging up Wall Street in only its first day. So why are so many investors interested? We'll tell you why, right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: Welcome back live from London this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. In for Richard Quest, I'm Adrian Finighan. Let's get a check right now of the main news headlines at this hour.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: Welcome back.</p><p>Live from London, this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>In for Richard Quest, I'm Adrian Finighan.</p><p>Let's get a check right now of the main news headlines at this hour.</p><p>Russia's foreign ministry is rejecting U.S. claims that it's uncovered a cold war-style espionage ring. Ten people have been arrested in the United States, another in Cypress, on suspicion that they were Russian agents on a long-term mission to spy on the U.S. government.</p><p>Russia calls the allegations \"unfounded,\" saying that the suspects never harmed U.S. interests.</p><p>The general tapped to become the next top U.S. commander in Afghanistan says he agrees with President Barack Obama's time line for troop withdrawal. David Petraeus is testifying before a Senate committee today. He's expected to easily win confirmation to replace General Stanley McChrystal, who was forced to resign over critical comments about the Obama administration.</p><p>Well, Barack Obama is hosting Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah at the White House this hour. The two leaders are expected to discuss Israel's plan to further Jewish settlements on occupied land and Iran's nuclear program. Talks between the Saudi king and the president come ahead of a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's due in Washington next week.</p><p>Rescuers are searching for more than 100 people buried in a mudslide in Southwestern China. According to state media, the first body, a child, was pulled from the rubble today. Hopes of finding any survivors are slim. Heavy rains triggered the mudslide, but there are still showers in the area.</p><p>Well, big losses on Wall Street today, as we've been reporting. And it's just the same for just about any U.S. stock you care to name, except one. Shares of the electric car maker Tesla Motorsare up by about 12 percent. They're making their debut on the Nasdaq today.</p><p>Now, the company has yet to make a -- a profit, even for a single quarter. But that didn't stop investors handing over more than $220 million in the initial public offering. The company sold the stock for $17 a share. That's higher than the range it previously indicated after demand was stronger than expected.</p><p>And it made a little bit of history. It's the first public listing of a car maker in the state since Ford back in 1956.</p><p>But the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, is reluctant to call the company a traditional car maker. Musk was a co-founder of the -- the company, having earlier got PayPal, the electronic payment system, off the ground. He says in the way Tesla operates, it's got more in common with Apple or Google than Ford and GM.</p><p>Well, the road certainly hasn't been smooth for the man who provided much of the funding for Tesla. He's poured millions of dollars of his own money into Tesla.</p><p>Let's go live to CNNMoney.com, the newsroom there.</p><p>Poppy Harlow joins us live -- and, Poppy, he must -- he must have faith in his product there, to pour so much money into it.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, ANCHOR, CNNMONEY.COM: You can say that again. His name, Elon Musk. You know, it's very interesting that he relates his company to Google or Apple. Larry Paige and Sergey Brin of Google poured money, also, into Tesla. They're betting on its success.</p><p>But a big, big day, the company going public in New York, going public at about $17 a share, trading much higher, trading around $20.50. So a nice boost for that stock today.</p><p>I talked to the CEO, Elon Musk, right outside of the Nasdaq, along with all of those Tesla cars there. Beautiful. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: Elon, a huge day for Tesla, the company going public.</p><p>Why now?</p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: Well, a -- a number of reasons. We actually don't need (INAUDIBLE) proceeds for the Model S (INAUDIBLE) in production. A lot of people think we do, but that's -- that's actually taken care of with the DOE loan and with the pre-existing investment.</p><p>HARLOW: This is the Model S, by the way, folks.</p><p>MUSK: This is the Model S, right.</p><p>HARLOW: Rolling out in 2012.</p><p>MUSK: Right. The reason for the IPO was actually to raise funds for parallel development of some additional variations on the Model S platform, to give us a little bit of additional cushion in case the Model S takes longer than expected and -- and also to provide some small amount of liquidity for myself and others in -- that are in the IPR.</p><p>I'm only selling 5 percent of my holdings and I don't intend to sell anymore, to be clear.</p><p>HARLOW: And that's part of the -- part of the DOE agreement, you have to hold onto about 65 percent, correct?</p><p>MUSK: Yes, of my holdings, yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Of your holdings.</p><p>All right, let's talk about the Model S. This is the -- it's going to cost about half of what the Roadster costs.</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: About $50,000.</p><p>MUSK: Correct.</p><p>HARLOW: The goal is to have this roll out in 2012.</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: But you just said in case it takes longer than expected. That's a really aggressive time line.</p><p>I mean, do you really think that you can get these out and running, 20,000 of them, by 2012, as -- as the hope is?</p><p>MUSK: We intend to start production in mid-2012. It always takes a little bit of time to (INAUDIBLE) up the production line. So we expect to get the 20,000 unit a year run rate by early 2015.</p><p>HARLOW: OK.</p><p>MUSK: So 2013 will be the first year where we do the 20,000 units.</p><p>HARLOW: It's good -- it's good to clear that up for a lot of folks. Looking at -- at Tesla, this is a startup company. Like many startup companies, you lose money.</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: The company has lost about $260 million since its inception.</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: You're going public. You want the public to invest in Tesla.</p><p>What can you say to reassure investors that might have questions about the potential profitability here?</p><p>MUSK: Well, yes. We -- we do often do get that question. The -- the thing that's important to bear in mind is that if Tesla just -- were just decided to be a -- a spore scar company and sell power trains to -- to other -- other companies like to the -- to Daimler and to Toyota, we would be profitable. That's an important consideration.</p><p>However, we're choosing not to do that. We're choosing, instead, to reinvest those profits and raise additional money to increase the -- the production volume and -- and produce the Model S, which is 30 times more production volume, maybe 40 times more production volume than -- than the - - than our sport scar. And it's just impossible, if you're going through that kind of growth, to -- to remain profitable as a whole.</p><p>HARLOW: And up here we have the Roadster, right?</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Are you going to stop making the Roadster in 2011?</p><p>MUSK: (INAUDIBLE) the Roadster does give us the -- a good, good time, a good -- good production run-up of -- of the Roadster. We feel comfortable stopping that first generation and actually making it much more of a collective item, as well. So when -- when people are buying a car...</p><p>HARLOW: I think what you're trying to do here, you'll make a ton of them so they get in the -- you know, people want them even more.</p><p>MUSK: Well, I think, you know, I think there is some scarcity value. And it's sort of like imagine if you had the opportunity to own the first Porsche, you know, or the first Mercedes or the first Ferrari or something like that.</p><p>HARLOW: Is this what you see Tesla becoming, as big as Ferrari?</p><p>MUSK: Well, I think -- I think much bigger than Ferrari but -- and -- and hopefully bigger than Porsche.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: A ways to go there before it is bigger than Porsche, Adrian. Of course, as you said, they first need to turn a profit. I asked him, when will Tesla turn a profit. He wouldn't comment on that.</p><p>I'll tell you, though, Tesla has this cool factor that a lot of car companies out there -- especially electric car makers, just don't have.</p><p>And I'll end it on this little note. What's very interesting, you may have seen Elon Musk, that CEO, in \"Iron Man 2.\" Apparently, Robert Downey, Jr. called him up himself and asked him to be in that movie.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Oh, wow!</p><p>HARLOW: Back to you -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Bigger than Ferrari, bigger than Porsche, well, we'll wait and see.</p><p>HARLOW: I know.</p><p>FINIGHAN: I was going to ask you, did he get to drive it?</p><p>But given the traffic that was out there in Manhattan, perhaps -- perhaps it wouldn't have been much fun.</p><p>But, no, Jim Boulden was in here earlier saying oh, he's driven one. Oh, yes, fine. But he -- he just -- I don't know, the image isn't right. You know, you'd look great in a Tesla.</p><p>Would you buy one, is the question?</p><p>HARLOW: I -- I've driven...</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes?</p><p>HARLOW: If I -- if I had $100,000 spare cash, yes, I would buy one. I actually have driven one a few months ago at this electric car race. It's amazing the pickup -- very, very fast. It's -- it feels like a Porsche, I'll give him that...</p><p>FINIGHAN: You'd better start saving...</p><p>HARLOW: -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: You'd better start saving up, Poppy.</p><p>Many thanks, indeed.</p><p>HARLOW: I know.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Poppy Harlow live at CNNMoney.com.</p><p>Now, for most U.S. car companies, home could only ever be Detroit, Michigan. But not Tesla. This is one automaker the originated far from Motor City. It's based in Silicon Valley, home of the big tech titans. Tesla Design isn't too far away from Google's headquarters. And by basing itself there, the company is going for a high tech image. Who knows, it might even be good for business.</p><p>Well, just around the corner in Silicon Valley, Google itself being accused of backing down in its censorship battle with China. The search engine announced a new strategy that it hopes will keep its Chinese Web site up and running.</p><p>But the technique isn't going down so well in the U.S. tech community.</p><p>Maggie Lake joins us now live from New York with the latest on that -- hey, Maggie.</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Adrian.</p><p>You know, this is a very small step for a very large tech company and a very large and growing population of Internet users.</p><p>But, you know, if actions speak louder than words, pant very happy with Google today.</p><p>When users in China go to Google's home page that you're looking at right here on Google.cn, instead of being automatically directed to Google Hong Kong, they're going to have to click that site there that you see first, that will then transport them to the Google Hong Kong page.</p><p>Now, that's interesting because it's a softening of the harder line that Google had taken earlier this year, when it moved its servers to Hong Kong, announced it was going to stop censoring results and automatically redirect those users, which is what it's been doing.</p><p>Now, at that time, you'll remember, the company complained of cyber attacks aimed at accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents and they expressed concern on their Web site about the, quote, \"security and human rights implications.\" You know, using some pretty bold language.</p><p>Well, on the company's Web site today, Google's chief legal officer, David Drummond, addressed this change in tact, saying this. Quote, \"Without an ICP license, we cannot operate a commercial Web site like Google.cn. That's a prospect dreaded by many of our Chinese users, who have been very vocal about their desire to keep Google.cn alive.\"</p><p>So the company very much painting this as a necessary trade-off. But, tech watchers out there aren't really buying that. They say there are some other motivations going on, it's not really about protecting Chinese users, but about Google's bottom line.</p><p>Might -- Mitch Wagner, for example, blogging for \"Computer World,\" has this to say in response: \"Maybe it's not about choosing good or evil. Maybe it's just about the money. China is, after all, a market of a billion people, most of whom have yet to get Internet access. Google stands to reap vast wealth in that market. Maybe that wealth is more important to Google than defending freedom.\"</p><p>So the company really taking a bit of a hit on this. They were seen says -- you know, before as really standing up to China. So it's -- it is having a little bit of impact on that. And it's interesting, it's not clear whether it's going to be worth it not, not so whether this tweak is going to go far enough to impress the Chinese regulators. We haven't heard word from China and Google not really commenting on it any further, as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google's stock down about 3 percent today. But, of course, it is down in an overall terrible market here in the U.S. -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, it is.</p><p>But Google isn't the only high tech firm to -- to have faced this dilemma, is it?</p><p>LAKE: No, it's not. I mean, certainly they've all come across this. And when it comes to censoring the results, it's -- it's been a big issue. Yahoo! in particular, has had a lot of problems in the past with this. They've also come under a lot of criticism.</p><p>I think the difference here, though -- and you caught it in that comment from that one tech blogger -- is that Google really sort of put forth this -- this idea that they're different from everybody else, they're the maverick. They have that, you know, do no evil sort of quote that's been widely interpreted.</p><p>So the feeling was that they were going to behave a little differently, they were going to make a stand and show everyone else how -- how to act. I mean that's really kind of their reputation. And so by backpedaling just a little bit, it's really seen as caving. In fact, our own Web site saying, you know, the search engine blinked in the face of Chinese censorship.</p><p>So it's -- they're not alone and that's why a lot of these tech companies have been calling on there to be an issue -- an international standard, because no one wants to be the first one to pull out and potentially lose that lucrative business. But that has human rights watchers, as well as tech watchers, crying foul and saying, hey, this is all about the money. Don't try to say it's anything else.</p><p>So they're not the only ones, but because they set themselves apart a little bit differently, I think they're coming -- being called to the mat a little bit more on this. We'll see. It's the early days. We'll see China's reaction. We'll see if Google has anything else to say about it on its Web site -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, the early days, as you say. It will be interesting to see how it pans out.</p><p>Maggie, many thanks, indeed.</p><p>Maggie Lake live in New York.</p><p>Now, it's already dealing with an oil disaster, a huge drain on its funds and a storm of criticism. And now, BP faces the real thing, as a hurricane gathers speed off the coast of Mexico. We'll have the latest in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: Hello again.</p><p>Now, the disaster in the Gulf shows not only potential mistakes made by BP, a U.S. government agency also, perhaps, share some of the blame.</p><p>CNN's Joe Johns reports now on how loopholes can help lead to disaster.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Before it ever began drilling out in the Gulf, BP got an extraordinary gift from the government. The agency that regulates offshore oil exploration declared it didn't believe the Deepwater Horizon would cause any environmental damage, so BP deserved a pass. BP would not be required to comply with a tough law that would have forced the oil giant to fully assess what risks its rig might pose to the environment.</p><p>KIERAN SUCKLING, CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY: The whole thing is a mess.</p><p>JOHNS (on camera): Because it got this pass, here's what BP did not have to do.</p><p>It didn't have to produce specific information on the equipment that it was using or the place where it was drilling.</p><p>And BP didn't have to answer this question -- could there be a serious accident affecting the environment?</p><p>In other words, BP got to skip what would have been the toughest and final environmental review it would face before drilling.</p><p>(voice-over) That final environmental review would have taken time. It would have itemized in detail all the things that could go wrong and how that could hurt the environment. And that would almost certainly have delayed final approval to drill.</p><p>(on camera) Instead, BP got that pass from the agency at the Interior Department that's supposed to regulate it.</p><p>But Keeping Them Honest, as bad as all this sounds, it gets worse. It isn't just BP and Deepwater Horizon. In fact, most oil companies working in the Gulf get that same pass. That means of the hundreds of oil projects operating today in the Gulf, most got to skip that final critical environmental review.</p><p>SUCKLING: So the whole system is broken. It's not about BP having some individualized way of gaming the system. The oil industry has gamed the entire system from top to bottom.</p><p>JOHNS: Documents supplied to Congressional investigators by that Interior Department agency, the MMS, show that since President Obama took office, 254 oil development plans and 226 exploration plans in the Gulf were approved without the final environmental review.</p><p>The documents also show that every administration dating back to the first President Bush used the loophole. And they actually used it more often than Obama.</p><p>Now, though, it could end.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're closing the loophole that has allowed some oil companies to bypass some critical environmental reviews.</p><p>JOHNS: But even if the administration closes the loophole, what about all those other projects currently operating in the Gulf?</p><p>SUCKLING: You really need to go back and redo that entire decision to allow it in the first place. Instead, what's happening is the Department of Interior is allowing those bad decisions to stand, then trying to kind of come in around the back and fix it with safety inspections. And that's just not good enough. You've really got to go back to square one on this stuff.</p><p>JOHNS (voice-over): But sometimes starting over is hard to do, especially if you've already gotten the lease, leased the rig and hired the crew.</p><p>Eric Milito is with the American Petroleum Institute.</p><p>ERIC MILITO, AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE: You don't want to hurt that industry any more. You want to protect the jobs that are down there. And this industry provides a lot of economic input and a lot jobs to that - - that Gulf region.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>JOHNS: There are other environmental reviews prior to this final one BP and others did not have to pass, but none as rigorous. In fact, the law allows 30 days for this review. But given the slow pace of government bureaucracy, no one really thinks they could get done in 30 days. And that's another reason why the agency gave BP the pass.</p><p>(voice-over): The Interior Department won't comment because of pending litigation, but now the whole process is being reexamined by the White House -- too late to help the Gulf.</p><p>Joe Johns, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>FINIGHAN: And, of course, there's a storm brewing in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>Guillermo was telling us last night the next couple of days will be crucial in determining...</p><p>GUILLERMO ARDUINO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes.</p><p>FINIGHAN: -- what this storm actually becomes, whether it turns into a full blown hurricane, and, of course, the direction.</p><p>He's here with an update right now -- Guillermo.</p><p>ARDUINO: Here we see the perspective from Central America. This is the Gulf of Mexico. You see how wide it is. It's becoming a hurricane. It's not a hurricane yet. In any case, it's going to be a powerful storm.</p><p>And things are not changing. As far as we see, the National Hurricane Center continues with the same forecast, making landfall on Thursday of this system into the Tamaulipas state here of Mexico. That's south of Texas. And this red line is the National Hurricane Center forecast. The other ones are computer models.</p><p>So we are interested to see if there are -- there is a number of models that take the cyclone into the east, but there's no actually such thing.</p><p>Now, where we see the prevailing tracks of cyclones in the month of June, we see that actually we have the very cyclone that caused the problems in Yucatan is pretty much following the path of what we see in this time of the year.</p><p>So any time within hours, it's going to become a hurricane. It is very close to it. You see seven kilometers shy of being a hurricane. And we're talking about the maximum sustained winds that at 120 it becomes a hurricane.</p><p>And then, in 40 -- within that time frame and before the 48 hour period, it is expected to make landfall. An abundant amount of rain in the area and also intense winds.</p><p>The effects on the Gulf, Adrian, though, is the effect that it would have with waves and winds on the booms that would be either overtopped or breached because of all the movement there, the swell and all the intense winds.</p><p>Some thunderstorms in the area that these are causing.</p><p>But let's talk about your nice weather. Britain looking great. I see the London forecast. I mean I'm so sorry that Richard is not here, because I love giving him good news, you know, concerning the weather.</p><p>But we're going to see the bad weather into the Ukraine and Moldova section and northern parts of Romania. It's going to continue to be warm and nice in Britain. I think that 27 degrees or so in the next days with sunny skies. That's exclusively for Adrian Finighan.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Thank you, my friend.</p><p>It's always nice to -- to see you. Always nice to get good news.</p><p>We'll see you again.</p><p>ARDUINO: It is.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Guillermo, many thanks.</p><p>Crime doesn't pay, unless, of course, you're in the business of security.</p><p>And at the World Cup, of course, security is big business.</p><p>We'll tell you more in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: Well, in Capetown right now, Spain and Portugal are fighting for a place in the World Cup quarterfinals. Off the pitch, we're looking at the big business stories in South Africa.</p><p>CNN's Nkepile Mabuse reports now on South Africa's private security industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NKEPILE MABUSE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):</p><p>As crime as burgeoned in South Africa, so has the business of crime prevention. The country now has two private security guards for every policeman, with the industry's annual turnover estimated at more than $6 billion.</p><p>(on camera): So business has been good in the past few years, hasn't it?</p><p>NEVILLE ROTHFUSZ, CHUBB SECURITY: Yes. It has been good.</p><p>MABUSE (voice-over): Neville Rothfusz manages one of the country's biggest private security firms.</p><p>(on camera): In essence, high crime levels mean very good business for you?</p><p>ROTHFUSZ: Well, crime, obviously, is a driver of business for us. But the -- there are other reasons for that, as well, from -- from the insurance companies insisting that you have some form of cover, from a non- response company or a burglar alarm or something like that. So there's a lot of -- it's not only the crime that drives that, but there's obviously some -- some commercial businesses that depend on us to -- to kind of minimize the risk for them.</p><p>MABUSE (voice-over): Despite the rapid growth of South Africa's private army, crime levels have continued to rise. House robberies have increased by more than 100 percent in the past five years, from about 9,000 in 2005 to more than 18,000 last year. Attacks on businesses have gone up by even more, from about 3,000 in 2005 to nearly 14,000 in 2009.</p><p>While the numbers might indicate otherwise, private security companies continue to defend their role in crime prevention.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) can you just (INAUDIBLE) six, seven of those numbers (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>ROTHFUSZ: I think we've got many more resources than -- than the South African police have in terms of vehicles, in -- in terms of hours and feet on the floor. And -- and we really work together with the police as a partnership.</p><p>MABUSE: A security analyst who has interviewed convicted robbers says criminals have found ways to circumvent measures meant to protect their victims.</p><p>RUDOLPH ZINN, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AFRICA: These are experienced criminals that have learned through experience when the alarm system would be off. But interestingly enough, explain to us that should they see that there is an alarm system installed, whether it's been triggered or not, it will -- it will help to make them try and commit the crime in the shortest possible time and leave as soon as possible. It reduces the time that they spend inside and allowing them opportunities as far as rape is concerned and torture is concerned.</p><p>MABUSE: Security analysts have criticized the police and private security companies for being reactors. The answer, they say, lies in apprehending troublemakers early.</p><p>ZINN: We think criminology is the theory, that the younger a person is the first time he would get involved in crime, the more violent that person would be becoming an adult if they're not stopped. Second, also, is the fact that if people commit crime over an extended period of time, without any intervention from the police itself, those people gradually become more and more evasive, more violent, more daring in the crimes that they commit. And this is what we see.</p><p>MABUSE: Zinn has shared his findings with the police in the hope that it will change their strategy to a more proactive one. For now, fear grips South Africans are likely to continue spending millions on anything that holds the promise of safety.</p><p>Nkepile Mabuse, CNN, Johannesburg.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: The U.S. stock market is taking a pounding tonight amid a global sell-off today.

We look at who has the edge both on and off the field.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, I'm Adrian Finighan in for Richard Quest, this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, U.S. stock markets are taking a pounding tonight as a wave of selling sweeps the world. Almost everywhere traders look, there's trouble. In China, in Europe, and in the U.S. worrying signs that the recovery may be at risk. Let's go straight to Alison Kosik, who is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Alison, doesn't look pretty. What's the atmosphere like there on the floor?</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, exactly. It does not look pretty today and so what we're doing today is turning to a trader here on the floor. Alan Valdes, with DME Securities, to find out why we're seeing this sell off today?</p><p>ALAN VALDES, DME SECURITIES: Well, you know, we knew coming into the market, this morning, we looked at the markets in Asia last night. They were selling off. Look like things are getting a little weaker in China. Europe, this morning, they got a big bill due tomorrow-Thursday, rather-of $545 billion, the banks have loans repayment. Hedge traders a little worried. This morning consumer confidence, here in America, all of weighing on the market right across the board, but from the get-go the market was down. Right from the opening bell, we were down 100 points.</p><p>KOSIK: Are we in for a bounce back? I mean, could we see a bounce back tomorrow, with such a plunge today?</p><p>VALDES: Well, you know we hope so, as traders, because we are a superstitious lot. Tomorrow is the end of the half, end of the first six months. Historically, the way the market closes tomorrow will be the way we finish the year. So, right now the Dow is down about 2.8 percent. If we close tomorrow on the downside, we could be in for a tough year ahead.</p><p>KOSIK: You know, there's been a lot of talk about a double dip recession. I mean, we're getting a lot of down beat economic reports, day after day. Are we really in for another recession?</p><p>VALDES: I don't think we'll go double-dip. I think you may see the market contract, maybe down another 8,500, 9,000, in that range; which would be bad enough. I don't think we'll double dip. I think you'll see earnings season be pretty good. I think we'll grind things out, but at the end of the day. It is all about jobs. And jobs have not changed at all. Friday we got a big jobs number and that is going to be a turning point. We'll see where that goes.</p><p>KOSIK: Well, what is it going to take to turn the markets around?</p><p>VALDES: Well, you know right now this administration has lost more jobs than Herbert Hoover. We've lost 4.4 million jobs since Obama has been elected. We have to turn that around. Some way we have to get that turned around. If you look at the U6, that is the under-employed jobs. I mean, that is on the rise. That is 16.6. Last year at this time it was a little lower. Those are the people who were making $30,000 last year and are making $15,000 this year. So that is weighing on the market, too. It's just not the quality jobs out there.</p><p>KOSIK: And there is, once again, the fear about the Friday jobs report?</p><p>VALDES: That's right that is a big number coming out. Again, that is going to kick off the next half and we'll watch that number real closely.</p><p>KOSIK: All right. We'll have to wait and see what happens. But once again, you know what, Adrian, it always comes down to jobs, doesn't it? To bring back that confidence that we lost in June, Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: It does indeed, Alison. Many thanks indeed.</p><p>KOSIK: You've got it.</p><p>FINIGHAN: We'll check back on Wall Street throughout the hour to keep you up to date with what's happening there.</p><p>Well, stock markets here in Europe were on the ropes after the close, a brutal session today. There is deep concern about what will happen when a lifeline for banks expires this week and that is only one of several negatives today. Let's take a look at how things ended.</p><p>All the main markets plunged, every stock on each one of those indices lost value. The FTSE 100 at an eight-month low. Mining, metal stocks, down because of worries about weaker global demand. The big four, that's Rio Tinto, Xstrata (ph), Oslo Metal (ph), Piece &amp; Krupp (ph). Airlines were weak today, British Airways, Lufthansa. Banks, too, Barclays down 6.3 percent, Greddy Agricola down nearly 8 percent in Paris, also BNP Paribas, and Societe Generale, all down. It is payback time for European banks, this week they must repay about $540 billion worth, extraordinary loans to the ECB.</p><p>This will reveal just how much banks still rely on low rate loans from the central bank. Will there be cash flow problems? Even a new credit crunch? That's what the markets are worried about today. Now, banking stocks were hit particularly hard in Spain, Portugal and Greece today. Banks there, of course, could face greater problems getting funds because of their exposure to weak economies, markets and people reluctant to lend, of course. Even on a day like today, you know, we're seeing some signs of optimism though, about the Euro Zone. Some people still think that things are going to get better, according to the European Union. It is economic sentiment indicator, that is a measure of the mood, is rising in the single currency area. It edged higher in June by just a fraction to 98.7, from 98.4, back in May. Now that was contrary to expectations. Consumer confidence is also up in the Euro Zone, by 1 point, on the EU index.</p><p>Well, earlier today I spoke with Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize- winning economist and a professor at Columbia University. I asked him, if he thinks the EU is right to end its emergency loan program on Thursday this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSEPH STIGLITZ, PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: I think it is very similar to the problems that are true about fiscal policy. It is premature to remove the support for fiscal policies and it is almost surely premature to remove the support for the banking system. We are not yet on the basis of a robust recovery. And particularly, as the fiscal policies undermine the recovery, there is a serious risk of a double-dip. And it is not a surprise to me that there is a high level of anxiety on the part of the banks.</p><p>FINIGHAN: I know that you are no fan of Chancellor George Osborne's budget, here in the U.K., last week. Do you think that by implementing cuts, more cuts, austerity measures here in Europe, in particular, we're in danger of repeating Herbert Hoover's 1929 mistake, when he turned the Wall Street crash into the Great Recession (sic).</p><p>STIGLITZ: Precisely, that is exactly-we have ample evidence on this. I mean, Hoover, we call these Hooverite policies, in honor of Herbert Hoover. But the IMF has done that same experiment in Indonesia, Korea, Thailand, Argentina, so we know what is almost surely likely to have happened, and that is, fiscal contraction.</p><p>FINIGHAN: But surely-</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>STIGLITZ: It's understandable that countries are worried about the debt, but there are ways to respond to that, that are not so short-sighted.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, give me some indication of what those ways might be. Surely, governments can't spend their way out of a recession? They can't keep spending money that haven't got.</p><p>STIGLITZ: Well, what you have to do is change the strategy, both the composition of expenditures, and the structure of taxes. So, let me give you an example. If, in the United States, for instance, we spent less money on the military, on weapons that don't work against enemies that don't exist, on a war in Afghanistan that is failing, and take that same money and invest it at home. We will stimulate the economy more. We could then cut back a little bit on expenditure and have the same level of fiscal support.</p><p>But what that will mean is that because the economy will be growing on the basis of this productive investment. Taxes revenues will be coming in, both in the short run, and in the long run. And the result of that is that the long-term national debt will be lower. So, you can't look at this in a very short-sighted way. You really-what is of concern is not the debt today or tomorrow, the concern is the debt 10 years or 15 years from now. And these investment strategies are the way out of this particular conundrum that we've gotten ourselves into.</p><p>FINIGHAN: One final question, here. You're the man credited with having foreseen, predicted this recession. You are far too modest a man to say, well, I told you so. But what have you learned? Has your economic philosophy, if you like, changed or been tweaked as a result of what we've been through over the last two years, 18 months?</p><p>STIGLITZ: So far things have come along pretty much as I had predicted. And, in fact, I think the crisis is a real reinforcement for the kinds of economic theories that I had been developing over a long period of time. And standing on the shoulders of great economists, like Keynes, modifying it as the economy has changed.</p><p>So, there is a wide body of research that had actually anticipated this. But it wasn't the mainstream. The mainstream in the economics profession, quite frankly, said that bubbles don't exist, markets are efficient. Bubbles can't exist because markets are efficient. That is why you ought to deregulate, and if there was a problem the markets will be self-correcting. Well, we know pretty well not that that is not true.</p><p>And the challenge going forward is, two-fold, how to prevent the recurrence, and that is where regulatory reform is very important, but really the main challenge right now is how to get our economies going again. And unfortunately, the same mindset that brought us into the crisis, the same mindset of the financial markets, that had this belief in unfettered markets, that got us into the mess, are now dictating that austerity measures that will just make thing worse. We have so much evidence on this, I hope this is an exception, but I wouldn't bet on it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FINIGHAN: Professor Joseph Stiglitz who is currently here in the U.K.</p><p>Well, it is turning into a summer of strikes in Spain and Greece. Riot police are back on the streets of Athens, as protests over spending cuts turn to anger. We'll take you live to Greece for a look at what's been happening today.</p><p>FINIGHAN: A fresh wave of strikes is underway in Europe as austerity bites. Police in Athens clashed with protestors as lawmakers debated a new round of spending cuts. Many public services ground to a halt in the country's fifth general strike this year. Let's go straight over to Athens now. Elinda Labrapolou joins us live via broadband.</p><p>So, it turned violent on the streets once again, Elinda?</p><p>ELINDA LABRAPOLOU, CNN INT'L. CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it did turn violent again. This is the fifth general strike we've had this year. We did have less people turning up, however, than we had until now. So, you could say, in a way that things are calming down. But what is being debated in Parliament at the moment, the pension reforms bill, is something that touches a lot of people. So, over 10,000 people took to the streets today, protesting, being angry. About, you know, their retirement age is changing. It is getting-they'll have to retire when they're older. They are getting a lot of benefit cuts, their pensions are being slashed. So that led a lot of people to the streets once again.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Plus the argument that pensions and conditions for people are being changed right across Europe at the moment. Austerity measures are being implemented wherever you look. Does that argument cut any sway with people there in Greece?</p><p>LABRAPOLOU: Well, it does up to a point, but then people look at things on a personal level and they see how it affects them. And they realize that with the new austerity measures that we've had, where the VAT tax on alcohol, tobacco, fuel has been raised. A lot of other things have gone up. They just can't make ends meet. So to most people being asked to give more is just not something that they're prepared to put up with.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Of course, Greece relies heavily upon its tourism industry. We're just a few weeks now from the peak of the season. Are people there not at all concerned that this kind of violent protest is likely to put people off coming to Greece and spending money that the country desperately needs?</p><p>LABRAPOLOU: A lot of people are very much concerned about that. Tourism figures are much lower this year. They're 12 percent down. The tourism industry amounts for about 20 percent of GDP, and one in five jobs. So it is an industry that affects a lot of people. But again, on a personal level, when people realize that they're touched directly by these measures, they're just not prepared to put up with them. So, they realize that it might affect the whole country, but they're just not prepared to put up with it.</p><p>FINIGHAN: And people who work in the tourism industry, they're taking action, themselves, tomorrow?</p><p>LABRAPOLOU: Yes, they're holding a separate strike tomorrow. This is just people in the tourism industry. So that is also going to affect services and obviously for someone who is here on holiday for a short while, you know, you have a general strike on one day. You're not quite sure what works, what doesn't. The same thing happens the following day. It makes it more and more difficult to convince people to come to Greece.</p><p>FINIGHAN: All right, Elinda, many thanks indeed. Elinda Labrapolou, there, speaking live from Athens, via broadband.</p><p>At the other side of the Med, there were signs on the streets of Madrid today that Spain's pretty unhappy with austerity, too. There was traffic chaos in the Spanish capitol, for the second day running. Metro workers went on strike over a 5 percent cut in public sector pay. Today's action closed the entire subway network. Around 2.5 million people had to find other means of getting to and from work. Metro staff are planning another walk out for tomorrow.</p><p>Well, Spanish football fans have plenty to distract them, thank goodness. We're moments away from a crucial match in the World Cup. We'll have more on that in just a moment.</p><p>FINIGHAN: So, a couple of hours ago, Paraguay booked their place in the last days of the World Cup by beating Japan. It was the first match at this tournament to end in a penalty shootout, when the game ended goal after extra time.</p><p>There is one more slot to fill in the quarter finals. And both Spain and Portugal want it. CNN's Alex Thomas joins us now live from Johannesburg, with a round up of all today's action.</p><p>And, Alex, what's being said about giving referees some extra help? I assume that is referring to controversial decisions. That affected both England and Mexico.</p><p>ALEX THOMAS, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: You are absolutely right, Adrian. Let's take you through the World Cup action so far on this Tuesday. The pen ultimate of the round of sixteen matches, it took place in Pretoria, at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium.</p><p>This is what happened. Paraguay with the majority of the possession for most of the game, and their best opportunity-or one of them-came as early as the 20th minute. Luca Barrios with a shot that forced Japan's goalkeeper to make a good save. Later in the first half, a chance for Japan as well, Diasuke Matsui rattling the crossbar with a curling shot from about 20 yards away-I thought we were going to show you some of the video action, that's why I was reading it off my black read. But clearly, we're having a big of problems with that.</p><p>It all boiled down to a penalty shootout, Adrian. Five kicks apiece at the end. The third Japanese spot kick taker hit the cross bar, didn't score. Paraguay scored their last two penalties and it meant that Paraguay goes through, 5-3 on penalties. The first shootout in this World Cup so far.</p><p>Paraguay moves (ph) to the last eight for the first time in their history, Adrian, and denying Japan the same achievement, Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, you've got to feel sorry for Japan, really. It's never good to go out in a penalty shootout, Alex. Of course, we've got Portugal and Spain in just a moment. We are going to talk to Al Goodman, who is in Spain, about that match in just a moment. That's I should imagine fairly, it's quite a tight match up, isn't it?</p><p>Let's talk about that, that-those controversial decisions that affected both England and Mexico. Seth Blatter has been talking today about the possibility of looking into introducing goal-line technology?</p><p>THOMAS: That's right, Adrian. It was a news conference that was scheduled before Sunday's matches, between England and Germany, and Argentina and Mexico. And we can all recall that during those games there were two glaring referee errors. Frank Rampart scored a legitimate goal that disallowed. And in the Argentina game, Carlos Tevez's first goal for Argentina should have been ruled offside, but it wasn't. That one was allowed.</p><p>So, massive refereeing mistakes. FIFA have been hammered in the world's media for the last 48 hours. So, President Seth Blatter used today's press conference, as I said, scheduled before the controversies, to apologize to the football associations of both England and Mexico. We should stress that those dodgy refereeing decisions didn't affect the results. Germany and Argentina went through fairly and squarely. Nonetheless a huge embarrassment for world football's governing body.</p><p>And Blatter, as well as the apology, also promised to look again at the possibility of using goal-line technology in a meeting that is scheduled for Wales next month. So maybe it will be introduced in time for the next World Cup. They certainly won't change their stance for this tournament. They've got to keep the rules consistent throughout. It's all about Blatter, Adrian, has ruled out the use of wholesale video replay like you get in other sports. It is just particularly talking about the goal- line technology, whether the ball has crossed the line or not.</p><p>FINIGHAN: I'm sure, Alex, that many people here in England would agree with you there, that England were beaten fairly and squarely. But, Alex Thomas, many thanks indeed. We'll talk to you again soon.</p><p>So, in what, eight minutes' time, Portugal kick offs against their neighbor, Spain. At stake, of course, is that last birth in the quarter finals of the World Cup, as well as a load of national pride. CNN's Al Goodman is in Madrid, no doubt which side he'll be cheering for tonight.</p><p>But, Al, you speak to, um, you speak to anyone in Portugal in Spanish and they're not best pleased; and the same in Spain, there, if you try to talk to someone in Portuguese. Even though they are neighbors there is not love lost between the two countries, is there?</p><p>AL GOODMAN, CNN INT'L. CORRESPONDENT: Not really, especially, on this day, Adrian. Actually, I am on the Spanish/Portuguese border in the town of Batahothe (ph). We've been across the border that way, through Portugal, to the town of Elvis (ph). So both sides are predicting victory and this is a really important day because both of these countries have deep economic problems. They are on the watch list, if you will, of the international ratings agencies; a lot of attention on the economic problems of Portugal and Spain. But this day, the attention is all on this TV screen here in this bar in Batahothe (ph) Spain, and on TV screens like this all across the country. So, both sides predicting victory; these teams have a historic rivalry, they know each other well. We're going to see who is going to come out ahead, Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, it is a chance for people to put their economic woes behind them. Just for what, 90 minutes tonight. How would you describe the atmosphere? You talk about the rivalry between the two neighboring nations? How nasty does that get? Or is it just friendly rivalry?</p><p>GOODMAN: Well, in football it is not exactly a friendly rivalry. And Spain has the upper hand in the matches overall, 15 victories, five losses. But notably they have had 12 ties. Now Spain, of course, is the much bigger economy. Portuguese is always feeling pushed, if you will-I think that is a fair assessment-by their Spanish neighbors on a number of fronts. Certainly economically, and here, this certainly for Portugal a chance to show pride and come back against the bigger more powerful neighbor next door.</p><p>But for Spain, they are the perennial underachievers in the World Cup. They have gone home many times, very early. Everybody thinks they might actually have a chance to get far this time. This is the toughest game they will have faced this tournament, Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Al, you've got a great job tonight. I'm really envious. Enjoy the match, tonight, won't you? And enjoy the atmosphere there, on the border between Spain and Portugal. Al Goodman, there.</p><p>And Al alluded to it just a moment or two ago, that the strength of the two economies there. Let's take a more detailed look at both of them in the Economic World Cup.</p><p>So, let's join Jim Boulden, once again, to see who would win if it wasn't the players, but the economies of Spain and Portugal that were head to head.</p><p>Al, sort of touched upon it there, a moment.</p><p>JIM BOULDEN, CNN INT'L. CORRESPONDENT: Yes, sure.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Of course, that Spain, you would think, being the larger country has a bigger economy. But it's in trouble. Both economies are in trouble.</p><p>BOULDEN: It is in trouble, but it is in more trouble than Portugal, to be honest with you. If you think of Spanish unemployment at 20 percent, and GDP growth negative expected this year; unemployment, as we said, you know, 20 percent. And budget deficits near 10 percent. None of those figures in Portugal come close to that. They're all-it's all better in Portugal. The unemployment rate about half of that. They are expecting growth in Portugal this year. And the budget deficit is nowhere near as bad, even though the banks are always confident (ph). And this is what Portugal always likes to say, don't put a brush on us from Spain.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes.</p><p>BOULDEN: We're not the same.</p><p>FINIGHAN: OK, if we were talking about the strength of the economies it's Portugal that has the upper hand?</p><p>BOULDEN: This year, Portugal. Absolutely.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: What's all this we're hearing about the Portugal, though, being perhaps the next Greece, the next Ireland, perhaps.</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Why are we talking about Portugal in that way, and not so much Spain?</p><p>BOULDEN: Well, Spain, the Spanish banks seem to be-have invested a lot and the worry is the amount of debt they have from place like Greece.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Correct (ph).</p><p>BOULDEN: So there is a real worry about the Spanish banks, but the Spanish government constantly says our banks are not a bad as people think. They're going to do a stress test. And we're going to hear very soon, Spain says. We'll see where the banks stand. But Spain has been very transparent about that.</p><p>Portugal is a much, much smaller economy. So they're not having as much exposure like the big, big Spanish banks.</p><p>FINIGHAN: OK, who would you be rooting for tonight, then, Jim?</p><p>BOULDEN: I would have said, before the tournament, that Spain was my favorite. I still say it is my favorite, but not economically.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Really? Ah, I'm going for Portugal. Love-as a man who holidays in Portugal, takes a vacation there, most years, it has got to be Portugal, of course.</p><p>What about the earlier game we saw today? Paraguay-poor Japan, going out on penalties.</p><p>BOULDEN: Well, some country had to be the first one to go out on penalties, it was Japan. Believe it or not, I'm going to say, Paraguay.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yeah?</p><p>BOULDEN: I'm going to say it for economic reasons.</p><p>FINIGHAN: What?</p><p>BOULDEN: And you are going to say you seem crazy.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Hang on? Yeah?</p><p>BOULDEN: Yes, well, let's get the numbers.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Jim Boulden, you're crazy.</p><p>BOULDEN: The budget deficit, Paraguay, a fraction of the budget deficit problems in Japan right now.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Really?</p><p>BOULDEN: GDP growth, because it's a small country, South America, and it's neighbor Brazil. Its biggest export partner is Brazil, so it is doing well.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: It's got a GDP growth anywhere between 4 and 6 percent this year.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Right.</p><p>BOULDEN: Japan, of course, had well, all the Western nations have a problem in the last year. Now officially, unemployment rate, 5.7 percent in Paraguay. Officially, in Japan, 5.2 percent.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Oh, right.</p><p>BOULDEN: Now, officially Paraguay's unemployment rate isn't much worse. We're not talking about the informal economy here.</p><p>FINIGHAN: So, it is Paraguay on potential, perhaps, then?</p><p>BOULDEN: Yeah.</p><p>FINIGHAN: OK. All right. Jim, many thanks indeed.</p><p>We want to know how you are combining doing a days' work and actually following the World Cup. I'm sure that many of you are managing to juggle the two of them.

So why are so many investors interested? We'll tell you why, right after this.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Welcome back live from London this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. In for Richard Quest, I'm Adrian Finighan. Let's get a check right now of the main news headlines at this hour.</p><p>(NEWSBREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN: Welcome back.</p><p>Live from London, this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>In for Richard Quest, I'm Adrian Finighan.</p><p>Let's get a check right now of the main news headlines at this hour.</p><p>Russia's foreign ministry is rejecting U.S. claims that it's uncovered a cold war-style espionage ring. Ten people have been arrested in the United States, another in Cypress, on suspicion that they were Russian agents on a long-term mission to spy on the U.S. government.</p><p>Russia calls the allegations \"unfounded,\" saying that the suspects never harmed U.S. interests.</p><p>The general tapped to become the next top U.S. commander in Afghanistan says he agrees with President Barack Obama's time line for troop withdrawal. David Petraeus is testifying before a Senate committee today. He's expected to easily win confirmation to replace General Stanley McChrystal, who was forced to resign over critical comments about the Obama administration.</p><p>Well, Barack Obama is hosting Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah at the White House this hour. The two leaders are expected to discuss Israel's plan to further Jewish settlements on occupied land and Iran's nuclear program. Talks between the Saudi king and the president come ahead of a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's due in Washington next week.</p><p>Rescuers are searching for more than 100 people buried in a mudslide in Southwestern China. According to state media, the first body, a child, was pulled from the rubble today. Hopes of finding any survivors are slim. Heavy rains triggered the mudslide, but there are still showers in the area.</p><p>Well, big losses on Wall Street today, as we've been reporting. And it's just the same for just about any U.S. stock you care to name, except one. Shares of the electric car maker Tesla Motors are up by about 12 percent. They're making their debut on the Nasdaq today.</p><p>Now, the company has yet to make a -- a profit, even for a single quarter. But that didn't stop investors handing over more than $220 million in the initial public offering. The company sold the stock for $17 a share. That's higher than the range it previously indicated after demand was stronger than expected.</p><p>And it made a little bit of history. It's the first public listing of a car maker in the state since Ford back in 1956.</p><p>But the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, is reluctant to call the company a traditional car maker. Musk was a co-founder of the -- the company, having earlier got PayPal, the electronic payment system, off the ground. He says in the way Tesla operates, it's got more in common with Apple or Google than Ford and GM.</p><p>Well, the road certainly hasn't been smooth for the man who provided much of the funding for Tesla. He's poured millions of dollars of his own money into Tesla.</p><p>Let's go live to CNNMoney.com, the newsroom there.</p><p>Poppy Harlow joins us live -- and, Poppy, he must -- he must have faith in his product there, to pour so much money into it.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, ANCHOR, CNNMONEY.COM: You can say that again. His name, Elon Musk. You know, it's very interesting that he relates his company to Google or Apple. Larry Paige and Sergey Brin of Google poured money, also, into Tesla. They're betting on its success.</p><p>But a big, big day, the company going public in New York, going public at about $17 a share, trading much higher, trading around $20.50. So a nice boost for that stock today.</p><p>I talked to the CEO, Elon Musk, right outside of the Nasdaq, along with all of those Tesla cars there. Beautiful. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: Elon, a huge day for Tesla, the company going public.</p><p>Why now?</p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: Well, a -- a number of reasons. We actually don't need (INAUDIBLE) proceeds for the Model S (INAUDIBLE) in production. A lot of people think we do, but that's -- that's actually taken care of with the DOE loan and with the pre-existing investment.</p><p>HARLOW: This is the Model S, by the way, folks.</p><p>MUSK: This is the Model S, right.</p><p>HARLOW: Rolling out in 2012.</p><p>MUSK: Right. The reason for the IPO was actually to raise funds for parallel development of some additional variations on the Model S platform, to give us a little bit of additional cushion in case the Model S takes longer than expected and -- and also to provide some small amount of liquidity for myself and others in -- that are in the IPR.</p><p>I'm only selling 5 percent of my holdings and I don't intend to sell anymore, to be clear.</p><p>HARLOW: And that's part of the -- part of the DOE agreement, you have to hold onto about 65 percent, correct?</p><p>MUSK: Yes, of my holdings, yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Of your holdings.</p><p>All right, let's talk about the Model S. This is the -- it's going to cost about half of what the Roadster costs.</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: About $50,000.</p><p>MUSK: Correct.</p><p>HARLOW: The goal is to have this roll out in 2012.</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: But you just said in case it takes longer than expected. That's a really aggressive time line.</p><p>I mean, do you really think that you can get these out and running, 20,000 of them, by 2012, as -- as the hope is?</p><p>MUSK: We intend to start production in mid-2012. It always takes a little bit of time to (INAUDIBLE) up the production line. So we expect to get the 20,000 unit a year run rate by early 2015.</p><p>HARLOW: OK.</p><p>MUSK: So 2013 will be the first year where we do the 20,000 units.</p><p>HARLOW: It's good -- it's good to clear that up for a lot of folks. Looking at -- at Tesla, this is a startup company. Like many startup companies, you lose money.</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: The company has lost about $260 million since its inception.</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: You're going public. You want the public to invest in Tesla.</p><p>What can you say to reassure investors that might have questions about the potential profitability here?</p><p>MUSK: Well, yes. We -- we do often do get that question. The -- the thing that's important to bear in mind is that if Tesla just -- were just decided to be a -- a spore scar company and sell power trains to -- to other -- other companies like to the -- to Daimler and to Toyota, we would be profitable. That's an important consideration.</p><p>However, we're choosing not to do that. We're choosing, instead, to reinvest those profits and raise additional money to increase the -- the production volume and -- and produce the Model S, which is 30 times more production volume, maybe 40 times more production volume than -- than the - - than our sport scar. And it's just impossible, if you're going through that kind of growth, to -- to remain profitable as a whole.</p><p>HARLOW: And up here we have the Roadster, right?</p><p>MUSK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Are you going to stop making the Roadster in 2011?</p><p>MUSK: (INAUDIBLE) the Roadster does give us the -- a good, good time, a good -- good production run-up of -- of the Roadster. We feel comfortable stopping that first generation and actually making it much more of a collective item, as well. So when -- when people are buying a car...</p><p>HARLOW: I think what you're trying to do here, you'll make a ton of them so they get in the -- you know, people want them even more.</p><p>MUSK: Well, I think, you know, I think there is some scarcity value. And it's sort of like imagine if you had the opportunity to own the first Porsche, you know, or the first Mercedes or the first Ferrari or something like that.</p><p>HARLOW: Is this what you see Tesla becoming, as big as Ferrari?</p><p>MUSK: Well, I think -- I think much bigger than Ferrari but -- and -- and hopefully bigger than Porsche.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: A ways to go there before it is bigger than Porsche, Adrian. Of course, as you said, they first need to turn a profit. I asked him, when will Tesla turn a profit. He wouldn't comment on that.</p><p>I'll tell you, though, Tesla has this cool factor that a lot of car companies out there -- especially electric car makers, just don't have.</p><p>And I'll end it on this little note. What's very interesting, you may have seen Elon Musk, that CEO, in \"Iron Man 2.\" Apparently, Robert Downey, Jr. called him up himself and asked him to be in that movie.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Oh, wow!</p><p>HARLOW: Back to you -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Bigger than Ferrari, bigger than Porsche, well, we'll wait and see.</p><p>HARLOW: I know.</p><p>FINIGHAN: I was going to ask you, did he get to drive it?</p><p>But given the traffic that was out there in Manhattan, perhaps -- perhaps it wouldn't have been much fun.</p><p>But, no, Jim Boulden was in here earlier saying oh, he's driven one. Oh, yes, fine. But he -- he just -- I don't know, the image isn't right. You know, you'd look great in a Tesla.</p><p>Would you buy one, is the question?</p><p>HARLOW: I -- I've driven...</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes?</p><p>HARLOW: If I -- if I had $100,000 spare cash, yes, I would buy one. I actually have driven one a few months ago at this electric car race. It's amazing the pickup -- very, very fast. It's -- it feels like a Porsche, I'll give him that...</p><p>FINIGHAN: You'd better start saving...</p><p>HARLOW: -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: You'd better start saving up, Poppy.</p><p>Many thanks, indeed.</p><p>HARLOW: I know.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Poppy Harlow live at CNNMoney.com.</p><p>Now, for most U.S. car companies, home could only ever be Detroit, Michigan. But not Tesla. This is one automaker the originated far from Motor City. It's based in Silicon Valley, home of the big tech titans. Tesla Design isn't too far away from Google's headquarters. And by basing itself there, the company is going for a high tech image. Who knows, it might even be good for business.</p><p>Well, just around the corner in Silicon Valley, Google itself being accused of backing down in its censorship battle with China. The search engine announced a new strategy that it hopes will keep its Chinese Web site up and running.</p><p>But the technique isn't going down so well in the U.S. tech community.</p><p>Maggie Lake joins us now live from New York with the latest on that -- hey, Maggie.</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Adrian.</p><p>You know, this is a very small step for a very large tech company and a very large and growing population of Internet users.</p><p>But, you know, if actions speak louder than words, pant very happy with Google today.</p><p>When users in China go to Google's home page that you're looking at right here on Google.cn, instead of being automatically directed to Google Hong Kong, they're going to have to click that site there that you see first, that will then transport them to the Google Hong Kong page.</p><p>Now, that's interesting because it's a softening of the harder line that Google had taken earlier this year, when it moved its servers to Hong Kong, announced it was going to stop censoring results and automatically redirect those users, which is what it's been doing.</p><p>Now, at that time, you'll remember, the company complained of cyber attacks aimed at accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents and they expressed concern on their Web site about the, quote, \"security and human rights implications.\" You know, using some pretty bold language.</p><p>Well, on the company's Web site today, Google's chief legal officer, David Drummond, addressed this change in tact, saying this. Quote, \"Without an ICP license, we cannot operate a commercial Web site like Google.cn. That's a prospect dreaded by many of our Chinese users, who have been very vocal about their desire to keep Google.cn alive.\"</p><p>So the company very much painting this as a necessary trade-off. But, tech watchers out there aren't really buying that. They say there are some other motivations going on, it's not really about protecting Chinese users, but about Google's bottom line.</p><p>Might -- Mitch Wagner, for example, blogging for \"Computer World,\" has this to say in response: \"Maybe it's not about choosing good or evil. Maybe it's just about the money. China is, after all, a market of a billion people, most of whom have yet to get Internet access. Google stands to reap vast wealth in that market. Maybe that wealth is more important to Google than defending freedom.\"</p><p>So the company really taking a bit of a hit on this. They were seen says -- you know, before as really standing up to China. So it's -- it is having a little bit of impact on that. And it's interesting, it's not clear whether it's going to be worth it not, not so whether this tweak is going to go far enough to impress the Chinese regulators. We haven't heard word from China and Google not really commenting on it any further, as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google's stock down about 3 percent today. But, of course, it is down in an overall terrible market here in the U.S. -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, it is.</p><p>But Google isn't the only high tech firm to -- to have faced this dilemma, is it?</p><p>LAKE: No, it's not. I mean, certainly they've all come across this. And when it comes to censoring the results, it's -- it's been a big issue. Yahoo! in particular, has had a lot of problems in the past with this. They've also come under a lot of criticism.</p><p>I think the difference here, though -- and you caught it in that comment from that one tech blogger -- is that Google really sort of put forth this -- this idea that they're different from everybody else, they're the maverick. They have that, you know, do no evil sort of quote that's been widely interpreted.</p><p>So the feeling was that they were going to behave a little differently, they were going to make a stand and show everyone else how -- how to act. I mean that's really kind of their reputation. And so by backpedaling just a little bit, it's really seen as caving. In fact, our own Web site saying, you know, the search engine blinked in the face of Chinese censorship.</p><p>So it's -- they're not alone and that's why a lot of these tech companies have been calling on there to be an issue -- an international standard, because no one wants to be the first one to pull out and potentially lose that lucrative business. But that has human rights watchers, as well as tech watchers, crying foul and saying, hey, this is all about the money. Don't try to say it's anything else.</p><p>So they're not the only ones, but because they set themselves apart a little bit differently, I think they're coming -- being called to the mat a little bit more on this. We'll see. It's the early days. We'll see China's reaction. We'll see if Google has anything else to say about it on its Web site -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Yes, the early days, as you say. It will be interesting to see how it pans out.</p><p>Maggie, many thanks, indeed.</p><p>Maggie Lake live in New York.</p><p>Now, it's already dealing with an oil disaster, a huge drain on its funds and a storm of criticism. And now, BP faces the real thing, as a hurricane gathers speed off the coast of Mexico. We'll have the latest in just a moment.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Hello again.</p><p>Now, the disaster in the Gulf shows not only potential mistakes made by BP, a U.S. government agency also, perhaps, share some of the blame.</p><p>CNN's Joe Johns reports now on how loopholes can help lead to disaster.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Before it ever began drilling out in the Gulf, BP got an extraordinary gift from the government. The agency that regulates offshore oil exploration declared it didn't believe the Deepwater Horizon would cause any environmental damage, so BP deserved a pass. BP would not be required to comply with a tough law that would have forced the oil giant to fully assess what risks its rig might pose to the environment.</p><p>KIERAN SUCKLING, CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY: The whole thing is a mess.</p><p>JOHNS (on camera): Because it got this pass, here's what BP did not have to do.</p><p>It didn't have to produce specific information on the equipment that it was using or the place where it was drilling.</p><p>And BP didn't have to answer this question -- could there be a serious accident affecting the environment?</p><p>In other words, BP got to skip what would have been the toughest and final environmental review it would face before drilling.</p><p>(voice-over) That final environmental review would have taken time. It would have itemized in detail all the things that could go wrong and how that could hurt the environment. And that would almost certainly have delayed final approval to drill.</p><p>(on camera) Instead, BP got that pass from the agency at the Interior Department that's supposed to regulate it.</p><p>But Keeping Them Honest, as bad as all this sounds, it gets worse. It isn't just BP and Deepwater Horizon. In fact, most oil companies working in the Gulf get that same pass. That means of the hundreds of oil projects operating today in the Gulf, most got to skip that final critical environmental review.</p><p>SUCKLING: So the whole system is broken. It's not about BP having some individualized way of gaming the system. The oil industry has gamed the entire system from top to bottom.</p><p>JOHNS: Documents supplied to Congressional investigators by that Interior Department agency, the MMS, show that since President Obama took office, 254 oil development plans and 226 exploration plans in the Gulf were approved without the final environmental review.</p><p>The documents also show that every administration dating back to the first President Bush used the loophole. And they actually used it more often than Obama.</p><p>Now, though, it could end.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're closing the loophole that has allowed some oil companies to bypass some critical environmental reviews.</p><p>JOHNS: But even if the administration closes the loophole, what about all those other projects currently operating in the Gulf?</p><p>SUCKLING: You really need to go back and redo that entire decision to allow it in the first place. Instead, what's happening is the Department of Interior is allowing those bad decisions to stand, then trying to kind of come in around the back and fix it with safety inspections. And that's just not good enough. You've really got to go back to square one on this stuff.</p><p>JOHNS (voice-over): But sometimes starting over is hard to do, especially if you've already gotten the lease, leased the rig and hired the crew.</p><p>Eric Milito is with the American Petroleum Institute.</p><p>ERIC MILITO, AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE: You don't want to hurt that industry any more. You want to protect the jobs that are down there. And this industry provides a lot of economic input and a lot jobs to that - - that Gulf region.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>JOHNS: There are other environmental reviews prior to this final one BP and others did not have to pass, but none as rigorous. In fact, the law allows 30 days for this review. But given the slow pace of government bureaucracy, no one really thinks they could get done in 30 days. And that's another reason why the agency gave BP the pass.</p><p>(voice-over): The Interior Department won't comment because of pending litigation, but now the whole process is being reexamined by the White House -- too late to help the Gulf.</p><p>Joe Johns, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>FINIGHAN: And, of course, there's a storm brewing in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>Guillermo was telling us last night the next couple of days will be crucial in determining...</p><p>GUILLERMO ARDUINO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes.</p><p>FINIGHAN: -- what this storm actually becomes, whether it turns into a full blown hurricane, and, of course, the direction.</p><p>He's here with an update right now -- Guillermo.</p><p>ARDUINO: Here we see the perspective from Central America. This is the Gulf of Mexico. You see how wide it is. It's becoming a hurricane. It's not a hurricane yet. In any case, it's going to be a powerful storm.</p><p>And things are not changing. As far as we see, the National Hurricane Center continues with the same forecast, making landfall on Thursday of this system into the Tamaulipas state here of Mexico. That's south of Texas. And this red line is the National Hurricane Center forecast. The other ones are computer models.</p><p>So we are interested to see if there are -- there is a number of models that take the cyclone into the east, but there's no actually such thing.</p><p>Now, where we see the prevailing tracks of cyclones in the month of June, we see that actually we have the very cyclone that caused the problems in Yucatan is pretty much following the path of what we see in this time of the year.</p><p>So any time within hours, it's going to become a hurricane. It is very close to it. You see seven kilometers shy of being a hurricane. And we're talking about the maximum sustained winds that at 120 it becomes a hurricane.</p><p>And then, in 40 -- within that time frame and before the 48 hour period, it is expected to make landfall. An abundant amount of rain in the area and also intense winds.</p><p>The effects on the Gulf, Adrian, though, is the effect that it would have with waves and winds on the booms that would be either overtopped or breached because of all the movement there, the swell and all the intense winds.</p><p>Some thunderstorms in the area that these are causing.</p><p>But let's talk about your nice weather. Britain looking great. I see the London forecast. I mean I'm so sorry that Richard is not here, because I love giving him good news, you know, concerning the weather.</p><p>But we're going to see the bad weather into the Ukraine and Moldova section and northern parts of Romania. It's going to continue to be warm and nice in Britain. I think that 27 degrees or so in the next days with sunny skies. That's exclusively for Adrian Finighan.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Thank you, my friend.</p><p>It's always nice to -- to see you. Always nice to get good news.</p><p>We'll see you again.</p><p>ARDUINO: It is.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Guillermo, many thanks.</p><p>Crime doesn't pay, unless, of course, you're in the business of security.</p><p>And at the World Cup, of course, security is big business.</p><p>We'll tell you more in just a moment.</p><p>FINIGHAN: Well, in Capetown right now, Spain and Portugal are fighting for a place in the World Cup quarterfinals. Off the pitch, we're looking at the big business stories in South Africa.</p><p>CNN's Nkepile Mabuse reports now on South Africa's private security industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NKEPILE MABUSE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):</p><p>As crime as burgeoned in South Africa, so has the business of crime prevention. The country now has two private security guards for every policeman, with the industry's annual turnover estimated at more than $6 billion.</p><p>(on camera): So business has been good in the past few years, hasn't it?</p><p>NEVILLE ROTHFUSZ, CHUBB SECURITY: Yes. It has been good.</p><p>MABUSE (voice-over): Neville Rothfusz manages one of the country's biggest private security firms.</p><p>(on camera): In essence, high crime levels mean very good business for you?</p><p>ROTHFUSZ: Well, crime, obviously, is a driver of business for us. But the -- there are other reasons for that, as well, from -- from the insurance companies insisting that you have some form of cover, from a non- response company or a burglar alarm or something like that. So there's a lot of -- it's not only the crime that drives that, but there's obviously some -- some commercial businesses that depend on us to -- to kind of minimize the risk for them.</p><p>MABUSE (voice-over): Despite the rapid growth of South Africa's private army, crime levels have continued to rise. House robberies have increased by more than 100 percent in the past five years, from about 9,000 in 2005 to more than 18,000 last year. Attacks on businesses have gone up by even more, from about 3,000 in 2005 to nearly 14,000 in 2009.</p><p>While the numbers might indicate otherwise, private security companies continue to defend their role in crime prevention.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) can you just (INAUDIBLE) six, seven of those numbers (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>ROTHFUSZ: I think we've got many more resources than -- than the South African police have in terms of vehicles, in -- in terms of hours and feet on the floor. And -- and we really work together with the police as a partnership.</p><p>MABUSE: A security analyst who has interviewed convicted robbers says criminals have found ways to circumvent measures meant to protect their victims.</p><p>RUDOLPH ZINN, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AFRICA: These are experienced criminals that have learned through experience when the alarm system would be off. But interestingly enough, explain to us that should they see that there is an alarm system installed, whether it's been triggered or not, it will -- it will help to make them try and commit the crime in the shortest possible time and leave as soon as possible. It reduces the time that they spend inside and allowing them opportunities as far as rape is concerned and torture is concerned.</p><p>MABUSE: Security analysts have criticized the police and private security companies for being reactors. The answer, they say, lies in apprehending troublemakers early.</p><p>ZINN: We think criminology is the theory, that the younger a person is the first time he would get involved in crime, the more violent that person would be becoming an adult if they're not stopped. Second, also, is the fact that if people commit crime over an extended period of time, without any intervention from the police itself, those people gradually become more and more evasive, more violent, more daring in the crimes that they commit. And this is what we see.</p><p>MABUSE: Zinn has shared his findings with the police in the hope that it will change their strategy to a more proactive one. For now, fear grips South Africans are likely to continue spending millions on anything that holds the promise of safety.</p><p>Nkepile Mabuse, CNN, Johannesburg.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>FINIGHAN: The U.S. stock market is taking a pounding tonight amid a global sell-off today.

We  look at who has the edge both on and off the field.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, I'm Adrian Finighan in for Richard Quest, this is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, U.S. stock markets are taking a pounding tonight as a  wave of selling sweeps the world.  Almost everywhere traders look, there's  trouble.  In China, in Europe, and in the U.S. worrying signs that the  recovery may be at risk.  Let's go straight to Alison Kosik, who is at the  New York Stock Exchange. </p><p>Alison, doesn't look pretty.  What's the atmosphere like there on the  floor?  </p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, exactly.  It does not  look pretty today and so what we're doing today is turning to a trader here  on the floor.  Alan Valdes, with DME Securities, to find out why we're  seeing this sell off today?</p><p>ALAN VALDES, DME SECURITIES:  Well, you know, we knew coming into the  market, this morning, we looked at the markets in Asia last night.  They  were selling off.  Look like things are getting a little weaker in China.   Europe, this morning, they got a big bill due tomorrow-Thursday, rather-of  $545 billion, the banks have loans repayment.  Hedge traders a little  worried.  This morning consumer confidence, here in America, all of  weighing on the market right across the board, but from the get-go the  market was down.  Right from the opening bell, we were down 100 points. </p><p>KOSIK:  Are we in for a bounce back?  I mean, could we see a bounce  back tomorrow, with such a plunge today? </p><p>VALDES:  Well, you know we hope so, as traders, because we are a  superstitious lot.  Tomorrow is the end of the half, end of the first six  months.  Historically, the way the market closes tomorrow will be the way  we finish the year.  So, right now the Dow is down about 2.8 percent.  If  we close tomorrow on the downside, we could be in for a tough year ahead. </p><p>KOSIK:  You know, there's been a lot of talk about a double dip  recession.  I mean, we're getting a lot of down beat economic reports, day  after day.  Are we really in for another recession? </p><p>VALDES:  I don't think we'll go double-dip.  I think you may see the  market contract, maybe down another 8,500, 9,000, in that range; which  would be bad enough.  I don't think we'll double dip.  I think you'll see  earnings season be pretty good.  I think we'll grind things out, but at the  end of the day.  It is all about jobs.  And jobs have not changed at all.   Friday we got a big jobs number and that is going to be a turning point.   We'll see where that goes.  </p><p>KOSIK:  Well, what is it going to take to turn the markets around?</p><p>VALDES:  Well, you know right now this administration has lost more  jobs than Herbert Hoover.  We've lost 4.4 million jobs since Obama has been  elected.  We have to turn that around.  Some way we have to get that turned  around.  If you look at the U6, that is the under-employed jobs.  I mean,  that is on the rise.  That is 16.6.  Last year at this time it was a little  lower.  Those are the people who were making $30,000 last year and are  making $15,000 this year.  So that is weighing on the market, too.  It's  just not the quality jobs out there.  </p><p>KOSIK:  And there is, once again, the fear about the Friday jobs  report?</p><p>VALDES:  That's right that is a big number coming out.  Again, that is  going to kick off the next half and we'll watch that number real closely.  </p><p>KOSIK:  All right.  We'll have to wait and see what happens.  But once  again, you know what, Adrian, it always comes down to jobs, doesn't it?  To  bring back that confidence that we lost in June, Adrian. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  It does indeed, Alison.  Many thanks indeed.  </p><p>KOSIK:  You've got it. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  We'll check back on Wall Street throughout the hour to keep  you up to date with what's happening there.  </p><p>Well, stock markets here in Europe were on the ropes after the close,  a brutal session today.  There is deep concern about what will happen when  a lifeline for banks expires this week and that is only one of several  negatives today.  Let's take a look at how things ended.  </p><p>All the main markets plunged, every stock on each one of those indices  lost value.  The FTSE 100 at an eight-month low.  Mining, metal stocks,  down because of worries about weaker global demand.  The big four, that's  Rio Tinto, Xstrata (ph), Oslo Metal (ph), Piece &amp; Krupp (ph).  Airlines  were weak today, British Airways, Lufthansa.  Banks, too, Barclays down 6.3  percent, Greddy Agricola down nearly 8 percent in Paris, also BNP Paribas,  and Societe Generale, all down.  It is payback time for European banks,  this week they must repay about $540 billion worth, extraordinary loans to  the ECB.  </p><p>This will reveal just how much banks still rely on low rate loans from  the central bank.  Will there be cash flow problems?  Even a new credit  crunch?  That's what the markets are worried about today.  Now, banking  stocks were hit particularly hard in Spain, Portugal and Greece today.   Banks there, of course, could face greater problems getting funds because  of their exposure to weak economies, markets and people reluctant to lend,  of course.  Even on a day like today, you know, we're seeing some signs of  optimism though, about the Euro Zone.  Some people still think that things  are going to get better, according to the European Union.  It is economic  sentiment indicator, that is a measure of the mood, is rising in the single  currency area.  It edged higher in June by just a fraction to 98.7, from  98.4, back in May.  Now that was contrary to expectations.  Consumer  confidence is also up in the Euro Zone, by 1 point, on the EU index. </p><p>Well, earlier today I spoke with Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize- winning economist and a professor at Columbia University.  I asked him, if  he thinks the EU is right to end its emergency loan program on Thursday  this week. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSEPH STIGLITZ, PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY:  I think it is very  similar to the problems that are true about fiscal policy.  It is premature  to remove the support for fiscal policies and it is almost surely premature  to remove the support for the banking system.  We are not yet on the basis  of a robust recovery.  And particularly, as the fiscal policies undermine  the recovery, there is a serious risk of a double-dip.  And it is not a  surprise to me that there is a high level of anxiety on the part of the  banks. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  I know that you are no fan of Chancellor George Osborne's  budget, here in the U.K., last week.  Do you think that by implementing  cuts, more cuts, austerity measures here in Europe, in particular, we're in  danger of repeating Herbert Hoover's 1929 mistake, when he turned the Wall  Street crash into the Great Recession (sic).  </p><p>STIGLITZ:  Precisely, that is exactly-we have ample evidence on this.   I mean, Hoover, we call these Hooverite policies, in honor of Herbert  Hoover.  But the IMF has done that same experiment in Indonesia, Korea,  Thailand, Argentina, so we know what is almost surely likely to have  happened, and that is, fiscal contraction.  </p><p>FINIGHAN:  But surely-</p><p>(CROSS TALK) </p><p>STIGLITZ:  It's understandable that countries are worried about the  debt, but there are ways to respond to that, that are not so short-sighted. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Yes, give me some indication of what those ways might be.   Surely, governments can't spend their way out of a recession?  They can't  keep spending money that haven't got.  </p><p>STIGLITZ:  Well, what you have to do is change the strategy, both the  composition of expenditures, and the structure of taxes.  So, let me give  you an example.  If, in the United States, for instance, we spent less  money on the military, on weapons that don't work against enemies that  don't exist, on a war in Afghanistan that is failing, and take that same  money and invest it at home.  We will stimulate the economy more.  We could  then cut back a little bit on expenditure and have the same level of fiscal  support.  </p><p>But what that will mean is that because the economy will be growing on  the basis of this productive investment.  Taxes revenues will be coming in,  both in the short run, and in the long run.  And the result of that is that  the long-term national debt will be lower.  So, you can't look at this in a  very short-sighted way.  You really-what is of concern is not the debt  today or tomorrow, the concern is the debt 10 years or 15 years from now.   And these investment strategies are the way out of this particular  conundrum that we've gotten ourselves into. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  One final question, here.  You're the man credited with  having foreseen, predicted this recession.  You are far too modest a man to  say, well, I told you so.  But what have you learned?  Has your economic  philosophy, if you like, changed or been tweaked as a result of what we've  been through over the last two years, 18 months?</p><p>STIGLITZ:  So far things have come along pretty much as I had  predicted.  And, in fact, I think the crisis is a real reinforcement for  the kinds of economic theories that I had been developing over a long  period of time.  And standing on the shoulders of great economists, like  Keynes, modifying it as the economy has changed.  </p><p>So, there is a wide body of research that had actually anticipated  this.  But it wasn't the mainstream.  The mainstream in the economics  profession, quite frankly, said that bubbles don't exist, markets are  efficient.  Bubbles can't exist because markets are efficient.  That is why  you ought to deregulate, and if there was a problem the markets will be  self-correcting.  Well, we know pretty well not that that is not true. </p><p>And the challenge going forward is, two-fold, how to prevent the  recurrence, and that is where regulatory reform is very important, but  really the main challenge right now is how to get our economies going  again.  And unfortunately, the same mindset that brought us into the  crisis, the same mindset of the financial markets, that had this belief in  unfettered markets, that got us into the mess, are now dictating that  austerity measures that will just make thing worse.  We have so much  evidence on this, I hope this is an exception, but I wouldn't bet on it. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Professor Joseph Stiglitz who is currently here in the U.K. </p><p>Well, it is turning into a summer of strikes in Spain and Greece.   Riot police are back on the streets of Athens, as protests over spending  cuts turn to anger.  We'll take you live to Greece for a look at what's  been happening today. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>FINIGHAN:  A fresh wave of strikes is underway in Europe as austerity  bites.  Police in Athens clashed with protestors as lawmakers debated a new  round of spending cuts.  Many public services ground to a halt in the  country's fifth general strike this year.  Let's go straight over to Athens  now.  Elinda Labrapolou joins us live via broadband. </p><p>So, it turned violent on the streets once again, Elinda?</p><p>ELINDA LABRAPOLOU, CNN INT'L. CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it did turn violent  again.  This is the fifth general strike we've had this year.  We did have  less people turning up, however, than we had until now.  So, you could say,  in a way that things are calming down.  But what is being debated in  Parliament at the moment, the pension reforms bill, is something that  touches a lot of people.  So, over 10,000 people took to the streets today,  protesting, being angry.  About, you know, their retirement age is  changing.  It is getting-they'll have to retire when they're older.  They  are getting a lot of benefit cuts, their pensions are being slashed.  So  that led a lot of people to the streets once again. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Plus the argument that pensions and conditions for people  are being changed right across Europe at the moment.  Austerity measures  are being implemented wherever you look.  Does that argument cut any sway  with people there in Greece?</p><p>LABRAPOLOU:  Well, it does up to a point, but then people look at  things on a personal level and they see how it affects them.  And they  realize that with the new austerity measures that we've had, where the VAT  tax on alcohol, tobacco, fuel has been raised.  A lot of other things have  gone up.  They just can't make ends meet.  So to most people being asked to  give more is just not something that they're prepared to put up with. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Of course, Greece relies heavily upon its tourism industry.   We're just a few weeks now from the peak of the season.  Are people there  not at all concerned that this kind of violent protest is likely to put  people off coming to Greece and spending money that the country desperately  needs?</p><p>LABRAPOLOU:  A lot of people are very much concerned about that.   Tourism figures are much lower this year.  They're 12 percent down.  The  tourism industry amounts for about 20 percent of GDP, and one in five jobs.   So it is an industry that affects a lot of people.  But again, on a  personal level, when people realize that they're touched directly by these  measures, they're just not prepared to put up with them.  So, they realize  that it might affect the whole country, but they're just not prepared to  put up with it.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  And people who work in the tourism industry, they're taking  action, themselves, tomorrow?</p><p>LABRAPOLOU:  Yes, they're holding a separate strike tomorrow.  This is  just people in the tourism industry.  So that is also going to affect  services and obviously for someone who is here on holiday for a short  while, you know, you have a general strike on one day.  You're not quite  sure what works, what doesn't.  The same thing happens the following day.   It makes it more and more difficult to convince people to come to Greece.  </p><p>FINIGHAN:  All right, Elinda, many thanks indeed.  Elinda Labrapolou,  there, speaking live from Athens, via broadband. </p><p>At the other side of the Med, there were signs on the streets of  Madrid today that Spain's pretty unhappy with austerity, too.  There was  traffic chaos in the Spanish capitol, for the second day running.  Metro  workers went on strike over a 5 percent cut in public sector pay.  Today's  action closed the entire subway network.  Around 2.5 million people had to  find other means of getting to and from work.  Metro staff are planning  another walk out for tomorrow.  </p><p>Well, Spanish football fans have plenty to distract them, thank  goodness.  We're moments away from a crucial match in the World Cup.  We'll  have more on that in just a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>FINIGHAN:  So, a couple of hours ago, Paraguay booked their place in  the last days of the World Cup by beating Japan.  It was the first match at  this tournament to end in a penalty shootout, when the game ended goal  after extra time. </p><p>There is one more slot to fill in the quarter finals.  And both Spain  and Portugal want it.  CNN's Alex Thomas joins us now live from  Johannesburg, with a round up of all today's action.  </p><p>And, Alex, what's being said about giving referees some extra help?  I  assume that is referring to controversial decisions.  That affected both  England and Mexico. </p><p>ALEX THOMAS, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  You are absolutely right,  Adrian.  Let's take you through the World Cup action so far on this  Tuesday.  The pen ultimate of the round of sixteen matches, it took place  in Pretoria, at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium.  </p><p>This is what happened.  Paraguay with the majority of the possession  for most of the game, and their best opportunity-or one of them-came as  early as the 20th minute.  Luca Barrios with a shot that forced Japan's  goalkeeper to make a good save.  Later in the first half, a chance for  Japan as well, Diasuke Matsui rattling the crossbar with a curling shot  from about 20 yards away-I thought we were going to show you some of the  video action, that's why I was reading it off my black read. But clearly,  we're having a big of problems with that.  </p><p>It all boiled down to a penalty shootout, Adrian.  Five kicks apiece  at the end.  The third Japanese spot kick taker hit the cross bar, didn't  score.  Paraguay scored their last two penalties and it meant that Paraguay  goes through, 5-3 on penalties.  The first shootout in this World Cup so  far.  </p><p>Paraguay moves (ph) to the last eight for the first time in their  history, Adrian, and denying Japan the same achievement, Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Yes, you've got to feel sorry for Japan, really. It's never  good to go out in a penalty shootout, Alex.  Of course, we've got Portugal  and Spain in just a moment.  We are going to talk to Al Goodman, who is in  Spain, about that match in just a moment.  That's I should imagine fairly,  it's quite a tight match up, isn't it?  </p><p>Let's talk about that, that-those controversial decisions that  affected both England and Mexico.  Seth Blatter has been talking today  about the possibility of looking into introducing goal-line technology?</p><p>THOMAS:  That's right, Adrian.  It was a news conference that was  scheduled before Sunday's matches, between England and Germany, and  Argentina and Mexico.  And we can all recall that during those games there  were two glaring referee errors.  Frank Rampart scored a legitimate goal  that disallowed.  And in the Argentina game, Carlos Tevez's first goal for  Argentina should have been ruled offside, but it wasn't.  That one was  allowed. </p><p>So, massive refereeing mistakes.  FIFA have been hammered in the  world's media for the last 48 hours.  So, President Seth Blatter used  today's press conference, as I said, scheduled before the controversies, to  apologize to the football associations of both England and Mexico.  We  should stress that those dodgy refereeing decisions didn't affect the  results.  Germany and Argentina went through fairly and squarely.   Nonetheless a huge embarrassment for world football's governing body.  </p><p>And Blatter, as well as the apology, also promised to look again at  the possibility of using goal-line technology in a meeting that is  scheduled for Wales next month.  So maybe it will be introduced in time for  the next World Cup.  They certainly won't change their stance for this  tournament.  They've got to keep the rules consistent throughout.  It's all  about Blatter, Adrian, has ruled out the use of wholesale video replay like  you get in other sports.  It is just particularly talking about the goal- line technology, whether the ball has crossed the line or not. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  I'm sure, Alex, that many people here in England would  agree with you there, that England were beaten fairly and squarely.  But,  Alex Thomas, many thanks indeed.  We'll talk to you again soon.  </p><p>So, in what, eight minutes' time, Portugal kick offs against their  neighbor, Spain.  At stake, of course, is that last birth in the quarter  finals of the World Cup, as well as a load of national pride.  CNN's Al  Goodman is in Madrid, no doubt which side he'll be cheering for tonight.  </p><p>But, Al, you speak to, um, you speak to anyone in Portugal in Spanish  and they're not best pleased; and the same in Spain, there, if you try to  talk to someone in Portuguese.  Even though they are neighbors there is not  love lost between the two countries, is there?</p><p>AL GOODMAN, CNN INT'L. CORRESPONDENT:  Not really, especially, on this  day, Adrian.  Actually, I am on the Spanish/Portuguese border in the town  of Batahothe (ph).  We've been across the border that way, through  Portugal, to the town of Elvis (ph).  So both sides are predicting victory  and this is a really important day because both of these countries have  deep economic problems.  They are on the watch list, if you will, of the  international ratings agencies; a lot of attention on the economic problems  of Portugal and Spain.  But this day, the attention is all on this TV  screen here in this bar in Batahothe (ph) Spain, and on TV screens like  this all across the country.  So, both sides predicting victory; these  teams have a historic rivalry, they know each other well.  We're going to  see who is going to come out ahead, Adrian. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Yes, it is a chance for people to put their economic woes  behind them.  Just for what, 90 minutes tonight.  How would you describe  the atmosphere?  You talk about the rivalry between the two neighboring  nations?  How nasty does that get?  Or is it just friendly rivalry?</p><p>GOODMAN:  Well, in football it is not exactly a friendly rivalry.  And  Spain has the upper hand in the matches overall, 15 victories, five losses.   But notably they have had 12 ties.  Now Spain, of course, is the much  bigger economy.  Portuguese is always feeling pushed, if you will-I think  that is a fair assessment-by their Spanish neighbors on a number of fronts.   Certainly economically, and here, this certainly for Portugal a chance to  show pride and come back against the bigger more powerful neighbor next  door.  </p><p>But for Spain, they are the perennial underachievers in the World Cup.   They have gone home many times, very early.  Everybody thinks they might  actually have a chance to get far this time.  This is the toughest game  they will have faced this tournament, Adrian. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Al, you've got a great job tonight.  I'm really envious.   Enjoy the match, tonight, won't you?  And enjoy the atmosphere there, on  the border between Spain and Portugal.  Al Goodman, there.  </p><p>And Al alluded to it just a moment or two ago, that the strength of  the two economies there.  Let's take a more detailed look at both of them  in the Economic World Cup.  </p><p>So, let's join Jim Boulden, once again, to see who would win if it  wasn't the players, but the economies of Spain and Portugal that were head  to head.  </p><p>Al, sort of touched upon it there, a moment. </p><p>JIM BOULDEN, CNN INT'L. CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, sure. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Of course, that Spain, you would think, being the larger  country has a bigger economy.  But it's in trouble.  Both economies are in  trouble. </p><p>BOULDEN:  It is in trouble, but it is in more trouble than Portugal,  to be honest with you.  If you think of Spanish unemployment at 20 percent,  and GDP growth negative expected this year; unemployment, as we said, you  know, 20 percent.  And budget deficits near 10 percent.  None of those  figures in Portugal come close to that.  They're all-it's all better in  Portugal.  The unemployment rate about half of that.  They are expecting  growth in Portugal this year.  And the budget deficit is nowhere near as  bad, even though the banks are always confident (ph).  And this is what  Portugal always likes to say, don't put a brush on us from Spain.  </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Yes.  </p><p>BOULDEN:  We're not the same.  </p><p>FINIGHAN:  OK, if we were talking about the strength of the economies  it's Portugal that has the upper hand?</p><p>BOULDEN:  This year, Portugal.  Absolutely.  </p><p>(CROSS TALK) </p><p>FINIGHAN:  What's all this we're hearing about the Portugal, though,  being perhaps the next Greece, the next Ireland, perhaps.  </p><p>BOULDEN:  Yes. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Why are we talking about Portugal in that way, and not so  much Spain?</p><p>BOULDEN:  Well, Spain, the Spanish banks seem to be-have invested a  lot and the worry is the amount of debt they have from place like Greece.  </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Correct (ph).</p><p>BOULDEN:  So there is a real worry about the Spanish banks, but the  Spanish government constantly says our banks are not a bad as people think.   They're going to do a stress test.  And we're going to hear very soon,  Spain says.  We'll see where the banks stand.  But Spain has been very  transparent about that.  </p><p>Portugal is a much, much smaller economy.  So they're not having as  much exposure like the big, big Spanish banks.  </p><p>FINIGHAN:  OK, who would you be rooting for tonight, then, Jim? </p><p>BOULDEN:  I would have said, before the tournament, that Spain was my  favorite.  I still say it is my favorite, but not economically. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Really?  Ah, I'm going for Portugal.  Love-as a man who  holidays in Portugal, takes a vacation there, most years, it has got to be  Portugal, of course.  </p><p>What about the earlier game we saw today?  Paraguay-poor Japan, going  out on penalties.  </p><p>BOULDEN:  Well, some country had to be the first one to go out on  penalties, it was Japan.  Believe it or not, I'm going to say, Paraguay.  </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Yeah?</p><p>BOULDEN:  I'm going to say it for economic reasons.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  What? </p><p>BOULDEN:  And you are going to say you seem crazy.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Hang on?  Yeah?</p><p>BOULDEN:  Yes, well, let's get the numbers.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Jim Boulden, you're crazy.</p><p>BOULDEN:  The budget deficit, Paraguay, a fraction of the budget  deficit problems in Japan right now.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Really?</p><p>BOULDEN:  GDP growth, because it's a small country, South America, and  it's neighbor Brazil.  Its biggest export partner is Brazil, so it is doing  well. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Right. </p><p>BOULDEN:  It's got a GDP growth anywhere between 4 and 6 percent this  year. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Right. </p><p>BOULDEN:  Japan, of course, had well, all the Western nations have a  problem in the last year.  Now officially, unemployment rate, 5.7 percent  in Paraguay.  Officially, in Japan, 5.2 percent.  </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Oh, right. </p><p>BOULDEN:  Now, officially Paraguay's unemployment rate isn't much  worse.  We're not talking about the informal economy here. </p><p>FINIGHAN:  So, it is Paraguay on potential, perhaps, then? </p><p>BOULDEN:  Yeah.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  OK.  All right.  Jim, many thanks indeed.  </p><p>We want to know how you are combining doing a days' work and actually  following the World Cup.  I'm sure that many of you are managing to juggle  the two of them.

So why are so many investors interested?  We'll tell you  why, right after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Welcome back live from London this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.   In for Richard Quest, I'm Adrian Finighan.  Let's get a check right now of  the main news headlines at this hour.  </p><p>(NEWSBREAK)  </p><p>FINIGHAN:  Welcome back.</p><p>Live from London, this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>In for Richard Quest, I'm Adrian Finighan.</p><p>Let's get a check right now of the main news headlines at this hour.</p><p>Russia's foreign ministry is rejecting U.S. claims that it's uncovered  a cold war-style espionage ring.  Ten people have been arrested in the  United States, another in Cypress, on suspicion that they were Russian  agents on a long-term mission to spy on the U.S. government.</p><p>Russia calls the allegations \"unfounded,\" saying that the suspects  never harmed U.S. interests.</p><p>The general tapped to become the next top U.S. commander in  Afghanistan says he agrees with President Barack Obama's time line for  troop withdrawal.  David Petraeus is testifying before a Senate committee  today.  He's expected to easily win confirmation to replace General Stanley  McChrystal, who was forced to resign over critical comments about the Obama  administration.</p><p>Well, Barack Obama is hosting Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah at the  White House this hour.  The two leaders are expected to discuss Israel's  plan to further Jewish settlements on occupied land and Iran's nuclear  program.  Talks between the Saudi king and the president come ahead of a  visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's due in Washington  next week.</p><p>Rescuers are searching for more than 100 people buried in a mudslide  in Southwestern China.  According to state media, the first body, a child,  was pulled from the rubble today.  Hopes of finding any survivors are slim.   Heavy rains triggered the mudslide, but there are still showers in the  area.</p><p>Well, big losses on Wall Street today, as we've been reporting.  And  it's just the same for just about any U.S. stock you care to name, except  one.  Shares of the electric car maker Tesla Motors are up by about 12  percent.  They're making their debut on the Nasdaq today.</p><p>Now, the company has yet to make a -- a profit, even for a single  quarter.  But that didn't stop investors handing over more than $220  million in the initial public offering.  The company sold the stock for $17  a share.  That's higher than the range it previously indicated after demand  was stronger than expected.</p><p>And it made a little bit of history.  It's the first public listing of  a car maker in the state since Ford back in 1956.</p><p>But the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, is reluctant to call the company a  traditional car maker.  Musk was a co-founder of the -- the company, having  earlier got PayPal, the electronic payment system, off the ground.  He says  in the way Tesla operates, it's got more in common with Apple or Google  than Ford and GM.</p><p>Well, the road certainly hasn't been smooth for the man who provided  much of the funding for Tesla.  He's poured millions of dollars of his own  money into Tesla.</p><p>Let's go live to CNNMoney.com, the newsroom there.</p><p>Poppy Harlow joins us live -- and, Poppy, he must -- he must have  faith in his product there, to pour so much money into it.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, ANCHOR, CNNMONEY.COM:  You can say that again.  His  name, Elon Musk.  You know, it's very interesting that he relates his  company to Google or Apple.  Larry Paige and Sergey Brin of Google poured  money, also, into Tesla.  They're betting on its success.</p><p>But a big, big day, the company going public in New York, going public  at about $17 a share, trading much higher, trading around $20.50.  So a  nice boost for that stock today.</p><p>I talked to the CEO, Elon Musk, right outside of the Nasdaq, along  with all of those Tesla cars there.  Beautiful.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW:  Elon, a huge day for Tesla, the company going public.</p><p>Why now?</p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA:  Well, a -- a number of reasons.  We actually  don't need (INAUDIBLE) proceeds for the Model S (INAUDIBLE) in production.   A lot of people think we do, but that's -- that's actually taken care of  with the DOE loan and with the pre-existing investment.</p><p>HARLOW:  This is the Model S, by the way, folks.</p><p>MUSK:  This is the Model S, right.</p><p>HARLOW:  Rolling out in 2012.</p><p>MUSK:  Right.  The reason for the IPO was actually to raise funds for  parallel development of some additional variations on the Model S platform,  to give us a little bit of additional cushion in case the Model S takes  longer than expected and -- and also to provide some small amount of  liquidity for myself and others in -- that are in the IPR.</p><p>I'm only selling 5 percent of my holdings and I don't intend to sell  anymore, to be clear.</p><p>HARLOW:  And that's part of the -- part of the DOE agreement, you have  to hold onto about 65 percent, correct?</p><p>MUSK:  Yes, of my holdings, yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  Of your holdings.</p><p>All right, let's talk about the Model S. This is the -- it's going to  cost about half of what the Roadster costs.</p><p>MUSK:  Yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  About $50,000.</p><p>MUSK:  Correct.</p><p>HARLOW:  The goal is to have this roll out in 2012.</p><p>MUSK:  Yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  But you just said in case it takes longer than expected.   That's a really aggressive time line.</p><p>I mean, do you really think that you can get these out and running,  20,000 of them, by 2012, as -- as the hope is?</p><p>MUSK:  We intend to start production in mid-2012.  It always takes a  little bit of time to (INAUDIBLE) up the production line.  So we expect to  get the 20,000 unit a year run rate by early 2015.</p><p>HARLOW:  OK.</p><p>MUSK:  So 2013 will be the first year where we do the 20,000 units.</p><p>HARLOW:  It's good -- it's good to clear that up for a lot of folks.   Looking at -- at Tesla, this is a startup company.  Like many startup  companies, you lose money.</p><p>MUSK:  Yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  The company has lost about $260 million since its inception.</p><p>MUSK:  Yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  You're going public.  You want the public to invest in Tesla.</p><p>What can you say to reassure investors that might have questions about  the potential profitability here?</p><p>MUSK:  Well, yes.  We -- we do often do get that question.  The -- the  thing that's important to bear in mind is that if Tesla just -- were just  decided to be a -- a spore scar company and sell power trains to -- to  other -- other companies like to the -- to Daimler and to Toyota, we would  be profitable.  That's an important consideration.</p><p>However, we're choosing not to do that.  We're choosing, instead, to  reinvest those profits and raise additional money to increase the -- the  production volume and -- and produce the Model S, which is 30 times more  production volume, maybe 40 times more production volume than -- than the - - than our sport scar.  And it's just impossible, if you're going through  that kind of growth, to -- to remain profitable as a whole.</p><p>HARLOW:  And up here we have the Roadster, right?</p><p>MUSK:  Yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  Are you going to stop making the Roadster in 2011?</p><p>MUSK:  (INAUDIBLE) the Roadster does give us the -- a good, good time,  a good -- good production run-up of -- of the Roadster.  We feel  comfortable stopping that first generation and actually making it much more  of a collective item, as well.  So when -- when people are buying a car...</p><p>HARLOW:  I think what you're trying to do here, you'll make a ton of  them so they get in the -- you know, people want them even more.</p><p>MUSK:  Well, I think, you know, I think there is some scarcity value.   And it's sort of like imagine if you had the opportunity to own the first  Porsche, you know, or the first Mercedes or the first Ferrari or something  like that.</p><p>HARLOW:  Is this what you see Tesla becoming, as big as Ferrari?</p><p>MUSK:  Well, I think -- I think much bigger than Ferrari but -- and --  and hopefully bigger than Porsche.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>HARLOW:  A ways to go there before it is bigger than Porsche, Adrian.   Of course, as you said, they first need to turn a profit.  I asked him,  when will Tesla turn a profit.  He wouldn't comment on that.</p><p>I'll tell you, though, Tesla has this cool factor that a lot of car  companies out there -- especially electric car makers, just don't have.</p><p>And I'll end it on this little note.  What's very interesting, you may  have seen Elon Musk, that CEO, in \"Iron Man 2.\" Apparently, Robert Downey,  Jr. called him up himself and asked him to be in that movie.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Oh, wow!</p><p>HARLOW:  Back to you -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Bigger than Ferrari, bigger than Porsche, well, we'll wait  and see.</p><p>HARLOW:  I know.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  I was going to ask you, did he get to drive it?</p><p>But given the traffic that was out there in Manhattan, perhaps --  perhaps it wouldn't have been much fun.</p><p>But, no, Jim Boulden was in here earlier saying oh, he's driven one.   Oh, yes, fine.  But he -- he just -- I don't know, the image isn't right.   You know, you'd look great in a Tesla.</p><p>Would you buy one, is the question?</p><p>HARLOW:  I -- I've driven...</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Yes?</p><p>HARLOW:  If I -- if I had $100,000 spare cash, yes, I would buy one.   I actually have driven one a few months ago at this electric car race.   It's amazing the pickup -- very, very fast.  It's -- it feels like a  Porsche, I'll give him that...</p><p>FINIGHAN:  You'd better start saving...</p><p>HARLOW:  -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  You'd better start saving up, Poppy.</p><p>Many thanks, indeed.</p><p>HARLOW:  I know.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Poppy Harlow live at CNNMoney.com.</p><p>Now, for most U.S. car companies, home could only ever be Detroit,  Michigan.  But not Tesla.  This is one automaker the originated far from  Motor City.  It's based in Silicon Valley, home of the big tech titans.   Tesla Design isn't too far away from Google's headquarters.  And by basing  itself there, the company is going for a high tech image.  Who knows, it  might even be good for business.</p><p>Well, just around the corner in Silicon Valley, Google itself being  accused of backing down in its censorship battle with China.  The search  engine announced a new strategy that it hopes will keep its Chinese Web  site up and running.</p><p>But the technique isn't going down so well in the U.S. tech community.</p><p>Maggie Lake joins us now live from New York with the latest on that --  hey, Maggie.</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Adrian.</p><p>You know, this is a very small step for a very large tech company and  a very large and growing population of Internet users.</p><p>But, you know, if actions speak louder than words, pant very happy  with Google today.</p><p>When users in China go to Google's home page that you're looking at  right here on Google.cn, instead of being automatically directed to Google  Hong Kong, they're going to have to click that site there that you see  first, that will then transport them to the Google Hong Kong page.</p><p>Now, that's interesting because it's a softening of the harder line  that Google had taken earlier this year, when it moved its servers to Hong  Kong, announced it was going to stop censoring results and automatically  redirect those users, which is what it's been doing.</p><p>Now, at that time, you'll remember, the company complained of cyber  attacks aimed at accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents and they  expressed concern on their Web site about the, quote, \"security and human  rights implications.\" You know, using some pretty bold language.</p><p>Well, on the company's Web site today, Google's chief legal officer,  David Drummond, addressed this change in tact, saying this.  Quote,  \"Without an ICP license, we cannot operate a commercial Web site like  Google.cn.  That's a prospect dreaded by many of our Chinese users, who  have been very vocal about their desire to keep Google.cn alive.\"</p><p>So the company very much painting this as a necessary trade-off.  But,  tech watchers out there aren't really buying that.  They say there are some  other motivations going on, it's not really about protecting Chinese users,  but about Google's bottom line.</p><p>Might -- Mitch Wagner, for example, blogging for \"Computer World,\" has  this to say in response:  \"Maybe it's not about choosing good or evil.   Maybe it's just about the money.  China is, after all, a market of a  billion people, most of whom have yet to get Internet access.  Google  stands to reap vast wealth in that market.  Maybe that wealth is more  important to Google than defending freedom.\"</p><p>So the company really taking a bit of a hit on this.  They were seen  says -- you know, before as really standing up to China.  So it's -- it is  having a little bit of impact on that.  And it's interesting, it's not  clear whether it's going to be worth it not, not so whether this tweak is  going to go far enough to impress the Chinese regulators.  We haven't heard  word from China and Google not really commenting on it any further, as  well.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google's stock down about 3 percent today.  But, of course,  it is down in an overall terrible market here in the U.S. -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Yes, it is.</p><p>But Google isn't the only high tech firm to -- to have faced this  dilemma, is it?</p><p>LAKE:  No, it's not.  I mean, certainly they've all come across this.   And when it comes to censoring the results, it's -- it's been a big issue.   Yahoo! in particular, has had a lot of problems in the past with this.   They've also come under a lot of criticism.</p><p>I think the difference here, though -- and you caught it in that  comment from that one tech blogger -- is that Google really sort of put  forth this -- this idea that they're different from everybody else, they're  the maverick.  They have that, you know, do no evil sort of quote that's  been widely interpreted.</p><p>So the feeling was that they were going to behave a little  differently, they were going to make a stand and show everyone else how --  how to act.  I mean that's really kind of their reputation.  And so by  backpedaling just a little bit, it's really seen as caving.  In fact, our  own Web site saying, you know, the search engine blinked in the face of  Chinese censorship.</p><p>So it's -- they're not alone and that's why a lot of these tech  companies have been calling on there to be an issue -- an international  standard, because no one wants to be the first one to pull out and  potentially lose that lucrative business.  But that has human rights  watchers, as well as tech watchers, crying foul and saying, hey, this is  all about the money.  Don't try to say it's anything else.</p><p>So they're not the only ones, but because they set themselves apart a  little bit differently, I think they're coming -- being called to the mat a  little bit more on this.  We'll see.  It's the early days.  We'll see  China's reaction.  We'll see if Google has anything else to say about it on  its Web site -- Adrian.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Yes, the early days, as you say.  It will be interesting to  see how it pans out.</p><p>Maggie, many thanks, indeed.</p><p>Maggie Lake live in New York.</p><p>Now, it's already dealing with an oil disaster, a huge drain on its  funds and a storm of criticism.  And now, BP faces the real thing, as a  hurricane gathers speed off the coast of Mexico.  We'll have the latest in  just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Hello again.</p><p>Now, the disaster in the Gulf shows not only potential mistakes made  by BP, a U.S. government agency also, perhaps, share some of the blame.</p><p>CNN's Joe Johns reports now on how loopholes can help lead to  disaster.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Before it ever began  drilling out in the Gulf, BP got an extraordinary gift from the government.   The agency that regulates offshore oil exploration declared it didn't  believe the Deepwater Horizon would cause any environmental damage, so BP  deserved a pass.  BP would not be required to comply with a tough law that  would have forced the oil giant to fully assess what risks its rig might  pose to the environment.</p><p>KIERAN SUCKLING, CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY:  The whole thing is  a mess.</p><p>JOHNS (on camera):  Because it got this pass, here's what BP did not  have to do.</p><p>It didn't have to produce specific information on the equipment that  it was using or the place where it was drilling.</p><p>And BP didn't have to answer this question -- could there be a serious  accident affecting the environment?</p><p>In other words, BP got to skip what would have been the toughest and  final environmental review it would face before drilling.</p><p>(voice-over) That final environmental review would have taken time.   It would have itemized in detail all the things that could go wrong and how  that could hurt the environment.  And that would almost certainly have  delayed final approval to drill.</p><p>(on camera) Instead, BP got that pass from the agency at the Interior  Department that's supposed to regulate it.</p><p>But Keeping Them Honest, as bad as all this sounds, it gets worse.  It  isn't just BP and Deepwater Horizon.  In fact, most oil companies working  in the Gulf get that same pass.  That means of the hundreds of oil projects  operating today in the Gulf, most got to skip that final critical  environmental review.</p><p>SUCKLING:  So the whole system is broken.  It's not about BP having  some individualized way of gaming the system.  The oil industry has gamed  the entire system from top to bottom.</p><p>JOHNS:  Documents supplied to Congressional investigators by that  Interior Department agency, the MMS, show that since President Obama took  office, 254 oil development plans and 226 exploration plans in the Gulf  were approved without the final environmental review.</p><p>The documents also show that every administration dating back to the  first President Bush used the loophole.  And they actually used it more  often than Obama.</p><p>Now, though, it could end.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're closing the  loophole that has allowed some oil companies to bypass some critical  environmental reviews.</p><p>JOHNS:  But even if the administration closes the loophole, what about  all those other projects currently operating in the Gulf?</p><p>SUCKLING:  You really need to go back and redo that entire decision to  allow it in the first place.  Instead, what's happening is the Department  of Interior is allowing those bad decisions to stand, then trying to kind  of come in around the back and fix it with safety inspections.  And that's  just not good enough.  You've really got to go back to square one on this  stuff.</p><p>JOHNS (voice-over):  But sometimes starting over is hard to do,  especially if you've already gotten the lease, leased the rig and hired the  crew.</p><p>Eric Milito is with the American Petroleum Institute.</p><p>ERIC MILITO, AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE:  You don't want to hurt  that industry any more.  You want to protect the jobs that are down there.   And this industry provides a lot of economic input and a lot jobs to that - - that Gulf region.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>JOHNS:  There are other environmental reviews prior to this final one  BP and others did not have to pass, but none as rigorous.  In fact, the law  allows 30 days for this review.  But given the slow pace of government  bureaucracy, no one really thinks they could get done in 30 days.  And  that's another reason why the agency gave BP the pass.</p><p>(voice-over):  The Interior Department won't comment because of  pending litigation, but now the whole process is being reexamined by the  White House -- too late to help the Gulf.</p><p>Joe Johns, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>FINIGHAN:  And, of course, there's a storm brewing in the Gulf of  Mexico.</p><p>Guillermo was telling us last night the next couple of days will be  crucial in determining...</p><p>GUILLERMO ARDUINO, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Yes.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  -- what this storm actually becomes, whether it turns into  a full blown hurricane, and, of course, the direction.</p><p>He's here with an update right now -- Guillermo.</p><p>ARDUINO:  Here we see the perspective from Central America.  This is  the Gulf of Mexico.  You see how wide it is.  It's becoming a hurricane.   It's not a hurricane yet.  In any case, it's going to be a powerful storm.</p><p>And things are not changing.  As far as we see, the National Hurricane  Center continues with the same forecast, making landfall on Thursday of  this system into the Tamaulipas state here of Mexico.  That's south of  Texas.  And this red line is the National Hurricane Center forecast.  The  other ones are computer models.</p><p>So we are interested to see if there are -- there is a number of  models that take the cyclone into the east, but there's no actually such  thing.</p><p>Now, where we see the prevailing tracks of cyclones in the month of  June, we see that actually we have the very cyclone that caused the  problems in Yucatan is pretty much following the path of what we see in  this time of the year.</p><p>So any time within hours, it's going to become a hurricane.  It is  very close to it.  You see seven kilometers shy of being a hurricane.  And  we're talking about the maximum sustained winds that at 120 it becomes a  hurricane.</p><p>And then, in 40 -- within that time frame and before the 48 hour  period, it is expected to make landfall.  An abundant amount of rain in the  area and also intense winds.</p><p>The effects on the Gulf, Adrian, though, is the effect that it would  have with waves and winds on the booms that would be either overtopped or  breached because of all the movement there, the swell and all the intense  winds.</p><p>Some thunderstorms in the area that these are causing.</p><p>But let's talk about your nice weather.  Britain looking great.  I see  the London forecast.  I mean I'm so sorry that Richard is not here, because  I love giving him good news, you know, concerning the weather.</p><p>But we're going to see the bad weather into the Ukraine and Moldova  section and northern parts of Romania.  It's going to continue to be warm  and nice in Britain.  I think that 27 degrees or so in the next days with  sunny skies.  That's exclusively for Adrian Finighan.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Thank you, my friend.</p><p>It's always nice to -- to see you.  Always nice to get good news.</p><p>We'll see you again.</p><p>ARDUINO:  It is.</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Guillermo, many thanks.</p><p>Crime doesn't pay, unless, of course, you're in the business of  security.</p><p>And at the World Cup, of course, security is big business.</p><p>We'll tell you more in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN:  Well, in Capetown right now, Spain and Portugal are  fighting for a place in the World Cup quarterfinals.  Off the pitch, we're  looking at the big business stories in South Africa.</p><p>CNN's Nkepile Mabuse reports now on South Africa's private security  industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NKEPILE MABUSE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):</p><p>As crime as burgeoned in South Africa, so has the business of crime  prevention.  The country now has two private security guards for every  policeman, with the industry's annual turnover estimated at more than $6  billion.</p><p>(on camera):  So business has been good in the past few years, hasn't  it?</p><p>NEVILLE ROTHFUSZ, CHUBB SECURITY:  Yes.  It has been good.</p><p>MABUSE (voice-over):  Neville Rothfusz manages one of the country's  biggest private security firms.</p><p>(on camera):  In essence, high crime levels mean very good business  for you?</p><p>ROTHFUSZ:  Well, crime, obviously, is a driver of business for us.   But the -- there are other reasons for that, as well, from -- from the  insurance companies insisting that you have some form of cover, from a non- response company or a burglar alarm or something like that.  So there's a  lot of -- it's not only the crime that drives that, but there's obviously  some -- some commercial businesses that depend on us to -- to kind of  minimize the risk for them.</p><p>MABUSE (voice-over):  Despite the rapid growth of South Africa's  private army, crime levels have continued to rise.  House robberies have  increased by more than 100 percent in the past five years, from about 9,000  in 2005 to more than 18,000 last year.  Attacks on businesses have gone up  by even more, from about 3,000 in 2005 to nearly 14,000 in 2009.</p><p>While the numbers might indicate otherwise, private security companies  continue to defend their role in crime prevention.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) can you just (INAUDIBLE) six, seven of  those numbers (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>ROTHFUSZ:  I think we've got many more resources than -- than the  South African police have in terms of vehicles, in -- in terms of hours and  feet on the floor.  And -- and we really work together with the police as a  partnership.</p><p>MABUSE:  A security analyst who has interviewed convicted robbers says  criminals have found ways to circumvent measures meant to protect their  victims.</p><p>RUDOLPH ZINN, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AFRICA:  These are experienced  criminals that have learned through experience when the alarm system would  be off.  But interestingly enough, explain to us that should they see that  there is an alarm system installed, whether it's been triggered or not, it  will -- it will help to make them try and commit the crime in the shortest  possible time and leave as soon as possible.  It reduces the time that they  spend inside and allowing them opportunities as far as rape is concerned  and torture is concerned.</p><p>MABUSE:  Security analysts have criticized the police and private  security companies for being reactors.  The answer, they say, lies in  apprehending troublemakers early.</p><p>ZINN:  We think criminology is the theory, that the younger a person  is the first time he would get involved in crime, the more violent that  person would be becoming an adult if they're not stopped.  Second, also, is  the fact that if people commit crime over an extended period of time,  without any intervention from the police itself, those people gradually  become more and more evasive, more violent, more daring in the crimes that  they commit.  And this is what we see.</p><p>MABUSE:  Zinn has shared his findings with the police in the hope that  it will change their strategy to a more proactive one.  For now, fear grips  South Africans are likely to continue spending millions on anything that  holds the promise of safety.</p><p>Nkepile Mabuse, CNN, Johannesburg.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FINIGHAN:  The U.S. stock market is taking a pounding tonight amid a  global sell-off today.  Wherever traders look at the moment, they see  nothing but trouble, be it China, be it Europe, be it on their own shores.</p><p>The Dow Jones now down 252 points.  It's about 2.4 percent, although  it's come off its earlier lows.</p><p>Closing numbers here in Europe.  This is how it looked -- some of the  heaviest losses for several weeks here.  Bank shares, in particular, got a  pasting.  They're facing a deadline to repay billions of dollars in  extraordinary loans from the ECB.  That deal expires on Thursday.

You\u2019ve heard it from big business lackeys in both political parties. And you\u2019ve heard it from journalists, pundits and think-tankers ad nauseam.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The H-1B foreign guest worker program, they claim, requires American employers to first show that they searched for and tried to recruit American workers before tapping an ever-growing government-rigged pipeline of cheap foreign workers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The foot soldiers of the open-borders brigade are lying, deluded, ignorant or bought-off.</p><p> On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee brought top independent academics and informed whistleblowers to</p><p> Washington to expose the truth.</p><p> Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, played host to Howard University associate professor of public policy Ron Hira, Rutgers University professor Hal Salzman, Infosys whistle-blower Jay Palmer and former computer programmer-turned-lawyer John Miano, who brought much-needed reality checks on the systemic betrayal of American workers to the Beltway table.</p><p> Miano\u2019s testimony was particularly important because he explained how the little known \u201cOPT,\u201d or optical training program, for foreign students is being used to circumvent H-1B and supply large corporations with cheap foreign labor.</p><p> President Obama has expanded this regulatory program by unfettered administrative fiat.</p><p> As Miano noted: \u201cOPT has no labor protections of any kind. Aliens on OPT do not even have to be paid at all. While DHS requires aliens to work in an area related to their major area of study, DHS has no ability to ensure that this happens. Under OPT, over 125,000 foreign workers a year are simply turned loose in America with no supervision or restrictions.\u201d</p><p> Also on hand at the hearing: a few big tech shills toeing the Zuckerberg/ Gates/chamber of commerce line that there\u2019s a catastrophic American tech worker shortage.</p><p> That line comes even as thousands upon thousands of American workers are being laid off in favor of underpaid, easily exploited H-1Bs. (Just use H-1Bpromoter Google\u2019s search engine and type in \u201cSouthern California Edison\u201d and \u201clayoffs.\u201d)</p><p> Grassley put it plainly: \u201cMost people believe that employers are supposed to recruit Americans before they petition for an H-1B worker. Yet under the law, most employers are not required to prove to the Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the job first.\u201d</p><p> He added, \u201cAnd, if there is an equally or even better qualified U.S. worker available, the company does not have to offer him or her the job. Over the years, the program has become a government-assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over \u2014 rather than complement \u2014 the U.S. work force.\u201d</p><p> Hira affirmed: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not true\u201d that employers seeking H-1Bs must put American workers first, either by \u201claw or regulations.\u201d</p><p> How did this myth gain such traction? Many commentators and journalists confuse the labor certification process required for companies applying to obtain green cards (lawful permanent residency status) for H-1B workers with the Labor Condition</p><p> Application, or LCA, process for H-1Bs.</p><p> Labor certification in the green card process \u201cexists to protect U.S. workers and the U.S. labor market by ensuring that foreign workers seeking immigrant visa classifications are not displacing equally qualified U.S. workers.\u201d</p><p> Only in extremely narrow and exceptional circumstances do these nominal protections exist in the H-1B LCA process.</p><p> (Companies must be classified as \u201cH-1B dependent\u201d for the requirements to apply. Big tech giants like Facebook have been lobbying mightily to avoid the classification.)</p><p> And even those narrow exceptions are easily and often circumvented by H-1B foreign worker traffickers.</p><p> Conservative journalist W. James Antle gets to the heart of the matter: \u201cIf the government has discretion in how it exercises its legitimate authority over who comes and who goes, a prerequisite for national sovereignty, then shouldn\u2019t it exercise such discretion in a way that minimizes the impoverishment of Americans?\u201d</p><p> For a brief window, Grassley and, yes, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a small group of H-1Bemploying banks and other financial institutions that accepted federal bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, did have to demonstrate that they had taken \u201cgood-faith steps to recruit U.S. workers\u201d and offer them wages \u201cat least as high\u201d as those offered to H-1B workers.</p><p> In addition, the targeted employers had to show that they \u201cmust not have laid off, and will not lay off, any U.S. worker in a job essentially equivalent to the H-1B position in the area of intended employment of the H-1B worker\u201d within a narrow time frame.</p><p> But this American worker-first provision, vociferously opposed by big business and big government, expired in 2011.</p><p> The refusal of the vast majority of politicians and the White House to embrace these protections for all U.S. workers tells you everything you need to know about H-1B\u2019s big, fat lies.</p><p> Michelle Malkin is the author of \u201cCulture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies.\u201d Her e-mail address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:malkinblog@gmail.com\">malkinblog@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKGA-155445E82AA6F6A8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897F97B5DBB5C NWBKGA2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FYT-58N1-JD6S-R489-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Forsyth County News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Some of the highlights:</p><p> \u201cHow are corporations using the power that they have in Congress?\u201d</p><p>Although hiring and promotion practices are important, \u201cI\u2019m thinking much, much bigger than, \u2018Can we raise our Black staff from 6 percent to 10 percent?\u2019 \u201d Nikole said, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s very minimal if we\u2019re talking about a moment of reckoning.\u201d Companies can use their political heft to address \u201cmuch bigger societal issues\u201d like education, she noted. A push for integrating and improving public schools would have broad community benefits, including when it comes to hiring. \u201cA lot of times you look at what companies are saying, and then you look at what candidates and issues they\u2019re supporting, and there\u2019s a deep incongruence there, if not hypocrisy,\u201d she said.</p><p> \u201cA meritocracy is not built on continuing to advance and advantage the same people who have already had every advantage.\u201d</p><p>When recruiting, companies tend to stick too rigidly to requirements on education and experience that ignore structural inequalities, Nikole said. \u201cWe need the person who is Black, but also has the exact same r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and criteria as the white person, despite the fact that we know there\u2019s a great deal of structural inequality,\u201d she said, describing a common thought process among corporate recruiters. \u201cThe typical Black child attends a high-poverty, underresourced school,\u201d she noted, and \u201cthey\u2019re not going to have the same internships, they\u2019re not going to have the same letters of reference. But that kid has worked really hard, and that kid is going to come into your institution with certain skills and knowledge and fight.\u201d</p><p> \u201cMaybe they can just wait this moment out.\u201d</p><p>Is there a risk for companies to not take action during the national uproar about racial inequality? The \u201ccynical way of thinking about it,\u201d Nikole said, is that \u201cour country\u2019s attention to racial injustice is very fleeting.\u201d Public pressure on companies will determine whether they act or not. \u201cIn the end, I don\u2019t think not doing anything has ever been that risky,\u201d she said, \u201cexcept for these kind of key moments \u2014 the end of the civil rights movement for one, and perhaps now \u2014 but that\u2019s likely going to depend on us.\u201d</p><p>The speed read</p><p>Deals</p><p> Are megadeals back?

The regulators in Washington may be on to something. The whopping $5 billion fine levied last week by the Federal Trade Commission against Facebook was a welcome step in a long-overdue ramping up of federal oversight on Big Tech and its handling of our privacy. The news of the fine was followed fast by two reactions. </p><p>First, many Facebook critics complained the fine was too small. Sure, it's more than 40 times as large as any previous FTC fine in history, but given how much money Facebook earns, it's more of a speed bump than a pull-over by the police. Facebook has earned more than $3 billion in profit in each of the past nine quarters, according to shareholder disclosures on its website. That's more than a billion dollars' profit each month for at least 27 months. But the fine also marked what could be the beginning of a radically different approach to regulating companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, who together control so much of our lives in cyberspace. For one thing, the FTC also is requiring Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to personally guarantee that he will implement a new set of privacy rules. That's important because Facebook is being fined precisely because it failed to live up to the terms of a 2012 FTC order settling a complaint over deceiving users about the extent to which their data was shared with third parties. A new investigation was launched 16 months ago after revelations that a viral quiz on Facebook was really a way to extract personal information from its users and all of their friends for consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The company used the data to help politicians and others develop targeted campaign messages. Just taking Facebook's word that it would change was out of the question. Now, Zuckerberg will be held liable if the company stumbles again. The second reaction came from Facebook itself. The company disclosed not only that it is subject to an ongoing antitrust investigation by the FTC but that it was also contacted this month by the Department of Justice as part of a separate, sweeping antitrust investigation of the whole tech industry. These pending inquiries are the best reason to see the FTC fine as merely the beginning of Washington's getting tough on tech. The focus will likely be on how to prevent the companies from locking would-be competitors out of the industry. That might sound like an inefficient route to protecting privacy, but it's not. It may be the best way, said Cory Doctorow , one of the world's leading privacy experts and the former director of European affairs for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Companies such as Google and Facebook have used their mountains of cash to fend off competitors, limiting consumer options. \"Fifteen million American users left Facebook since 2017,\" Doctorow told the editorial board, citing results from a widely respected industry survey by Edison Research. Many of them joined Snapchat instead, where privacy protections are among the most popular draws. But millions also likely joined Instagram, where more than 1 billion accounts are now active monthly. The problem with that? Facebook saw that trend coming and bought Instagram for $1 billion seven years ago. Doctorow said the FTC and DOJ should focus on the industrywide dynamics to prevent what he called anti-competitive acquisitions. That's a smarter approach, he argued, than Europe's strategy of imposing extremely rigorous privacy rules for social media companies. As a result, only the richest companies can afford to comply. Doctorow said a better alternative in America is to focus on a market-based solution, mixed in with some new rules that would place some especially shady conduct out of bounds. \"Where we have real potential for movement in the U.S. is by framing the issue through a pro-competition lens,\" he said. \"The extreme concentration in the tech sector has really alarmed a bunch of people on the right. You don't have to be a fan of Alex Jones to worry that the decision to put him out of business was made by four tech executives.\" Americans, he said, will warm to a case that dials back the hyperconcentration in the tech industry and other industries too, such as energy, eye wear and agribusiness, where consolidation has happened with far less scrutiny. Congress has also scheduled bipartisan hearings promising to assess the state of the tech industry and whether antitrust or privacy laws need updating. That's smart, too. Last week's big Facebook fine could end up being a bust. We hope to look back in five years and see it as a turning point. If not, we'll be living in a world where privacy is as illusory as the friendships many of us make online.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN69335264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP6-JGM1-DYRV-41BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The country only has seed round funding for startups, for less than $1 million, and few series A rounds for valuations above $1 million, creating a bottleneck for growth, he said.</p><p>Thailand needs to have more series B and C funding rounds to draw bigger deals with higher valuations. Local startups need to innovate, not copy ideas, and go beyond the domestic market to Southeast Asia, said Mr Krating.</p><p> The government needs to execute regulations to facilitate foreign venture capital and startups in Thailand by speeding up the smart visa approval process. The valuation of startups in Thailand is 20-30% lower than Singapore because of barriers to doing business.</p><p> Mr Krating said in the first year of 500 TukTuks, which opened three years ago, it invested 400 million baht from a total fund of 550 million in 50 startups, mostly seed stage funding. Of the startups the company invested in, 47% of startups successfully raised funding of almost 7 billion baht and created at least 10,000 jobs.</p><p> \"In 2018, we believe that 500 TukTuks can help at least 2-3 startups reach a valuation of $100 million each,\" he said. Mr Krating said 500 TukTuks will expand investment in series A funding for not only digitally disruptive technology but also deep tech startups that heavily rely on RandD.</p><p> The company will invest in food tech, e-commerce related areas, travel, agritech, logistics, fintech, health, energy, property tech, insurtech, artificial intelligence, and biotech. \"We will consider more startups that can work with our corporate investors,\" he said.</p><p> 500 TukTuks wants to invest in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

This week in Australia, Facebook is rolling out new measures to improve the transparency of political advertising, in response to concerns about online misinformation and foreign interference.</p><p>For most big tech companies, political advertising has become a hot potato issue since Russia was caught red-handed using social media to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election. While US President Donald Trump often characterises critical coverage by the mainstream media as fake news, it is social media platforms that have become prolific forums for exaggerated, conspiratorial and fraudulent information that mostly goes unchecked.</p><p>While they have been slow to react, big tech companies are starting to move. In the most dramatic change, late last year Twitter banned all political advertising from its platform. Google was unwilling to take the financial hit of a ban, instead focusing on restricting the ability to micro-target political ads. The targeting, which let political parties direct ads to specific voters based on political affiliation or interest, has been dramatically restricted to reduce the polarisation and manipulation of voters.</p><p>It has been Facebook that has got itself tied in knots over the issue. The recipient of the most political advertising dollars, it has made faltering attempts to make it more transparent by enforcing tougher disclosure rules. The changes this week in Australia, which are already in place in America, mean ads about politics, elections and social issues will need to be authorised by an Australia-based person whose identity will be verified by Facebook. Ads will also have a public \"paid for by\" disclaimer linked to an account, page or organisation nominated by the advertiser and will be documented in a publicly accessible library that will detail the reach of the post, the money spent on it and the demographic groups being targeted.</p><p>While these changes are to be commended, there is one very big flaw. Facebook has a strict policy on truth in advertising but is unwilling to enforce that code on political ads. So if you are selling soap you must ensure your ad is truthful, but if you are selling a political message there is no such condition.</p><p>Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg defends the decision, believing voters should be allowed to make the judgment of truth themselves and any attempt to crack down on the company would be censorship. The reality is Facebook does not want to be in the business of having to fact-check whether thousands of political ads are true or not, a fraught space for any company. But the end result is a forum where political parties must self-regulate on what is truthful. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>At the last federal election, the Coalition ran an effective social media campaign accusing Bill Shorten of wanting to introduce a death tax, a claim that was clearly false. At the previous election, in 2016, it was Labor which ran an effective social media campaign accusing Malcolm Turnbull of wanting to privatise Medicare. Again, not true. The big tech companies need to do better. In a world where political self-interest can put falsehoods before the facts, they need to set the bar higher on political discourse. Voters deserve to know the truth, no matter what the financial cost.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc79pmumpb8i8nggkddy8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YF3-8W51-JD34-V1PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"580\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

This week in Australia, Facebook is rolling out new measures to improve the transparency of political advertising in response to concerns about online misinformation and foreign interference.</p><p>For most big-tech companies, political advertising has become a hot potato issue since Russia was caught red-handed using social media to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election. While US President Donald Trump often characterises critical coverage by the mainstream media as fake news, it is social media platforms that have become prolific forums for exaggerated, conspiratorial and fraudulent information that mostly goes unchecked.</p><p>While they have been slow to react, big tech companies are starting to move. In the most dramatic change, late last year Twitter banned all political advertising from its platform. Google was unwilling to take the financial hit of a ban, instead focusing on restricting the ability to micro-target political ads. The targeting, which allowed political parties to direct ads to very specific voters based on political affiliation or interest, has been dramatically restricted to reduce the polarisation and manipulation of voters.</p><p>It has been Facebook that has got itself tied in knots over the issue. The recipient of the most political advertising dollars, it has made faltering attempts to make its site more transparent by enforcing tougher disclosure rules. The changes this week in Australia, which are already in place in America, mean ads about politics, elections and social issues will need to be authorised by an Australia-based person whose identity will be verified by Facebook.</p><p>Ads will also have a public \"paid for by\" disclaimer linked to an account, page or organisation nominated by the advertiser and will be documented in a publicly accessible library that will detail the reach of the post, the money spent on it and the demographic groups being targeted.</p><p>While these changes are to be commended, there is one very big flaw. Facebook has a strict policy on truth in advertising, but is unwilling to enforce that code on political ads. So if you are selling soap you must ensure your ads are truthful, but if you are selling a political message there is no such condition.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/02/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-policy-fake-ads\">Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg</url> defends the decision, believing voters should be allowed to make the judgment of truth themselves and any attempt to crack down on the company would be censorship. The reality is Facebook does not want to be in the business of having to fact-check whether thousands of political ads are true or not, a fraught space for any company. But the end result is a forum where political parties must self-regulate on what is truthful. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>At the last federal election, the Coalition ran an effective social media campaign accusing Bill Shorten of wanting to introduce a death tax, a claim that was clearly false. At the previous election, in 2016, it was Labor which ran an effective social media campaign accusing Malcolm Turnbull of wanting to privatise Medicare. Again, not true.</p><p>The big tech companies need to do better. In a world where political self-interest can put falsehoods before the facts, they need to set the bar higher on political discourse. Voters deserve to know the truth, no matter what the financial cost.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520250624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YF2-X351-DY19-C22G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"583\"/><timeReceived>08:12 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But in the data, they're something else: a miraculous small-business success story.</p><p>Mom-and-pop vape shops are the fastest-growing retail segment of the past decade, as well as the one with the highest share of employees at small businesses. But a government ban on flavored vapes and increased regulation could wipe them out and leave an opening for big tobacco and big tech to dominate the fast-growing industry.</p><p>Tobacconists - the broader category which includes vape shops - have lapped every other retail segment since 2009 thanks to an explosion of tiny businesses, Labor Department data show.</p><p>Two thirds of vape-shop workers are employed by the 93% of businesses with fewer than 10 employees - a higher rate than for any other retail segment.</p><p>Yelp's vast databases, which allow us to break out segments not yet tracked by the government, agree. Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing large retail segment tracked by the online review site. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state.</p><p>The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping related, has killed at least nine people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net.</p><p>In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high-school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices. The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner.</p><p>Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options.</p><p>On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Mich., plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons their Facebook page, and their website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine).</p><p>But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\"</p><p>The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval which its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse.</p><p>Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, N.Y. \"After the mom and pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria.</p><p>Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said.</p><p>Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated items as tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transport challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the U.S., according to figures from the book American Breweries II provided by the Brewers Association.</p><p>But the rise of lager-syle beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers. In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained.</p><p>\"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association. \"The companies that survived were the ones that were able to rapidly shift markets and weather the storm.\" He pointed that, Yuengling, for example, entered the ice cream business during the lean years.</p><p>Those bigger players swung back into the industry when Prohibition lifted, because they were positioned to navigate costly state and local regulations that proliferated in the wake of repeal. It consolidated their advantage. By 1978, there were just 89 brewers in the country.</p><p>In that same year, regulations finally eased. President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that legalized homebrewing. In the years that followed, states relaxed their brewpub bans, Watson said. There were more than 1,500 U.S. breweries by the year 2000, and by 2018 there were 7,450.</p><p>There's an important caveat, however. A few enormous corporations still sell six out of every seven U.S. beers, leaving about 7,447 craft brewers to split the remaining 14% of the market. \"These regulatory decisions that were made a long time ago have very long historical trajectories,\" Watson said.</p><p>Heavyweights like Anheuser-Busch InBev (41% of the market) and Molson Coors (23.5%) have also elbowed into the craft beer boom, snapping up smaller brewers and distributing their beverages under myriad craft labels.</p><p>We're seeing echoes of that in the vaping industry. Late last year, Altria sought to regain lost ground with a $12.8 billion investment in Juul. It also acquired 45% of a Canadian marijuana firm.</p><p>Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At vape shops, customers often taper to lower and lower nicotine concentrations, until they're vaping a zero-nicotine product. Eventually, some will quit entirely.</p><p>But while adult smokers seem to have benefited from the vaping boom, officials point to a worrying spike in teen use. A 2018 survey found 37.3% of high-school seniors had vaped at some point in the prior year, up from 27.8% in 2017. Only 3.6% of them reported smoking cigarettes daily.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-660018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4K-JX31-JBM5-P19K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1253\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DN56</classCode><className>VAPING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00096L2</classCode><className>RATINGS &amp;

This isn't charity.</p><p> It's big tech recruitment of vulnerable generations of future Google addicts.</p><p> In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Google inked a deal to provide 4,000 \"free\" Chromebooks to students, along with \"free\" Wi-Fi to 100,000 families. In Kentucky, the Jefferson County public schools gave away 25,000 Chromebooks. In Philadelphia, public officials earmarked $11 million to purchase 40,000 Chromebooks for homebound kids.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai crowed a few weeks ago that the company now has 100 million students and educators hooked on Google Classroom.</p><p> Bent on conquering the virtual meeting market, the online giant announced that its premium Google Meet videoconferencing features are now free to all 80 million customers of its G Suite for Education apps through the fall.</p><p>Google Meet is racking up 2 million new users a day as school districts abandon Zoom, the dominant virtual meeting app that recently admitted \"mistakenly\" routing non-Chinese calls through its Beijing-based data centers.</p><p> But if educators think Google will provide more protections for American students than the ChiCom government, they're blind, dumb or bought off. As I've chronicled regularly in this column over the past decade, the Silicon Valley giant has repeatedly breached federal privacy laws to extend its tentacles into children's emails, browsing habits, search engine activity, voice memos and more without parental consent.</p><p>Google's information predators have previously admitted to unauthorized scanning and indexing of student email accounts and targeted online advertising based on search engine activity, as well as autosyncing of passwords, browsing history and other private data across devices and accounts belonging to students and families unaware of default tracking.</p><p> A new lawsuit seeking class-action status against Google filed in Illinois serves as a warning to all the millions of families enthralled by their pandemic-gifted Chromebooks. Father-of-two Clinton Farwell alleges that Google illegally collected personally identifying biometric information from his children through their public schoolissued Chromebooks (loaded with G Suite for Education apps) dating back to 2015. His suit lays out how Google has \"infiltrated\" K-12 education with hardware and software primarily targeting students under the age of 13, whose face templates and voiceprints are illicitly collected, along with their: physical locations; websites they visit; every search term they use in Google's search engine (and the results they click on); the videos they watch on YouTube; personal contact lists; voice recordings; saved passwords; and other behavioral information.</p><p> Despite signing a \"Student Privacy Pledge\" promising not to collect, share and retain private personal data, Google Chromebooks scan students' faces and unique acoustic details of students' voices to identify them by name, age, gender and location while using Google platforms. Farwell realized his kids' biometric data was being stored in a vast database when he discovered they were required to speak and look into the laptops' microphones and cameras in order to use the school products and apps.</p><p> A similar lawsuit by the New Mexico Attorney General's office filed in federal court in February exposed how Chromebooks and G Suite for Education apps mined students' Gmail accounts for advertising purposes. The New Mexico AG's brief also bolstered my previous exclusive reports, based on whistleblowing by Missouri teachers Brooke Henderson and Brette Hay, on Google's access to student profiles and family computer passwords through the default Chrome Sync function--which can only be blocked by creating a passphrase buried in settings that school officials never inform students about (let alone their parents left in the dark from the moment schools require kids to create Google logins as early as kindergarten).</p><p> And now governments are entrusting Google to help develop contacttracing technology on the promise that they won't collect location data, won't exploit data for commercial purposes, and won't grant access to unauthorized parties? Fox, meet henhouse.</p><p> Regulatory slaps on the wrist by toothless federal agencies have done nothing to deter the deceitful data usurpers. Why hasn't every other state attorney general filed a similar suit? Where is Congress, which passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to prevent exactly the kind of routine marauding of students' digital lives perpetrated by Google and other EdTech vultures? Instead of pushing back, Congress passed the \"Every Student Succeeds Act\" and the \"Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act\"--deceptively titled bills expanding third-party access to sensitive personal data.</p><p> The Invisible Enemy is right under our noses, in our homes and on our kids' laptops. Instead of removing children en masse from their classrooms in the name of public health, responsible adults should be de-platforming Google's privacy pillagers from every school in America in the name of public safety.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKLA-0862084ef04d3b85835ff851ed90d139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289B0AC94C1099 NWBKLA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX4-0M51-JBCN-419K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401937</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gueydan Journal, Louisiana State Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It's big tech recruitment of vulnerable generations of future Google addicts. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Google inked a deal to provide 4,000 \"free\" Chromebooks to students, along with \"free\" Wi-Fito 100,000 families. In Kentucky, the Jefferson County public schools gave away 25,000 Chromebooks. In Philadelphia, public officials earmarked $11 million to purchase 40,000 Chromebooks for homebound kids.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai crowed a few weeks ago that the company now has 100 million students and educators hooked on Google Classroom. Bent on conquering the virtual meeting market, the online giant announced that its premium Google Meet videoconferencing features are now free to all 80 million customers of its G Suite for Education apps through the fall.</p><p>Google Meet is racking up 2 million new users a day as school districts abandon Zoom, the dominant virtual meeting app that recently admitted \"mistakenly\" routing non-Chinese calls through its Beijing-based data centers.</p><p> But if educators think Google will provide more protections for American students than the ChiCom government, they're blind, dumb or bought off. As I've chronicled regularly in this column over the past decade, the Silicon Valley giant has repeatedly breached federal privacy laws to extend its tentacles into children's emails, browsing habits, search engine activity, voice memos and more without parental consent.</p><p>Google's information predators have previously admitted to unauthorized scanning and indexing of student email accounts and targeted online advertising based on search engine activity, as well as autosyncing of passwords, browsing history and other private data across devices and accounts belonging to students and families unaware of default tracking.</p><p> A new lawsuit seeking class-action status against Google filed in Illinois serves as a warning to all the millions of families enthralled by their pandemic-gifted Chromebooks. Father-of-two Clinton Farwell alleges that Google illegally collected personally identifying biometric information from his children through their public school-issued Chromebooks (loaded with G Suite for Education apps) dating back to 2015. His suit lays out how Google has \"infiltrated\" K-12 education with hardware and software primarily targeting students under the age of 13, whose face templates and voiceprints are illicitly collected, along with their: physical locations; websites they visit; every search term they use in Google's search engine (and the results they click on); the videos they watch on YouTube; personal contact lists; voice recordings; saved passwords; and other behavioral information.</p><p> Despite signing a \"Student Privacy Pledge\" promising not to collect, share and retain private personal data, Google Chromebooks scan students' faces and unique acoustic details of students' voices to identify them by name, age, gender and location while using Google platforms. Farwell realized his kids' biometric data was being stored in a vast database when he discovered they were required to speak and look into the laptops' microphones and cameras in order to use the school products and apps.</p><p> A similar lawsuit by the New Mexico Attorney General's office filed in federal court in February exposed how Chromebooks and G Suite for Education apps mined students' Gmail accounts for advertising purposes. The New Mexico AG's brief also bolstered my previous exclusive reports, based on whistleblowing by Missouri teachers Brooke Henderson and Brette Hay, on Google's access to student profiles and family computer passwords through the default Chrome Sync function -- which can only be blocked by creating a passphrase buried in settings that school officials never inform students about (let alone their parents left in the dark from the moment schools require kids to create Google logins as early as kindergarten).</p><p> And now governments are entrusting Google to help develop contact-tracing technology on the promise that they won't collect location data, won't exploit data for commercial purposes, and won't grant access to unauthorized parties?</p><p> Fox, meet henhouse.</p><p> Regulatory slaps on the wrist by toothless federal agencies have done nothing to deter the deceitful data usurpers. Why hasn't every other state attorney general filed a similar suit? Where is Congress, which passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to prevent exactly the kind of routine marauding of students' digital lives perpetrated by Google and other EdTech vultures? Instead of pushing back, Congress passed the \"Every Student Succeeds Act\" and the \"Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act\" -- deceptively titled bills expanding third-party access to sensitive personal data.</p><p> The Invisible Enemy is right under our noses, in our homes and on our kids' laptops. Instead of removing children en masse from their classrooms in the name of public health, responsible adults should be de-platforming Google's privacy pillagers from every school in America in the name of public safety.</p><p> Michelle Malkin's email address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MichelleMalkinInvestigates@protonmail.com\">MichelleMalkinInvestigates@protonmail.com</email> To find out more about Michelle Malkin and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.creators.com\">www.creators.com</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKLA-82d6a60b8b3bfa4b24d550df3121d9c0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E53B3709FF8 NWBKLA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWX-1BV1-JBCN-41T3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401937</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"974\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Church Point News, LSN Publishing Co., LLC.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This isn't charity. It's big tech recruitment of vulnerable generations of future Google addicts.</p><p> In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Google inked a deal to provide 4,000 \"free\" Chromebooks to students, along with \"free\" Wi-Fito 100,000 families. In Kentucky, the Jefferson County public schools gave away 25,000 Chromebooks. In Philadelphia, public officials earmarked $11 million to purchase 40,000 Chromebooks for homebound kids.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai crowed a few weeks ago that the company now has 100 million students and educators hooked on Google Classroom. Bent on conquering the virtual meeting market, the online giant announced that its premium Google Meet videoconferencing features are now free to all 80 million customers of its G Suite for Education apps through the fall. Google Meet is racking up 2 million new users a day as school districts abandon Zoom, the dominant virtual meeting app that recently admitted \"mistakenly\" routing non-Chinese calls through its Beijing-based data centers.</p><p> But if educators think Google will provide more protections for American students than the ChiCom government, they're blind, dumb or bought off. As I've chronicled regularly in this column over the past decade, the Silicon Valley giant has repeatedly breached federal privacy laws to extend its tentacles into children's emails, browsing habits, search engine activity, voice memos and more without parental consent. Google's information predators have previously admitted to unauthorized scanning and indexing of student email accounts and targeted online advertising based on search engine activity, as well as autosyncing of passwords, browsing history and other private data across devices and accounts belonging to students and families unaware of default tracking.</p><p> A new lawsuit seeking class-action status against Google filed in Illinois serves as a warning to all the millions of families enthralled by their pandemicgifted Chromebooks. Father-of-two Clinton Farwell alleges that Google illegally collected personally identifying biometric information from his children through their public school-issued Chromebooks (loaded with G Suite for Education apps) dating back to 2015. His suit lays out how Google has \"infiltrated\" K-12 education with hardware and software primarily targeting students under the age of 13, whose face templates and voiceprints are illicitly collected, along with their: physical locations; websites they visit; every search term they use in Google's search engine (and the results they click on); the videos they watch on YouTube; personal contact lists; voice recordings; saved passwords; and other behavioral information.</p><p> Despite signing a \"Student Privacy Pledge\" promising not to collect, share and retain private personal data, Google Chromebooks scan students' faces and unique acoustic details of students' voices to identify them by name, age, gender and location while using Google platforms. Farwell realized his kids' biometric data was being stored in a vast database when he discovered they were required to speak and look into the laptops' microphones and cameras in order to use the school products and apps.</p><p> A similar lawsuit by the New Mexico Attorney General's office filed in federal court in February exposed how Chromebooks and G Suite for Education apps mined students' Gmail accounts for advertising purposes. The New Mexico AG's brief also bolstered my previous exclusive reports, based on whistleblowing by Missouri teachers Brooke Henderson and Brette Hay, on Google's access to student profiles and family computer passwords through the default Chrome Sync function -- which can only be blocked by creating a passphrase buried in settings that school officials never inform students about (let alone their parents left in the dark from the moment schools require kids to create Google logins as early as kindergarten).</p><p> And now governments are entrusting Google to help develop contact-tracing technology on the promise that they won't collect location data, won't exploit data for commercial purposes, and won't grant access to unauthorized parties? Fox, meet henhouse.</p><p> Regulatory slaps on the wrist by toothless federal agencies have done nothing to deter the deceitful data usurpers. Why hasn't every other state attorney general filed a similar suit? Where is Congress, which passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to prevent exactly the kind of routine marauding of students' digital lives perpetrated by Google and other EdTech vultures?</p><p> Instead of pushing back, Congress passed the \"Every Student Succeeds Act\" and the \"Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act\" -- deceptively titled bills expanding third-party access to sensitive personal data.</p><p> The Invisible Enemy is right under our noses, in our homes and on our kids' laptops. Instead of removing children en masse from their classrooms in the name of public health, responsible adults should be de-platforming Google's privacy pillagers from every school in America in the name of public safety.</p><p> Michelle Malkin's email address is MichelleMalkinInvestigates@ protonmail.com.

Silicon Valley companies are feasting on an exploding client base of quarantined students held hostage to \"online learning.\" Big Google is leading the way   and that is not OK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unsuspecting parents cheering all the software and hardware donations during the pandemic shutdown have no idea the privacy price their children are paying. This isn't charity. It's big tech recruitment of vulnerable generations of future Google addicts. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Google inked a deal to provide 4,000 \"free\" Chromebooks to students, along with \"free\" Wi-Fi to 100,000 families. In Kentucky, the Jefferson County public schools gave away 25,000 Chromebooks. In Philadelphia, public officials earmarked $11 million to purchase 40,000 Chromebooks for homebound kids.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai crowed a few weeks ago that the company now has 100 million students and educators hooked on Google Classroom. Bent on conquering the virtual meeting market, the online giant announced that its premium Google Meet videoconferencing features are now free to all 80 million customers of its G Suite for Education apps through the fall. Google Meet is racking up 2 million new users a day as school districts abandon Zoom, the dominant virtual meeting app that recently admitted \"mistakenly\" routing non-Chinese calls through its Beijing-based data centers.</p><p>But if educators think Google will provide more protections for American students than the ChiCom government, they're blind, dumb or bought off. As I've chronicled regularly in this column over the past decade, the Silicon Valley giant has repeatedly breached federal privacy laws to extend its tentacles into children's emails, browsing habits, search engine activity, voice memos and more without parental consent. Google's information predators have previously admitted to unauthorized scanning and indexing of student email accounts and targeted online advertising based on search engine activity, as well as autosyncing of passwords, browsing history and other private data across devices and accounts belonging to students and families unaware of default tracking.</p><p>A new lawsuit seeking class-action status against Google filed in Illinois serves as a warning to all the millions of families enthralled by their pandemic-gifted Chromebooks. Father-of-two Clinton Farwell alleges that Google illegally collected personally identifying biometric information from his children through their public school-issued Chromebooks (loaded with G Suite for Education apps) dating back to 2015. His suit lays out how Google has \"infiltrated\" K-12 education with hardware and software primarily targeting students under the age of 13, whose face templates and voiceprints are illicitly collected, along with their: physical locations; websites they visit; every search term they use in Google's search engine (and the results they click on); the videos they watch on YouTube; personal contact lists; voice recordings; saved passwords; and other behavioral information.</p><p>Despite signing a \"Student Privacy Pledge\" promising not to collect, share and retain private personal data, Google Chromebooks scan students' faces and unique acoustic details of students' voices to identify them by name, age, gender and location while using Google platforms. Farwell realized his kids' biometric data was being stored in a vast database when he discovered they were required to speak and look into the laptops' microphones and cameras in order to use the school products and apps.</p><p>A similar lawsuit by the New Mexico Attorney General's office filed in federal court in February exposed how Chromebooks and G Suite for Education apps mined students' Gmail accounts for advertising purposes. The New Mexico AG's brief also bolstered my previous exclusive reports, based on whistleblowing by Missouri teachers Brooke Henderson and Brette Hay, on Google's access to student profiles and family computer passwords through the default Chrome Sync function   which can only be blocked by creating a passphrase buried in settings that school officials never inform students about (let alone their parents left in the dark from the moment schools require kids to create Google logins as early as kindergarten).</p><p>And now governments are entrusting Google to help develop contact-tracing technology on the promise that they won't collect location data, won't exploit data for commercial purposes, and won't grant access to unauthorized parties? Fox, meet henhouse.</p><p>Regulatory slaps on the wrist by toothless federal agencies have done nothing to deter the deceitful data usurpers. Why hasn't every other state attorney general filed a similar suit? Where is Congress, which passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to prevent exactly the kind of routine marauding of students' digital lives perpetrated by Google and other EdTech vultures? Instead of pushing back, Congress passed the \"Every Student Succeeds Act\" and the \"Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act\"   deceptively titled bills expanding third-party access to sensitive personal data.</p><p>The Invisible Enemy is right under our noses, in our homes and on our kids' laptops. Instead of removing children en masse from their classrooms in the name of public health, responsible adults should be de-platforming Google's privacy pillagers from every school in America in the name of public safety.</p><p>Michelle Malkin's email address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MichelleMalkinInvestigates@protonmail.com\">MichelleMalkinInvestigates@protonmail.com</email> To find out more about Michelle Malkin and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.creators.com\">www.creators.com</url>.</p><p>COPYRIGHT 2020 CREATORS.COM</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COPNWS-big-google-is-watching-your-children_278079</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COPNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YV5-P3K1-JC8H-N0M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157000</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Creators Syndicate, Inc.

Silicon Valley companies are feasting on an exploding client base of quarantined students held hostage to \"online learning.\" Big Google is leading the way - and that is not OK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unsuspecting parents cheering all the software and hardware donations during the pandemic shutdown have no idea the privacy price their children are paying.</p><p> This isn't charity. It's big tech recruitment of vulnerable generations of future Google addicts. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Google inked a deal to provide 4,000 \"free\" Chromebooks to students, along with \"free\" Wi-Fi to 100,000 families. In Kentucky, the Jefferson County public schools gave away 25,000 Chromebooks.</p><p> In Philadelphia, public officials earmarked $11 million to purchase 40,000 Chromebooks for homebound kids.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai crowed a few weeks ago that the company now has 100 million students and educators hooked on Google Classroom. Bent on conquering the virtual meeting market, the online giant announced that its premium Google Meet videoconferencing features are now free to all 80 million customers of its G Suite for Education apps through the fall. Google Meet is racking up 2 million new users a day as school districts abandon Zoom, the dominant virtual meeting app that recently admitted \"mistakenly\" routing non-Chinese calls through its Beijing-based data centers.</p><p> But if educators think Google will provide more protections for American students than the ChiCom government, they're blind, dumb or bought off. As I've chronicled regularly in this column over the past decade, the Silicon Valley giant has repeatedly breached federal privacy laws to extend its tentacles into children's emails, browsing habits, search engine activity, voice memos and more without parental consent. Google's information predators have previously admitted to unauthorized scanning and indexing of student email accounts and targeted online advertising based on search engine activity, as well as autosyncing of passwords, browsing history and other private data across devices and accounts belonging to students and families unaware of default tracking.</p><p> A new lawsuit seeking classaction status against Google filed in Illinois serves as a warning to all the millions of families enthralled by their pandemic-gifted Chromebooks. Father-of-two Clinton Farwell alleges that Google illegally collected personally identifying biometric information from his children through their public school-issued Chromebooks (loaded with G Suite for Education apps) dating back to 2015. His suit lays out how Google has \"infiltrated\" K-12 education with hardware and software primarily targeting students under the age of 13, whose face templates and voiceprints are illicitly collected, along with their: physical locations; websites they visit; every search term they use in Google's search engine (and the results they click on); the videos they watch on YouTube; personal contact lists; voice recordings; saved passwords; and other behavioral information.</p><p> Despite signing a \"Student Privacy Pledge\" promising not to collect, share and retain private personal data, Google Chromebooks scan students' faces and unique acoustic details of students' voices to identify them by name, age, gender and location while using Google platforms.</p><p> Farwell realized his kids' biometric data was being stored in a vast database when he discovered they were required to speak and look into the laptops' microphones and cameras in order to use the school products and apps.</p><p> A similar lawsuit by the New Mexico Attorney General's office filed in federal court in February exposed how Chromebooks and G Suite for Education apps mined students' Gmail accounts for advertising purposes. The New Mexico AG's brief also bolstered my previous exclusive reports, based on whistleblowing by Missouri teachers Brooke Henderson and Brette Hay, on Google's access to student profiles and family computer passwords through the default Chrome Sync function - which can only be blocked by creating a passphrase buried in settings that school officials never inform students about (let alone their parents left in the dark from the moment schools require kids to create Google logins as early as kindergarten).</p><p> And now governments are entrusting Google to help develop contact-tracing technology on the promise that they won't collect location data, won't exploit data for commercial purposes, and won't grant access to unauthorized parties? Fox, meet henhouse.</p><p> Regulatory slaps on the wrist by toothless federal agencies have done nothing to deter the deceitful data usurpers. Why hasn't every other state attorney general filed a similar suit? Where is Congress, which passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to prevent exactly the kind of routine marauding of students' digital lives perpetrated by Google and other EdTech vultures? Instead of pushing back, Congress passed the \"Every Student Succeeds Act\" and the \"Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act\" - deceptively titled bills expanding third-party access to sensitive personal data.</p><p> The Invisible Enemy is right under our noses, in our homes and on our kids' laptops.</p><p> Instead of removing children en masse from their classrooms in the name of public health, responsible adults should be de-platforming Google's privacy pillagers from every school in America in the name of public safety.</p><p> Michelle Malkin's email address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MichelleMalkinInvestigates@protonmail.com\">MichelleMalkinInvestigates@protonmail.com</email> To find out more about Michelle Malkin and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.creators.com\">www.creators.com</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKLA-b7981ac4d75c1e97a7e7c4d89b122543</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E53C2590B30 NWBKLA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX9-YNR1-DXVP-V2VF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401937</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"973\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 West Carroll Gazette, LSN Publishing Co., LLC.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Silicon Valley companies are feasting on an exploding client base of quarantined students held hostage to \u201conline learning.\u201d Big Google is leading the way \u2014 and that is not OK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unsuspecting parents cheering all the software and hardware donations during the pandemic shutdown have no idea the privacy price their children are paying. This isn\u2019t charity. It\u2019s big tech recruitment of vulnerable generations of future Google addicts. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Google inked a deal to provide 4,000 \u201cfree\u201d Chromebooks to students, along with \u201cfree\u201d Wi-Fi to 100,000 families. In Kentucky, the Jefferson County public schools gave away 25,000 Chromebooks. In Philadelphia, public officials earmarked $11 million to purchase 40,000 Chromebooks for homebound kids.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai crowed a few weeks ago that the company now has 100 million students and educators hooked on Google Classroom. Bent on conquering the virtual meeting market, the online giant announced that its premium Google Meet videoconferencing features are now free to all 80 million customers of its G Suite for Education apps through the fall. Google Meet is racking up 2 million new users a day as school districts abandon Zoom, the dominant virtual meeting app that recently admitted \u201cmistakenly\u201d routing non-Chinese calls through its Beijing-based data centers.</p><p> But if educators think Google will provide more protections for American students than the ChiCom government, they\u2019re blind, dumb or bought off. As I\u2019ve chronicled regularly in this column over the past decade, the Silicon Valley giant has repeatedly breached federal privacy laws to extend its tentacles into children\u2019s emails, browsing habits, search engine activity, voice memos and more without parental consent. Google\u2019s information predators have previously admitted to unauthorized scanning and indexing of student email accounts and targeted online advertising based on search engine activity, as well as autosyncing of passwords, browsing history and other private data across devices and accounts belonging to students and families unaware of default tracking.</p><p> A new lawsuit seeking class-action status against Google filed in Illinois serves as a warning to all the millions of families enthralled by their pandemic-gifted Chromebooks. Father-of-two Clinton Farwell alleges that Google illegally collected personally identifying biometric information from his children through their public school-issued Chromebooks (loaded with G Suite for Education apps) dating back to 2015. His suit lays out how Google has \u201cinfiltrated\u201d K-12 education with hardware and software primarily targeting students under the age of 13, whose face templates and voiceprints are illicitly collected, along with their: physical locations; websites they visit; every search term they use in Google\u2019s search engine (and the results they click on); the videos they watch on YouTube; personal contact lists; voice recordings; saved passwords; and other behavioral information.</p><p> Despite signing a \u201cStudent Privacy Pledge\u201d promising not to collect, share and retain private personal data, Google Chromebooks scan students\u2019 faces and unique acoustic details of students\u2019 voices to identify them by name, age, gender and location while using Google platforms. Farwell realized his kids\u2019 biometric data was being stored in a vast database when he discovered they were required to speak and look into the laptops\u2019 microphones and cameras in order to use the school products and apps.</p><p> A similar lawsuit by the New Mexico Attorney General\u2019s office filed in federal court in February exposed how Chromebooks and G Suite for Education apps mined students\u2019 Gmail accounts for advertising purposes. The New Mexico AG\u2019s brief also bolstered my previous exclusive reports, based on whistleblowing by Missouri teachers Brooke Henderson and Brette Hay, on Google\u2019s access to student profiles and family computer passwords through the default Chrome Sync function \u2014 which can only be blocked by creating a passphrase buried in settings that school officials never inform students about (let alone their parents left in the dark from the moment schools require kids to create Google logins as early as kindergarten).</p><p> And now governments are entrusting Google to help develop contact-tracing technology on the promise that they won\u2019t collect location data, won\u2019t exploit data for commercial purposes, and won\u2019t grant access to unauthorized parties? Fox, meet henhouse.</p><p> Regulatory slaps on the wrist by toothless federal agencies have done nothing to deter the deceitful data usurpers. Why hasn\u2019t every other state attorney general filed a similar suit? Where is Congress, which passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to prevent exactly the kind of routine marauding of students\u2019 digital lives perpetrated by Google and other EdTech vultures? Instead of pushing back, Congress passed the \u201cEvery Student Succeeds Act\u201d and the \u201cFoundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act\u201d \u2014 deceptively titled bills expanding third-party access to sensitive personal data.</p><p> The Invisible Enemy is right under our noses, in our homes and on our kids\u2019 laptops.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:MicheMichellMichelleMalkinInvestigates@protonmail.com\">MicheMichellMichelleMalkinInvestigates@protonmail.com</email> To find out more about Michelle Malkin and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.creators.com\">www.creators.com</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKLA-17AD628B8E34E613</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28986CA42D9F7D NWBKLA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YVM-MFB1-JBCN-43YR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401937</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Daily Review, Louisiana State Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

But then I have never liked running with the herd, especially ones full of bulls. Financial markets globally, continue to delusionly price in a semi-rapid to normality in the world as economies tentatively return from COVID-19 lockdowns. That is not going to happen in the slightest. A reality check should be the levels of government intervention and support in the global economy so far. That will all have to be paid back, but big Government will be back in a very 70/80's manner for some time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Related articles</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is true, though, is that the world's central banks seem to be prepared to back-stop the poorest of investment decisions to keep the lights on in the global economy. The Federal Reserve's move to buy \"high yield\" debt in vast quantities if necessary, effectively signalled that. The ECB has removed its country-specific limits on individual bonds to obtain as well, marking a high yield-lite strategy. The BOJ has been buying everything for quite some time, including ETF's on the stock exchange for some reason. </p><p>Little surprise then that equities globally are or have moved into \"official\" bull markets. Or that the market itself is painting a narrative to explain it. Direct debt monetisation by other central banks, including our own in Indonesia, is also occurring regularly, with even the Reserve Bank of New Zealand suggesting negative rates are not of the table. I am so glad I am long property there. </p><p>When central banks plug their fingers in holes in the dike in one place, leaks tend to occur in other areas. In this case, those leaks may well manifest themselves in the form of inflation, as gigantic government borrowing requirements crown out the private sector. Peak globalisation and supply chains that have a national, rather than international look about them, thus raising costs, will also assist. Investors should be clear in differentiating central bank largesse back-stopping investment decisions, from economic reality. Reality usually wins in the end, but that economist \"return to the mean\" can take a long time to manifest. There is a world of difference between a bull market, and bs. </p><p>Still, that does not mean that momentum will fade anytime soon. Far from it, in fact. The bulls have the upper hand this week for sure, with a dovish outlook from the FOMC and further easing from the ECB sure to please. Big tech continues to report this week, with Microsoft and Facebook next up today. We also have US GDP this evening, with the US expected to have contracted by 4.0% in Q1. Even that staggering number will likely be ignored though, as markets prefer to take hope from the partial reopening of States across the nation. Even ones like Florida, where the COVID-19 death rate is still increasing. Like inflation, the limits of monetary policy, and the competence of governments leadership across the world, a COVID-19 second wave is a story for another day. Bask instead on Asia joining the \"20%\" FOMO club.</p><p>Asia stocks rise on easy money and peak virus hopes.As I have stated, Asian stocks have risen this morning as US index futures rallied strong, with the S&amp;P e-mini up over 1.20%, and the NASDAQ futures are rising 1.50%. The street is pricing in a very dovish outlook from the FOMC this evening, which should surprise no-one and more strong news from big-tech Q1 earnings, after the Alphabet Inc. results. With strongly positive momentum, even a poor US GDP print this evening will likely be twisted as backwards looking and ignored. </p><p>Japan is on holiday today, but the rest of Asia is performing well. Mainland China's Shanghai composite has risen 0.50% and the CSI 300 by 0.70%. The Korean Kospi is 0.70% higher with the Straits Times 0.50 higher, and the Hang Seng up 0.25%. Regional markets, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, have climbed 0.50%. </p><p>Australia continues to perform strongly on the global recovery story and their exits from COVID-19 lockdowns. The ASX 200 and All Ordinaries have jumped 1.20%. </p><p>We fully expect Europe to pick up the baton, as they did yesterday, and continue with the rally started in Asia. With the US ignoring the rest of the stock markets results, only slip-ups by Facebook and Microsoft will upset the boat.</p><p> Related articles</p><p>The US Dollar continues to ease as global sentiment improves.The haven status of the US Dollar meant that it yet again gave ground overnight and this morning against the majors and emerging market currencies. EUR/USD has risen to 1.0850 with GBP/USD climbing 40 points to 1.2470 as oil prices rose today. With the Bank of Japan decision out of the way and a dovish FOMC to come, USD/JPY continues to fall, down 30 points to a one-month low of 106.50 today. Having fallen from 108.00 last week, USD/JPY looks still to have more downside potential.</p><p>The Australian Dollar has risen by over 1.0% in the last two sessions, up 30 points to 0.6536 today. With a high beta to commodities and world growth, its outperformance is no surprise. The AUD/USD faces a stern test of resistance at its 100-day moving average, just above at 0.6570. New Zealand is catching much the same tailwinds, the NZD/USD climbing nearly 1.0% to 0.6100 by this morning, having risen from 0.5900 last week. Having broken the 50-day moving average at 0.6670, Kiwi now eyes resistance at 0.6150 as its next target. </p><p>The jump in oil today has seen USD/CAD fall 40 points to 1.3937. We would expect other Petro-currencies such as NOK and RUB to outperform once Europe arrives, assuming oil holds its gains.</p><p>Across Asia, the CNY, KRW, SGD are all stronger versus the US Dollar today. We expect regional currencies to remain gently bid for the remainder of the session and into tomorrow, ahead of the May Day holiday on Friday.</p><p>WTI rallies impressively in Asia. Even with WTI's low, low price exaggerating the percentage moves in prices each day now, WTI's rally in Asia this morning has been impressive. WTI has surged by 14.0% to $14.00 a barrel today. That has dragged Brent crude higher by 3.25% to $ 23.50 a barrel.</p><p>The generally positive mood sweeping financial markets can only partly account for this morning's WTI rally. Liquidity in Asia, or lack of it, has undoubtedly exaggerated the move higher, with Japan away today. The June WTI contract is also where angels fear to tread now as the USO oil ETF and anyone else with a long position in it, desperately tries to roll their positions into forward months to avoid the mid-May contract expiry. It may well be that much of the speculative long positions have been rolled forward now that have to be. </p><p>I have my doubts with regards to that thesis, though. Bear in mind that the WTI June contract will not necessarily move around on fundamentals, rather than on liquidity at a given time. The supply/demand situation in the world continues to have a massive overhang of oil of 20 million barrels per day. That does not favour a sustained increase in oil prices.</p><p>One ray of hope for WTI though could occur next week. The regulators in Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota are all set to decide whether producing oil at these prices in those states is 'wasting resources.\" Clearly, it is, and that has given the state authorities the power to force state-wide production cuts on producers or let them shutter wells without losing their concessions. What OPEC+ and the US President could not achieve, arcane regulatory bodies at a state level, might.</p><p>Gold continues its unexciting price action.It may well be that with so much action going on in equity and energy markets, gold has just fallen off investors' radars for now. Overnight, gold eased to the bottom of its recent range, at $1710.00 an ounce, remaining their unchanged today.</p><p>Gold's time will come again, possibly driven by a sudden reversal and realisation of reality by financial markets. That though is unlikely to be this week. With much of the world on holiday on Friday, gold may find weekend event risk buyers in tomorrow's session. But for today, gold looks set to probe the downside of its recent range, possibly edging below $1700.00 an ounce later today. </p><p>In the bigger picture, gold continues to mark time in a longer-term $1640.00 to $1740.00 an ounce range, with the shorter-term range probably confined between $1700.00 and $1720.00 an ounce. Given my track record on gold in general, I understand the murmurs of \"famous last words\" entirely.</p><p> Related articles Furlough warning: Pension contributions could drop by nearly \u00a3300 Coronavirus cancellations: Refund policies to be reassessed Oil price crisis: Crude prices continue to tumble</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXPONL-62498567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXPONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSN-DP81-F021-62J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1436\"/><timeReceived>8:27 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Northern and Shell Media Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Express Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12327\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

From attempts to suppress strong encryption technology to the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and China's \"Great Firewall,\" such efforts have generally proven ineffectual. But things are changing, and not for the better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Parliament recently passed a \"Copyright Directive\" which, if implemented, will force Internet platforms to actively monitor user content instead of putting the burden of proving copyright infringement on those claiming such infringement. The directive also includes a \"link tax\" under which publishers will charge aggregation platforms for traditionally \"fair use\" excerpts.</p><p>The U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment is attempting to force the sale of Grindr, a gay dating app, over \"national security\" concerns. Grindr is owned by a Chinese company, Beijing Kunlun.</p><p>CFIUS's supposed fear is that the Chinese government will use information the app gathers to surveil or even blackmail users in sensitive political and military jobs.</p><p>Those are just two current examples of many.</p><p>Big Governments and Big Tech are engaged in a long-term mating dance.</p><p>Big Governments want to regulate Big Tech because that's what governments do, and because, as with Willie Sutton and banks, Big Tech is where the Big Tax Money is.</p><p>Big Tech wants to be regulated by Big Governments because regulation makes it more difficult and expensive for new competitors to enter the market. Facebook doesn't want someone else to make it the next MySpace. Google doesn't want a fresh new face to send it the way of Yahoo.</p><p>It's a mating dance with multiple suitors on all sides.</p><p>The U.S. doesn't like Grindr or Huawei, because FREEDUMB.</p><p>The Chinese don't want uncensored Google or Twitter, because ORDER.</p><p>The EU is at least honest about being sexually indiscriminate: It freely admits that it just wants to rigorously screw everyone, everything, everywhere.</p><p>Big Tech wants to operate in all of these markets and it's willing to buy every potential Big Government as many drinks as it takes to get them all into the sack.</p><p>Everybody wins, I guess. Except the public.</p><p>Governments and would-be monopolists are fragmenting what once advertised itself as a Global Information Superhighway into hundreds of gated streets.</p><p>Those streets are lined by neatly manicured lawns per the homeowners' association's rigorously enforced rules, and herbicide is sprayed on those lawns to kill off the values that made the Internet the social successor to the printing press and the economic successor to the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>As Stewart Brand wrote, \"Information wants to be free. Information also wants to be expensive. ... That tension will not go away.\"</p><p>Big Tech and Big Government are both coming down, increasingly effectively, on the side of \"expensive\" and on the side of Ford's Model T philosophy (\"you can have any color you want as long as it's black\").</p><p>They're killing the Internet. They're killing the future. They're killing us.</p><p>Thomas L. Knapp (Twitter: @thomaslknapp) is director and senior news analyst at the William Lloyd Garrison Center for Libertarian Advocacy Journalism (thegarrisoncenter.org). He lives and works in north central Florida.</p><p>Big Governments and Big Tech are engaged in a long-term mating dance.</p><p>Your Turn</p><p>Thomas L.

Around three-quarters is focused on finance and technology, but the rest meanders around life, taxes, government, the economy, global trade, regulatory matters and more. All of these latter areas can probably be summed up right now as: INTERNET ANGER No, I'm not angry with the internet. I love it. </p><p>But governments, economies, trade, commerce and others are pretty angry with the big internet giants on two major fronts: their lack of regulation and lack of taxation. This builds on my blogs of the other week, but I've noticed three major movements to change the internet world recently. The first has been the momentum behind Liz Warren, the possible democratic candidate for President of the US of A. She's been very outspoken against the silicon valley giants and even blogged about it on Medium:[1] 'Today's big tech companies have too much power\u2014too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation and I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish. To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.' You have Mark Zuckerberg responding[2]: 'You have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companiesif she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.' This tension between tech innovation and government regulation has existed for a long time. Just look at the US regulator's decision to break up Microsoft[3] back in the 1990s to see. <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gates-Senate.jpg\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gates-Senate.jpg</url> The issue is the power of the internet firms, their abuse of customer, avoidance of governance and dodging of tax. The US fails completely to regulate the big technology firms. China does a better job - at least their internet giants work with government and not against it - and Europe is caught in the middle. Europe is doing something about that however, and Margrethe Vestager the Competition Commissioner and now Digital Lead for the EU is committed to change things. This is where the second key debate takes off: tax. Vestager is demanding that digital giants pay proper tax. She has some backing too[4]. 'Expectations are rife that the G20 group of the world's biggest economies will seal an OECD proposal that aims to find an agreement on taxing global tech giants by June next year  'The OECD proposal\u2014negotiated by 134 countries\u2014would mean reallocating some profits and taxation rights to countries where digital giants do business, regardless of where the giants are headquartered. 'The new rules would mean that such companies would be taxed in places where they conduct significant business even if they do not have aphysical presence[5]there\u2014an increasing reality in the digital age  'If achieved, the deal will have survived major resistance, including by Washington and low tax nations such as Ireland or Luxembourg where big tech have set up international headquarters.' The issue for Ireland and Luxembourg is losing big employment and investment in their economies as tax arbitrage is all that keeps the Apple's, Google's and Facebook's in their domains. In fact, their issue is that if the G20 don't go ahead with this plan, then the EU will do it alone[6]. Ireland and Luxembourg, watch out! Meantime, this is not the end of the issue. The end of the issue was highlighted by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen[7]. If you didn't see or hear it, please listen and watch. It's an amazing speech and only 25 minutes long. [embedded content] In it, he says things like: 'Zuckerberg at Facebook, Sundar Pichai at Google, at its parent company Alphabet, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Brin's ex-sister-in-law, Susan Wojcicki at YouTube and Jack Dorsey at Twitter. 'The Silicon Six\u2014all billionaires, all Americans\u2014who care more about boosting their share price than about protecting democracy. This is ideological imperialism\u2014six unelected individuals in Silicon Valley imposing their vision on the rest of the world, unaccountable to any government and acting like they're above the reach of law. It's like we're living in the Roman Empire, and Mark Zuckerberg is Caesar. At least that would explain his haircut. 'Here's an idea. Instead of letting the Silicon Six decide the fate of the world, let our elected representatives, voted for by the people, of every democracy in the world, have at least some say.' You get the idea. In fact, one of his core statements that hit most headlines was: 'Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem'.' Ouch! The unregulated, data abusing, advertising whores who are the internet giants are an issue, according to Sacha Baron Cohen. Actually, it's not just him but everyone. Another British comedian, David Mitchell,also highlighted this issue[8]. 'I think the internet and the smartphone have been a disaster for civilisation. I think it would be very helpful for us to see it as a disaster, see it as something like nuclear weapons. It's easier to get taxis, but that's it. It's addictive. It changes the nature of discourse in a horrible way. What was billed as the democratisation of knowledge has turned into the death of truth.' He rightly picks out that people believe extremism views today, because they are not getting facts checked and vetted. Baron Cohen rightly picks out that when we watch TV or read newspapers, they have to get their facts right. It's a law. On the internet, there is no law. Will this change? Possibly, but only if the internet is changed. The internet has to allow for users to own their identities and their data. Tim Berners-Lee has a few words to say[9] about that: One of the fiercest critics of themodern internet[10]is the man who created it, Tim Berners-Lee. As the father of the web he has beenvocally critical[11]about the current state of the internet and how it is dominated by a small number of powerful companies, and how usershave little control over their online data[12]. This week, Berners-Lee unveiled his answer to these problems with a global action plan to tackle issues of access, privacy and openness of the web. The Contract for the Web lays out nine key principals for a better internet, including promoting affordable internet access for all, respecting people's privacy and data rights, not allowing governments to cut off internet access and, perhaps most ambitiously of all given the current state of political rhetoric, building 'strong communities that respect civil discourse and human dignity.' Good luck with that Tim. I just have this gut feeling that there's a few billionaires in Silicon Valley who will fight tooth and nail against it.

He has indicated\u00a0support [3]\u00a0for a nationwide version of California\u00a0Assembly Bill 5 [4], which is designed to hobble tech firms by eliminating their use of contractors as workers \u2014 something that would undermine their entire business model. Even some conservatives, frustrated by liberal bias in Silicon Valley, seem open to the idea of unleashing the feds on Amazon, Google, and Facebook.<br/>Yet as we\u2019re all dealing with this bizarre coronavirus crisis, we ought to ask ourselves a question: What\u2019s helping us more, the tech firms that are providing needed goods and services or the government that\u2019s slowing down the economy? Are we benefiting more by DoorDash and Amazon deliveries or by police arresting people for taking a walk in the park or\u00a0surfing [5]? Gov. Gavin Newsom can issue edicts, but we\u2019re all left fending for ourselves.<br/>The \u201cstay in place [6]\u201d orders seem to be accelerating trends that already are taking place throughout the economy. Instead of waiting in line at the grocery stores, we simply order essential household goods through Amazon. Most of us have enjoyed not having to schlep home dog food, cat litter, and other bulky items. Now that grocery shopping has become a potentially dangerous and highly annoying chore, these services are godsends.<br/>\u201cWhile the rest of the economy is tanking from the crippling impact of coronavirus, business at the biggest technology companies is holding steady \u2014 even thriving,\u201d according to a recent\u00a0New York Times\u00a0report [7]. It noted that Amazon was hiring 100,000 warehouse workers \u201cto meet surging demand\u201d and video calling and messaging has exploded on Facebook.<br/>Now more than ever, these tech innovations are helping us cope with this mess. And they\u2019re providing a needed bright spot in an economy that is dangerously close to\u00a0recession [8]. We should be pleased that any company is hiring now, any stocks are soaring, and any companies are figuring out innovative ways to deliver food, medicine, and other essential products to people who are largely outlawed from leaving their homes. The alternative is downright scary.<br/>Government\u2019s approach is predictable. It amounts to mainly shutting things down and then, at times, stepping up police enforcement of routine behaviors. My wife and I left the house to walk on some trails in a remote rural area and, sure enough, the trails were closed by state wildlife officials. We\u2019ve seen incidents of surfers being arrested for surfing along vacant beaches, and police who ticket and fine people who are out doing \u201cnon-essential\u201d things. Fortunately, we\u2019re all using various workarounds \u2014 ordering food and supplies online, having teleconferences with our colleagues, using technology to keep our lives functioning. Thank goodness for Netflix, which provides an endless array of\u00a0binge-watching [9]\u00a0options as we\u2019re stuck bored at home.<br/>Foes of the tech firms want to treat them like public utilities, but even if that were philosophically acceptable \u2014 and it\u2019s not, from a limited-government perspective \u2014 it\u2019s a bad idea for practical reasons. As I\u00a0wrote [10]\u00a0for the\u00a0American Spectator\u00a0in its fall print magazine, \u201cUtilities operate expensively and poorly mainly because of their government-granted monopoly status and subsidies.\u201d They are at the bottom of the list of open, efficient, and competitive companies.<br/>Here in California, the bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. was recently shutting down electric service to certain areas in the midst of raging wildfires. The company agreed to a host of new government regulations at the insistence of the governor, which simply is the\u00a0latest example [11]\u00a0of the degree to which government officials end up controlling these companies. But think about the nightmarish possibilities if tech firms were run this way.<br/>So far, we\u2019re all getting electricity from our outlets and water from our taps, but if the regulators force these companies to pare back to help \u201cprotect\u201d public workers from COVID-19, don\u2019t be surprised if we\u2019re stuck with limited service \u2014 say brownouts in the afternoons, or calls to conserve more water. It all depends on how far the governor, who already has threatened to impose statewide\u00a0martial law [12], will be willing to take things.<br/>Meanwhile, private companies \u2014 operating in response to demand, and seeking to maximize their supposedly dreaded\u00a0profits [13]\u00a0\u2014 will be finding increasingly clever ways to keep our lives going. Would you rather rely on a government-controlled monopoly or on a host of lightly regulated technology businesses when the chips are down? I know my answer.<br/>The good news is perhaps the COVID-19 shutdown will remind us of how poorly many old-line industries and government services have long operated. For instance, most governors have put an end to the\u00a0school year [14], but schools that embrace cyberlearning can keep their systems running without missing a beat. Of course, unions and other government actors will try to keep that from happening.<br/>After Pennsylvania indefinitely closed the public schools, \u201cthe Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators pressured government officials to impose a moratorium on any new enrollments into publicly funded cyber charter schools while traditional public schools are unable to teach students in person,\u201d\u00a0wrote [15]\u00a0Kevin Mooney in the\u00a0Washington Examiner. The needs of students obviously aren\u2019t nearly as important as job protections for administrators.<br/>Instead of targeting the tech firms, conservatives need to keep their eye on the ball. The only saving graces during these tough times are the\u00a0innovative companies [16]\u00a0that are allowing us to conduct our lives at least semi-normally. When this is over, the attacks on the tech industry ought to go the way of the Sanders, Warren, and Biden campaigns.<br/>Endnotes<br/>\u201cvowing\u201d: <url

No, the question is not being posed in relation to statements by some kooky conspiracy theorist. It stems from a much more credible source: Tim Cook, CEO of Apple. </p><p>Cook made the remarks in a speech in Brussels last week at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners. He said, \"Rogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence, and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false. This crisis is real. It is not imagined, or exaggerated, or crazy.\" The Apple CEO underlined how data is now regarded as the new oil because \"countless decisions are made, on the basis of our likes and dislikes, our friends and families, our relationships and conversations. Our wishes and fears, our hopes and dreams.\" These translate into transactions worth billions of dollars. What's most troubling is that whilst each morsel of data may be innocuous in isolation, when they are \"carefully assembled, synthesised, traded, and sold,\" they become extremely valuable as detailed profiles of a person's activities can be constructed for commercial purposes. And it's not just businesses that are engaging in this profiling. As Cook explained, \"Your profile is then run through algorithms that can serve up increasingly extreme content, pounding our harmless preferences into hardened convictions.\" In other words, misinformation and manipulation campaigns as exemplified by the Russian election interference during the 2016 US elections fuel extremism and groupthink and infect the political arena. As an antidote, Cook expressed support for the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and advocated for a federal privacy law in the United States. He made the case for four rights to secure privacy: the right to have personal data minimised; the right for users to know what personal data is collected; the right to access that data; and the right for data security. To be clear, the Apple CEO might be engaging in cheap talk. Unlike many of its tech rivals, Apple's business model is not currently heavily reliant on collecting tonnes of user data. That is the province of Facebook, Google, and other players. And Facebook, in particular, has endured an annus horribilis following revelations about Cambridge Analytica and other scandals. Similarly, Google has been under the microscope from lawmakers in the United States about its privacy practices and targeted advertising of users. Therefore, Cook, recognising that regulation may be on the horizon might be sticking the knife into competitors knowing that they have more to lose from strict data protection laws. He might also be engaging in some low-cost virtue-signalling by seeking to differentiate Apple from other tech companies. Nonetheless, Cook's warnings should not be ignored. Instead, they should be treated with the seriousness they merit and the same spotlight should be shone on Apple. Even if Apple has not experienced publicly disclosed data leaks like Facebook and other companies, the reality is that Apple devices are probably the most invasive data collection devices known to man. As anyone who owns an iPhone can attest to, the device is effectively an ankle bracelet - virtually a constant appendage of the body. It collects and transmits information even when it is not on. And most people take it everywhere - even the bathroom. The United States Supreme Court noted these worries in the recent case of Carpenter - concerning the collection of cell phone location data. Chief Justice Roberts wrote in his majority opinion that cell phones have become virtually a \"feature of human anatomy.\" During oral arguments, Justice Sotomayor, observed that the government was virtually in the bedroom as most people took their phones with them to bed. Similar concerns animated Justice Chandrachud's dissenting opinion in the Aadhaar case in the Indian Supreme Court recently. The judges in the majority opinion accepted the government's justifications and assurances about data collected every time the Aadhaar card is used not being aggregated for commercial or surveillance purposes. However, Justice Chandrachud's opinion raises the prospect of how sensitive biometric data could be aggregated with other data such as location and banking to construct profiles that provide detailed information about a person's whereabouts and activities. Even if this is not being done currently, there is little assurance that it will not be done in the future. Hence the absolute need for data minimalisation - the only way to prevent abuse is to not provide unnecessary data. There is absolutely no need for iris scans and finger prints to be provided to a mobile phone operator or to a bank to open a bank account. Apple's CEO ended with a warning: \"We shouldn't sugarcoat the consequences. This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them . This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\" Unfortunately, the warnings appear to be falling on deaf ears - consumers are parting with private information in a remarkably cavalier way, and data breaches do not appear to be altering this behaviour. In fact, with every breach, the attendant invasions of privacy appear to be becoming the new normal. Coevally, governments in many countries are taking advantage of lax consumer attitudes to collect vast troves of data - ranging from India's Aadhaar scheme to China's pervasive use of facial recognition and web surveillance. These actions are being justified on grounds of being necessary for the efficient provision of government benefits (India) or maintaining order and tackling crime (China). Our privacy rights - earned over centuries of contestation with the state - should not be sacrificed at the altar of devices that are barely a few decades old. Once lost, humankind may find privacy hard to regain and regress into an animal existence. There is no app to fix that problem.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

The definition is largely subjective and refers to datasets of a size that is beyond the ability of typical database tools to capture, archive, and manage. Sources can include human and machine generated unstructured data such as logfiles, semi-structured such as documents and structured relational data. Rather than being defined in terms of \"greater than x terabytes\", as storage and the capacity of database tools increases, so will the definition of what constitutes big data.</p><p>Information is now growing at a faster rate than our electronic systems improve (Moore's Law states that that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit can be expected to double approximately every two years). According to IDC estimates, the average enterprise will need to manage 50 times more information by 2020 while increasing IT staff by only 1.5 per cent - a challenge that businesses will have to respond to in an efficient manner.</p><p>BIG DATA AND FINANCE In the financial sector, the stipulations of ever mounting layers of regulation - such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive review (Mifid II) - as well as increased volumes of data are driving the requirements for exponentially increasing data storage and analysis. \"On some days in 2011, data volumes were almost double that of the previous day,\" says Simon Garland, chief strategist at Kx Solutions. \"In addition, events such as the flash crash have brought wild, short-term increases in data volumes to the forefront of concerns, while problems in the Eurozone have resulted in market instability and therefore increased volatility.\"</p><p>ABOVE AND BEYOND Beyond simply achieving regulatory compliance for transactional reporting and best execution, companies should also be focusing on making big data analytics work for their business. Through data intelligence mining and analytics, behavioural modeling and inference-based decisions, big data can be used to provide a competitive advantage.</p><p>In the finance sector, financial risk modeling, near real-time financial analysis and cyber security and threat analysis can all be given the edge with the aid of big data sets and powerful analytics. \"With big data, none of it can be discarded,\" says Garland. \"All of it must be analysed, tick by tick. The institution that does that will spot market opportunities which someone just working with aggregated data could miss.\"</p><p>\"Every two days we create as much information as we did from the dawn of civilisation up until 2003\" - Eric Schmidt, former Google chief executive</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Data volumes are increasing exponentially</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture: GETTY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">56125739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54TG-HVS1-JCC9-V22G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"455\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 City A.M.

The entire series of posts is available here[1].]This post is authored by Ramsi Woodcock[2], Assistant Professor, College of Law, and Assistant Professor, Department of Management at Gatton College of Business ...onomics, University of Kentucky.When in 2011 Paul Krugman attacked[3] the press for bending over backwards to give equal billing to conservative experts on social security, even though the conservatives were plainly wrong, I celebrated. Social security isn't the biggest part of the government's budget, and calls to privatize it in order to save the country from bankruptcy were blatant fear mongering[4]. Why should the press report those calls with a neutrality that could mislead readers into thinking the position reasonable?Journalists' ethic of balanced reporting looked, at the time, like gross negligence at best, and deceit at worst. </p><p>But lost in the pathos of the moment[5] was the rationale behind that ethic, which is not so much to ensure that the truth gets into print as to prevent the press from making policy. For if journalists do not practice balance, then they ultimately decide the angle to take.And journalists, like the rest of us, will choose their own.The dark underbelly of the engaged journalism unleashed by progressives like Krugman has nowhere been more starkly exposed than in the unfolding assault of journalists, operating as a special interest, on Google, Facebook, and Amazon, three companies that writers believe have decimated their earnings[6] over the past decade.In story after story, journalists have manufactured an antitrust movement aimed at breaking up these companies, even though virtually no expert in antitrust law or economics, on either the right or the left, can find an antitrust case against them, and virtually no expert would place any of these three companies at the top of the genuinely long list[7] of monopolies in America that are due for an antitrust reckoning. Bitter ledes Headlines alone tell the story. We have: 'What Happens After Amazon's Domination Is Complete? Its Bookstore Offers Clues[8]'; 'Be Afraid, Jeff Bezos, Be Very Afraid[9]'; 'How Should Big Tech Be Reined In? Here Are 4 Prominent Ideas[10]'; 'The Case Against Google[11]'; and 'Powerful Coalition Pushes Back on Anti-Tech Fervor[12].'My favorite is: 'It's Time to Break Up Facebook[13].' Unlike the others, it belongs to an Op-Ed, so a bias is appropriate. Not appropriate, however, is the howler, contained in the article's body, that 'a host of legal scholars like Lina Khan, Barry Lynn and Ganesh Sitaraman are plotting a way forward' toward breakup. Lina Khan has never held an academic appointment. Barry Lynn does not even have a law degree. And Ganesh Sitaraman's academic specialty is constitutional law, not antitrust. But editors let it through anyway.As this unguarded moment shows, the press has treated these and other members of a small network of activists and legal scholars who operate on antitrust's fringes as representative of scholarly sentiment regarding antitrust action. The only real antitrust scholar among them is Tim Wu, who, when you look closely at his public statements, has actually gone no further than to call for Facebook to unwind[14] its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.In more sober moments, the press has acknowledged that the law does not support antitrust attacks on the tech giants. But instead of helping readers to understand why, the press instead presents this as a failure of the law. 'To Take Down Big Tech,' read one headline in The New York Times, 'They First Need to Reinvent the Law[15].' I have documented further instances of unbalanced reporting here[16].This is not to say that we don't need more antitrust in America. Herbert Hovenkamp, who the New York Times once recognized[17] as 'the dean of American antitrust law,' but has since downgraded[18] to 'an antitrust expert' after he came out against[19] the breakup movement, has advocated stronger monopsony enforcement across labor markets. Einer Elhauge at Harvard is pushing[20] to prevent index funds from inadvertently generating oligopolies in markets ranging from airlines to pharmacies. NYU economist Thomas Philippon has called[21] for deconcentration of banking. Yale's Fiona Morton has pointed[22] to rising markups across the economy as a sign of lax antitrust enforcement. Jonathan Baker has argued with great[23] sophistication[24] for more antitrust enforcement in general.But no serious antitrust scholar has traced America's concentration problem to the tech giants. Advertising monopolies old and new So why does the press have an axe to grind with the tech giants? The answer lies in the creative destruction[25] wrought by Amazon on the publishing industry, and Google and Facebook upon the newspaper industry.Newspapers were probably the most durable monopolies of the 20th century, so lucrative that Warren Buffett famously picked them as his preferred example of businesses with 'moats[26]' around them. But that wasn't because readers were willing to pay top dollar for newspapers' reporting. Instead, that was because, incongruously for organizations dedicated to exposing propaganda of all forms on their front pages, newspapers have long striven[27] to fill every other available inch of newsprint with that particular kind of corporate propaganda known as commercial advertising.It was a lucrative arrangement. Newspapers exhibit powerful network effects, meaning that the more people read a paper the more advertisers want to advertise in it. As a result, many American cities came to have but one major newspaper monopolizing[28] the local advertising market.One such local paper, the Lorain Journal of Lorain, Ohio, sparked a case[29] that has since become part of the standard antitrust curriculum in law schools. The paper tried to leverage its monopoly to destroy a local radio station that was competing for its advertising business. The Supreme Court affirmed liability for monopolization.In the event, neither radio nor television ultimately undermined newspapers' advertising monopolies. But the internet is different. Radio, television, and newspaper advertising can coexist, because they can target only groups, and often not the same ones, minimizing competition between them. The internet, by contrast, reaches individuals, making it strictly superior to group-based advertising. The internet also lets at least some firms target virtually all individuals in the country, allowing those firms to compete with all comers.You might think that newspapers, which quickly became an important web destination, were perfectly positioned to exploit the new functionality. But being a destination turned out to be a problem. Consumers reveal far more valuable information about themselves to web gateways, like search and social media, than to particular destinations, like newspaper websites. But consumer data is the key to targeted advertising.That gave Google and Facebook a competitive advantage, and because these companies also enjoy network effects\u2014search and social media get better the more people use them\u2014they inherited the newspapers' old advertising monopolies.That was a catastrophe[30] for journalists, whose earnings and employment prospects plummeted[31]. It was also a catastrophe for the public[32], because newspapers have a tradition of plowing their monopoly profits into investigative journalism, whereas Google and Facebook have instead invested their profits in new technologies like self-driving cars and cryptocurrencies. The catastrophe of countervailing power Amazon has found itself in journalists' crosshairs for disrupting another industry that feed writers: publishing. Book distribution was Amazon's first big market, and Amazon won it, driving most brick and mortar booksellers to bankruptcy[33]. Publishing, long dominated[34] by a few big houses that used their power to extract high wholesale prices from booksellers, some of the profit from which they passed on to authors as royalties, now faced a distribution industry that was even more concentrated and powerful than was publishing. The Department of Justice stamped out[35] a desperate attempt by publishers to cartelize in response, and profits, and author royalties, have continued to fall[36].Journalists, of course, are writers, and the disruption of publishing, taken together with the disruption of news, have left journalists with the impression that they have nowhere to turn to escape the new economy. The abuse of antitrust Except antitrust.Unschooled in the fine points of antitrust policy, it seems obvious to them that the Armageddon in newspapers and publishing is a problem of monopoly and that antitrust enforcers should do something about it. Only it isn't and they shouldn't. The courts have gone[37] to[38] great[39] lengths[40] over the past 130 years to distinguish between doing harm to competition, which is prohibited by the antitrust laws, and doing harm to competitors, which is not.Disrupting markets by introducing new technologies that make products better is no antitrust violation[41], even if doing so does drive legacy firms into bankruptcy, and throws their employees out of work and into the streets. Because disruption is really the only thing capitalism has going for it. Disruption is the mechanism by which market economies generate technological advances and improve living standards in the long run. The antitrust laws are not there to preserve old monopolies and oligopolies such as those long enjoyed by newspapers and publishers.In fact, by tearing down barriers to market entry, the antitrust laws strive to do the opposite: to speed the destruction and replacement of legacy monopolies with new and more innovative ones.That's why the entire antitrust establishment has stayed on the sidelines regarding the tech fight. It's hard to think of three companies that have more obviously risen to prominence over the past generation by disrupting markets using superior technologies than Amazon, Google, and Facebook. It may be possible to find an anticompetitive practice here or there\u2014I certainly have[42]\u2014but no serious antitrust scholar thinks the heart of these firms' continued dominance lies other than in their technical savvy. The nuclear option of breaking up these firms just makes no sense here.Indeed, the disruption inflicted by these firms on newspapers and publishing is a measure of the extent to which these firms have improved book distribution and advertising, just as the vast disruption created by the industrial revolution was a symptom of the extraordinary technological advances of that period. Few people, and not even Karl Marx, thought that the solution to those disruptions lay with Ned Ludd. The solution to the disruption wrought by Google, Amazon, and Facebook today similarly does not lie in using the antitrust laws to smash the machines.Governments eventually learned to address the disruption created by the original industrial revolution not by smashing the big firms that brought that revolution about, but by using tax and transfer, and rate regulation, to ensure that the winners share their gains with the losers. However the press's campaign turns out, rate regulation, not antitrust, is ultimately the approach that government will take to Amazon, Google, and Facebook if these companies continue to grow in power. Because we don't have to decide between social justice and technological advance. We can have both. And voters will demand it.Concerns regarding excessive pricing power by Amazon in the book market, and Google in advertising, will ultimately be addressed through rate regulation or other policies aimed at wealth redistribution, just as concerns about pricing of industrial age networks, such as railroads and telephones, were addressed through Interstate Commerce Commission and Federal Communication Commission price regulation. The anti-progress wing of the progressive movement Alas, smashing the machines is precisely what journalists and their supporters are demanding in calling for the breakup of Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Zephyr Teachout, for example, recently told an audience[43] at Columbia Law School that she would ban targeted advertising except for newspapers. That would restore newspapers' old advertising monopolies, but also make targeted advertising less effective, for the same reason that Google and Facebook are the preferred choice of advertisers today. (Of course, making advertising more effective might not be a good thing. More on this below.)This contempt for technological advance has been coupled with a broader anti-intellectualism, best captured by an extraordinary remark made by Barry Lynn, director of the pro-breakup Open Markets Institute, and sometime advocate for the Author's Guild[44]. The Times quotes[45] him saying that because the antitrust laws once contained a presumption against mergers to market shares in excess of 25%, all policymakers have to do to get antitrust right is 'be able to count to four. We don't need economists to help us count to four.'But size really is not a good measure of monopoly power. Ask Nokia, which controlled[46] more than half the market for cell phones in 2007, on the eve of Apple's introduction of the iPhone, but saw its share fall almost to zero by 2012. Or Walmart, the nation's largest[47] retailer and a monopolist in many smaller retail markets, which nevertheless saw its stock fall[48] after Amazon announced one-day shipping.Journalists themselves acknowledge[49] that size does not always translate into power when they wring their hands about the Amazon-driven financial troubles of vast nationwide retailers like Macy's. Determining whether a market lacks competition really does require more than counting the number of big firms in the market.I keep waiting for a devastating critique of arguments that Amazon operates in highly competitive markets to emerge from the big tech breakup movement. But that's impossible for a movement that rejects economics as a corporate plot[50]. Indeed, even an economist as pro-antitrust as Thomas Philippon, who advocates a return to antitrust's mid-20th century golden age of massive breakups or firms like Alcoa and AT...affirms[51] in a new book that American retail is actually a bright spot in an otherwise concentrated economy.But you won't find journalists highlighting that. The headline of a Times column promoting Philippon's book? 'Big Business Is Overcharging you $5000 a Year[52].' I tend to agree. But given all the anti-tech fervor in the press, Philippon's chapter on why the tech giants are probably not an antitrust problem ought to get a mention somewhere in the column. It doesn't.John Maynard Keynes famously observed[53] that 'though no one will believe it\u2014economics is a technical and difficult subject.' So too antitrust. A failure to appreciate the field's technical difficulty is manifest also in Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's antitrust proposals, which were heavily influenced[54] by breakup advocates.Warren has argued that no large firm should be able to compete on its own platform[55]s, not seeming to realize that doing business means competing on your own platforms. To show up to work in the morning in your own office space is to compete on a platform, your office, from which you exclude competitors. The rule that large firms (defined by Warren as those with more than $25 billion in revenues) cannot compete on their own platforms would just make doing large amounts of business illegal, something Warren no doubt does not desire. The power of the press The press's campaign against Amazon, Google, and Facebook is working. Because while they may not be as well financed as Amazon, Google, or Facebook, writers can offer their friends something more valuable than money: publicity.That appears to have induced a slew of politicians, including both Senator Warren on the left and Senator Josh Hawley[56] on the right, to pander to breakup advocates. The House antitrust investigation[57] into the tech giants, led by a congressman who is simultaneously championing[58] legislation advocated[59] by the News Media Alliance, a newspaper trade group, to give newspapers an exemption[60] from the antitrust laws, may also have similar roots. So too the investigations[61] announced by dozens of elected state attorneys general.The investigations[62] recently opened by the FTC and Department of Justice may signal no more than a desire not to look idle while so many others act. Which is why the press has the power to turn fiction into reality. Moreover, under the current Administration, the Department of Justice has already undertaken two suspiciously[63] partisan[64] antitrust investigations, and President Trump has made clear his hatred[65] regarding the liberal bastions that are Amazon, Google and Facebook. The fact that the press has made antitrust action against the tech giants a progressive cause provides convenient cover for the President to take down some enemies. The future of the news Rate regulation of Amazon, Google, or Facebook is the likely long-term resolution of concerns about these firms' power. But that won't bring back newspapers, which henceforth will always play the loom to Google and Facebook's textile mills, at least in the advertising market.Journalists and their defenders, like Teachout, have been pushing to restore newspapers' old monopolies by government fiat. No doubt that would make existing newspapers, and their staffs, very happy. But what is good for Big News is not necessarily good for journalism in the long run.The silver lining to the disruption of newspapers' old advertising monopolies is that it has created an opportunity for newspapers to wean themselves off a funding source that has always made little sense for organizations dedicated to helping Americans make informed, independent decisions. For advertising has always been manipulative in part, and, as I have argued[66], has now become exclusively manipulative in the information age, because consumers now can get all the product information they want for free on the internet.Manipulation causes consumers to buy products they don't really want, giving firms that advertise a competitive advantage that they don't deserve. That makes for an antitrust problem, this time with real consequences not just for competitors, but also for technological advance, as manipulative advertising drives dollars away from superior products toward advertised products, and away from investment in innovation and toward investment in consumer seduction.The solution is to ban all advertising, targeted or not, rather than to give newspapers an advertising monopoly. And to give journalism the state subsidies that, like all public goods, from defense to highways, are journalism's genuine due. The BBC provides a model[67] of how that can be done without fear of government influence.Indeed, Teachout's proposed newspaper advertising monopoly is itself just a government subsidy, but a subsidy extracted through an advertising medium that harms consumers. Direct government subsidization achieves the same result, without the collateral consumer harm.The press's brazen advocacy of antitrust action against the tech giants, without making clear how much the press itself has to gain from that action, and the utter absence of any expert support for this approach, represents an abdication by the press of its responsibility to create an informed citizenry that is every bit as profound as the press's lapses on social security a decade ago.I'm glad we still have social security. But I'm also starting to miss balanced journalism. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fbig-ink-vs-bigger-tech%2F...kname=Big%20Ink%20vs.%20Bigger%20Techhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fbig-ink-vs-bigger-tech%2F...kname=Big%20Ink%20vs.%20Bigger%20Techhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fbig-ink-vs-bigger-tech%2F...kname=Big%20Ink%20vs.%20Bigger%20Techhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fbig-ink-vs-bigger-tech%2F...le=Big%20Ink%20vs.%20Bigger%20TechThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fbig-ink-vs-bigger-tech%2F...kname=Big%20Ink%20vs.%20Bigger%20Techhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fbig-ink-vs-bigger-tech%2F...kname=Big%20Ink%20vs.%20Bigger%20Techhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fbig-ink-vs-bigger-tech%2F...kname=Big%20Ink%20vs.%20Bigger%20Techhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fbig-ink-vs-bigger-tech%2F...le=Big%20Ink%20vs.%20Bigger%20TechThe</url> post Big Ink vs. Bigger Tech[68] appeared first on Truth on the Market[69].

The hedge fund Jana Partners also reduced its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter.</p><p>Even Berkshire Hathaway, which has spent the past three years gobbling up shares of Apple, cut back its holdings in the company.</p><p>And Apple was not the only tech titan that big investors were selling last quarter.</p><p>Jana, along with Third Point, sold all its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Third Point exited its position in Netflix. Leon Cooperman\u2019s firm, Omega Advisors, sold its stake in Facebook and reduced its holdings in Alphabet. And Tiger Global Management decreased its holdings in Amazon.</p><p>The filings are the latest evidence of how quickly investors soured on Big Tech late last year as the industry\u2019s woes mounted. A stream of revelations about privacy lapses and security issues had raised the specter of increased regulation on both sides of the Atlantic. But of more immediate concern for investors late last year was whether these companies could continue to grow amid a slowing global economy and an escalating trade war between China and the United States.</p><p>Over the final three months of last year, tech shares dropped 13 percent to 30 percent, erasing more than $1 trillion in market value. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 fell 14 percent.</p><p>The selling signaled a swift shift in sentiment among big hedge funds. Many of these fund managers had struggled to beat the broader market in recent years. So as tech stocks soared and drove much of the broader market\u2019s gains, hedge funds crammed their portfolios with their shares.</p><p>The selling caught the hedge fund industry off guard, and their losses mounted during the fourth-quarter tumult in the stock market.</p><p>So far this year, shares of the tech companies have recovered, but most have not fared as well as the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Earnings for the final three months of 2018 were better than investors feared, but they did not inspire confidence that Big Tech would weather a global economic slowdown well, particularly in China.</p><p>Whether investors will pile back into tech stocks will probably depend on the outcome of trade talks between China and the United States. Until then, many investors may stay on the sidelines.</p><p>PHOTO: Apple was prominent among the large tech stocks that big investors dumped last quarter.

But there are tempting opportunities in today's market if you realize that this tech boom is fundamentally different than the last one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not about technology. It's about money.</p><p>At some point over the past couple of years, banks and technology firms switched places. Banks used to be the giants sitting on top of mountains of cash, explaining their ambitious merger and acquisition plans.</p><p>Now it's technology companies that are sitting in the same perch, counting their billions in loose change, and gobbling each other up with gusto.</p><p>The most successful tech companies have so much cash on their balance sheets that they can easily afford to pick up a multi-billion-dollar acquisition -- or a couple for that matter --whenever the whim strikes. At the end of the most recent quarter, Oracle was sitting on more than US$20-billion in cash and securities, Cisco on US$35-billion, and Microsoft on US$37-billion.</p><p>Paying up for the right acquisition is no problem for these moneybag firms. Hewlett-Packardagreed this past week to acquire 3Comfor US$3-billion. Earlier this year, Dell bought Perot Systems for US$3.9-billion, Xerox picked up Affiliated Computer Services for US$5.8-billion, and Oracle struck a deal to buy Sun Microsystems for US$7.4-billion (although that last deal is running into regulatory obstacles in Europe).</p><p>More deals are likely as tech firms try to figure out how to position themselves for a harsh new world.</p><p>One force that's defining that world is the move to \"open-source\" software, which is open to all comers at no cost. Open-source software eats into the lush margins that software companies used to charge for their proprietary products.</p><p>Another factor is competition from India, which is driving down the premium that consultants and software developers can charge for their services.</p><p>Yet another factor is the lack of a Next Big Thing -- a killer app or technology breakthrough that would encourage corporate customers to spend billions overhauling their data centres. Especially in this dismal economy, data managers don't see any compelling reason to upgrade; instead they're trying to squeeze pennies out of their IT bills.</p><p>How does a technology firm fight back against these trends? The emerging strategy is to bulk up and offer everything from software and computers to networking and consulting services, on the theory that big customers want one- stop shopping.</p><p>Not that long ago, you could easily have written down the key specialties of most of the big tech companies -- Cisco did networking, IBM did mainframes, Hewlett-Packarddid servers, and EMC did storage.</p><p>All those firms now appear to be searching for ways to broaden their product line-ups through acquisitions or close relationships with other firms. Cisco earlier this month entered into a partnership with EMC, while H-P acquired 3Com. IBM was rebuffed in its attempt to buy Sun, but it's become best buddies with Juniper, a networking firm.</p><p>The primary goal of these alliances is to offer everything that a data centre manager at a large company could possibly want in one neat package. The other goal is to do a bit of cross-selling -- when Dell recently acquired Perot Systems, a technology consulting and services firm, it became a foregone conclusion that Dell computers and servers would henceforth become Perot's favored brand.</p><p>As every major firm rushes to get bigger, it seems inevitable that more acquisitions are in the offing. Investors may want to look at a couple of ways of cashing in.</p><p>One strategy is to look for potential acquisition targets. Red Hat (RHT:NYSE) is a leader in open source software and enterprise computing based on the Linux operating system. It could make a tempting acquisition for a company like IBM. Conservative investors won't like Red Hat's price-to-earnings ratio of 62, but they'll be impressed by the firm's track record in tripling its revenue over the past four years.</p><p>Juniper Networks (JNPR: NYSE) also sports a price-to-earnings ratio north of 60. While that's a premium valuation, it too could make a nice acquisition for IBM, because of its rapidly growing revenues in the networking area.</p><p>A far more conservative investment would be CGI Group (GIB.A:TSX), the Montreal IT consultant. It's trading for only about 13 times earnings and might help to fill Dell's appetite for computer service firms that can help the computer maker to increase its share of corporate IT budgets.</p><p>Of course, you can also place a bet on the acquirer rather than on the target. In the computer world that is taking shape, big is beautiful and few companies are bigger than IBM (IBM:NYSE) or Microsoft (MSFT:NASDAQ). Both are selling for under 20 times earnings, have mountains of cash, and are broadly diversified. Their relatively modest valuations demonstrate just how different this tech boom is than the last one.</p><p>Ian McGugan is a freelance business journalist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANWNS-200911160176WCNS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANWNS2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7X3X-DGG1-2SFB-530N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><timeReceived>05:55 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Canwest News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canwest News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>November 16, 2009 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Co...</p><p>, the chief executive officers of some of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, faced intensive questioning by the House Judiciary Committee. Antitrust-driven scrutiny of market leaders is not without precedent. Contrary to the protectionist \u201cnational champion\u201d policies often pursued elsewhere, U.S. policymakers have a mostly laudable penchant for scrutinizing incumbents for efforts to entrench their success by erecting barriers against challengers. This was the fate of IBM, which endured a decade-long investigation and trial (with inconclusive results), AT&amp;T, which experienced a similar process resulting in its breakup, and Microsoft, which was compelled to open up distribution pathways to consumers.     It is now the turn of \u201cBig Tech\u201d to face examination in the court of antitrust.    This is as much a court of public opinion in which outcomes can be determined on the basis of perceptions as it is a court of law in which outcomes are (hopefully) determined on the basis of law and fact. Currently there appears to be significant bipartisan support for leveraging antitrust law to restrain leading platforms in the digital ecosystem. Some policymakers and commentators have called for deploying antitrust law\u2019s most dramatic remedies, including dissolution or other actions that would effectively convert significant functions of these platforms into public utilities.   Antitrust law does not take lightly such far-reaching interventions, and any court would insist that the government supply compelling evidence that these companies have engaged in practices that result in a net harm to competition.    Most fundamentally, it is important to remember (as now often seems to be forgotten) that mere size is  never  an offense under the antitrust laws. This principle is elementary but deserves to be restated. Decades of federal case law and regulatory guidance provide that a firm can only be liable for monopolization if \u2014 and only if \u2014 it acquires or preserves its market position through means other than \u201ccompetition on the merits.\u201d This critical qualification implies that antitrust law provides no basis for breaking up a firm or imposing any other remedy merely because that firm has secured an \u201cexcessive\u201d share of the relevant market. Winners who play fair do not get punished simply for winning.    Counterintuitively, antitrust law\u2019s refusal to reengineer marketplace outcomes merely on the basis of firm size can operate to consumers\u2019 advantage.    Consider the fact that a small number of firms enjoy large market shares in significant segments of the digital economy. This top-heavy market structure is neither accidental nor nefarious. High concentration arises from the fact that competition drives firms to spread \u201cfixed costs\u201d \u2014 developing a new operating system \u2014 over the largest possible number of units. When fixed costs are high and \u201cvariable\u201d costs \u2014 delivering one more copy of the operating system \u2014 are low, the most efficient firms naturally capture the bulk of the market. So long as actual or potential competition persists, consumers will enjoy part of the cost-savings through lower prices, and incumbents will invest in continuously improved products and services.     It will be reasonably objected that leading platforms are shielded by network effects that neutralize entry threats and enable the platform to extract a significant premium in the digital ecosystem. This familiar line of argument must overcome two obstacles.     First, technology history shows that dominant firms have typically remained exposed to entry threats. The list of fallen giants is long: IBM (personal computers), Blackberry (smartphones), AOL (internet service and email), Yahoo! (internet search), eBay (online resale), and others. These technology leaders once seemed almost unbeatable. It is therefore necessary to show why currently dominant platforms would be exceptions to this rule.   Second, the premium enjoyed by leading platforms is not necessarily a source of concern. If firms cannot enjoy significant upside from prevailing in an innovation race, there would be little incentive to enter those races in the first place. Simply dismissing profits as \u201cprofiteering\u201d overlooks the fact that it is the prospect of outsized rewards that induces entrepreneurs to undertake high-risk, high-return innovations that deliver the greatest social value over the long term.    To be clear, these considerations do not foreclose the possibility that leading technology platforms engage in certain practices that impede entry without offsetting efficiency gains or impose harms that demand legal intervention outside antitrust. In particular, it is generally overlooked that large technology firms\u2019 widespread opposition to robust intellectual property rights tilts the playing field against innovators that rely on those rights to capture returns on their R&amp;D investments. But that is principally a matter for intellectual property, not antitrust, law.    Distinguishing competitive from anti-competitive practices is uncertain and inherently fraught with the risks of false positives and false negatives. Yet what is certain is that this exercise must never indict a business practice solely because its practitioner has secured a large market share. This is especially the case in platform markets, where vigorous competition will necessarily yield a handful of big winners.   A \u201cbig is bad\u201d approach that overlooks these complexities will soon be driven by ideology, populism and competitors\u2019 private interests, rather than the fact-driven examination that best protects the public\u2019s interest in an efficient and innovative marketplace.

Together, the pair could form a perfect storm thanks to COVID-19 driving demand.  Cannabis is more popular  than ever thanks to lockdowns and vape technology and the market is predicted to be worth  $76.3 billion  by 2027). A.I. adds new business benefits for the industry that the COVID boom could mean big changes ahead for regulation.    Adrian Holguin, CEO of  CannaShark Consulting , started consulting for cannabis companies in 2017, and in three years he says the changes have been dramatic. Previously a Silicon Valley alum working in intellectual property and patents and trademark work, Holguin, now works with entrepreneurs and startups entering the cannabis industry and is bullish on the impact that AI is having: \"The use of A.I. sensors allows us to keep track of every element of the cultivation process such as water level, P.H. level, temperature, nutrient feed, etc. A.I. will also help in a lot of the automation process. Indoor growing has a history of heavy resource consumption for water and electricity, Artificial Intelligence and robotics allow the cultivating process to be more efficient and effective.\"    Holguin, believes the future of the pairing will help not only with environmental controls and quality control but A.I. also offers more business operations benefits; \"A.I. can help with cost-benefit analyses of purchasing manufacturing equipment or analyzing risks before implementing new techniques into the grow-process. If the use of A.I. in cannabis continues to go down the same path as big agriculture, it will ultimately help to reduce the costs of labor.\"      Big issues face the cannabis industry from different fronts. Legally, cannabis continues to see roadblocks, regulation changes, and challenges from across the political divide. For example, CBD, THC, and CBN are all given different National Institute on Drug Abuse classifications even though they come from the same plant. There are more than just regulatory issues for cannabis. One of the most unmentioned surrounds banking, many institutions simply don't want cannabis companies as clients. The same comes with A.I. startups, thanks to the big guns scooping them all up (Google, Facebook etc). A brain drain is happening at a cost to fill 10,000 AI-related jobs budgeted more than  $650 million  for salaries. Some forecasts in Canada have been  downgraded .     COVID-19 may change this but banking and societal views remain big barriers for scaling businesses. Research and testing also remain an issue for the industry although this is a key area that AI can assist in. As does, state voting; Vivien Azer, Managing Director, Cannabis; Consumer \u2013 Beverages, Tobacco for Cowen believes that if New Jersey voters choose to legalize the drug, it could cause a domino effect in neighboring states like New York, Pennsylvania, and others to adopt similar standards.    The biggest issue may not be these issues though. getting talent might be. Big tech companies have been actively hoovering AI startups, not just to acquire technology or clients but to secure qualified talent. The pool of true experts in the field is small, and Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and other tech giants have hired most of the available talent. Companies have adopted M&amp;A as a way to sign up top talent, a practice known as \u201cacqui-hiring,\u201d for sums that typically work out to $5 million to $10 million per person, according to a recent A.I. report by  McKinsey .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43225026447</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6105-HM41-F07F-80X9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 3, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

According to a report by the investment firm Raymond James, 31 percent of Americans said their primary source of video was streaming services.<br/><br/> About 32 percent of consumers have canceled or \"traded down\" to a less expensive package, and many young viewers rely entirely on Internet platforms for video, the report said.<br/><br/> Google-owned YouTube is also ramping up its original content offerings and Apple has reportedly created a $1 billion war chest for its television service programs.<br/><br/> \"It's more than taking away money and subscriptions. It's about viewership, eyeballs,\" said Bruce Leichtman of Leichtman Research Group, who follows media and entertainment.<br/><br/> Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research, says the established \"legacy\" companies are being forced to sell, diversify or \"scale up\" to compete against tech players.<br/><br/> But Greenfield said Disney's plan to acquire Fox's stake in Sky TV and studio assets while gearing up for its own streaming offerings may not be enough.<br/><br/>Disney, which owns the ABC television network along with ESPN sports channels, still appears wedded to \"legacy distribution platforms,\" Greenfield said in a research note.<br/><br/> With more consumers moving away from big pay TV bundles, \"industry fundamentals are worsening by the day,\" Greenfield writes.<br/><br/> \"At the same time the tech giants/platforms are flourishing and they are taking aim at consumer time spent with legacy media.\"<br/><br/> Analyst Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research said the moves come amid concerns about eroding profits, and mergers can give the firms better scale.<br/><br/> \"The pursuit of size allows for more cost efficiencies and a better negotiating position\" for content, Wieser said.<br/><br/> - Pipes and content -<br/><br/> An AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal would merge one of the largest distribution platforms -- AT&amp;T's pay TV and Internet service -- with the media- entertainment conglomerate's HBO, CNN and other content channels, putting it on the same level as Comcast, a cable giant which owns NBCUniversal.<br/><br/> But the Trump administration's Department of Justice has filed an antitrust suit to block the AT&amp;T deal, fueling concerns the move is aimed at punishing White House foe CNN.<br/><br/> The \"vertical integration\" of a company with content as well as \"pipes\" could present a formidable foe to the tech sector.<br/><br/> And a plan by US regulators to end \"net neutrality\" -- rules aimed at treating all online traffic equally -- may force companies like Netflix and Amazon to pay more to deliver to consumers.<br/><br/> With relaxed rules, firms like AT&amp;T and Comcast may be able to use some of the same tools employed by Netflix and Facebook by garnering data on viewers for promotions and advertising, according to independent media consultant Alan Wolk.<br/><br/> \"Right now if you are ABC, you have no idea who is watching your shows,\" Wolk said.<br/><br/> Having better data \"is probably the most important thing\" for these media firms, Wolk said, adding that it allows for more efficient targeted advertising.<br/><br/> Thompson, of the Bleier Center, said that even as the industry faces disruption, content creators -- writers, directors and producers -- will have more choices and potentially more bargaining power.<br/><br/> \"I think these new tech operations can disrupt the old legacy means of distribution, but they still have to make this stuff,\" he said.<br/><br/> While Big Tech has disrupted many industries, its roots come from a culture of math and engineering geeks who may not be adapted to the entertainment sector.<br/><br/> Wolk said Google-owned YouTube \"bombed pretty badly\" with most of its shows for a paid streaming service.<br/><br/> \"They didn't hire anyone with Hollywood programming experience and they underestimated the skill for this,\" he said.<br/><br/> Apple by contrast \"made a smart move\" by hiring entertainment executives, according to Wolk, and Facebook is pursuing a different strategy of finding \"niche\" programs for devotees of certain kinds of shows. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

platforms,\" Greenfield said in a research note.<br/> With more consumers moving away from big pay TV bundles, \"industry fundamentals are worsening by the day,\" Greenfield writes.<br/> \"At the same time the tech giants/platforms are flourishing and they are taking aim at consumer time spent with legacy media.\"<br/> Analyst Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research said the moves come amid concerns about eroding profits, and mergers can give the firms better scale.<br/> \"The pursuit of size allows for more cost efficiencies and a better negotiating position\" for content, Wieser said.<br/> An AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal would merge one of the largest distribution platforms -- AT&amp;T's pay TV and Internet service -- with the media-entertainment conglomerate's HBO, CNN and other content channels, putting it on the same level as Comcast, a cable giant which owns NBCUniversal.<br/> But the Trump administration's Department of Justice has filed an antitrust suit to block the AT&amp;T deal, fueling concerns the move is aimed at punishing White House foe CNN.<br/> The \"vertical integration\" of a company with content as well as \"pipes\" could present a formidable foe to the tech sector.<br/> And a plan by US regulators to end \"net neutrality\" -- rules aimed at treating all online traffic equally -- may force companies like Netflix and Amazon to pay more to deliver to consumers.<br/> With relaxed rules, firms like AT&amp;T and Comcast may be able to use some of the same tools employed by Netflix and Facebook by garnering data on viewers for promotions and advertising, according to independent media consultant Alan Wolk.<br/> \"Right now if you are ABC, you have no idea who is watching your shows,\" Wolk said.<br/> Having better data \"is probably the most important thing\" for these media firms, Wolk said, adding that it allows for more efficient targeted advertising.<br/> Thompson, of the Bleier Center, said that even as the industry faces disruption, content creators -- writers, directors and producers -- will have more choices and potentially more bargaining power.<br/> \"I think these new tech operations can disrupt the old legacy means of distribution, but they still have to make this stuff,\" he said.<br/> While Big Tech has disrupted many industries, its roots come from a culture of math and engineering geeks who may not be adapted to the entertainment sector.<br/>  Wolk said Google-owned YouTube \"bombed pretty badly\" with most of its shows for a paid streaming service.<br/>  \"They didn't hire anyone with Hollywood programming experience and they underestimated the skill for this,\" he said.<br/>Apple by contrast \"made a smart move\" by hiring entertainment executives, according to Wolk, and Facebook is pursuing a different strategy of finding \"niche\" programs for devotees of certain kinds of shows.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Other supporters include groups run by George Soros, the billionaire financier, and Pierre Omidyar, an eBay founder.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The foundations regularly fund critical looks at capitalism. The Ford Foundation, for example, supports many organizations that study and fight inequality. The Hewlett Foundation, whose lineage goes back to a founder of Hewlett-Packard and has a $10 billion endowment, has put a slice of its money toward organizations re-examining the free market economic policies that dominate Washington.</p><p>  But the financial support is reaching new heights, and it could help the activists keep pressure on Silicon Valley by building the sort of political might that has powered liberal policy victories on issues like civil rights and net neutrality. Activists recently announced a coalition to take on Amazon, for example, that includes organizers around the country.</p><p>  One of the groups receiving foundation money is led by Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder who now publicly argues for breaking up the social media giant. His group, the Economic Security Project, is pooling some of the money and then distributing it to projects focused on antitrust and concentration concerns. Mr. Hughes, wealthy from his time at Facebook, has contributed some of the money himself. </p><p>  The Economic Security Project plans to give antitrust activists $10 million over the next 18 months. On Tuesday, the organization will announce how it plans to spend the first $3 million, putting the money toward grass-roots organizers, researchers at several Washington think tanks and a group that recruits artists to make graphics that ''expose how our economy really works.''</p><p>  The coming years will test whether the efforts of the advocates can harness the skepticism about large corporations and the wealthy that is animating the Democratic presidential primary race. Federal and state officials have already announced investigations into Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple.</p><p>  Ultimately, these advocates hope to address corporate concentration in numerous businesses, including drugs and farm products, and combat rising economic inequality. </p><p>  They have their work cut out for them. Tech companies spend tens of millions of dollars on lobbying every year. And antitrust issues hinge on dense questions of law and economics that don't fit on bumper stickers.</p><p>  ''It's not just about trends and corporate accountability,'' said Maria Torres-Springer, the vice president for United States programs at the Ford Foundation, which has a $12 billion endowment. ''It's about creating and sustaining a movement that rebuilds political and economic power for everyday Americans.'' </p><p>  A leading beneficiary of the money is the Open Markets Institute, a research group whose focus on antitrust issues has been pivotal in making corporate concentration a matter of public debate. It expects to bring in more than $3 million in 2020, according to an internal document from the first half of this year. In 2016, before the group split off from a bigger organization, New America, its revenue topped out at just over $900,000.</p><p>  This year, the Knight Foundation, which focuses on journalism, awarded Open Markets $2 million to study the impact that concentration among technology platforms has on the media. In September, the Ford Foundation gave it $200,000 to examine how tech monopolies affect workers. A public campaign it has led to break up Facebook will expand to include Google next year, according to Sarah Miller, the organization's deputy director.</p><p>  Mr. Hughes's Economic Security Project is contributing to that campaign. It is also paying for Open Markets to conduct public opinion polling. </p><p>  ''Our view is you need an ecosystem,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''You need a community of people who generally share the same values but who, among themselves, may even have different approaches to the issues.''</p><p>  Another progressive group, Jobs With Justice, plans to hold sessions next year explaining to people the antitrust case against tech companies in simple terms. In the draft script of the training, the session's leader seizes on a simple metaphor, asking attendees to consider two lemonade stands.</p><p>  The first stand belongs to someone whose family owns the local grocery store, so it gets its lemons free. The family's neighbors, who opened a competing stand, aren't so lucky. Over time, the first stand is able to slash its prices to undercut the second stand.</p><p>  The session leader asks for a volunteer to play the person running the stand that can't use a family connection to get free fruit. The volunteer has to decide whether to engage in a price war with the more powerful competitor while an organizer charts the volunteer's dire financial situation on butcher paper.</p><p>  Each situation ends with the volunteer's lemonade stand closing and a revelation: Amazon, the session leader will tell participants, has used this tactic against its competitors.</p><p>  ''What we wanted to do was create some field materials, some training materials, just to even explain what a monopoly meant for people,'' said Erica Smiley, Jobs With Justice's executive director. ''Outside of people maybe playing the board game, it's kind of an old idea that maybe they learned in their fourth grade civics class but haven't necessarily re-upped on.''</p><p>  Ms. Smiley's group is one participant in Athena, the new coalition organizing opposition to Amazon over antitrust, privacy and other concerns. The coalition says it wants to raise $15 million in its first three years.</p><p>  Athena will receive money from Mr. Hughes's fund, along with other groups trying to rally the grass roots to the cause.</p><p>  The civil rights group Color of Change plans to use its funding from the project to pay for new hires to lead public campaigns around antitrust issues, while the Action Center on Race and the Economy will run ''corporate campaigns designed to influence the public narrative on corporate concentration and win real victories for communities of color around the country.''</p><p>  Other projects, like the artists' group, are focused on finding new ways to explore the antitrust issue. Mr. Hughes's group paid for a New York event in November -- held by a project called the Museum of Capitalism -- where people could play versions of the board game Monopoly that are meant to call out inequities in the economy.</p><p>  Mr. Hughes will also finance some groups doing academic research on corporate concentration and intends to support more researchers in the future. </p><p>  ''If you're going to see real change, you need a community of scholars who are in dialogue with one another,'' he said.</p><p>  Money is already flowing to campuses. In November, the Knight Foundation allocated $3.5 million to researchers to examine questions about digital platforms, including competition issues.</p><p>  The foundation, along with Mr. Omidyar's philanthropic network, has also provided the money to introduce an antitrust-focused initiative at Yale's business school. In an interview, Sam Gill, a Knight executive, said the foundation had not yet taken a position on whether there should be an antimonopoly movement but felt it was important to finance inquiries into the questions posed by major tech companies.</p><p>  In recent years, more potential solutions to corporate concentration have emerged. While some believe in aggressive approaches like breaking up companies, others prefer new regulations or other measures.</p><p>  At a conference at the University of Utah this fall, Dan Crane, a conservative law professor, challenged a group of participants including Tim Wu, a legal scholar and New York Times contributing opinion writer who is a leading voice calling for more aggressive antitrust enforcement. Mr. Crane pushed them to be more specific about the changes they would like to see in how antitrust laws are interpreted and enforced.</p><p>  Over box lunches, the group wrote a statement, later published by Mr. Wu, listing legal precedents the group hopes will be overturned and policies it hopes will be enacted.</p><p>  ''Those who believe in a strong revival of antitrust, and a return to its antimonopoly roots, have a duty to specify what, exactly, they mean, in concrete, legal detail,'' the statement said.</p><p>  Mr. Wu said that, among other purposes, the statement could be a test for judicial nominees. It's a focus reminiscent of the playbook that helped build the conservative legal movement -- which in turn shaped the antitrust laws Mr. Wu and his compatriots criticize today.</p><p>  ''Over a 30-year period, they won almost every one of those battles,'' Mr. Wu said. ''They just sort of said, 'Here's what it should be,' and it happened.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Anthony Russo FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)               </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-452394191211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR0-SS21-DXY4-X123-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1521\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/technology/americas-top-foundations-bankroll-attack-on-big-tech.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/technology/americas-top-foundations-bankroll-attack-on-big-tech.html</url><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You can sign up here to receive it weekdays. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Less than a decade ago, Exxon Mobil was the most valuable company in the world. On Monday, it's being kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average after nearly a century of inclusion in the stock index.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  I'm mentioning an energy company in a technology newsletter for two reasons: First, as wild as it feels to have a handful of American technology superpowers rule the economy and the stock market and influence world events, oil superpowers like Exxon were in a similar position not very long ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  And second, while it's hard to imagine Big Tech losing relevance, most people didn't predict that demand for fossil fuels would start to wane, until it did. That's part of the sweeping changes that ushered out the era of Big Oil and started the Big Tech age. Today all of Exxon is worth less than Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Exxon's star faded because the world changed, and it didn't. The question is whether what happened to Exxon is a warning about the potential vulnerability of today's tech superpowers -- or if it's the opposite: a sign of how Big Tech is invincible in ways that Exxon wasn't.</p><p>  The 2012 book ''Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power'' described how the company at its peak helped steer U.S. foreign policy, supported sometimes authoritarian leaders in oil-rich countries and shaped people's views on important issues like climate change to suit its interests. Its author, Steve Coll, called Exxon the world's most powerful unelected force, and I've wondered for years whether big tech companies are the new Exxon.</p><p>Apple wouldn't be the company it is today without its savvy diplomatic skills in the United States and China to advance its own business interests. Facebook is so influential that it's a tool used both against and by authoritarian governments. Google shapes how government regulators and the public think about antitrust laws. It's an imperfect comparison, but big tech companies are private empires in some of the same ways as the old Exxon.</p><p>  But not long after Coll's book was published, Exxon's influence and riches started to decline. The status of the world's most valuable company shifted to Apple. Exxon and other oil giants mostly missed out on the fracking boom, and on the move away from fossil fuels. Exxon still has influence like it did in the old days, but it's not the same.</p><p>  ''Time has marched on and these big companies have not been nimble enough,'' Clifford Krauss, a New York Times energy correspondent, told me when I asked about the comparison between Big Oil and Big Tech.</p><p>  One fundamental difference is that Big Oil's fate relies on demand for a product that the companies can't control. The tech industry doesn't seem to have this essential vulnerability.</p><p>  I've said here before that many tech executives live in fear of their companies dying or becoming irrelevant. They're not thinking about Exxon but about a history of technology in which evolutionary changes have ruined seemingly invincible industry leaders. But while it's possible to imagine some of the individual tech powers losing relevance -- maybe -- it's much harder to imagine the tech industry overall growing less potent or essential.</p><p>  I'll leave you with two notes of symbolism about Exxon giving way to a dominant tech industry. Exxon is being dropped from the Dow Jones index because of a technical change necessitated by Apple's stock getting too expensive. And Exxon's spot is being taken by a tech company: Salesforce.com.</p><p>  Tech empires can use their power for good</p><p>Apple is changing its rules to make it harder for apps to track what we do on our phones. Google is also remaking its popular Chrome web browser with a similar goal of limiting the perpetual digital tracking that is a staple of our online lives.</p><p>  I've said before that digital data surveillance is out of control, and Apple and Google might be powerful enough to single-handedly change the rules for digital privacy. Sometimes we want powerful companies to assert their authority. It should still make us nervous that they have this much authority.</p><p>  Here's what is happening with Apple: Very soon, most people with iPhones will start to see pop-up messages in apps that ask permission to let the app log everything they do on other apps and websites. Apps want this information, in part, to personalize the advertisements we see and to figure out if we're responding to them.</p><p>  I suspect that a lot of people are going to say heck no when they get these messages, meaning fewer companies will be able to compile digital dossiers on us. (There is a good explanation from Recode on what Apple is doing and the potential effects.)</p><p>  Companies tend to find workarounds for most data privacy guidelines, and Apple's latest change won't slow down the biggest digital data hogs of all, Google and Facebook. But I think Apple is taking a good step to put more guardrails around companies that try to follow our every move online and in the real world.</p><p>  It is also a reminder that in the absence of effective government policy in the United States to limit digital privacy intrusions, we have Apple and Google remaking how the digital world works without input or oversight on this important policy issue.</p><p>  I'm glad that these powerful companies are flexing their muscle for what I think is a worthy mission. It also makes me queasy.</p><p>  Before we go ...</p><p>  Common sense tips to fight the data surveillance machine: My colleague Brian X. Chen walks through questions we should ask ourselves when we get all those pop-up requests from apps that want to track what we do. The bottom line: It takes a lot of research and work on our part to be informed consumers in the digital surveillance economy.</p><p>  Blame government underinvestment in technology: Some U.S. states have been quick to pay a new $300 weekly unemployment benefit, while others expect it to take until early October to send out the funds. The difference is that some states have antiquated computer systems that can't digest the programming changes for the unemployment payouts, my colleague Ben Casselman wrote.</p><p>  The weird saga of TikTok is even weirder than you thought: Mike Isaac and Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times have great back-room details about the U.S. government forcing TikTok to sell at least part of the app company over concerns that it's a potential conduit for Chinese spying and propaganda. This will be ugly for awhile with everyone involved trying to maximize what they get out of this drama.</p><p>  Related: TikTok's C.E.O. quit after just a few months on the job. This soap opera is not what he signed up for.</p><p>  Hugs to this</p><p>  Rover the Cat is the coolest fashion runway model.</p><p>  We want to hear from you.

You can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">sign up here</url> to receive it weekdays.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Less than a decade ago, Exxon Mobil was the most valuable company in the world. On Monday, it\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">being kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average</url> after nearly a century of inclusion in the stock index.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I\u2019m mentioning an energy company in a technology newsletter for two reasons: First, as wild as it feels to have a handful of American technology superpowers rule the economy and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">the stock market</url> and influence world events, oil superpowers like Exxon were in a similar position not very long ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And second, while it\u2019s hard to imagine Big Tech losing relevance, most people didn\u2019t predict that demand for fossil fuels would start to wane, until <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">it did</url>. That\u2019s part of the sweeping changes that ushered out the era of Big Oil and started the Big Tech age. Today all of Exxon is worth less than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Jeff Bezos</url>.</p><p>Exxon\u2019s star faded because the world changed, and it didn\u2019t. The question is whether what happened to Exxon is a warning about the potential vulnerability of today\u2019s tech superpowers \u2014 or if it\u2019s the opposite: a sign of how Big Tech is invincible in ways that Exxon wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">2012 book \u201cPrivate Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power</url>\u201d described how the company at its peak helped steer U.S. foreign policy, supported sometimes authoritarian leaders in oil-rich countries and shaped people\u2019s views on important issues like climate change to suit its interests. Its author, Steve Coll, called Exxon the world\u2019s most powerful unelected force, and I\u2019ve wondered for years whether big tech companies are the new Exxon.</p><p>Apple wouldn\u2019t be the company it is today without its<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">savvy diplomatic skills in the United States and China to advance its own business interests</url>. Facebook is so influential that it\u2019s a tool <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">used both against</url> and by<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">authoritarian</url> governments. Google shapes how<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">government regulators</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">the public</url> think about antitrust laws. It\u2019s an imperfect comparison, but big tech companies are private empires in some of the same ways as the old Exxon.</p><p>But not long after Coll\u2019s book was published, Exxon\u2019s influence and riches started to decline. The status of the world\u2019s most valuable company shifted to Apple. Exxon and other oil giants mostly missed out on the fracking boom, and on the move away from fossil fuels. Exxon still has influence <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">like it did in the old days</url>, but it\u2019s not the same.</p><p>\u201cTime has marched on and these big companies have not been nimble enough,\u201d Clifford Krauss, a New York Times energy correspondent, told me when I asked about the comparison between Big Oil and Big Tech.</p><p>One fundamental difference is that Big Oil\u2019s fate relies on demand for a product that the companies can\u2019t control. The tech industry doesn\u2019t seem to have this essential vulnerability.</p><p>I\u2019ve said here before that many tech executives <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">live in fear of their companies dying or becoming irrelevant</url>. They\u2019re not thinking about Exxon but about a history of technology in which evolutionary changes have ruined seemingly invincible industry leaders. But while it\u2019s possible to imagine some of the individual tech powers losing relevance \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">maybe</url> \u2014 it\u2019s much harder to imagine the tech industry overall growing less potent or essential.</p><p>I\u2019ll leave you with two notes of symbolism about Exxon giving way to a dominant tech industry. Exxon is being dropped from the Dow Jones index <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">because of a technical change</url> necessitated by Apple\u2019s stock getting too expensive. And Exxon\u2019s spot is being taken by a tech company: Salesforce.com.</p><p>Tech empires can use their power for good</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Apple is changing its rules</url>to make it harder for apps to track what we do on our phones. Google is also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">remaking its popular Chrome web browser</url> with a similar goal of limiting the perpetual digital tracking that is a staple of our online lives.</p><p>I\u2019ve said before that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">digital data surveillance is out of control</url>, and Apple and Google might be powerful enough to single-handedly change the rules for digital privacy. Sometimes we want powerful companies to assert their authority. It should still make us nervous that they have this much authority.</p><p>Here\u2019s what is happening with Apple: Very soon, most people with iPhones will start to see pop-up messages in apps that ask permission to let the app log everything they do on other apps and websites. Apps want this information, in part, to personalize the advertisements we see and to figure out if we\u2019re responding to them.</p><p>I suspect that a lot of people are going to say heck no when they get these messages, meaning fewer companies will be able to compile digital dossiers on us. (There is a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">good explanation from Recode</url> on what Apple is doing and the potential effects.)</p><p>Companies tend to find workarounds for most data privacy guidelines, and Apple\u2019s latest change won\u2019t slow down the biggest digital data hogs of all, Google and Facebook. But I think Apple is taking a good step to put more guardrails around companies that try to follow our every move online and in the real world.</p><p>It is also a reminder that in the absence of effective government policy in the United States to limit digital privacy intrusions, we have Apple and Google remaking how the digital world works without input or oversight on this important policy issue.</p><p>I\u2019m glad that these powerful companies are flexing their muscle for what I think is a worthy mission. It also makes me queasy.</p><p>Before we go \u2026</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Common sense tips to fight the data surveillance machine: My colleague Brian X.

Since the law was enacted in June, multiple Big Tech firms - Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, and Twitter - have suspended their mechanisms to process data requests from law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong. TikTok, a competitor of Bigo Technology's Likee, had also announced that it will cease its operations in the territory. We have reached out to Bigo for more details. The development also comes as the US is doubling down on Chinese internet companies (more on that below).</p><p>The National Security Law defines offences very broadly and allows the police to take down internet posts and punish internet companies that do not comply with data requests. For not complying with the law, companies could be fined almost $13,000 and authorities could jail employees of the internet companies for six months. If an employee refuses to remove content as ordered, they could be jailed for a year. The police can also order deletion of posts that threaten national security. Since the new law applies across the world, companies would also have to give data of users in countries outside Hong Kong.</p><p>Bigo Live and Likee were banned in India: Bigo's announcement comes as its Bigo Live and Likee were banned in India, along with 57 other 'Chinese' apps in June over national security concerns. The company also told Reuters that it had appealed to both Singapore and Indian governments following the ban. Likee had 150 million users globally as of June, as per an earnings press release by JOYY, the Chinese internet company which owns Bigo Technology. Pakistan's telecom regulator had also banned Bigo Live in July over \"obscene\" and \"immoral\" content, while issuing a \"final warning\" to TikTok.</p><p>The US has banned US transactions with TikTok, and has directed Bytedance to divest its assets in the US: The United States is doubling down on Chinese internet companies such as TikTok parent Bytedance, and TenCent's WeChat. On August 14, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Bytedance to divest from its American assets and its rights to any user data that TikTok gathered in the country, within 90 days. Before that, Trump had barred all US transactions with TikTok and WeChat by means of an executive order signed earlier in August. Bigo is hoping \"not to be caught in the crossfire\", according to Reuters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0054169829</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M5-B7G1-DXMP-K0WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"420\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But he says word that the Internal Revenue Service might count free meals and other such perks for tech employees as taxable compensation would have ramifications far beyond his paycheck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"All of this great food infrastructure that we have in San Francisco, a lot of it is supported by companies providing lunch,\" said Hager, 32. \"So it's more of a benefit to the entire regional economy than me just bringing chicken and rice from home.\"</p><p>According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, the IRS is looking into whether big tech companies like Google and Facebook should count their lavish - but free - meals and other perks for employees as part of their taxable compensation.</p><p>While such extras are nothing new to the workforce at large, tech companies around the Bay Area have famously pampered employees with free meals, as well as perks like transportation, massages, fitness classes and more. </p><p>But free food, some of it fine cuisine prepared by company chefs, is perhaps the most emblematic and expected perquisite. As Facebook executive chef Josef Desimone said in a 2011 interview, \"Food is an oasis, a break. More than anything, the meals create a sense of community. People eating across from each other is a sacred thing.\"</p><h>Luring tech talent</h><p>Competition for talent has been white hot in Silicon Valley, and employers use such perks to lure candidates. For now, these benefits dodge IRS review, being deemed \"non-compensatory\" and thus free from taxation. With about 260 workdays in a year - likely far more at overworked tech companies - and a meal costing, say, $10, that's a sizable chunk of saved income.</p><p>Should the IRS determine that this practice falls within purview of the federal tax code, tech employees could be in for an added line on their W-2's.</p><p>And it would seem like an issue the right legislator or regulator could feast on. </p><p>\"Lavish, tax-deductible Silicon Valley lunches for employees who are often already pretty wealthy from their stock options seems like the perfect issue for an enterprising politician,\" Megan McArdle wrote recently on the Daily Beast. \"But for some reason, neither Republicans nor Democrats have picked up on this one.\"</p><p>The IRS declined to comment for this story. But its regulations specify that there must be substantial reasons to keep employees on-premises and feed them tax-free. This most readily applies to jobs like first responders, security guards, ship workers or child care providers, where leaving the company premises could result in detriment to the business.</p><h>Essential staff</h><p>Tech companies could argue that their employees run important computing systems - subject to unpredictable crashes - and their staff must remain on hand. Or they could argue it's essential that employees stay on-site because of the fierce competition in today's tech sector, where lost minutes are lost money.</p><p>Yet any business could make a similar argument. For the most part, says Russell Stanaland, a San Francisco corporate tax attorney, most tech companies would have an uphill battle convincing the agency that their free meals are essential. </p><p>\"I suspect the IRS would win on that,\" he says.</p><p>But some determinations will be judgment calls, and depending on the nature of the employment, some employees could be given untaxed meals while other, less essential staff is taxed.</p><p>Bjoern Zinnssmeister's business e-mail software company in San Francisco, isn't big enough yet to provide such perks, but he questioned why the IRS might be considering the plan. </p><p>\"Another tax, are you kidding me?\" Zinnssmeister said. \"Is that like a waiter eating in the kitchen at night and getting taxed on that? That's what California needs at this point, being more business unfriendly.\"</p><p>Zinnssmeister said the free meals aren't like money because he can't choose how to spend it, on food or something else. </p><h>Not all use perk</h><p>Adam Kelly, 37, a lead programmer for a software company, said he could see both sides of the issue, but questioned how the IRS could keep track of what perks employees should be liable for.</p><p>\"If they employers were giving it to employees directly, then definitely it could be taxed,\" Kelly said. \"But you could conceivably go to work every day and not take advantage of any of those things. With a bag of chips or a soda, it's not really clear-cut to me. Do we keep track of each one that we drink? I drank seven sodas, so I owe 43 cents in taxes?\"</p><p>Traditionally, those expenses are considered \"de minimis\" expenses, says Jeffrey Kahn, a Bay Area tax attorney; their cost is so low that accounting for them is unreasonable. Sprawling platters of sushi and ice cream sundae bars are another matter, however.</p><h>A new line item</h><p>Companies of all kinds sometimes order food for important lunchtime meetings. That expense can be written off, since it's an expense of doing business. Could a tech company like Google get clever and tell its employees to discuss only business matters at lunch, but never really enforce that requirement? </p><p>\"Now you're getting into situations that are very, very gray,\" Kahn said. \"If you're having meetings every day it's going to be a lot harder to justify that to the IRS.\"</p><p>Were the IRS to decide in favor of taxing the meals, and a tech company continued them as a perk, Kahn says the employee would probably find a new line item on their W2, with the value of the meals they've eaten as a piece of income to pay taxes on.</p><p>And that could surely leave a bad taste.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The IRS is deciding whether employees such as these Google workers in New York should pay taxes on the free lunch perk.

This included ignoring the complaints of companies stung in the crackdown.</p><p>\"People don't get to choose whether or not they pay tax - you've got to pay the right amount of tax,\" she said.</p><p>Konza said Australians \"should be confident that the companies we've been working on, the ones that we've finished, are now paying the right amount of tax under the law\".</p><p>He was keen to dispel \"scepticism we'd collect that money\".</p><p>\"Of that $1bn, we've already collected $800 million in cash, so I just want to reassure you that the results are real and the collection is real too.\" Even the Labor opposition doesn't quibble with the result. Instead, it plays down the effect of the MAAL and claims credit for the haul by pointing out it was largely achieved under legislation passed while it was in government, over opposition from the Coalition.</p><p>Having taken on big tech and the powerful oil and gas industry, the ATO now has the global pharmaceutical industry in its sights - better known as big pharma. The Weekend Australian can reveal it has 12 audits of pharma companies under way, with another eight groups engaged in voluntary discussions with the ATO over their pricing arrangements.</p><p>\"It's really about whether the right share of profit has been landed in Australia for the functionality carried out here,\" Konza said.</p><p>He said the ATO was also still keeping a close eye on sales hubs in tax havens used by resources companies including BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, and has concerns about intellectual property being shifted offshore.</p><p>It was in February last year that Jordan used an appearance before Senate estimates to publicly lose his patience with big multinationals. In an extraordinary outburst, he accused multinational corporations of \"stooging\" the ATO by playing games and stringing it along, dragging out assessments for as long as possible.</p><p>\"Enough is enough - no more of this,\" Jordan told the Senate. But, according to Konza, Jordan had been focused on the problem for much longer - since shortly after he succeeded Michael D'Ascenzo as head of the ATO in 2013.</p><p>\"What had happened was that the Commissioner had asked us to get on to the issue, and then after three years he said 'enough is enough' because he felt that progress had not been fast enough,\" Konza said.</p><p>\"The tax office tries to be fair in all its dealings, and it has processes that try to always give people a fair go and an even break, but sometimes in the hands of the professional adviser who understands our processes and our policies very well, you can get gaming of those policies.</p><p>\"When you have taxpayers who are trying to stooge us, who are trying to game the system, you need to react firmly.\" Konza said some multinationals went to extraordinary lengths to evade the ATO's attempts to get a grip on what they were actually doing here in Australia.</p><p>\"We would require information and it would take us months to get an agreement as to the sort of information that we could get, and then we'd send out a request for information and it would literally take nine months to get information back, but it would be incomplete,\" he said.</p><p>\"We would have people that we wanted to interview and there'd be a delay getting access to that, and by the time we get in contact with them we'd discover they'd been transferred overseas in the meantime.\" Konza and fellow deputy commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn, who is responsible for the taxation of public groups, looked through the ATO casebook for taxpayers who were \"drifting\" and came up with seven targets.</p><p>\"Originally we thought we'd get those seven cases finished and we would raise $2bn,\" Konza said.</p><p>\"In the end, strictly speaking as at 30 June only six of those cases had been finished - the seventh has been settled since - but six of those cases have been finished for $3.1bn. So not only did we get the cases finished but as it turned out the actual liabilities were much higher than we'd expected.\" Clayton Utz tax partner Niv Tadmore said the ATO's message \"has been taken very seriously by multinationals\".</p><p>\"I think the seriousness the ATO put into these procedures has been felt,\" he said. However, he didn't think the ATO could keep up the pressure indefinitely. \"I think the balance will shift over time - at the moment it's been very intensive,\" he said.</p><p>Jason Ward, who runs the Australian arm of global activist group Tax Justice Network, said the ATO \" should be congratulated on their efforts, they have made significant progress\".</p><p>\"However, the notion that the job is done and now multinationals will all pay their fair share is a complete farce,\" he said.</p><p>Ward rattled off a list of further reforms - including changes to the petroleum resources rent tax, a crackdown on stapled securities and a beneficial ownership register - he claims are needed to \"make sure corporations pay what they should to support our schools, hospitals and other public services\".</p><p>Also calling for stricter laws is Queensland Labor senator Chris Ketter, who pointed to evidence Facebook this week gave to the Senate Economics References Committee he chairs.</p><p>The tech giant continues to book Australian income in Ireland using a loophole in MAAL that enables the practice as long as the transaction doesn't touch Australia. \"Tuesday's hearing showed that multinational companies are still restructuring their businesses to avoid paying tax in Australia,\" Ketter said.</p><p>Konza points out the ATO couldn't lay claim to some transactions due to international tax law.</p><p>\"What you do see is that the smaller clients in Australia, they'll go on to the website overseas and place their ads in an automated fashion,\" he said. \"In those instances we don't have a taxing right and that's been the case for almost 100 years.\"However, O'Dwyer was quick to point out Facebook was still under audit - and that other tech companies hit by audits had restructured to bring all their businesses onshore. \"It would surprise me if there are others under audit who weren't similarly affected,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20170826Australian325000318593936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PBK-2WD1-JD3N-53V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1389\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 26, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This included ignoring the complaints of companies stung in the crackdown.</p><p>\"People don't get to choose whether or not they pay tax - you've got to pay the right amount of tax,\" she said.</p><p>Konza said Australians \"should be confident that the companies we've been working on, the ones that we've finished, are now paying the right amount of tax under the law\".</p><p>He was keen to dispel \"scepticism we'd collect that money\".</p><p>\"Of that $1bn, we've already collected $800 million in cash, so I just want to reassure you that the results are real and the collection is real too.\" Even the Labor opposition doesn't quibble with the result. Instead, it plays down the effect of the MAAL and claims credit for the haul by pointing out it was largely achieved under legislation passed while it was in government, over opposition from the Coalition.</p><p>Having taken on big tech and the powerful oil and gas industry, the ATO now has the global pharmaceutical industry in its sights - better known as big pharma. The Weekend Australian can reveal it has 12 audits of pharma companies under way, with another eight groups engaged in voluntary discussions with the ATO over their pricing arrangements.</p><p>\"It's really about whether the right share of profit has been landed in Australia for the functionality carried out here,\" Konza said.</p><p>He said the ATO was also still keeping a close eye on sales hubs in tax havens used by resources companies including BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, and has concerns about intellectual property being shifted offshore.</p><p>It was in February last year that Jordan used an appearance before Senate estimates to publicly lose his patience with big multinationals. In an extraordinary outburst, he accused multinational corporations of \"stooging\" the ATO by playing games and stringing it along, dragging out assessments for as long as possible.</p><p>\"Enough is enough - no more of this,\" Jordan told the Senate. But, according to Konza, Jordan had been focused on the problem for much longer - since shortly after he succeeded Michael D'Ascenzo as head of the ATO in 2013.</p><p>\"What had happened was that the Commissioner had asked us to get on to the issue, and then after three years he said 'enough is enough' because he felt that progress had not been fast enough,\" Konza said.</p><p>\"The tax office tries to be fair in all its dealings, and it has processes that try to always give people a fair go and an even break, but sometimes in the hands of the professional adviser who understands our processes and our policies very well, you can get gaming of those policies.</p><p>\"When you have taxpayers who are trying to stooge us, who are trying to game the system, you need to react firmly.\" Konza said some multinationals went to extraordinary lengths to evade the ATO's attempts to get a grip on what they were actually doing here in Australia.</p><p>\"We would require information and it would take us months to get an agreement as to the sort of information that we could get, and then we'd send out a request for information and it would literally take nine months to get information back, but it would be incomplete,\" he said.</p><p>\"We would have people that we wanted to interview and there'd be a delay getting access to that, and by the time we get in contact with them we'd discover they'd been transferred overseas in the meantime.\" Konza and fellow deputy commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn, who is responsible for the taxation of public groups, looked through the ATO casebook for taxpayers who were \"drifting\" and came up with seven targets.</p><p>\"Originally we thought we'd get those seven cases finished and we would raise $2bn,\" Konza said.</p><p>\"In the end, strictly speaking as at 30 June only six of those cases had been finished - the seventh has been settled since - but six of those cases have been finished for $3.1bn. So not only did we get the cases finished but as it turned out the actual liabilities were much higher than we'd expected.\" Clayton Utz tax partner Niv Tadmore said the ATO's message \"has been taken very seriously by multinationals\".</p><p>\"I think the seriousness the ATO put into these procedures has been felt,\" he said. However, he didn't think the ATO could keep up the pressure indefinitely. \"I think the balance will shift over time - at the moment it's been very intensive,\" he said.</p><p>Jason Ward, who runs the Australian arm of global activist group Tax Justice Network, said the ATO \" should be congratulated on their efforts, they have made significant progress\".</p><p>\"However, the notion that the job is done and now multinationals will all pay their fair share is a complete farce,\" he said.</p><p>Ward rattled off a list of further reforms - including changes to the petroleum resources rent tax, a crackdown on stapled securities and a beneficial ownership register - he claims are needed to \"make sure corporations pay what they should to support our schools, hospitals and other public services\".</p><p>Also calling for stricter laws is Queensland Labor senator Chris Ketter, who pointed to evidence Facebook this week gave to the Senate Economics References Committee he chairs.</p><p>The tech giant continues to book Australian income in Ireland using a loophole in MAAL that enables the practice as long as the transaction doesn't touch Australia. \"Tuesday's hearing showed that multinational companies are still restructuring their businesses to avoid paying tax in Australia,\" Ketter said.</p><p>Konza points out the ATO couldn't lay claim to some transactions due to international tax law.</p><p>\"What you do see is that the smaller clients in Australia, they'll go on to the website overseas and place their ads in an automated fashion,\" he said. \"In those instances we don't have a taxing right and that's been the case for almost 100 years.\"However, O'Dwyer was quick to point out Facebook was still under audit - and that other tech companies hit by audits had restructured to bring all their businesses onshore. \"It would surprise me if there are others under audit who weren't similarly affected,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20170826Australian29000318566931</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PB5-4HM1-JD3N-5403-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1389\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 26, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But cyclones and hurricanes, these we name. If it has energy enough to be an existential threat, we christen it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So the fact there's a name for the trouble Big Tech has gotten itself into - albeit a portmanteau taken from \"tech\" and \"backlash\" - suggests this trouble might do more than upset a few hairdos.</p><p>One can only hope the techlash upsets the balance of power, which for too long has been held by an elite few Silicon Valley and Seattle billionaires, too many of whom have abused that power to enrich themselves at untold political, social and human cost.</p><p>But the techlash is now entering its third year, and its impact has not been what one might have hoped for. It's been a headwind for Big Tech, to be sure, but not the hurricane required.</p><p>While some Big Tech companies have backed away from some of their more destructive practices - Twitter has now banned political advertising on its platform, slowing social media's river of disinformation ever so slightly - others have not mended their ways, despite the threat of heavy regulation and demergers if they continue on their present path.</p><p>As recently as last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/un-says-online-anti-vaxxers-fuelling-samoa-measles-deaths-doc-1mt61b2\">Unicef was still begging Facebook to stop publishing \"incredibly irresponsible\" anti-vaccination propaganda</url>, years after the social media platform was first identified as a contributor to the re-emergence of life-threatening but preventable diseases.</p><p>(But, of course, the billionaire founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has defended Facebook's publication of tracts denying the Holocaust, and its acceptance of paid political advertisements it knows to contain lies, arguing it's important for the public to hear falsehoods. It may be naive of Unicef to think that Facebook would eliminate anti-vaxxer content from its platform, just because children are dying.)</p><p>China v America</p><p>So what would have to happen in 2020, to finally make the techlash a storm worth having?</p><p>The storm brewing in the Pacific - the decoupling of the US and Chinese tech sectors - which looks likely to gather strength next year, will almost certainly shift the balance of power away from the US West Coast. But whether this will diminish the power of Big Tech, or simply embolden it, remains to be seen.</p><p>Having been banned from using American suppliers for its phones, China's telecommunications giant Huawei this September came out with a smartphone, the Mate 30, which contained no US-made hardware whatsoever, and ran a version of the Android operating system that lacked any services provided by Big Tech company Google.</p><p>More recently, the Chinese government is reported to have embarked on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/world/asia/beijing-orders-state-offices-to-replace-foreign-pcs-and-software-20191209-p53i2f\">\"3-5-2 policy\" to remove US-made technology from all government offices and public institutions</url>, at a rate of 30 per cent removal in 2020, 50 per cent in 2021, and the remaining 20 per cent in 2022.</p><p>China, in short, is being forced to create a stand-alone tech sector, drastically increasing the likelihood big American tech companies such as Facebook and Google will face competitive threats on a scale they've never dealt with before.</p><p>The question is, will the decoupling lead to a Balkanisation of tech, under which Facebook might see off a competitor such as Beijing's TikTok, it having been banned from the US and its allies by executive decree, just as Huawei was banned?</p><p>Or will the decoupling loosen Big Tech's grip on society, diminishing the global power of these American platforms to the point where regulators finally feel they can get on top of the problem?</p><p>While we wait to see how China changes the technology landscape, there is one thing lawmakers and regulators can do.</p><p>In 2020, they can make good on their promise to end the special dispensations tech companies have from the rules that govern all other companies.</p><p>If, for instance, traditional transport companies must pay their workers minimum wage, then technology-based transport companies should, too.</p><p>If, for instance, traditional publishers and broadcasters are to face punishment when they publish defamation or falsehoods or incite violence or hatred, then technology-based publishers and broadcasters should, too.</p><p>And if these winds of change prove so strong that some technology companies risk collapse, then that's a problem for Big Tech to solve, not lawmakers.</p><p>If finally imposing social and legal norms on the likes of Uber and Facebook would undermine their business, then one could only conclude those businesses were never built on solid foundations in the first place.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520215841</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPB-N231-JBJ7-N0G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><timeReceived>04:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Life won't be much easier, but at least IT will once again bite into interesting issues - ones that can make real differences for firms. This is oodles better than continually dealing with chief financial officers whose selective hearing limits chats to the topic of IT budget cuts. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> My IT management issues agenda for 2004 includes three topics in each of three areas: technologies, applications and management. It may not be definitive, but it ought to convince you that the next year won't be boring. </p><p> In technologies, the hot toys of 2004 will be little things that talk. Radio-frequency ID tags will be on offer for financial services, supply chains, livestock - you name it. Voice over the Internet will become an increasingly viable and cheap alternative to the phone company's version of long distance. And we'll begin to hear about commercial mesh networks: cellphones that liberate you from companies such as Bell Mobility. </p><p> A second technology decision will be the open-source option. Linux is at the centre of an increasingly coherent constellation that, in 2004, will openly challenge Microsoft where you work: On the desktop. You won't dump your existing Windows and Office platforms, but people will be asking \"why not try out Linux for new users?\" in offshore locations of call centres, for example. Some big company may well announce a plan for a wholesale conversion to the Linux constellation. </p><p> A third big tech decision for you in 2004 is your stand on telecom deregulation. Bell Canada chief executive officer Michael Sabia has opted for: If anyone can emerge from the game victorious, it's he who carries the ball today. Your company may well agree. Or not. What are your economic and business interests as telecom succumbs to a technology revolution? And how will you make those interests known? </p><p> Moving into the applications area, the latest flavour is hot and cold running applications, thanks to software and technology infrastructure on demand. This is a tweak on outsourcing whereby vendors provide application tools and processing capacity as needed. When you buy computer hardware and software licences up front, you may spend more than necessary because you must anticipate peak demands. In an on-demand model, vendors theoretically pass on their savings from risk portfolio economies of scale, since they support many customers at once. The smart decision is not whether to go with on-demand; instead it's where, when and how to do it. </p><p> A new area of applications investment to consider for 2004, if it hasn't hit you already, is \"reporting.\" For firms that report in the United States, a key driver is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Canada's balkanized market regulators are still playing catch-up in this area, while some business lobbies continue to argue that we don't need more reporting anyway. The fact is, though, more transparent reporting improves business performance, market credibility and shareholder value. Next-generation applications (such as portals for board members and various stakeholders) and enabling technologies (such as XBRL) will reduce costs, vouchsafe accuracy, and improve access for interested parties. </p><p> Transparent reporting raises a business dilemma: privacy and security. How do you protect competitive secrets in a transparent world? What about the privacy of employee and client data? Just today an executive described how his firm struggles with the fact that it provides conservative and safe guidance to financial markets, and tells employees that the real plan is significantly higher. Some might say the answer is to put the kibosh on market guidance altogether. But the deeper issue remains.</p><p> The third major area is about broader issues of IT management. My No. 1 topic here harks back to the dunce corner. Many IT executives are indeed in the doldrums. The lucky ones have been booted off the executive committee and had their budgets slashed. The unlucky ones have simply been fired. Now is the time to go on the offensive. IT must continue to reduce its own costs while proving its ability to improve productivity across the business. But as the economy warms up, productivity will mean more than reducing labour hours. It will also mean helping the business get better at innovation and at enticing and keeping customers. </p><p> Outsourcing is a management dilemma that looms more than ever. Last week Lou Dobbs announced on CNN for five nights a rogue's gallery of big-name corporations involved in offshore contracting. As the Canadian dollar rises and competition intensifies, outsourcing - including offshore contracting - rears its head right here. How to balance the cost-risk equations of moving IT work around the world? Will so-called near-shore work that Canadians do for U.S. firms offset the impact of offshore contracting of Canadian jobs? Anyway, what's fairer - keeping jobs in rich Canada or creating jobs in emerging economies? Whatever you believe, our labour markets will likely be roiled.</p><p> All this ties into the third key management issue: The unfortunate education and experience bias of today's IT professionals. Few of today's universities require computer science students to take courses in the arts or humanities. In fact few even require basic business skills. It's no wonder business people continually express frustration with their IT counterparts. Make 2004 your year to broaden horizons. It will be a good investment, and fun to boot. </p><p> (Corrections to last week's column. Bad news: Factiva article retrievals on Microsoft Office 2003 aren't free after all.

Life won't be much easier, but at least IT will once again bite into interesting issues -- ones that can make real differences for firms. This is oodles better than continually dealing with chief financial officers whose selective hearing limits chats to the topic of IT budget cuts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My IT management issues agenda for 2004 includes three topics in each of three areas: technologies, applications and management. It may not be definitive, but it ought to convince you that the next year won't be boring.</p><p>In technologies, the hot toys of 2004 will be little things that talk. Radio-frequency ID tags will be on offer for financial services, supply chains, livestock -- you name it. Voice over the Internet will become an increasingly viable and cheap alternative to the phone company's version of long distance. And we'll begin to hear about commercial mesh networks: cellphones that liberate you from companies such as Bell Mobility.</p><p>A second technology decision will be the open-source option. Linux is at the centre of an increasingly coherent constellation that, in 2004, will openly challenge Microsoft where you work: On the desktop. You won't dump your existing Windows and Office platforms, but people will be asking \"why not try out Linux for new users?\" in offshore locations of call centres, for example. Some big company may well announce a plan for a wholesale conversion to the Linux constellation.</p><p>A third big tech decision for you in 2004 is your stand on telecom deregulation. Bell Canada chief executive officer Michael Sabia has opted for: If anyone can emerge from the game victorious, it's he who carries the ball today. Your company may well agree. Or not. What are your economic and business interests as telecom succumbs to a technology revolution? And how will you make those interests known?</p><p>Moving into the applications area, the latest flavour is hot and cold running applications, thanks to software and technology infrastructure on demand. This is a tweak on outsourcing whereby vendors provide application tools and processing capacity as needed. When you buy computer hardware and software licences up front, you may spend more than necessary because you must anticipate peak demands. In an on-demand model, vendors theoretically pass on their savings from risk portfolio economies of scale, since they support many customers at once. The smart decision is not whether to go with on-demand; instead it's where, when and how to do it.</p><p>A new area of applications investment to consider for 2004, if it hasn't hit you already, is \"reporting.\" For firms that report in the United States, a key driver is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Canada's balkanized market regulators are still playing catch-up in this area, while some business lobbies continue to argue that we don't need more reporting anyway. The fact is, though, more transparent reporting improves business performance, market credibility and shareholder value. Next-generation applications (such as portals for board members and various stakeholders) and enabling technologies (such as XBRL) will reduce costs, vouchsafe accuracy, and improve access for interested parties.</p><p>Transparent reporting raises a business dilemma: privacy and security. How do you protect competitive secrets in a transparent world? What about the privacy of employee and client data? Just today an executive described how his firm struggles with the fact that it provides conservative and safe guidance to financial markets, and tells employees that the real plan is significantly higher. Some might say the answer is to put the kibosh on market guidance altogether. But the deeper issue remains.</p><p>The third major area is about broader issues of IT management. My No. 1 topic here harks back to the dunce corner. Many IT executives are indeed in the doldrums. The lucky ones have been booted off the executive committee and had their budgets slashed. The unlucky ones have simply been fired. Now is the time to go on the offensive. IT must continue to reduce its own costs while proving its ability to improve productivity across the business. But as the economy warms up, productivity will mean more than reducing labour hours. It will also mean helping the business get better at innovation and at enticing and keeping customers.</p><p>Outsourcing is a management dilemma that looms more than ever. Last week Lou Dobbs announced on CNN for five nights a rogue's gallery of big-name corporations involved in offshore contracting. As the Canadian dollar rises and competition intensifies, outsourcing -- including offshore contracting -- rears its head right here. How to balance the cost-risk equations of moving IT work around the world? Will so-called near-shore work that Canadians do for U.S. firms offset the impact of offshore contracting of Canadian jobs? Anyway, what's fairer -- keeping jobs in rich Canada or creating jobs in emerging economies? Whatever you believe, our labour markets will likely be roiled.</p><p>All this ties into the third key management issue: The unfortunate education and experience bias of today's IT professionals. Few of today's universities require computer science students to take courses in the arts or humanities. In fact few even require basic business skills. It's no wonder business people continually express frustration with their IT counterparts. Make 2004 your year to broaden horizons. It will be a good investment, and fun to boot.</p><p>(Corrections to last week's column. Bad news: Factiva article retrievals on Microsoft Office 2003 aren't free after all.
