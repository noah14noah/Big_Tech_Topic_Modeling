We send it right over to Dagen McDowell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning ladies, we'll  see you both coming up shortly.  Good morning everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell  in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 6:00  a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for second quarter reporting  season, one-third of the Dow Industrials and the S&amp;P500 set to post results  this week.  We'll look at the numbers and guidance and what they all say  about the state of the United States economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are showing this this morning, we have slight losses but, again,  even a tweak from the president could change all of that.  After the close  today we get earnings from Alphabet, the parent of Google.  Again, that  just kicks off a blockbuster week.</p><p>Those markets, those Futures after the major market gauges finish the day  on Friday, little change.  You had the Dow and S&amp;P were up for the week,  but the NASDAQ Composite for the week was slightly lower last week.</p><p>In Europe we have declines across the board to tell you about, the biggest  loser there being the CAC Quarante in France down about half of one  percent.  In Asia overnight some mixed action, the Nikkei in Japan the  worst performer of the lot down more than one percent.</p><p>A tragedy in Toronto, a deadly shooting rampage late last night, a gunman  killing at least one, injuring more than a dozen others.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard at least 20 shots in intervals, you know,  clipping, spent, reloading, clipping, spent.  I saw at least four people  shot her by the fountain.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a street where people walk every day, go to  the groceries, have dinner, have an ice cream, sit in a square, enjoy their  summer and it's absolutely devastating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have the latest on the investigation coming up.  President  Trump takes on Iran, the president issuing a sharp warning in a late night  tweet threatening severe consequences if Iran doesn't take a cautious tone  with the United States.</p><p>And unexpected change at the top for FiatChrysler, the automaker replacing  well-known CEO Sergio Marchionne after he stopped for complications from  recent surgery.  What the change means for the future of the company.</p><p>And out of this world vodka, Star Trek fans will be able to get a taste  space with alcohol inspired by the Starship Enterprise.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, CFRA Investment  Strategist Lindsey Bell.  PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle.  And Maslansky &amp;  Partners President Lee Carter.  We're going to tee up what is going to be  an incredible week.  One thing we'd left out in the open is we get second  quarter GDP, the first reading on how fast this economy is growing, that  comes out on Friday.</p><p>We're going to hear from all of these major technology companies and get a  sense of what the financial world looks like in the health of the U.S.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  It's going to be a big  week for sure.  And we're going to finally see what corporate health looks  like.  Tech sector's going to be very, very strong.  </p><p>We've got over 22 percent growth for the second quarter from these tech  companies, that is a six quarter in a row for over 21 percent earnings  growth.  You're looking at the S&amp;P500, earnings growth of 20.8 percent  based on S&amp;P capital IQ estimates right now.</p><p>So things are looking good so far, companies are beating on the bottom  line, the top line beat rate at 76 percent has come down over the last  week.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BELL:  We'd like to see that improve a little bit but the dollar's kind of  weighing there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, we're going to dig into more of that.  You teed it up nicely  Lindsey Bell, thank you so much.  And then the president's approval rating  going up, so we're going to talk about that as well, I can't wait for that.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Such a fascinating topic  because who would have thought --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p>CARTER:  -- based on everything else (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- you know what, the people who believe in his policies are  tuning out the noise.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.  And that's what we talked about, he got a floor and  it's not going to move.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  We're going to talk about that coming up in just a few  minutes.</p><p>But first our top story this hour, tech earnings on tap, Futures are  searching for a little bit of direction his morning, a start of huge week  for corporate earnings.  Dow Industrial Futures are down 15 points at the  moment.</p><p>Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, all set to report second quarter  results this week with Apple -- with Alphabet leading the way today.  The  parent of Google reporting after the bell.  Lindsey, can you dig into  these?  </p><p>These are the companies that have been driving the performance and I'm  going to look up a step that I have on my phone, but how critical will --  just these big name tech companies be?</p><p>BELL:  It's going to be huge and what's most -- going to be the most  important as is every quarter but especially this quarter, we saw what  happened with Netflix guidance.</p><p>Guidance is going to be key, I don't think there's going to be any dispute  that this has been a great quarter.  Like what you said on Friday, we're  going to get an amazing economic GDP number.  But I think that what people  want to watch is what's happening with the top line and is guidance  improving?</p><p>And we have actually seen surprisingly industrial companies raising  guidance for the remainder of the year which you would -- a sector that's  been impacted by trade.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  This trade in a way as I'm listening to  some of those earnings calls, I would have expected using the tariffs as a  bit of an excuse.  You know, corporate managers often look for something  out there, it's a bit of an excuse just to sort of temporary guidance --</p><p>BELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- and they're not using tariffs, which is quite surprising.   You're also not using the tight labor market as an excuse.  So that's been  sort of interesting.</p><p>BELL:  I know.  Which is a change in tone from what we've seen previously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But speaking of the industrial earnings, Honeywell's numbers out  on Friday were great .  That they had higher sales in profit margins  across, I think, all four of their -- it's divisions, that was out on  Friday.</p><p>But in terms of trade impact and the tariffs that have gone into effect on  steel and aluminum, the retaliation from major trading partners, Canada,  Mexico and even China, we're going to get earnings this week from TRIUM,  Harley-Davidson, and Whirlpool.</p><p>So, again, you're going to have to decide Mitch whether they're using maybe  the trade dispute as an excuse or if it's having a legitimate impact on  business here.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And we'll see -- we'll see -- if it's the guidance, you don't  know.  But if it's impacting second quarter earnings then it's not an  excuse, it's reality.  So we'll see then.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So industrial stocks actually are down two percent year-to-date  while the S&amp;P500 is up nearly five percent.  And there are some stocks that  are in, well, the toilet.</p><p>Caterpillar is down 14 -- 13 percent, 3M is down 14 percent year-to-date.   And also Alcoa had -- has had a major selloff in recent days.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  Alcoa you saw the tariffs impacting their business with  aluminum.  They bring a lot of it in from Canada, so they -- they're saying  every month they expect a 12 to 14 million dollar hit to the profitability  of the company. </p><p>This is definitely a huge -- the big question I think when you think about  the industrial company is, are they pulling this business forward ahead of  the tariffs going into effect?  And so that's why the second quarter is  significantly better than expected.  </p><p>The industrial sector has been in the toilet like you said.  The fourth  worth performing sector of all 11, but the stocks are reacting very, very  positively to this news.  On average, the companies that have reported so  far have moved up two and a half percentage points versus the S&amp;P500 up  1.6.  Last quarter, stocks weren't reacting to earnings at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's great news.  And I was just going to -- what I was  pulling up on my phone, it's not -- I'm not ignoring you.  I'm not -- I'm  not texting -- I'm not texting with my mother.</p><p>But if you look at just last week, they were -- of the major technology  stocks, there were only two that were lower out, Netflix was -- fell off a  cliff --</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it was down nine percent because of that miss, partially to  blame its own guidance.  And then Alphabet was down going into this  earnings report, half of one percent last week.  But, again, Microsoft is  out with earnings, number one Dow stock and is -- hit an all-time high on  Friday I believe.</p><p>BELL:  And that bodes well for Alphabet because they're in the cloud  business, to the third largest cloud provider.  We want to see tonight how  those numbers look.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The economy a big part of republican plans to retain control of  the House.  Here's what House Major Whip Steve Scalise told Maria on Sunday  Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  The plans to continue  focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth  and then locking it in.  We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes,  we're going to make the tax cuts permanent.</p><p>That bill, Chairman Brady and his committee are already working on.  We  just did a jobs 3.0 bill, a bill to provide more regulatory relief and do  some more things that will help create more jobs and rebuild the middle  class.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as a new Wall Street Journal NBC News Poll found that  half of registered voters approve of President Trump's handling on the  economy.  His highest mark on that question in the survey.</p><p>And also president's overall approval rating did inch up a little bit.   Lee, what do you make of that?</p><p>CARTER:  So I think it's really, really fascinating to say that the  president's job approval rating was the highest it's been after a lot of  people said they did not approve of his handling of the meeting with Putin,  that was over 68 percent of people, so they did not approve of that.</p><p>But the bottom line is this, when you look at Trump's handling of the  economy, 50 percent of Americans approve of it, 34 percent don't.  People  feel that it's in their pocketbooks, they're seeing the markets rise,  they're seeing their 401(k) balances go up, they're feeling better more  optimistic, they're seeing jobs, more opportunities for themselves.</p><p>So, even when these things happen, even when, you know, the president makes  comments that makes everybody uncomfortable after he did -- as he did in  Helsinki.  The more hysterical people get, the more upset, the more that  they go after him, the more his face is short up, and the more people go,  \"You know what though, I'm still feeling better economically.\"</p><p>And that is why people go to the polls.  Russia is down there, I think  number 16 as far as issues that are most important to the American people  right now.  And so I think what the democrats need to do, if they want to  win this in November is they've got to come up with a message that is going  to counter anything that the president's doing in the economy.</p><p>And I think that's why we're seeing a rise in the socialist movement  because people are saying, \"Here are some in it.  If we're going to do this  it's going to make life better for you.  We're going to give you jobs,  we're going to give you foreign income, we're going to get healthcare for  all.\"</p><p>That's the message that gets people excited whether we want to -- and we  can have a debate on that.  But just going after the president and saying  that he's the worst thing that's ever happen and really getting hysterical  about it, that's not going to work for the democrats.  And I think if  that's the way that they're going to approach November, they're going to  have big problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, it comes down to in terms of this democratic  socialist message or whatever you want to call them these days, it comes  down to how you're going to pay for it.  And that's one thing that does hit  people in the pocketbook.</p><p>That's by the president's tweets about the Federal Reserve last week, it  did resonate with people.  Like it or not, I mean we kind of worry about  the president interfering in what is so-called independent Federal Reserve  but, again, people -- that -- people understand that.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well what's interesting and sort of to Lee's point, I think at  the end of the day, the average voter isn't a creature of the new cycle  like the four of us are, OK?  They're not really paying attention to a lot  of it and they really focus on making ends meet, providing for their  family, and if they feel better about that, I think it's going to show up  in the polls.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I did want to point out Lee that -- because we were talking  about it, the president's overall approval rating did end higher in that  poll.  It ends up to 45 percent.  And, again, buoyed by strong support  within his base, within the republican base.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.  See, that I think as much as there where things  that went wrong in Helsinki, there's also things a lot of optimism on the  republicans by Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court appointment.  I think people  are feeling strong support there and I think that is really helping the  president right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's what the republicans and particularly the Senate,  they're showing resistance to this Tax cuts 2.0 that the House is pushing.   Ultimately it falls on the Senate to make sure that Kavanaugh is approved  and voted on to the Supreme Court --</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- by the midterm elections.  And then what -- we have another  Putin visit potentially in the fall, so we'll see how that goes.</p><p>CARTER:  Rise on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We'll see how that goes just in time for the midterm.   Coming up, tragedy in Toronto, at least one person dead, more than a dozen  hurt after a mass shooting.  We have the latest as police investigate the  motive behind the brazen attack.</p><p>And shifting gears at FiatChrysler, Mike Manley taking over the CEO job as  Sergio Marchionne suffers a sudden health crisis, the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A mass shooting in Toronto, Cheryl Casone has the details.   Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well Dagen, good morning.  A  frightening scene after a gunman killed at least one person and injured at  least 13 others including a young girl.</p><p>During the rampage, the suspect later killed at that scene, it happened at  the Toronto neighborhood known as Greek Town.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARK SAUNDERS, TORONTO POLICE CHIEF:  Shortly after 10:00p.m. what happened  was the police responded to a 911 call for sounds of gunshots.  A young  girl is in critical state right now and the other 13 are in the hospital  and being treated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well investigators are trying to find a motive and police say they  would not rule out terrorism.</p><p>Well, stunning news, and a change at the top for FiatChrysler breaking  over the weekend, its longtime CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced.   Marchionne underwent shoulder surgery about three weeks ago but his  condition has since worsened according to the company.  </p><p>Now Mike Manley who runs the Jeep SUV and RAM truck division is the new  CEO.  Shares of FiatChrysler we should say are lower on this news.   Sergio, of course, as stunning force for the company, down three percent in  the premarket as you can see.</p><p>And then there was a new record set at the box office this weekend, eight  of the top ten movies were sequels.  And the top spot went to a surprise  upset.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They killed my friend.  (INAUDIBLE) in everyone of them  and the only disappointment is that I only get to do it once.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well Sony's \"The Equalizer 2\" starring Denzel Washington brought  in $35.8 million.  Equalizer narrowly beat another sequel, Universal's  \"Mama Mia Here We Go Again\" which made $34.4 million which beat the  original film by the way by about seven million bucks, pretty good.</p><p>Taking third, Sony's \"Hotel Transylvania III\" with $23.3 million.  Rounding  up top five, \"Ant Man and the Wasp\" and \"Incredibles 2\" Dagen.  Feel free  to have \"Mama Mia\" stuck in your head for the rest of the morning as I do  right at this moment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why it beat the original?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One word, Cher.</p><p>CASONE:  Cher.  Got you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just despite her craziness on Twitter, I can't even -- she  speaks a language of her own on Twitter.  But --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  This is a business program, so I'd like to know how much ABBA  gets every time there's a -- one of those movies, \"Mama Mia\" movies.</p><p>BELL:  Oh yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I think we'll -- we will put the burden on you Mitch  Roscelle.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  I'm going to start Googling -- I'm a -- I ask a question,  research the results.  All right. </p><p>CARTER:  And theory.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>BELL:  I saw the show on Broadway and it was absolutely phenomenal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So this is the -- this is the sequel.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So if Meryl Streep is still in -- this is the sequel to the  original film.  So, again, ABBA who would have thought?</p><p>Coming up, war of words with Iran, President Trump ramping up the tough  talk as sanctions on the country are reinstated next week and after he  dumped the Obama Era nuclear deal.  The stern threat, next.</p><p>And now you can have vodka from the final frontier, find out how you can  throwback a cocktail made with just a hint of the extra-terrestrial. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Escalating tensions with Iran, President Trump calling out  Iran's president after the leader said U.S. policies toward the country  could lead to the \"mother of all wars\" with Iran.  </p><p>In a tweet last night the president wrote, \"To Iranian President Rouhani,  never ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences  the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before.  We  are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence  and death, be cautious.\"  All caps.</p><p>This coming as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling out Iran's  religious leaders and address plans to re-impose economic sanctions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Ayatollahs are in on the act  too.  Judging by their best, well they seem more concerned with riches than  religion.  These hypocritical (INAUDIBLE) all kinds of crooked schemes to  become some of the wealthiest men on earth while their people suffer.</p><p>Right now the United States is undertaking a diplomatic and financial  pressure campaign to cut off the funds that the regime uses to enrich  itself and support death and destruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us the Editorial Director for the Washington Examiner,  Hugo Gurdon.  Hugo, your take on this?</p><p>HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  You know, President  Trump is reminding the Iranians that things don't go well when those  countries threaten the United States.</p><p>Your viewers probably remember that Saddam Hussein promised the mother of  all battles against the United States but he was crying uncle after three  weeks o the first Gulf War and he was dead after the second.  </p><p>What you're really hearing is the fact that the Iranians are feeling the  strain of the end of the deal that President Obama put in place.  The  United States, Israel, and some Arab countries are really putting pressure  on Iran to undermine it throughout the region and the peeps have started to  squeak.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think that we get a new deal because, again, we're -- new  sanctions will go into place, I think it starts next month.  </p><p>There's the issue about Europe, but partly few American companies really  stepped up to begin doing business in a significant way in Iran after that  nuclear deal from President Obama because it was not ratified as a treaty  and they assumed that the next president because it could be a republican  would pull out of it and sure enough, that's what happened.</p><p>GURDON:  Right.  Well American companies did not but the European countries  certainly have.  But, you know, the European countries going to have to  make the calculation, do they want to do business with the Iranian economy  or do they want to do business with the much, much bigger American economy?   It's hardly a choice at all.</p><p>They are going to have to adjust, they're going to have to start scaling  back and ending business and, of course, there are the oil -- there's the  question of oil exports.  It's that that could mean as much as $1 trillion  of losses, loss revenue to the Iranians over the course of the next 10  years.  </p><p>This is really, really serious problems for the Iranians that the Mullahs  have losing support from the country, the country is fed up with their  theocracy.  And as I say, you know, the allies, the United States, Israel,  and countries like Saudi Arabia are increasing pressure to try and  undermine the Iranian Regime.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Hugo, Mitch Roschelle.  And Dagen made reference to it in terms  of whether or not there's a new deal.  If there was some sort of new deal,  what would the foundation of that deal be?  Obviously be much different  than the deal in the past but is there sort of a rubric or a framework for  what a deal would look like?</p><p>GURDON:  It seems to me that -- I mean, this obviously as to some extent a  speculation at this point.  It doesn't seem to me that there's a deal that  can be done with the Iranians, you know, in the way that the -- that Obama  Administration did.</p><p>I mean, the last thing that this administration wants to do is to cement  the Iranian Regime in place.  I don't know that there's any deal that could  be done which was acceptable to this country and acceptable to Iran.  I  mean, that's something we're going to have to read about and see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was going to -- just to clarify Hugo, I said the first  sanctions are set to be -- take place next month, it's actually on August  the 4th.  So it's coming up shortly, followed by the measures that will  target Iranian oil, that begins to happen on November 4th.</p><p>That's why it's so critical that the United States has a growing oil supply  that we're increasingly energy independent or heading toward that.</p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're the biggest exporter in the world of refine petroleum  product and that --</p><p>GURDON:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- gives us an incredible amount of leverage over someone like  Russia and its partner in crime Iran.</p><p>GURDON:  Exactly.  So, the United States became the biggest energy  producer.  I think more than a year ago it's now the biggest oil producer  as well, it's overtaking Saudi Arabia.</p><p>This gives it leverage all over the world.  For example, President Trump in  Europe just a week or so ago pressing Germany on the gas pipeline from  Russia, putting pressure on them to buy energy from the United States.  </p><p>The United States has a much greater ability than it has ever had to  control the price of oil and that's the way it can really squeeze the  Iranians.</p><p>BELL:  But then there was also the report that we were going to give some  of our allies in Europe a pass on purchasing oil from Iran, is that still  on the table because I've heard stories both ways?</p><p>GURDON:  Yes.  You know, I've hears stories both ways too.  You know,  there's also -- it's also being said that, \"No, the November deadline is a  deadline and the Europeans are going to have to fall into line.\"</p><p>And the closer we get to that deadline the more likely it is that the  Europeans are going to have to scramble to get themselves in position.   They don't want to lose business, they don't want to any sanctions that  prevent their access to the American market.  The Iranian market is much,  much smaller.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And all of this surely will be discussed with Jean-Claude  Juncker, the President of the European Commission who's visiting the White  House on Wednesday of this week because in recent months the -- Europe has  been talking about exploring activating accounts for the Iranian Central  Bank to basically keep this agreement alive.  So there's much to discuss in  terms of Iran in Europe.</p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hugo, thank you for being here.  It's great to see you as  always.</p><p>GURDON:  Thanks so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hugo Gurdon.  Coming up, pizza fight, the board of Papa John's  is going to extremes to prevent the company's founder from gaining  controlling interest after stepping down for using a racial epitaph.  We've  got the details on the so-called poison pill.</p><p>And turning nature's wrath into a tourist destination, Hawaii's plan to  help boost tourism by using the same lava that's damaging the industry.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Earning season  in full swing, one-third of the Dow and S&amp;P 500 later to post results, this  week.</p><p>Checking market action this morning, we have Futures are slightly lower  across the board, but much news is coming down the pipeline to move those  markets, 19-point loss on Dow Futures, right now.  On Friday, all three  major market gauges finished the day, little change.  It was still an up  week for the Dow and S&amp;P.</p><p>In Europe, we have declines across the board, in England, France and  Germany, stocks selling off in just a bit.  The biggest loser is the CAC  Quarante in France, down half of one percent.  In Asia overnight, markets  closing mixed.  The Nikkei in Japan and the KOSPI in South Korea, both  lower.  </p><p>A board room battle heating up.  Why Papa John's board members are adopting  a poison pill to stop its founder from gaining controlling stake in the  pizza chain.  That's ahead.</p><p>Plus, Hawaii is working to bring business back after volcanic eruptions  displaced residents.  How the state could start a lava tourism business,  later this hour.  And a new alcohol is taking inspiration from Star Trek.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Captain Scott is unaware of the existence of Synthehol.</p><p>CAPTAIN SCOTT:  Synthehol?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir.  It is an alcohol substitute, now being  served aboard star ships.  It simulates the appearance, taste and smell of  alcohol, but the intoxicating effects can be easily dismissed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Details of new liquor that contains vodka from space and also an  award to the producer who located that clip from Star Trek generation.  But  to our top story this half hour, technology in focus, among the big names  reporting earnings today, Google's parent company, Alphabet, less than a  week after the company was hit with a record five billion-dollar fine by  the E.U.</p><p>Our next guest is, there's opportunity here, joining me now is Alfred  Eskandar, CEO of Salt Financial, Alfred, good to see you.</p><p>ALFRED ESKANDAR, CEO, SALT FINANCIAL:  Good morning, good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  What are you expecting from Alphabet today?</p><p>ESKANDAR:  We're pretty excited about Google's earnings today.  And we  think</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, just call (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ESKANDAR:  We think it has shown a lot more life lately.  It has gone from  what we viewed as a very calm stock only rising about 1.1 percent more than  the S&amp;P for the first few months to now, actually showing a whole lot more  sensitivity and what we really look for are stocks and sectors that are  sensitive to the overall market because we think that's where investors can  get an edge.  </p><p>BELL:  Well, volatility, really, when we enter this year, it's just been a  theme, it's been returned to the market and I think a lot of individual  investors have had a hard time dealing with that. </p><p>But the good news about that is it resulted in a decoupling of individual  securities from the actual overall market, how do you take advantage of  that and is tech the biggest place that you can take advantage of it?</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Well, tech has really been the big story all year.  In fact, if  you look at its performance, it's up around 50 percent, year to date,  versus, what, five percent for the S&amp;P, so -- but if you're going to have a  broader market rally, other sectors need to participate as well.</p><p>Volatility as you mentioned, has spiked up this year.  Certainly, we all  remember February.  But if you look at last year, we all kind of fell  asleep.  Volatility was incredibly low.  The market was tremendously  resilient and just showed no sign of slowing down or going down.</p><p>This year, volatility has returned a little bit more to normal, I believe  (INAUDIBLE) around 12, 13 right now.  Normally, it's actually around 17.   So, we are still somewhat calm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where do you think is the greatest risk in terms of even if you  just want to look at industries that are overpriced right for volatility?   I was just looking at how these big tech stocks perform month to date, and  Alphabet going into this earnings report is still up six percent.</p><p>It's not up as much say, a Facebook, an Amazon or even a Microsoft,  Microsoft is up closer to eight percent, but it's still got a really nice  fat gain on in for the month.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Well, you know, it's interesting that you mention Facebook,  that's also going to report later on, I believe it's on Wednesday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Amazon, later on the week.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  And Amazon.  But just focusing on Facebook for a second, the  thing that's important for investors, particularly retail, you know,  there's only three ways to make money in the market, your selection, your  timing and your overall allocation.</p><p>And Facebook has been a relatively calm stock, believe it or not, I mean,  it had a little bit of an issue in February -- in March, I believe, it  brushed it off, hit new highs.  But it's not moving as much with the  market.</p><p>And that's what we look for in terms of giving an edge back to investors to  basically participate more in the up rally.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Alfred, if you want to, sort of, look beyond the big tech names  who've clearly driving the S&amp;P, where are the places in the S&amp;P 500, what  sectors would you, sort of, rotate to if you are just worried about how  frothy some of those names have gotten.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  So, we love financials, industrials, as you guys mentioned  earlier, and technology.  Those are the three biggest sectors right now in  our fund.  We see these sectors again way more sensitive to the overall  market than some of the others.</p><p>And we think that's where you want to be exposed for this quarter.   Ironically, Energy was the big surprise, second quarter.  I don't think  anyone really called it out.  But it actually outpaced technology, it was a  14 percent surprise gainer versus five percent, I believe, for technology  at the same time.</p><p>So, thinking about sectors -- you know, again, industrials, financials and  technologies, where you want to be right now.</p><p>BELL:  So, you think Energy's over though, because this is going a good  quarter, probably for Energy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  11 billion-barrels a day --</p><p>BELL:  Prices up 41 percent in the second quarter, so the numbers should be  really good.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  True, but then we saw some pressure on crude and we saw that the  Energy trade slip away.  If we are going to get into a bounce and if we are  going to have a little bit more momentum in the second half of the year, we  don't see Energy right now as the place to be.</p><p>The industrials, financials and technology sectors right now, are  demonstrating to us the highest true beta scores.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mentioned industrials.  But industrials would be and are the  most vulnerable to this trade fight that we have gotten into, even our  major trading partners with the steel and aluminum tariff, initially, even  the washing machine tariffs early in the year, that kicked in in January.</p><p>Now, we're in this fight.  And so, there is the greatest downside risk in  industrials.  I pointed out Caterpillar in 3M, are down 13 and 14 percent,  respectively, year to date.  And we've got 3M Harley Davidson whirlpool  come out with earnings later this week.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  You know, industrials, obviously, much more sensitive to trade  tariffs and some of the other sectors.  When we look at tariffs at 32  billion, you know, it's not a big piece of the overall economy.  I think  last week with the Trump administration talking about potentially 500  billion.  That's a different -- that's a different ball game.</p><p>So it will be challenged.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did the market react to that at all, because again, it was kind  of a so-so.  </p><p>ESKANDAR:  It flinched.  It flinched a little bit and, you know, it didn't  have a massive move.  And I think, you know, for investors to take some  comfort, the market has become incredibly efficient and resilient.  </p><p>And by that, I mean -- you know, in my 20 plus years of being in this  business, I have seen the market become better and better and better in  distilling information, not getting, you know, actually being able to  differentiate between sensationalism and substance and.  I think we is that  last week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, what about the sensationalism and or substance of the  President tweeting about the Federal Reserve and the U.S. dollar and other  currencies because, again, Secretary Mnuchin came out and said, well, the  President believes in an independent Federal Reserve.</p><p>But in the past, you know, when you have presidential pressure on the  central bank, it down the road has created some serious problems for the  country and I'm talking about runaway inflation in the 70s.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Well, Chairman Powell, I think, did a great job with his  testimony last week.  And I think what he demonstrated was a clarity in how  he sees things progressing.  It's very hard to not be optimistic about the  second half of the year, given how tremendous the job market looks right  now.</p><p>And if anything, I think he's doing the President a favor, you know, by  controlling inflation, you get to continue the growth that we're enjoying  right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, maybe the President is -- we will see if the President is  hearing that message because the Wall Street Journal reported that he  picked J Powell over Kevin Marsh and John Taylor because he was told that J  Powell would be more malleable.</p><p>So, again, there is some expectation.  There could be some executive branch  control over the fed, but we will see what happens.  Good to see you,  Alfred.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Alfred Eskandar, thank you.  And President Trump is tweeting  this morning.  So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and  fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the  DNC, that was knowingly and falsely submitted to FISA and which was  responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller  witch hunt.  </p><p>We will dig into more of that, but, again, those FISA documents released,  they're still redacted but released over the weekend and the President has  been busy tweeting on that note.  And we will discuss it coming up.</p><p>We will also talk about oil, all eyes watching the cost of crude with  global trade worries, the President's threats toward Iran and then we have  x on Mobile and Chevron reporting earnings, later this week.  Busy week for  big oil, we break down on what you need to know.</p><p>Plus, giving moonshine a whole new meaning, there's a new Star Trek vodka  that promises to be out-of-this-world.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Energy in focus, oil prices searching for direction after coming  of their third weekly decline in a row.  Joining us now, the Schork Report  Publisher, Stephen Schork, Stephen, with the President tweeting about Iran,  uses some tough language on that regime, what are you looking at in terms  of driving oil prices today and this week?</p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Well, I tell you what, Dagen,  there's nothing like waking up as an oil trader at 4:00 o'clock in the  morning and seeing a tweet storm between Trump and the Muellers, that  certainly going to put a hop in your step right there.  </p><p>That said, I can't imagine what the Iranians are thinking of.  It's as if  they are daring Trump to release barrels from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve.  And I have been talking about this now for the past two months,  actually, since Trump re-enacted the sanctions against Iran.  You got two  big factors that the bulls are counting on right now, Dagen.  </p><p>First and foremost, we had an unplanned outage bitchumen, mining operation  out in Calgary, Canada.  So, imports in Canada, this summer, peak driving  season have just fallen to the floor.  So, a significant amount of barrels,  in fact, over recent five-week stretch, we saw 31 million-barrel decline in  U.S. crude oil stocks.  That's the largest five-week decline we've ever  seen.</p><p>We also have a situation Heating Oil here in New York Harbor which is where  you may take delivery on a NYMEX diesel contract, where we're looking at  supplies given those nor'easters that we saw in March and the yields that  we were seeing from refineries, heating off stocks at the lowest points  since 2000.  So Trump outside of his ego has two very real fundamental  economic justifications for release of the SPR, so the Iranians ought to  trend lightly in this case.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we've got about 650 million barrels in the SPR right now.   When do you roughly, I think it's a little bit more than that.  Stephen,  when do you -- </p><p>SCHORK:  Yes, something like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when do you expect this would happen?  And again, you also  have trade tensions with Canada which is critical and even Mexico, but  Canada which is a critical supplier of oil into the United States.  So,  when do you think this SPR release happens?</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, it's a possibility right there and it's certainly on our  radar.  At this point of the season, and I think your prior guest said that  he's not into energy right now, it's a good thought because right now  demand has peaked right now for crude oil.  We're at the peak crude oil  demand season.  We're at the apogee of the market right now.  And in the  weeks, months ahead, crude oil demand will begin to fall off as we  transition out of the summer.</p><p>And when we look at supply productions at a record all-time, 11 million  barrels a day.  We're also looking at gasoline stocks.  Unlike diesel  stocks, gasoline stocks are one of the highest levels for the month of July  we've ever seen.  So, right now, the demand is falling.  So I think the big  caveat out there, Dagen, is the situation with geopolitics.  Watch your  Twitter accounts and your Twitter feeds, because from a fundamental  standpoint, if we are going to see continued pullback in crude oil prices,  we're at the point, like I said, demand has peak.  It's going to start  falling in the weeks ahead for both crude oil and gasoline.  We're going  into the fall shoulder months, so we're looking at the falling demand,  rising production.</p><p>So the coast is clear for lower prices.  We just have to wait and see and  the one caveat out there, as I said, is the diesel situation in New York  Harbor and, of course, the geopolitical tensions with our friends over in  Tehran.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I will point out in terms of you talking about gasoline  stocks high, demand peaking, the national average for gasoline has been  falling.  It's at $2.84 right now.  That is the current average.  That is  higher than it was a year ago, but that is lower than it was a month ago,  lower than it was a week ago as well.  Lindsey.</p><p>SCHORK:  Absolutely.  I guess what happens -- yes, sorry, I'm sorry.</p><p>BELL:  I was just going say we saw Halliburton numbers came out just now  and they missed pretty significantly.  We saw -- I think it's 41 cents  versus 58 cents expected on the bottom line.  We saw Schlumberger last  week.  It was a pretty decent report.  What are you expecting from the  energy sector as a whole?  I know these are service companies, but what are  you expecting this earning season?</p><p>SCHORK:  Yes.  No, I expect from both an upstream and a downstream.  I'm  expecting another solid quarter coming out of the industry.  We're looking  an industry a year ago where they were hoping for $50 barrel oil to be  sustainable.  A year later we've got 65, 70, $75 oil where the market is  holding.  So, we are significantly higher from an oil perspective.  So  certainly from -- and from the demand perspective.  So all these people who  want to complain, like they think gasoline prices are too high.  Well, if  they're too high, why is demand for gasoline at an all-time high?  So,  obviously gasoline prices are not too high.  It's because the economy is  much stronger.  And the stronger economy leads commodity prices.  Commodity  prices are following the economy and therefore I would expect the earnings  from this industry to follow in accord.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Same story can be said about interest rates too, Stephen, good  to see you, my friend.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.</p><p>SCHORK:  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stephen Schork.</p><p>Coming up, turning the erupting Hawaii volcano into an explosion of cash.   Next, Hawaii's plan to help boost tourism by using the same lava that's  damaging the industry.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Papa John's taking action against its former chairman.  Cheryl  Casone has the details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  The drama continues for Papa John's.  Their board has voted to  adopt a poison pill aimed to preventing John Schnatter from getting a  controlling stake in the company that he founded with just one pizza oven.   That poison pill defense can be used to prevent a hostile takeover.   Schnatter who owns 29 percent stake in Papa John's resigned as chairman  earlier this month after using a racial slur during a conference call.  He  wasn't pressured to resign.  He did so, but things may be changing now.   Shares of Papa John's down eight percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, this is fascinating.  It's images of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, stun  the world.  Once small Hawaii town is hoping it can profit off of lava  tourism.  Big Island businesses are asking for a lava viewing site  somewhere on the island, but authorities haven't found a safe way to do  this.  Pressures mounting from local merchants, tour guides, and others who  have seen the tourism industry completely drop off on the island since  Kilauea began erupting back in May.  It is basically decimating their small  businesses and that small town is right near the volcano.  It's the entry  gate to the volcano in that park.</p><p>And then here is this.  One company boldly going where no man has gone  before and making a Star Trek-inspired space vodka.  It's going to be named  Ten-Forward vodka after the spaceship bar that is featured in Star Trek:  The Next Generation, the T.V. show.  The company says it's going to send a  small batch of vodka into atmosphere using a high altitude balloon to  ensure, quote, \"That every portion of every bottle will contain vodka  officially from space.\"  It will then be blended and bottled here on earth.   The vodka available for preorder for $29.99.  And, yes, Dagen, best Star  Trek clip ever was featured in your reset back at 6:30 this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was very impressed by that.  So a shout-out, apparently it's  going to go into the mesosphere.  You know where the mesosphere is?</p><p>BELL:  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The region of our atmosphere above the stratosphere and below  the thermosphere.  Between about 30 and 50 miles in altitude.  I know how  to use Google very well.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I know nautical terms, not space terms.  I can't -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Vodka is vodka, though, isn't it?  I wonder if they're paying  loyalties to the estate of Gene Roddenberry, just asking.  I don't think  it's -- the word start -- yes, USS Enterprise.  I'm sure of that.</p><p>CARTER:  It must be.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Lee, this is about branding.</p><p>CARTER:  Clearly that's branding.  I mean, this is a total gimmick,  obviously.  But you know what?  We're talking about it and would we be  talking about a vodka launch otherwise?  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would argue that Star Trek fans are even more loyal and  serious about their devotion than Star Wars fans.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh, there's no doubt.  There is no doubt.  And people feel  strongly about both.  You feel one way or the other.  But there's no doubt  that Trekkies are more active in their support.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do not insult Star Trek.</p><p>CARTER:  No way.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  More importantly, we don't have vodka right now on the set.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Just to be clear. Just water.  Just water.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks, Mitch.  You want me to tell the story about when you  were coming in this morning?  I was like, Mitch, what's on your mind?  And  you're like, I'm still asleep.  He's waking up.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I'm waking up now.  I'm awake.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The alarming number of millennials tapping into their 401(k)  plans to buy their first home.

Good.</p><p>CARTER:  All right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  We like happy endings.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll watch this video again and talk about it.</p><p>But to our top story this hour -- trade tensions taking center stage.   President Trump will host a White House event showcasing American products  from all 50 states today.  The display follows escalating trade tensions  with Europe, Mexico, Canada and China -- a battle that has American  manufacturers wrestling with the fallout from Trump's tariffs.</p><p>Joining me now -- Gordon Chang, author of \"The Coming Collapse of China\".   Gordon -- this even follows President Trump's threats to impose tariffs on  all $500 billion worth of Chinese imports into this country every year.   The Commerce Department had a hearing last week about imposing tariffs on  auto imports.  That still remains to be seen.</p><p>But how much retaliation can we expect from China?  How dangerous is this  to the United States economy, do you think?  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\":  Well, the Chinese  certainly will retaliate -- Dagen.  But, you know, they really -- first of  all, they've run out of bullets.  So we only import -- or export to them  about $130 billion or something, and we take from them $505.5 billion last  year.  It's going to be more this year because we've got a robust economy.</p><p>You know, a lot of people say well, you know, the Chinese can retaliate  against U.S. companies in China, but Chinese officials don't want that to  happen because they're worried about the effect on the Europeans and others  who are investing in China.  And they think that that could really  boomerang on China and hurt Beijing much more than it hurts us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was -- he amplified President  Trump's trade threats in Argentina over the weekend at that G-20 meeting of  finance ministers.  The Secretary said this, quote, \"That he wouldn't  minimize the chance of the U.S. imposing tariffs on all -- its half a  trillion dollars with Chinese goods that we import into the United States,  but he still promises a light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>So listen to this, and I want to get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  President Trump is determined to have free and fair and more  balanced trade, and we just want to make sure American companies and  American workers are treated fairly.  And, yes, I do see a light at the end  of the tunnel.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How do you think this plays out?  Do you think that it doesn't  get to the point where we do slap tariffs on all imports coming in from  China?  </p><p>CHANG:  You know, that's a real possibility.  You know, we've got remember  that this is for the theft of U.S. intellectual property and its forced  taking.  These are imposed under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 after  that investigation into China's thievery.</p><p>So yes, we call this a trade war, but really this is about a remedy for  thievery.  It has trade implications, of course, but we've got to do this,  Dagen -- because the Chinese take hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S.  IP a year.  This is just unsustainable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well then, why didn't we take the tack that was pushed by Peter  Navarro in terms of cracking down on Chinese companies buying entities here  in the United States and then the technology exports into China?  Instead,  we kind of took a little bit of a lighter touch with the increased CFIUS  restrictions or committee on foreign investment in the U.S.</p><p>That was more what Secretary Mnuchin wanted, that's what Congress is moving  to do.  They actually came out of conference last week with how that would  be applied.  So they basically strengthened CFIUS.  So why didn't we do  more?  Why didn't we take a harder approach on that note then?  </p><p>CHANG:  Because we're Americans and we are so oblivious and have been for a  very long time.  You know, you started to see a change in Washington.  It  started in the last year of the Obama administration when the President  used CFIUS to block a Chinese deal.  And then President Trump has blocked  two or three acquisitions under CFIUS.</p><p>So this is going to be something we're going to see much, much more of.   And you know, yes, people don't like tariffs, but now we're starting to  think about the alternatives.  And of course it's investment bans but also  it could end up sort of being like an import ban.  If we're starting to  look at goods that have been benefiting from China's IP thievery -- there's  all sorts of things that the administration can start to look at.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But does this administration need to start talking about how  this is going to play out in the U.S. economy?  More specifically say, hey,  half a trillion dollars worth of imports -- everybody in this country, if  you buy anything made in China, you're going to pay more for it.  Hey,  farmers, you've got 2.5 billion pounds of meat that's now piling up as  exports slow to these nations.  You have soybean farmers that are getting  hit. </p><p>There is going to be pain, and it could be widespread, but does this  administration need to be really frank with the American people about this?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, it certainly does, you know.  And President Trump has hinted  about the pain.  But clearly, you cannot have decades of really bad trade  policy and policies on IP theft and not expect that the U.S. isn't going to  suffer at all.</p><p>We are going to suffer, but we actually have to do this because of the  scale of China's predation.  </p><p>CARTER:  So there's a lot of people out there who are saying this is a game  of chicken.  And that, ultimately, that the Chinese are going to have to  give something up here.  How long do you think it's going to take that  we're going to be feeling this pain until there's some movement?  </p><p>CHANG:  You know, we could be in a decades-long struggle with China.  You  know, when the Treasury Secretary talks about having equal access to the  Chinese market -- that's just ridiculous.  The Chinese system is designed  to prevent access of foreigners into China.  And under Xi Jinping, the  current Chinese ruler, it's become less, you know -- less open than it was  before.</p><p>So, you know, this is going to be a long-term struggle.  So we can be in  this for a very, very, very long time.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Well, China's already devaluing  their currency.  They're releasing reserves from the banks.  They're  preparing.  And they must be feeling the pain right now already from these  early moves on trade.  What brings them to the table?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, I think that when Xi Jinping realizes that there's no more  Chinese economy left, that's really when you get to the point.  Now look -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have that power?  Because again, if we want to take more  power away from -- </p><p>CHANG:  It's easy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but if we want to take more power away from China then we  stop running $1 trillion annual budget deficits, which is where we're  headed in the 2019 fiscal that we stop spending so much money and we don't  have to lean on China so much to buy our debt because we're not -- because  we can try to control spending.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  I don't think we have to worry about the debt.  The one  thing, you know, if President Trump really wants to hurt the Chinese  economy, he just allows Chairman Powell to raise rates.  Because what  you're seeing right now is U.S. interest rate increases are affecting the  Chinese economy.</p><p>Money is coming out.  And, you know, you go back to this whole thing about  the currency -- I don't think China is actually devaluing its currency.   The renminbi is declining.  It's tumbling and had its worst month ever last  year against the dollar -- I mean last month.</p><p>But the point right now is that the Chinese people are not expressing  confidence in their own currency.  And I think Beijing is trying to prevent  the fall rather than encourage it.</p><p>You know, down the road, you know, I could see Beijing changing tack and  forcefully driving down the renminbi to help exporters.  But they're not  doing that now because they're so worried about currency outflow which  almost killed the economy in 2015 and 2016.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Just from a capital markets perspective, we've seen money  flowing out of Chinese equity markets.  We're also seeing less money  invested domestically in infrastructure, in capital expenditures of their  companies, so is this beginning to happen?  And does their administration  realize that their economy's starting to get shaky?  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes, I think that the Chinese do understand that.  You have  academics in China starting to say look, we cannot sustain a long-term  struggle with the United States.  And right now you're starting to see real  signs of stress in the Chinese economy whether you're talking about the  tumbling stock markets, you know, the currency that looks like it's in the  early stages of collapse, all of the debt defaults.  You know, private  companies -- the problems with the peer-to-peer lenders, it just goes on  and on -- Mitch.</p><p>All the problems -- I don't know if Xi Jinping has any answer to this  except to try to take on more debt, and Chinese people are starting to look  at this and say, no, this doesn't work.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But if they continue to take on more debt there, do they have  the wallet to buy our debt?  Because that could drive our interest rates  even higher if there's no bid coming from China for U.S. Treasuries.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, you know, China's going to have to sell dollars to  support their currency.  They've been doing that up to now over the last  several months.  They're going to have to do more of that just because of  their own internal problems.</p><p>So, you know, China's going to do what it's going to have to do because  their economy's at the point where, you know, anything could -- if it goes  wrong -- could trigger those crises of confidence that we saw three years  ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If we're getting tough on China, why didn't we stick by that ban  on ZTE in this country?  It appears that the sanctions that were put back  in this defense bill were stripped out again.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  You know, amen to that -- you know, we should not have given  them relief.  But administration officials don't talk to me, but my guess  is this Wednesday there is the deadline on Qualcomm's deal to buy NXP, the  semiconductor company.  That deal will be held up if China does not give  approval.</p><p>My guess, Dagen -- and this is just pure speculation is that the  administration gave relief to ZTE so that Qualcomm will get that approval  for the acquisition.  I don't know, but it makes a lot of sense to me that  you could have a tit for tat sort of we'll do something for you, you do  something for us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So we've got $34 billion in Chinese imports right now that have  tariffs on them that they've retaliated dollar for dollar, if you will;  another $16 billion coming, an additional $200 billion that's being  studied.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think that the United States puts a tariff on every  dollar worth of imports into this country, more than half a trillion?  Do  you think that happens?  </p><p>CHANG:  I think we get up to maybe $400 billion is just my guess, you know.   And this is nothing that I know.  It's just sort of thinking about it, that  President Trump will actually go forward with the $200 billion and more  beyond that.  I don't think we get to the whole $505.5 billion but, you  know, we're going to get very, very close.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there's really no way to truly know how China retaliates,  isn't it?  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Xi Jinping is a tough guy.  I mean Larry Kudlow said at that  conference a couple of days ago.  Look, you know, the Chinese trade  officials they want to deal with us, but Xi Jinping is saying no.  </p><p>So this has become very, very political.  They're heading into their August  conference, the Communist Party senior officials at Beidaihe.  They're  going to be talking about this.  This is the number one topic on their  agenda because Xi Jinping is in trouble politically because he now owns  this crisis.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How quickly does this show up when people go to a store and want  to buy something?  They can't find it or they have to pay a lot more for  it?  </p><p>CHANG:  I don't think there's a problem because, you know, China is no  longer the low cost producer.  Companies can shift -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good point.</p><p>CHANG:  -- production very, very quickly.  The only company that can't  shift production on a dime is Apple because they're stuck with Foxconn.   Foxconn is in Shenzhen and other locations in China.  Apple can really get  hurt because they're going to be the number one target that the Chinese  officials are going to look at.</p><p>Yes, they might like Tim Cook today, but tomorrow they see that he's the  weak point in the U.S. economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gordon Chang -- great to talk to you.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.

I say that is not a bad thing.  We've got that  story after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Millennials are taking risks against their older, future selves  in order to buy a home.</p><p>Gerri Willis is here with this story.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning -- Dagen.</p><p>That's right.  More money problems for millennial -- members of this  younger generation opting to raid their retirement savings for a down  payment on a home.  According to a new survey from Bank of the West, nearly  one in three millennials say they tapped or borrowed against their 401(k)  or IRA, that is, to buy their home.</p><p>Financial advisers caution against it saying it could put their retirement  at risk in the future.  One of them said this, quote,  \"Tapping your 401(k) to buy a home should be a last resort.  Millennial  home buyers should exhaust all other funding options first.\"</p><p>Now if you do borrow experts note that Roth IRAs allow penalty-free  withdrawals of up to $10,000 for first-time home purchases.  Borrowing from  the 401(k) on the other hand triggers federal and state income tax and a 10  percent early withdrawal penalty.</p><p>Home ownership is a priority for millennials who say, hey, it's a good  financial investment -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Gerri -- here's or what I'll argue.  If you actually borrow  from your 401(k) and your company -- it's up to whether your company allows  it -- it doesn't trigger as long as you begin to repay it, you don't have  to pay the penalty and you don't have to pay tax on it.  You can take your  own money out of your 401(k) plan, and then it's automatically repaid  through paycheck deduction.  </p><p>WILLIS:  And the problem with that is ok -- there are several problems with  that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you think there's a problem?  Because I know -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Yes, I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- plenty of people who have done that.</p><p>WILLIS:  Everybody does it.  That's just the problem.  Right now at this  very moment in this country 20 percent of folks have a loan out against  their 401(k), but when you take that money out, it automatically reduces  your take-home because you're paying that back immediately through  withdrawals on, you know, your income, right?</p><p>Secondly, you're probably going to end up selling high and buying -- or  buying low and selling high, when we say it's the opposite way because  you'll sell when the S&amp;P 500 is at one level and by the time you're ready  to reinvest again, it'll be at a higher level probably.  So, you know, it's  just a recipe for -- </p><p>BELL:  And you give up compound interest.  </p><p>WILLIS:  That was my next point.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know but it's your -- my issue is it is your money.  It's your  money in a 401(k) plan and it's a way to access it without paying an IRS  penalty, without paying tax on it and without having to go to your parents  or relatives to borrow it.</p><p>I would rather owe myself than owe mama and daddy because you know they'll  be -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Nobody's advocating borrowing from mom and dad.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know but if the issue is hey I need an extra -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Save it yourself.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- if I need an extra $10,000 to get this down payment because,  again the higher the down payment, the better the terms of the loan.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Think of it this way.  T. Rowe Price showed in a recent survey  that you borrow $10,000 from that 401(k), that's $100,000 at retirement.   So, you know, the end result is people who borrow once tend to borrow  multiple times.  At the end of the day, you're going to have less savings  for retirement -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well but -- </p><p>WILLIS:  -- and I think that's what people want to avoid.  And when you  look at the new changes they're going to make to a 401(k), they're going to  make it even easier for you to save money.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  -- trends in how people are buying their first-time home.  People  aren't buying starter homes anymore and working up.  They want to go in and  get everything all at once.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Right.  </p><p>CARTER:  Like there's a total shift -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, these mutual fund companies and these money managers  they're going to tell you that it's a bad idea because it means less in  fees if you take the money out.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Listen, I'm not going to defend 401(k)s and I'm not going to  defend the way these things are managed because they do charge ridiculous  fees.  You can always do an IRA if you don't get the match, but you do want  that free money.</p><p>Look, it's not a perfect system, for sure, but I just think, golly, you  know, the last thing you want to do is make your life in your 70th year  worse, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I don't think it's worse if you have a nice home that's  completely paid off.  And particularly if home prices are low and you want  to get in, it's like now is the time to buy -- </p><p>WILLIS:  You know what I like about what you're saying?  It sounds like you  think that homeownership is a good investment.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I do, ultimately.  I think that it's better than renting and not  having any vested interest or any actual financial interest where you live.</p><p>And another -- one critical thing I'll point out about when you do borrow  from your 401(k), if you leave that job, that money has to be repaid -- </p><p>WILLIS:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- very quickly.  It's a very short window.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Two months, 60 days.  Sixty days -- do it inside 60 days, and  there is hell to pay if you don't make it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The IRS isn't going to come after you.  You just have to pay the  -- </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Fingers crossed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you have to pay the taxes and penalty on it immediately -- </p><p>BELL:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- if you don't repay the money.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  You pay yourself-interest though when you take the loan out.   You do pay yourself interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, again, it's your money, and you're paying yourself interest  rather than borrowing it from somebody.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I still don't go along with it, guys.  I disagree.  Not the best  way to fund a new house.  Buy a starter home.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  With your borrowed 401(k) money.  How about that?</p><p>We'll split it.

Again, an unvetted dossier paid for by the Democrats.  </p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Sure, I mean, there are other  provisions of that application.  That's already been at report.  One of  them, of course, is the fact that Carter himself had begun and says that he  was an informal advisor to the -- to the Russians.  So that certainly is  something that the judges could have hung their hats on.  They also talked  about the fact that he may have had discussions with these Russian  officials.  So, there's other things that the court could have latched on  in terms of this application.  Not just the dossier.  </p><p>So, there are other issues that have come up in that application.  And,  frankly, there is a lot of opposition to that application because, one,  that's a lot of redaction, so we don't know the full breadth of what the  application stood for, what the judges actually read in its entirety.  And,  two, the fact that the dossier was even part of the application is  troubling to many individuals that said, look, this should have been fully  vetted before it got to the judges.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you evened had Jim Comey when Bret Baeir interviewed him  when he was on that book tour.</p><p>COLWIN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey had the audacity to look at Bret Baier and say I don't  know who paid for it.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Well, sure.  I mean, now, of course, we know that there -- that  this was paid for -- the dossier was paid for.  So obviously, it's  compromised.  The fact that it was in this application is troubling to many  people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch, I should clarify that, he said he only knew who paid for  it, it wasn't actually running the FBI, that they didn't bother to find out  who paid for it, it was -- he'd read reports that the Clinton campaign had  paid for it.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Mercedes -- </p><p>COLWIN:  And, Dagen, anybody that comes forward and has an application for  wiretapping, it is such an extreme measure and it is such an extreme  measure that when you make these applications, you have to fully vet the  information that you're providing to the judges.  And that's what's so  troubling to everyone, because this is an extreme measure taken by the DOJ.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Mercedes, the documents that were released were heavily  redacted, I don't know that I've ever seen a document so redacted.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  One of the things Judge Napolitano's talked about with us is  potentially going to a judge and letting a judge read the unredacted  version.</p><p>COLWIN:  Sure.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Do you think there's going to be any possibility of getting  that done?  Because if we want transparency, we certainly don't have it  right now.  </p><p>COLWIN:  That's a great point, and a lot of things can happen in camera  which is call in camera.  Where the judges can read this in privacy.  It's  not published to the public, and it is critical especially when you're  talking about issues of this magnitude when such extreme measures are taken  in terms of wiretapping.  That is the most extreme measure that can be  taken when it comes to these types of investigations.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, Mercedes, I'm really --</p><p>COLWIN:  So certainly, that could be done.  </p><p>CARTER:  So, I'm really curious what you think.  This weekend the left is  acting like something great happened, and the right's acting like something  great happened, but did we really learn anything new at all?  </p><p>COLWIN:  (INAUDIBLE) frankly, not really because there are extreme  redactions done in the application.  Two, Carter Page was already in the --  in the -- in the crosshairs of the DOJ in terms of what he had already  presented.  By his own admission in 2013, he had written that he had -- he  had informal advisor to the Russians.  </p><p>So, he was already in that universe.  He was already -- I don't want to say  targeted, but certainly he was already looked at by the DOJ because anyone  that may have these informal ties to Russia would necessary -- would  necessarily be in that -- in that realm of at least scrutiny by the DOJ.  </p><p>So, we've already -- he's already in their crosshairs.  And once he started  orbiting close to the Trump campaign, that's when, of course, it piqued  their interest even greater, and that's when they moved forward with the  wiretap.  At least the application for the wiretapping.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mercedes, Chairman Goodlatte also confirmed to Maria that former  CIA Director John Brennan will be called to testify.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODLATTE:  We have lots of questions for John Brennan, and he will  definitely be sought by the committees for an interview.  This is an  extremely disturbing thing, to see both he and James Comey supposedly  impartial government officials carrying out their jobs in very important  areas in intelligence gathering and law enforcement express the kind of  extreme bias that they've shown now which I think reflects quite accurately  on what they were doing back in 2016.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mercedes, could Brennan face legal ramifications for his role in  the surveillance?  </p><p>COLWIN:  Well, certainly if there is any indication that he had lied to --  within the process, certainly he could face prosecution.  So, it really  depends on what representations are made in the past, what representation  he's going to make once he testifies, and there's always the specter of  perjury, which is they're lying under oath.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he has acknowledged that he's -- he egged on the FBI's probe  of Trump and Russia.  That was in a Wall Street Journal editorial last  Friday.  </p><p>Turning to the Supreme Court, majority leader Mitch McConnell is said to be  willing to call Democrats' bluff on nominee Brett Kavanaugh, let the vote  slip until right before the midterm elections.  Do you see any way  Kavanaugh is not confirmed before or the midterms in November?  </p><p>COLWIN:  I know there's going to be a lot of push.  The Democrats are  seeking over a million pages of documents, so it certainly could -- it  could last beyond the midterm elections, but there's going to be a  tremendous push to put him -- to put him forward, to have a vote.  There's  going to be a lot of that.  But it all depends on how much information's  being sought by the Democrats.  And, frankly, at this point it's  unreasonable in terms of how much they're seeking.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to point this out, because you raised this issue.   Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>COLWIN:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm talking to Lee Carter real quick, this is one of the reasons  that the president's approval rating has held up so well and actually  ticked up.  </p><p>CARTER:  That's absolutely right.  I think the Republican base continues to  support this president even when things are not going great with him.   They're saying you know what, the most important thing to me is the Supreme  Court, and I'm very -- like zero laser focused on it. </p><p>I'm fascinated to see though, if they don't get this done, is it going to  energize Democrats?  Because Democrats haven't had anything to vote for,  for so long, there's been a lot of resist messages, not a lot of things to  get out there and vote for.  People are wanting to go out and support for  gay marriage, Roe v. Wade, which is what the Democrats are saying on the  line here.  And then, that's not necessarily true.  But a million pages --  asking for a million pages, that is obstructionist, that is sending  American people are not going to favor no matter where they sit on the  aisle.  I think that the Democrats have got to start moving things forward  and get to stand for something.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mercedes, I'm going to give you the final word.  </p><p>COLWIN:  So, and it's also disruptive to the Supreme Court.  I mean, what  we have a vacancy that needs to be filled.  So, without that vacant seats  filled, you will not have decisions necessarily rendered, because it may be  a 4-4 split.  You need that deciding vote, whichever way it swings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, and the Democrats --</p><p>COLWIN:  So, it should be very disruptive in the long term.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Democrats would love that, doing a whole lot of nothing.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're good at it.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mercedes Colwin, thank you so much, Mercedes.  Great to see you.   Thanks for getting up early.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, caught on camera without knowing it.  Uber and Lyft  dropping a driver for live streaming passengers.  The fallout ahead.  </p><p>Plus, profitability problems.  Tesla now reportedly asking suppliers for  refunds to help it turn a profit.  The latest headache for the electric  carmaker.  Look at that stock drop.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uber and Lyft under fire again, this time for a driver who was  secretly live streaming passengers.  Cheryl Casone has the detail on this  appalling story, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  It really is, Dagen, thank you.  Uber and Lyft under scrutiny  right now after a driver for both companies secretly live streamed  passengers' trips.  A St. Louis newspaper says the driver recorded live  streams hundreds of passengers' rides to the live video web site Twitch.   That driver has been suspended by Uber which calls the behavior troubling.   Lyft says it also has stopped using that driver that you see on your  screen, by the way.  </p><p>OK, Tesla reportedly asking some of its suppliers to return some of the  money it's paid them.  The Wall Street Journal reports the request for  refunds is part of Tesla's plan to turn a profit.  Yes.  Tesla's CEO Elon  Musk this morning tweeted only costs that actually apply to the third  quarter and beyond will be counted.  Shares of Tesla are trading sharply  lower in the premarket, down more than four percent.  Look at that.</p><p>And ten finally there is this, Dagen, just for you.  A video that's going  viral of a dog caught on camera howling the exact tune of a Britney Spears  song.  You may know it.  </p><p>OK, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I hear it.  I hear it.</p><p>CASONE:  Don't you hear it?  So, the howl sounds, I think identical to the  strings part of the song Toxic.  Here's the real song.  </p><p>Somebody had fun editing this morning here at Fox Business.  </p><p>Anyway, the newfound fame has made the dog, named Riley, a social media  star.  The video's been seen more than four million times.  That's a lot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I ask -- all right, I'm going to say it again, the producers are  crushing it.</p><p>CASONE:  Thank you, Ellie.  Thank you for editing that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  My eyes are watering, that was -- that mash-up, it doesn't get  any better than that, Cheryl.  </p><p>Although, I think you'll agree with me, you kind of -- it's cute, but you  kind of hope your own dogs don't make that sound, can you imagine if that  was your dog?  That was terrible.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Or your neighbors' dogs make those -- </p><p>CASONE:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  You have Coconut and Cannon.  They don't make those  sounds, do they?  </p><p>CARTER:  They don't make those sounds, but Kevin does think he's a  doorbell.  If he hears anything, he's like -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Barks?  </p><p>CARTER:  Smart alert.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, if you pick Charlie up and he don't want to be picked up,  he groans, like that.</p><p>Enough.  Coming up, crying foul.  The Chicago Cubs stepping in after a  grown man steals a foul ball from a little boy.  We have that story in  sports after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just in case anyone needs a refresher course, the Chicago Cubs  remind us that baseball is a kids' game.  Jared, you've got that story.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, baseball's version of  taking candy from a baby is not a good look.  But things had a way of  working out into the end.  Check out what happened at Wrigley Field Sunday.   Cubs first base coach tosses a baseball to a young fan to a front row but  the ball fell under a seat.  The ball dude in the row behind says, hey,  mom, look what I found, and I'm not giving it back to the kid.  Yes,  seriously, the guy just takes the baseball.  So, the Cubs make it right.   Not only did the team give the young fan an official Major League Baseball  All-Star shortstop, Javier Baez signed one for the little guy.  </p><p>And by the way, the Cubs a win, Cubs a win.</p><p>Seems hard to believe, but no Italian-born golfer had ever won any of  golf's four major tournaments, until yesterday.  When 35 year old Francesco  Molinari played mistake three golf.  Final 37 holes in the British Open,  not one bogey.  His birdie on the 72nd and final hole secured a two-shot  victory.  </p><p>Now, while Tiger Woods was one of seven golfers who held the lead  yesterday, first time doing so in the final round of a major seven years,  Tiger double bogeyed on 11, then bogeyed on 12, finished three back tied  for sixth.  </p><p>Also, in golf yesterday we take a look at the leaderboard.  Francesco  Molinari wins it by the couple of strokes.  Rory McIlroy held the lead  briefly, finished tied for second.  Defending champ Jordan Spieth was tied  for ninth.  Near 61-year-old Bernhard Langer finished one under, the same  score as Phil Mickelson.  </p><p>20 years younger than Bernard Langer, Tom Brady and the Patriots open  training camp today and Tom Brady, obviously, still has it.  Watch this.   Brady with all Patriots targets Wes Welker on the back of a golf cart,  watch Brady hit his target, and he doesn't even look.  He's like a baseball  player who takes the swing, and it's just gone.  So, he's all set.  Tom  Brady ready for training camp today.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yey, Tom Brady.  Let's talk about the grown man stealing a ball,  a foul ball from a young child.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  I mean, when I was young, my grandfather used to take us to  Yankees' spring training back when it was in Fort Lauderdale.  And I  remember somebody once tried to do the same thing.  Leaned in, and my  grandfather's big voice stood, hey, what the hell -- you know, and we got  the ball, it was a quick thing.  So, I saw that story, I said, yes, that  brings me back.  </p><p>CARTER:  I just can't believe the fans around him didn't do anything.  Give  me a break.  Yes, give the kid another ball, but seriously?  That man ought  to be ashamed.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I'm surprised that -- is that, see the person who he's  there with, you would have thought that she would have been, give that ball  back.  </p><p>CARTER:  No, she's like taking a picture of it, posting it to Instagram.   Look at my ball.</p><p>MAX:  Well, today's world I'm sure both of them at their job, their  colleagues will shame them on Twitter, and they'll probably never be able  to work again. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I hope they're not making any disturbing about Cubs fans.   Because that is not a Cubs' problem, that's a jerk problem.  An individual  jerk problem.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  Apparently two jerk problem.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but the Cubs made it right which is awesome.  </p><p>CARTER:  How about Tiger's come back?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  Unbelievable.  The line between Tiger not winning and Tiger winning,  very small, three shots.  Had Tiger won this event, and for me that he's  just about there, today it's the biggest story not only in sports, but  probably in the news.  And it's an amazing story of a comeback that I  believe is inspirational.  Yes, the man has faults, and he's certainly  vilified for them and paid his price.  But it shows that even when you're  the absolute best number one in the world, you're the greatest at what you  do, the unbelievable fight that it takes, the determination, what it takes  to grind and come back to still be the best, and Tiger is just about there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What tournament's after this Mitch?  </p><p>MAX:  He's already the fourth favorite at the PGA championship.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  One more major left.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  PGA championship, there's one more major left.  And when is  that, do you know?  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  In August.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  We'll find out when that is.  But again, people want to see  some follow through.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're rooting for him but they want --</p><p>MAX:  He's been building.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But you know what?  There's the playoffs which he probably  won't qualify for -- </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But beyond there there's the sort of the fall finish, and  there's a lot of tournaments that don't have the level of players in them.   I say he's going to win something before the end of the calendar year.  </p><p>MAX:  And then watch out for the FedEx Cup Playoffs. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what?  I'm not betting you on that.  I'll just say yes,  sir to that.  </p><p>Jared Max, thanks.

Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for the second  quarter reporting season.  One-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 set  to post results this week.

All of that and so  much more coming up this morning.  CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell.</p><p>Look who it is, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Lee Carter, the President of Maslansky and Partners.  Sean  Spicer has a new book.  There you go.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>SPICER:  And you've got a copy of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It's not signed.  I don't know what's wrong (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SPICER:  It will be.  It will be signed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It called a briefing.  We're going to talk about to Sean about  it.  Coming up, politics to press and the President.  And maybe the  President will tweet some this hour and we can get your instantaneous  response. </p><p>SPICER:  Probability is high.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  He's already been tweeting this morning.  So, Mr.  President, let's ramp that up to our top story this hour on trade with  China.  President Trump will host a White House event showcasing American  products from all 50 states today following his threats to impose tariffs  on all exports out of China and to the U.S.  We're talking more than $500  billion worth of annual imports.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin amplifying the threats saying he \"would --  he wouldn't minimize\" the chance of this actually happening.  And adding  that.  If Europe believes in free trade, the U.S. is ready for a deal.   Joining me now is Ohio Congressman, Jim Renacci.  A member of the House  Ways and Means Committee, House Budget Committee.  Congressman, first did I  pronounce your name correctly?  </p><p>REP. JIM RENACCI (R), OHIO:  You did.  Renacci, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  So what is your take on President Trump's trade  threats and have you heard concerns from your constituents?  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, it's a mixed bag.  As I talk talked to my constituents they  always say to me, look, we're a little concerned but we want you supporting  the President.  And it's interesting I've had everybody from soybeans, you  know, the agriculture industry into my office to manufactures.  Just last  week and I always say to him, what do you want me to tell President because  I have opportunity to sit with him and what would you rather mew saying?  </p><p>They go, well, we're concerned but we want to you support him.  We want you  -- we realize, you know, we have to go through this process.  It's amazing  because you can't get a straight answer even soybean manufacturer, the  growers, I said to them, now seriously, tell me because they come in and  they say they're concerned.  I said, so what -- so what would your -- if  you had a chance to sit down with him what would you say?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But their business is being hurt though because they -- because  the concern but once people start feeling a real world impact on their  livelihoods, it might be different, right? </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, they are feeling it, they told me they're feeling it but  they also understand the need to be able to go through this.  They  understand the President's negotiating.  That's what I tell them.  We're in  a negotiations phase, let's get through these negotiations.  I've had an  opportunity to sit with the President car where he says, look, I'm worried  about children and grandchildren.</p><p>And at some point in time, you know, we need to make sure that we're  working through this and give me some time and that's what I tell them.  </p><p>SPICER:  How much time do you think that will give him?  </p><p>RENACCI:  You know, it's going to be interesting.  I say that I asked that  question too last week and they said -- I said, how much time do you want  to give them?  And they said, well, let's look at, you know, four, five,  six months and we where we're at.  So that's ---</p><p>SPICER:  Because it feels like if you don't do anything, they suffer the  consequences of Chinese economic policies.  But if you do something that's  some short-term pain and I think that's where -- trying to figure out where  that balance is.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, I was telling them short-term pain, a long-term gain.  I  mean, that's like --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SPICER:  Right.</p><p>RENACCI:  And that's like anything else.  We have to go be willing to do  that.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  When you were -- we were just  talking to Gordon earlier and he was saying, this isn't going to be short- term pain, this could be 10, 20 years, it's a long game the way that the  Chinese play.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, and the truth of it is, we have a long game already because  the Chinese have been doing this to us for so many years.  So now it's time  to go through this process.  And look, the most powerful message I heard  from the President one time was when he said to me, I don't want our  children and grandchildren on their knees begging in the future.  We have  to be willing to work through this.  </p><p>BELL:  Well, I think you saw that in the poll -- the Wall Street Journal  poll that came out that people aren't necessarily happy with how he's  dealing with trade but his overall rating is going up because I think that  the stock market and also, you know, manufacturers, soybean growers and the  like, the whole country thinks that this is a negotiating tactic and it's  going to end well, but the problem is when does it end?  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I think it's also really, really important point though to  say can you can be both be concerned and want to support the President at  the same time.  And I think that a lot of people have missed that because,  you think that if you support a President you support him blindly.  And I  don't think that's the truth.  I think most people -- for a lot of people  somewhere in the middle depending on the issue.  </p><p>SPICER:  Well, I think that people have been told for a long time that  policies going to change and they finally see the President fighting for  them willing and they're willing to give them a little bit of latitude to  see where this thing ends up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Listen, I have been from breathe one, very concerned about these  tariffs that have been slapped on starting with washing machines but then  particularly steel and aluminum tariffs and the retaliation that we've  gotten from some of our trading but most important trading partners and  allies.  But the messaging, I want to hit on this, because the messaging  from day one when Peter Navarro was on this program quizzing me.</p><p>When I wasn't on set about how much is a cost of six pack of beer going to  go up.  And the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial last week saying  Peter Navarro says the harm is a rounding error and their take was -- well,  he is out of touch because there are a number of -- there is a pipeline  builder down in Texas that wanted a steel -- a waiver from the steel --  wanted a steel tariff exemption in other company -- another pipeline  producer as well.</p><p>They didn't get them.  And it's going to cost -- it's going to hurt because  they're going to delay investment in -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SPICER:  -- construction industry as well in term of the cost of whether  it's a beam or a screw.  Things are starting to go up and that's costing  people money.  The question I think that we're just asking the Congressman  is how long and how long will tolerate.  They want the fight, they've seen  Chinese economic policies, adversely affect our economy, our workers too  long and they're willing to give the President I think some latitude for a  while.</p><p>But the question is going to be how long. </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, I say the same thing but I always tell them let's judge  this President.  You get a chance to a judge the President in a couple more  years in election.  So let's judge him then, let's not judge him today.   Let's let them go through negotiations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you guys, well, people go to the polls to reelect you or not  come November and on that note let's talk about tax cuts 2.0 which the  House is working on, revitalizing the economy, the second round, a big part  of the GOP's plan to try and retain control of the House.  Here is what  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise told Maria yesterday morning on \"SUNDAY  MORNING FUTURES.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  The plans to continue  focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth,  and then locking it in.  We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes,  we're going to make the tax cuts permanent.  That bill Chairman Brady, his  committee are already working on.  We just did a jobs 3.0 bill.</p><p>A bill to provide more regulatory relief and do some things that will help  create more jobs and rebuild the middle class.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is it enough for you as people head to the polls if the House  passed that?  And the Senate already showing resistance to it.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, I can tell you in Ohio, tax 1.0 is working.  Companies are  now reinvesting, I had a company went from 70 to 140 employees already.  I  have companies who are talking about expanding.  They're also giving  bonuses out to their employees, they're raising wages.  So as I travel,  Ohio people are very happy.  Now, if we can lock that in which is important  because the only reason it's not locked in its gimmicks in Washington.</p><p>I mean, I'm a business guy.  I always chuckle at some of these little  gimmicks we have.  We couldn't lock in it because of this rule or that  rule.  So let's lock it in, let's make sure people have certainty and  predictability.  I think that's going to be the second thing.  And also on  2.0, we're going to be talking about savings.  So I think that's another  issue.  These -- a lot of people back in Ohio are now getting more money in  their pockets.</p><p>We need to make sure they can save it and use it for their -- whether it's  education, whatever.  So those -- that's what 2.0 is going to be all about.   I think it's -- can be best explained that way when I travel the state.  </p><p>SPICER:  I think the other thing is -- I mean, look, elections are binary  choice and it's not just what Jim Renacci is for, it's what Sherrod Brown  isn't for.  And that's a thing -- it's a big contrast that Ohio voters are  going to face.  It's not just are you going to keep more, we're going talk  about economic expansion, it's what Sherrod Brown isn't going to do to help  Ohio businesses and families.  I mean, that's pretty much. </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, that's true too.  And I mean, it's polar total opposites  because I'm running against somebody who didn't support the tax cuts bill.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not one Democrat voted for the tax cut so -- but then they were  upset.  You heard this from Nancy Pelosi but then they're upset that the  individual tax cuts weren't permanent and they keep -- or they're now  worried about the debt and the deficit all of a sudden, so which is it?   And you don't get -- you don't get to say because she didn't vote.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Right.  And, again, here is the issue for me.  I came here as a  businessman and now I look at the numbers, 85 percent of our deficit or  things unrelated to the tax cut and the tax cut actually if it grows the  economy which it's doing and we get sustained growth over three percent,  then it will pay for itself and it will grow the economy and it will pay  the debt down. So that's the key.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speaking of which, we're going to get the first reading on  second quarter growth.   And the -- it's going to be likely north of four percent.  The Wall Street  Journal estimate is 4.2, the GDP now from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank  is 4-1/2, they're whisperer is coming out of White House, it's going to be  north 4-1/2.  But again, does that stick with people.  Does that -- the  number resonate or are they already feeling that?  </p><p>BELL:  I think they're feeling it.  We've discussed it earlier in the show,  the consumers, the everyday people, working class people are out there  feeling the benefits in their paychecks, they're feeling better but, you  know, we have the most jobs available out there with the lowest jobless  rate that we've seen in almost 20 years.  The consumers feeling good,  confidence remains high so -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you see that in this Wall Street Journal NBC News poll that  found half of registered voters approve of the President handling of the  economy.  His highest mark on that question in the survey.  That same poll  found that President's approval rating edged higher even during the week,  Lee Carter, when he came under criticism for his handling of that Helsinki  Summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The President's approval rating rose to 45 percent.  That is the highest of  his presidency.  </p><p>CARTER:  It is.  And there's two reasons why.  I think number one, we can't  forget the importance of the Supreme Court to voters out there.  I think  Republicans will support the President almost no matter what because that  is so, so, so important to them.  And the other thing is, I think Democrats  really blew it big in the way that they responded to Helsinki and the  President's comments.</p><p>Because well, a lot of people were rightfully upset by what the President  did say.  He later tried to correct himself.  I think that the hysteria  that happened over that actually made people more likely defend the  President that anything else.  So the Democrats really think and the media  really needs to learn how to balance their coverage and say, well, we might  be concerned, we don't have to get hysterical over it if they won't make  any moves here.</p><p>It's also important to know though that even though these are -- these are  pretty high rates, this isn't necessarily significant in that other  presidents have had higher approval ratings at the same point, but I think  it's telling.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Congressman, but we have -- potentially Vladimir  Putin coming to the United States for another summit right before people go  to the polls in November.  Are you concerned about that? </p><p>RENACCI:  Not at all.  I think this is -- again, the President has to be  able to negotiate even with some of the people that are enemies of us and I  think that's the key.  So we will continue to go and as we said, this  confidence is going to continue to build.  I want to go back whether you're  firefighter or police, your 401(k)s and your pensions are going up and  that's positive.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) thank you, Congressman Renacci.  Still to come, an  unexpected leadership shake-up at FiatChrysler.  The details are the  automaker's longtime CEO is stepping down due to health issues.  Plus,  Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We break  down those numbers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  I'm Nicole Petallides live on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  The Dow futures this morning only slightly to the downside, down  six of the Dow Jones Industrial average.  And it's earning season, the big,  big week here, 170 S &amp; 500 companies coming out with numbers.</p><p>We'll kick it off with two that have reported this morning including  Halliburton and Hasbro. So Halliburton is looking to downside to the tune  of about to 1.1 percent while Hasbro is jumping 10percent.  The Halliburton  in particular, it was in line earnings per share, that's why you're seeing  a little bit of selling, everybody is getting so used to be so far this  season.  The estimates were 20.5 percent growth year-over-year for  earnings.</p><p>And in fact, we've seen most of these companies beating, so we've seen over  21percent but Halliburton did have quarterly revenue on the rise, higher  oil prices and more rigs at work.  Hasbro as I noted up 10-1/2 percent  there, topping and soaring as it handily beat those analysts' estimates for  profit and sales by a wide margin.  </p><p>At then we'll watch for Alphabet, Google after the bell today.  That will  be key, not only will they watch for consistent revenue gains but also some  of those other areas, apps, pixel smartphones, licensing also cloud  computing stock just down a quarter of one percent right now.  So keep it  right here because coming up, former FBI Director James Comey is getting  political once again.</p><p>Why he is urging Democrats to not lose their minds and rush to the  socialist left.  It's all ahead.  Plus, spice up your office space.   Details on the new cubicle inspired by Superman that costs over $8,000.   That is all later this hour.  Keep it right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Let's kick off this new week with slightly lower  futures, five -- four-point loss on the Dow futures right now.  But again,  the direction this week will be decided by earnings.  Alphabet, the parent  of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter all set to report quarterly  results this week.  Alphabet kicks things off after the close today.  The  Google parent company reporting after the bell.</p><p>Joining is now beyond sport global ambassador, Fox News contributor, my  dear friend, John Layfield.  John, your expectation for earnings going into  this week?  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think we have another great earning  season.  The last earnings season that we had was the best earnings beat in  25 years since the early 1990s.  We're seeing so far a third of S&amp;P 500  companies reported, 87 percent have had earnings expectations that had an  upside on those earnings, the estimates that they've had.  So it's going to  be interesting to see what we're going to see these earnings.</p><p>Especially when you have automakers reporting this week.  We have G.M. and  Ford which I own both reporting.  They've already have commodity inflation  problems.  So interesting to see how whether hedge for these tariffs going  forward and how these tariffs are going to affect projections going  forward.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, some other companies to watch are these industrial  companies.  I think Whirlpool, Harley-Davidson or two of the names out with  earnings this week.  We will be listening for those even 3M listening for  the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs.  And any kind of supply chain  disruption these companies are experiencing.  </p><p>BELL:  Absolutely.  We're seeing these companies, 94 percent of the  industrial companies that have reported have beat on both the top and the  bottom line.  The stocks are reacting really well, the question, John, is I  don't know if you have a thought on this, it feels like the question is, is  -- are orders being pulled forward?  Is the second quarter coming in  significantly better than expected?</p><p>Because people are trying to get ahead of tariffs and that's what's causing  raised guidance for full year or are we just doing better than we thought?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's a great question, Lindsey.  And it's a little bit of  both.  We are seeing earnings pulled forward, people getting around these  tariffs.  So you're seeing lot of stuff shift early because of this, but  you are seeing better-than-expected.  We're going to have a -- look like a  four percent GDP.  That's going to be a little inflated because people are  getting these orders out there ahead of these tariffs.  </p><p>The earnings season this year, I mean, this is the dichotomy of this  administration.  We're going to have 20 percent earnings a gain this  quarter.  About 35 to 40 percent of that comes from these tax cuts.  So the  administration has done a great job in spurring this economy that is  already long in the tooth in this bull market to revitalization.  The  problem is all 100 percent.  Now black cloud is these tariffs. </p><p>And what can happen if the potential trade war happens.  It could negate  everything that happens with these tax cuts.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But so far, John, it looks like the markets are giving the White  House, giving administration some breathing room on how long do you think  that can last?  I mean to your point, we're going to get guidance this week  from some major industrial companies, the automakers about any potential  fallout?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think it starts until it starts significantly hurting, you  know, it's easy when you talk about a potential trade war.  We're actually  in a trade war right now no matter what level of that trade war we're in,  we're actually in one right now.  You look at Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh, Salt  Lake, they're all reducing headcount right now in their newspaper business  because of the tariffs that we have on Canadian paper.</p><p>So you're starting to see problems right now, you see soybeans, you see  livestock right now, you see a glut of that going on because we have two  problems.  We had a huge amount of livestock produced this year and we also  have these tariffs that are coming also.  We have a glut.  Until you start  seeing these -- Americans start being hurt which I think we're going to  start seeing, I think you give the President a pass on this, this is  negotiations.</p><p>But this is sticking and matched next to (INAUDIBLE) and say, hey, I'm  going to blow up everything if you don't agree.  It is a dangerous,  dangerous game we're playing right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, how do you structure portfolio around that?  Because again  you're not getting paid that much to own fixed income here.  How do you  allocate money?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think dividend stocks become to de facto bonds like they had  been for the past several years.  I know interest rates are rising but  that's still a play.  Look, you have problems in the E.U.  If Englands are  upset of the E.U., which it looks like they're probably going to do with  probably a hard Brexit, that takes out a huge amount of fees going to E.U.   The E.U. looks like it could break up especially we started losing smaller  parts like Italy and somebody else follows.</p><p>You look at the problems in China right now, the U.S. stock market is still  the place to be and I think dividend stocks are going to be the safe play  going forward because I don't think people know what's going to happen with  this market.  This market should be significantly higher.  This economy is  absolutely on fire.  The only black cloud right now is the trade tariffs  and that's why I will stay with dividend stocks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll say this ahead of the head of the European  Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker is going to be at the White House on  Wednesday, maybe you get some positive developments out of that meeting?   You never know.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  He doesn't have high expectations according to people around him  but you're right, we could have something, a big upside surprise come out  of that.  I wouldn't be surprised if the E.U. says, you know, we're just  going to drop the 10 percent tariffs on cars and then see what the  President does because it's really about those tariffs then the President  will drop it and this trade war could end at least with our friends here.</p><p>The problem we have with Europe right now is they're now negotiations deals  with our trading partners that are our neighbors in Canada and Mexico.   This could be long-term structural damage if we don't get in front of this  right now and try to work out something with Mr. Juncker when he visits  this week.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  That tariff that we have on light trucks that are  imported, it's a 25 percent tariff, it's called the chicken tax among  people I grew up with because it was retaliation to this fight we had with  Europe over poultry in 1964 I think.  So, you think tariffs can't hang  around?  That one has been around since before I was born.  Thank you,  John.  And before you were born too, I should point out.  John Layfield.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Correct.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Always great to see you, my friend.  Coming up.  Escalating  tensions with Iran.  The new warning from President Trump after Iran's  leader says any conflict with the country would lead to the mother of all  wars.  Plus, a surprise shake-up at FiatChrysler.  Details on the  unexpected changes after the automaker's long-time CEO steps down ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It  is Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  One big week  for earnings, one-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 reporting, this  week, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, all on deck.  </p><p>This afternoon's big reveal will be from Alphabet, the parent company of  Google.  Take a look at how the stock is premarket.  Let's take a look at  the Futures across the board, the Dow and S&amp;P did manage to eke out small  gains last week, and they're up to -- they are in the green right now.</p><p>The NASDAQ, 100, the Futures there are lower as the NASDAQ was, last week,  slipping.  In Europe, markets are headed lower this morning as well, losses  across the board.  The CAC Quarante in France, the biggest loser down half  of one percent.</p><p>The Asian markets finishing mixed, the Nikkei ending down more than one  percent, one and a third percent, to be exact, the KOSPI in South Korea  also losing almost nine-tenth of one percent.  </p><p>President Trump tweeting out to the president of Iran last night, with a  firm warning, saying not to threaten the U.S. or else, and former FBI  Director James Comey, cautioning the Dems on twitter.  He says, don't vote  for whatever socialist -- Democratic socialist, whatever they are calling  today.</p><p>FiatChrysler stock almost three percent in the red in premarket trading on  the sudden replacement of the company's well-known CEO, Sergio Marchionne,  over the weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUPERMAN:  This is a job for Superman.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And in celebration of Superman's 88th birthday, one company's  got a box for you.  Now, all is a Superman themed cubicle, modelled after  the same telephone booth that the Man of Steel used to get changed in, with  a few modern perks, red cape, not included.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, President Trump giving a stern warning to  Iran, escalating a war of words with the country's leader, Kristina  Partsinevelos is live at the White House with the very latest.  Good  morning, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   And you are right, the escalation has continued, the rhetoric between both  countries Iran and United States, why is this happening, why is the  President tweeting in all caps?  </p><p>This comes after the president of Iran gave a speech on Sunday to his  population, and he said, that if any conflict bn between the United States  and Iran, occurs, then it would be the mother of all wars.  </p><p>President Trump took to twitter yesterday, in all capitals, when in the  online world, essentially means yelling, he wrote, never, ever threaten  United States again, or you will suffer consequences the likes of when few  throughout history have ever suffered before.  We are no longer a country  that will stand for your demented words or violence and death.  Be  cautious.</p><p>And when I say the rhetoric has continued to escalate, you know that the  United States has pulled out of Iran nuclear deal in 20 -- or 2015 Iran  nuclear deal in May.  Just last month, the United States said that they  were going to impose sanctions against any exports leaving Iran.  </p><p>This comes at a time when the country in Iran is suffering.  The economy is  not doing so well and that had a huge effect on the price of oil.  Today,  we're seeing a trade just around $68.92.  But over the past two months,  you've seen it fluctuate quite a bit and climb higher because of the lack  of supply around  the globe, especially coming from Iran.</p><p>Iran has retaliated saying that they too will block any type of shipments  coming out of there.  But so far, it's just back and forth rhetoric between  the two countries.  And it's only Monday morning, 8:00 a.m. and we're  getting all this news.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kristina, thank you for delivering it to us, Kristina  Partsinevelos, at the White House for us.  Sean, I want to get your  reaction to the President's tweet, especially since it seems to be one of  the --you know, message control is the most impossible thing to do.  </p><p>They're in the White House, because again, that's the President, tweeting  out.</p><p>SPICER:  I mean, the beauty is everyone knows talks about transparency.  I  mean, you are hearing directly from him what he thinks, when he tweets like  this.  </p><p>And if I were President Rouhani, I would take caution in making some of  those outlandish statements, threatening United States, because I think  this president doesn't like to be looked at like that and he will take  swift indecisive action.  </p><p>So, Rouhani may forget that we can all hear what he says, when he does it  in the modern world, but that was a mistake on his part. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Iran was still firing, firing missiles after the Iran nuclear  deal was done with death to America, death to Israel.</p><p>SPICER:  And I don't think this President -- this President-- you know,  Kristina mentioned it, but he -- this -- the Iran nuclear deal is something  that is he is consistently talked about being a bad deal, and if Iran ups  the game, he is going to do something. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And now, Europe has to come to us to get -- basically  get waivers from sanctions that we are preparing to impose on Iran.  </p><p>The President tweeted again, this morning, on Russia, when you hear the  fake news talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all  that I gave up, remember, I gave up nothing, we merely talked about future  benefits for both countries.  Also, we got along very well, which is a good  thing, except for the corrupt media.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sean, your take on that?  Again, the fact that it was discussed  that the likes of Michael McFaul, the former ambassador to Russia, that  Putin says to our President, why I want to interview these Americans.  The  fact that that even came up was bothersome to many.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, but, again, I don't -- part of what we don't know is what  exactly was said, the context it was said, and what Trump did or did not  respond.  I think the White House has made it very clear that the idea that  Russia would interrogate any United States citizen, never mind the former  ambassador, is fairly laughable.</p><p>And I think it's good that they clarified these kinds of things because  it's not -- I mean, the idea that a former government official would be  interrogated by any country, never mind Russia in Putin, is something that  we should be very clear about what our nation's position is. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If Putin -- assuming that Putin does come to the United States  right before the midterm elections and there was a second summit on U.S.  soil, be sure that there will be people in that tete-a-tete.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I think the President is seeing the reaction that he saw  walking out of that summit.  I think they're going to come in to any kind  of future summit with their A game.</p><p>CARTER:  Do you think that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, you are saying that wasn't the President's A game?</p><p>SPICER:  No, I think that they -- after meeting with Kim, I think they  looked at the model and they were -- there was largely a lot of praise  coming from that, how the President had handled that meeting, how the  reaction had been in terms of him engaging with Kim, talking about  denuclearization in the peninsula.</p><p>And I think that this Helsinki summit seemed to follow a very similar  pattern.  I don't think that they fully appreciated the reaction that Putin  would get, versus Kim.</p><p>CARTER:  I also think the President didn't help himself with some of the  statements that he made, following, right?  Where he was almost -- seemed  like he was (INAUDIBLE) more with Russia than --</p><p>SPICER:  Sure.  And I think it's a good thing that they went out and  clarified.</p><p>CARTER:  Now, how do you think -- what do you think about his  clarification?  Do you think that was enough?  Do you think people buy it?</p><p>SPICER:  You know, so far, it seems like they do, I think it's important.   I mean, look, he has been -- it's good that he clarified it.  And, you  know, I -- talk -- there is an intensity to this White House of how they  cover it -- how they cover this president unlike ever before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The (INAUDIBLE) and the media.</p><p>SPICER:  The media.  And that's why I wrote a book that literally goes  through a lot of these big moments and how -- thank you, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm holding - I was going to ask you about this.</p><p>SPICER:  OK.  What I mean, I think that there is a level of intensity in  scrutiny that in past administrations, they haven't had to face.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  True.  But it's called the briefing politics, the press and the  President.  I would say, you put the words, the press, on the front cover  of a book, that doesn't really help sales, my friend.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I will -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People hate the --</p><p>SPICER:  But I think part of what people want to know is, what is it really  like inside?  And that's the thing.  You see one thing on television.  You  get to see us sitting here at the table.  What's going on behind-the- scenes?  </p><p>And part of the reason that I wrote the book is that the press gets to have  their say.  They get to put in paper, or put on television what they want  you to see, what they want you to read.  What I wanted to do is take  readers behind-the-scenes and say, this is what's actually happening when - - that you don't see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- is it safe to say that this is a President, this is a  man, the leader of the country who if you are trying to craft a message,  you can't control the message, because he is going to say what he wants to  say, and you are more crisis response or just a respond --</p><p>SPICER:  I was going to say -- I wouldn't say no, because -- I mean, right,  I think you are clearly in response, he is the leader.  </p><p>And that is a very different role than I normally played many -- most press  people where your job is to craft and execute a message and a plan.  This  president leads the way in every one of those fronts.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There hasn't been any lasting fallout for the President or even  the White House.  I would argue for anything that on Twitter.  And even --</p><p>SPICER:  No, in fact, I wouldn't.  But that's probably why one of the  reasons he won.  I mean, he has been -- and I write about all of these  instances were any other political candidate would have been left for dead.   I mean, I guarantee you, if a candidate for office went to Lee and said,  poll what I just did.  </p><p>It would come back and say, you're dead.  Get out of the race.  And what  this President, every time, not only picked himself up, but in most cases,  came up stronger.</p><p>CARTER:  And it's part of -- I mean, it is part of who he is, right?  I  think people wanted somebody who is going to go down, shape things up and  do things differently than it's ever been before.  And so the fact that he  does this and continues to do it, I think, just reinforces that message.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to Jim Comey, yes, Jim Comey, the midterm  elections, three months away, Former FBI Director, Comey, issuing a warning  to Democrats.  </p><p>He tweeted this, yesterday, Democrats, please, please don't lose your minds  and rush to the socialist left.  This president and his Republican Party  are counting on you to do exactly that.  America's great middle wants  sensible, balanced, ethical leadership.</p><p>But where is the sensible balanced ethical candidate who's running for the  Democrat?</p><p>SPICER:  Well, his tweet's a little too late.  I mean, that run to the  left, already happened.  So, he's a little late on his tweet.  I mean,  that's the problem.  They are now having a -- they're tripping over  themselves, to go further and further to the left.</p><p>They are not progressives.  I mean, they are now like Bernie Sanders, was a  socialist running for president and was -- at one point, viewed as the  extreme.  He's now become the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and you  have to go further and further to the left, to get traction.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, I just wonder, though, I can't -- I look at all of this  and I think I don't necessarily believe that it's a whole of the Democrats  that are going left.  I think that it's a socialists, the far left, it's  the only part of the party that has a message that resonates to people  because they are talking about things that matter most.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're lying to the American people.</p><p>CARTER:  Whether or not --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know that they're absolutely lying.  </p><p>CARTER:  They're saying something besides resist.</p><p>SPICER:  To your point, I mean, you can talk about all of these things at  some point.  They never tell you about the price tag.  They never talk  about the economic consequences that these policies would have on our  economy.  </p><p>Walking around and telling everyone that everything is going to be free, is  a great message.  But the reality is, it's unsustainable, and it is not  something that is a direction in our country that we have been against for  a long time.  We have been against socialism and against a lot of this  stuff.</p><p>And now, we're talking about -- in the other day, they talked about the  minimum income -- you know, were people will be given a -- like, that's  insane.  The idea we should be talking about is how do we create an economy  that allows people to have the opportunities that they need, how do we  provide a social safety net.</p><p>But the idea that we're talking about guaranteeing everybody all of this  free stuff, is unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, in your book, you don't believe, as the President  suggested that most media is the enemy of the state.</p><p>SPICER:  No.  I wrote about it.  I actually write that there are a lot of  good reporters, and that we need in a democracy a robust and active press  corps, that's essential to our democracy.  But what we need to do is know  where the line is.  Call out bad reporters and bad stories and also praise  good reports and good stories.</p><p>And it is not about being tough that reporters should be in pursuit of the  truth.  They should write tough, tough stories.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  But they should be called out when they are wrong. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And cut out the rehearsed hysteria, right, the rehearsed  sneering.  Coming up, legend in the auto industry, stepping down.  The  surprise leadership shake-up after FiatChrysler CEO resigned.  Plus,  earning season in full swing, Stuart Varney weighs in, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A busy week in the world of Wall Street.  No, America!  Tech --  big tech companies: Alphabet, that's parent of Google, Facebook, reporting  earnings this week.  Also, we get the first reading on how fast the economy  was growing during the second quarter.  Everybody is watching it,  especially, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  I love it when  you talk earnings and economic numbers because I know that that's --</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, you don't.  You don't.   You hate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I do.  Actually, I love it because --</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to earnings --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's not true.  Again, who held onto his Microsoft stock?   You.  What stock hit an all-time high on Friday?  Microsoft.  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  I had nothing to do with earnings per share.  I couldn't tell you.   Or, QE3 or anything else, and believe me, it didn't.  Look, I think this is  a pivotal week.  The stuff going on this week which would make an enormous  difference to your money.  As you said, Dagen, first of all, you got the  earnings from big tech, it's a big week for big tech.  Here they come,  we're going to find out how much money they've made and how much they  expect to make in the future.  That will have a significant impact on those  stocks, big tech stocks, which have been leading this market for at least a  couple of years.  Then, we've got the GDP numbers, that's Friday morning,  8:30 Eastern Time.  I know you will be covering it and so will we.  I'm  expecting around four percent growth per year, annualized growth, four  percent.  </p><p>Now, that would be a blockbuster news item because we've never achieved  that rate of growth in the last four -- I think it's been four years since  we had a four percent quarter.  And then, don't forget, Wednesday, we have  the Europeans coming over here, top-level delegation coming over to the  White House.  They're talking trade.  There's the possibility of a  breakthrough right there.  Either that or a breakdown, one of the two, and  that again makes this a very pivotal week.  So, I'm glad everybody is  tuning in, it's worthwhile.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What if we get -- and so much -- I've talked till I'm blue in  the face about these potential tariffs on automobile imports and how that  would hurt U.S. carmakers and any carmaker abroad or here at home, so many  of the foreign automakers have plants here, produce most of the cars that  they sell here, in fact.  But Stuart, what if we do get a breakthrough,  what if we do have, hey, we're just going to get rid of all of the auto  tariffs between Europe and the United States?  We're safe in the next three  years.  What if that happens, it would be incredible?</p><p>VARNEY:  Huge for the markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the summer rally has been held back by all those negative  trade headlines.  It's not being pushed down so much as held back I would  say.  But if you get a breakthrough Wednesday, and they come out with at  least a lessening of the tension, an agreement in some form or other to  just maybe get rid of some tariffs, that I think would be absolutely huge,  that would really set the stage for a big rally.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think about this every morning when I get up.  That is the  danger of always being negative and --</p><p>VARNEY:  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  The first thing you think of when  you wake up in the morning, is, oh, the Europeans are coming to a trade  deal.  I don't believe it, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, being positive and making sure that you don't look at  everything through a negative lens because again, then you miss all the  good stuff.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's the whole point about the Trump presidency, isn't it?   Think positive.  He's winning, the economy is expanding, we've got  prosperity coming at us.  You know, think positive, that's why the market  is up so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And even with some mean tweets, that's why his approval ratings  are up, too.  Stuart, great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY:  True.  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, he starts in 10 minutes every day, 9:00 a.m. to  noon.  Coming up, a phone booth worthy of Superman.  Details on the new  office cubicle that will cost you over $8,000, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The death toll rising in last night's mass shooting in Toronto.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Dagen, we just got an  update from police.  A second victim has died from the rampage, a gunman  shot 14 people including a young girl in Toronto.  The 29-year-old  suspect's body was later found at the scene, but it's not clear at this  point whether the man actually killed himself or he was shot by police.   All of this happened in the Toronto neighborhood known as Greektown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would say I heard at least 20 shots in intervals.   You know, clippings spent, reloading, clipping spent, reloading, clipping  spent, that's what I heard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, investigators are trying to find a motive.  Police say they  would not rule out, at this point, terrorism.</p><p>Well, tragedy in Maryland overnight after a firefighter died while battling  a massive seven alarm blaze.  The unidentified firefighter, a 13-year  veteran fell through the floor.  Three people who were inside the house  were able to get out, though, in time.  The cause of the fire under  investigation, but lightning could be the cause.</p><p>Well, some stunning news over the weekend at a change at the top for FiatChrysler.  Long-time CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced.  Marchionne  underwent shoulder surgery three weeks ago but in those three weeks, his  condition has somehow worsened.  We're looking for more details.  Now, Mike  Manley, who runs the Jeep, SUV, and Ram truck division is the new CEO.   While the stock is something to watch today, shares are actually lower in  the premarket, it's down more than three percent right now.  Again,  stunning news over the weekend for this company.</p><p>Well, a Superman solution for workers who want more privacy, for the first  time in 80 years, the Superman cubicle booth is available for purchase.  It  fits two people inside -- if that makes sense -- it comes with modern  necessities like USB outlets and an Ethernet connection, LED lights.   You're going to have to make more money than Clark Kent, though, it's  actually running about $8500 per booth.  And by the way, in the description  it doesn't mention to actually having a phone.  I don't think people use  those anymore, all right.</p><p>And then, finally, there is this, we've been watching this clip over and  over again this morning on the show.  It appears to show a grown man  stealing a foul ball from a child.  Well, the Chicago Cubs saw the  situation play out in real-time.  They ended up giving the young boy an  autographed baseball instead.  But it turns out the man that everybody is  criticizing had helped that boy get a foul ball earlier in the game.  You  can see him holding a game-used baseball next to his new autographed one,  obviously.  Yes.  So, maybe the guy in the clip isn't as mean as we all  think, and we're all beating up on him this morning.  So, I wanted to, you  know, give you some new details on this developing story in baseball.   Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Glad I didn't call him a lot of mean -- maybe.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, I think he's -- I think he's a little on a defensive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The child deserves all the foul balls.  How about that, though?</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, some final thoughts from our all-stars.  We'll be  right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Bell, Lee Carter, quick final thoughts.  Five seconds.</p><p>SPICER:  I'm glad to be here to kick off the briefing.  Thanks for having  me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, take it away, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm surprised at Sean Spicer.  I thought he got more to him than  that one.  He had at least five seconds to spare there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SPICER:  I yield it to you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, you're a good man. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

We send it right over to Dagen McDowell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning ladies, we'll  see you both coming up shortly.  Good morning everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell  in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 6:00  a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for second quarter reporting  season, one-third of the Dow Industrials and the S&amp;P500 set to post results  this week.  We'll look at the numbers and guidance and what they all say  about the state of the United States economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are showing this this morning, we have slight losses but, again,  even a tweak from the president could change all of that.  After the close  today we get earnings from Alphabet, the parent of Google.  Again, that  just kicks off a blockbuster week.</p><p>Those markets, those Futures after the major market gauges finish the day  on Friday, little change.  You had the Dow and S&amp;P were up for the week,  but the NASDAQ Composite for the week was slightly lower last week.</p><p>In Europe we have declines across the board to tell you about, the biggest  loser there being the CAC Quarante in France down about half of one  percent.  In Asia overnight some mixed action, the Nikkei in Japan the  worst performer of the lot down more than one percent.</p><p>A tragedy in Toronto, a deadly shooting rampage late last night, a gunman  killing at least one, injuring more than a dozen others.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard at least 20 shots in intervals, you know,  clipping, spent, reloading, clipping, spent.  I saw at least four people  shot her by the fountain.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a street where people walk every day, go to  the groceries, have dinner, have an ice cream, sit in a square, enjoy their  summer and it's absolutely devastating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have the latest on the investigation coming up.  President  Trump takes on Iran, the president issuing a sharp warning in a late night  tweet threatening severe consequences if Iran doesn't take a cautious tone  with the United States.</p><p>And unexpected change at the top for FiatChrysler, the automaker replacing  well-known CEO Sergio Marchionne after he stopped for complications from  recent surgery.  What the change means for the future of the company.</p><p>And out of this world vodka, Star Trek fans will be able to get a taste  space with alcohol inspired by the Starship Enterprise.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, CFRA Investment  Strategist Lindsey Bell.  PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle.  And Maslansky &amp;  Partners President Lee Carter.  We're going to tee up what is going to be  an incredible week.  One thing we'd left out in the open is we get second  quarter GDP, the first reading on how fast this economy is growing, that  comes out on Friday.</p><p>We're going to hear from all of these major technology companies and get a  sense of what the financial world looks like in the health of the U.S.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  It's going to be a big  week for sure.  And we're going to finally see what corporate health looks  like.  Tech sector's going to be very, very strong.  </p><p>We've got over 22 percent growth for the second quarter from these tech  companies, that is a six quarter in a row for over 21 percent earnings  growth.  You're looking at the S&amp;P500, earnings growth of 20.8 percent  based on S&amp;P capital IQ estimates right now.</p><p>So things are looking good so far, companies are beating on the bottom  line, the top line beat rate at 76 percent has come down over the last  week.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BELL:  We'd like to see that improve a little bit but the dollar's kind of  weighing there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, we're going to dig into more of that.  You teed it up nicely  Lindsey Bell, thank you so much.  And then the president's approval rating  going up, so we're going to talk about that as well, I can't wait for that.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Such a fascinating topic  because who would have thought --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p>CARTER:  -- based on everything else (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- you know what, the people who believe in his policies are  tuning out the noise.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.  And that's what we talked about, he got a floor and  it's not going to move.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  We're going to talk about that coming up in just a few  minutes.</p><p>But first our top story this hour, tech earnings on tap, Futures are  searching for a little bit of direction his morning, a start of huge week  for corporate earnings.  Dow Industrial Futures are down 15 points at the  moment.</p><p>Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, all set to report second quarter  results this week with Apple -- with Alphabet leading the way today.  The  parent of Google reporting after the bell.  Lindsey, can you dig into  these?  </p><p>These are the companies that have been driving the performance and I'm  going to look up a step that I have on my phone, but how critical will --  just these big name tech companies be?</p><p>BELL:  It's going to be huge and what's most -- going to be the most  important as is every quarter but especially this quarter, we saw what  happened with Netflix guidance.</p><p>Guidance is going to be key, I don't think there's going to be any dispute  that this has been a great quarter.  Like what you said on Friday, we're  going to get an amazing economic GDP number.  But I think that what people  want to watch is what's happening with the top line and is guidance  improving?</p><p>And we have actually seen surprisingly industrial companies raising  guidance for the remainder of the year which you would -- a sector that's  been impacted by trade.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  This trade in a way as I'm listening to  some of those earnings calls, I would have expected using the tariffs as a  bit of an excuse.  You know, corporate managers often look for something  out there, it's a bit of an excuse just to sort of temporary guidance --</p><p>BELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- and they're not using tariffs, which is quite surprising.   You're also not using the tight labor market as an excuse.  So that's been  sort of interesting.</p><p>BELL:  I know.  Which is a change in tone from what we've seen previously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But speaking of the industrial earnings, Honeywell's numbers out  on Friday were great .  That they had higher sales in profit margins  across, I think, all four of their -- it's divisions, that was out on  Friday.</p><p>But in terms of trade impact and the tariffs that have gone into effect on  steel and aluminum, the retaliation from major trading partners, Canada,  Mexico and even China, we're going to get earnings this week from TRIUM,  Harley-Davidson, and Whirlpool.</p><p>So, again, you're going to have to decide Mitch whether they're using maybe  the trade dispute as an excuse or if it's having a legitimate impact on  business here.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And we'll see -- we'll see -- if it's the guidance, you don't  know.  But if it's impacting second quarter earnings then it's not an  excuse, it's reality.  So we'll see then.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So industrial stocks actually are down two percent year-to-date  while the S&amp;P500 is up nearly five percent.  And there are some stocks that  are in, well, the toilet.</p><p>Caterpillar is down 14 -- 13 percent, 3M is down 14 percent year-to-date.   And also Alcoa had -- has had a major selloff in recent days.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  Alcoa you saw the tariffs impacting their business with  aluminum.  They bring a lot of it in from Canada, so they -- they're saying  every month they expect a 12 to 14 million dollar hit to the profitability  of the company. </p><p>This is definitely a huge -- the big question I think when you think about  the industrial company is, are they pulling this business forward ahead of  the tariffs going into effect?  And so that's why the second quarter is  significantly better than expected.  </p><p>The industrial sector has been in the toilet like you said.  The fourth  worth performing sector of all 11, but the stocks are reacting very, very  positively to this news.  On average, the companies that have reported so  far have moved up two and a half percentage points versus the S&amp;P500 up  1.6.  Last quarter, stocks weren't reacting to earnings at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's great news.  And I was just going to -- what I was  pulling up on my phone, it's not -- I'm not ignoring you.  I'm not -- I'm  not texting -- I'm not texting with my mother.</p><p>But if you look at just last week, they were -- of the major technology  stocks, there were only two that were lower out, Netflix was -- fell off a  cliff --</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it was down nine percent because of that miss, partially to  blame its own guidance.  And then Alphabet was down going into this  earnings report, half of one percent last week.  But, again, Microsoft is  out with earnings, number one Dow stock and is -- hit an all-time high on  Friday I believe.</p><p>BELL:  And that bodes well for Alphabet because they're in the cloud  business, to the third largest cloud provider.  We want to see tonight how  those numbers look.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The economy a big part of republican plans to retain control of  the House.  Here's what House Major Whip Steve Scalise told Maria on Sunday  Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  The plans to continue  focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth  and then locking it in.  We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes,  we're going to make the tax cuts permanent.</p><p>That bill, Chairman Brady and his committee are already working on.  We  just did a jobs 3.0 bill, a bill to provide more regulatory relief and do  some more things that will help create more jobs and rebuild the middle  class.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as a new Wall Street Journal NBC News Poll found that  half of registered voters approve of President Trump's handling on the  economy.  His highest mark on that question in the survey.</p><p>And also president's overall approval rating did inch up a little bit.   Lee, what do you make of that?</p><p>CARTER:  So I think it's really, really fascinating to say that the  president's job approval rating was the highest it's been after a lot of  people said they did not approve of his handling of the meeting with Putin,  that was over 68 percent of people, so they did not approve of that.</p><p>But the bottom line is this, when you look at Trump's handling of the  economy, 50 percent of Americans approve of it, 34 percent don't.  People  feel that it's in their pocketbooks, they're seeing the markets rise,  they're seeing their 401(k) balances go up, they're feeling better more  optimistic, they're seeing jobs, more opportunities for themselves.</p><p>So, even when these things happen, even when, you know, the president makes  comments that makes everybody uncomfortable after he did -- as he did in  Helsinki.  The more hysterical people get, the more upset, the more that  they go after him, the more his face is short up, and the more people go,  \"You know what though, I'm still feeling better economically.\"</p><p>And that is why people go to the polls.  Russia is down there, I think  number 16 as far as issues that are most important to the American people  right now.  And so I think what the democrats need to do, if they want to  win this in November is they've got to come up with a message that is going  to counter anything that the president's doing in the economy.</p><p>And I think that's why we're seeing a rise in the socialist movement  because people are saying, \"Here are some in it.  If we're going to do this  it's going to make life better for you.  We're going to give you jobs,  we're going to give you foreign income, we're going to get healthcare for  all.\"</p><p>That's the message that gets people excited whether we want to -- and we  can have a debate on that.  But just going after the president and saying  that he's the worst thing that's ever happen and really getting hysterical  about it, that's not going to work for the democrats.  And I think if  that's the way that they're going to approach November, they're going to  have big problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, it comes down to in terms of this democratic  socialist message or whatever you want to call them these days, it comes  down to how you're going to pay for it.  And that's one thing that does hit  people in the pocketbook.</p><p>That's by the president's tweets about the Federal Reserve last week, it  did resonate with people.  Like it or not, I mean we kind of worry about  the president interfering in what is so-called independent Federal Reserve  but, again, people -- that -- people understand that.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well what's interesting and sort of to Lee's point, I think at  the end of the day, the average voter isn't a creature of the new cycle  like the four of us are, OK?  They're not really paying attention to a lot  of it and they really focus on making ends meet, providing for their  family, and if they feel better about that, I think it's going to show up  in the polls.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I did want to point out Lee that -- because we were talking  about it, the president's overall approval rating did end higher in that  poll.  It ends up to 45 percent.  And, again, buoyed by strong support  within his base, within the republican base.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.  See, that I think as much as there where things  that went wrong in Helsinki, there's also things a lot of optimism on the  republicans by Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court appointment.  I think people  are feeling strong support there and I think that is really helping the  president right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's what the republicans and particularly the Senate,  they're showing resistance to this Tax cuts 2.0 that the House is pushing.   Ultimately it falls on the Senate to make sure that Kavanaugh is approved  and voted on to the Supreme Court --</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- by the midterm elections.  And then what -- we have another  Putin visit potentially in the fall, so we'll see how that goes.</p><p>CARTER:  Rise on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We'll see how that goes just in time for the midterm.   Coming up, tragedy in Toronto, at least one person dead, more than a dozen  hurt after a mass shooting.  We have the latest as police investigate the  motive behind the brazen attack.</p><p>And shifting gears at FiatChrysler, Mike Manley taking over the CEO job as  Sergio Marchionne suffers a sudden health crisis, the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A mass shooting in Toronto, Cheryl Casone has the details.   Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well Dagen, good morning.  A  frightening scene after a gunman killed at least one person and injured at  least 13 others including a young girl.</p><p>During the rampage, the suspect later killed at that scene, it happened at  the Toronto neighborhood known as Greek Town.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARK SAUNDERS, TORONTO POLICE CHIEF:  Shortly after 10:00p.m. what happened  was the police responded to a 911 call for sounds of gunshots.  A young  girl is in critical state right now and the other 13 are in the hospital  and being treated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well investigators are trying to find a motive and police say they  would not rule out terrorism.</p><p>Well, stunning news, and a change at the top for FiatChrysler breaking  over the weekend, its longtime CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced.   Marchionne underwent shoulder surgery about three weeks ago but his  condition has since worsened according to the company.  </p><p>Now Mike Manley who runs the Jeep SUV and RAM truck division is the new  CEO.  Shares of FiatChrysler we should say are lower on this news.   Sergio, of course, as stunning force for the company, down three percent in  the premarket as you can see.</p><p>And then there was a new record set at the box office this weekend, eight  of the top ten movies were sequels.  And the top spot went to a surprise  upset.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They killed my friend.  (INAUDIBLE) in everyone of them  and the only disappointment is that I only get to do it once.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well Sony's \"The Equalizer 2\" starring Denzel Washington brought  in $35.8 million.  Equalizer narrowly beat another sequel, Universal's  \"Mama Mia Here We Go Again\" which made $34.4 million which beat the  original film by the way by about seven million bucks, pretty good.</p><p>Taking third, Sony's \"Hotel Transylvania III\" with $23.3 million.  Rounding  up top five, \"Ant Man and the Wasp\" and \"Incredibles 2\" Dagen.  Feel free  to have \"Mama Mia\" stuck in your head for the rest of the morning as I do  right at this moment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why it beat the original?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One word, Cher.</p><p>CASONE:  Cher.  Got you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just despite her craziness on Twitter, I can't even -- she  speaks a language of her own on Twitter.  But --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  This is a business program, so I'd like to know how much ABBA  gets every time there's a -- one of those movies, \"Mama Mia\" movies.</p><p>BELL:  Oh yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I think we'll -- we will put the burden on you Mitch  Roscelle.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  I'm going to start Googling -- I'm a -- I ask a question,  research the results.  All right. </p><p>CARTER:  And theory.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>BELL:  I saw the show on Broadway and it was absolutely phenomenal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So this is the -- this is the sequel.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So if Meryl Streep is still in -- this is the sequel to the  original film.  So, again, ABBA who would have thought?</p><p>Coming up, war of words with Iran, President Trump ramping up the tough  talk as sanctions on the country are reinstated next week and after he  dumped the Obama Era nuclear deal.  The stern threat, next.</p><p>And now you can have vodka from the final frontier, find out how you can  throwback a cocktail made with just a hint of the extra-terrestrial. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Escalating tensions with Iran, President Trump calling out  Iran's president after the leader said U.S. policies toward the country  could lead to the \"mother of all wars\" with Iran.  </p><p>In a tweet last night the president wrote, \"To Iranian President Rouhani,  never ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences  the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before.  We  are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence  and death, be cautious.\"  All caps.</p><p>This coming as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling out Iran's  religious leaders and address plans to re-impose economic sanctions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Ayatollahs are in on the act  too.  Judging by their best, well they seem more concerned with riches than  religion.  These hypocritical (INAUDIBLE) all kinds of crooked schemes to  become some of the wealthiest men on earth while their people suffer.</p><p>Right now the United States is undertaking a diplomatic and financial  pressure campaign to cut off the funds that the regime uses to enrich  itself and support death and destruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us the Editorial Director for the Washington Examiner,  Hugo Gurdon.  Hugo, your take on this?</p><p>HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  You know, President  Trump is reminding the Iranians that things don't go well when those  countries threaten the United States.</p><p>Your viewers probably remember that Saddam Hussein promised the mother of  all battles against the United States but he was crying uncle after three  weeks o the first Gulf War and he was dead after the second.  </p><p>What you're really hearing is the fact that the Iranians are feeling the  strain of the end of the deal that President Obama put in place.  The  United States, Israel, and some Arab countries are really putting pressure  on Iran to undermine it throughout the region and the peeps have started to  squeak.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think that we get a new deal because, again, we're -- new  sanctions will go into place, I think it starts next month.  </p><p>There's the issue about Europe, but partly few American companies really  stepped up to begin doing business in a significant way in Iran after that  nuclear deal from President Obama because it was not ratified as a treaty  and they assumed that the next president because it could be a republican  would pull out of it and sure enough, that's what happened.</p><p>GURDON:  Right.  Well American companies did not but the European countries  certainly have.  But, you know, the European countries going to have to  make the calculation, do they want to do business with the Iranian economy  or do they want to do business with the much, much bigger American economy?   It's hardly a choice at all.</p><p>They are going to have to adjust, they're going to have to start scaling  back and ending business and, of course, there are the oil -- there's the  question of oil exports.  It's that that could mean as much as $1 trillion  of losses, loss revenue to the Iranians over the course of the next 10  years.  </p><p>This is really, really serious problems for the Iranians that the Mullahs  have losing support from the country, the country is fed up with their  theocracy.  And as I say, you know, the allies, the United States, Israel,  and countries like Saudi Arabia are increasing pressure to try and  undermine the Iranian Regime.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Hugo, Mitch Roschelle.  And Dagen made reference to it in terms  of whether or not there's a new deal.  If there was some sort of new deal,  what would the foundation of that deal be?  Obviously be much different  than the deal in the past but is there sort of a rubric or a framework for  what a deal would look like?</p><p>GURDON:  It seems to me that -- I mean, this obviously as to some extent a  speculation at this point.  It doesn't seem to me that there's a deal that  can be done with the Iranians, you know, in the way that the -- that Obama  Administration did.</p><p>I mean, the last thing that this administration wants to do is to cement  the Iranian Regime in place.  I don't know that there's any deal that could  be done which was acceptable to this country and acceptable to Iran.  I  mean, that's something we're going to have to read about and see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was going to -- just to clarify Hugo, I said the first  sanctions are set to be -- take place next month, it's actually on August  the 4th.  So it's coming up shortly, followed by the measures that will  target Iranian oil, that begins to happen on November 4th.</p><p>That's why it's so critical that the United States has a growing oil supply  that we're increasingly energy independent or heading toward that.</p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're the biggest exporter in the world of refine petroleum  product and that --</p><p>GURDON:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- gives us an incredible amount of leverage over someone like  Russia and its partner in crime Iran.</p><p>GURDON:  Exactly.  So, the United States became the biggest energy  producer.  I think more than a year ago it's now the biggest oil producer  as well, it's overtaking Saudi Arabia.</p><p>This gives it leverage all over the world.  For example, President Trump in  Europe just a week or so ago pressing Germany on the gas pipeline from  Russia, putting pressure on them to buy energy from the United States.  </p><p>The United States has a much greater ability than it has ever had to  control the price of oil and that's the way it can really squeeze the  Iranians.</p><p>BELL:  But then there was also the report that we were going to give some  of our allies in Europe a pass on purchasing oil from Iran, is that still  on the table because I've heard stories both ways?</p><p>GURDON:  Yes.  You know, I've hears stories both ways too.  You know,  there's also -- it's also being said that, \"No, the November deadline is a  deadline and the Europeans are going to have to fall into line.\"</p><p>And the closer we get to that deadline the more likely it is that the  Europeans are going to have to scramble to get themselves in position.   They don't want to lose business, they don't want to any sanctions that  prevent their access to the American market.  The Iranian market is much,  much smaller.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And all of this surely will be discussed with Jean-Claude  Juncker, the President of the European Commission who's visiting the White  House on Wednesday of this week because in recent months the -- Europe has  been talking about exploring activating accounts for the Iranian Central  Bank to basically keep this agreement alive.  So there's much to discuss in  terms of Iran in Europe.</p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hugo, thank you for being here.  It's great to see you as  always.</p><p>GURDON:  Thanks so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hugo Gurdon.  Coming up, pizza fight, the board of Papa John's  is going to extremes to prevent the company's founder from gaining  controlling interest after stepping down for using a racial epitaph.  We've  got the details on the so-called poison pill.</p><p>And turning nature's wrath into a tourist destination, Hawaii's plan to  help boost tourism by using the same lava that's damaging the industry.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Earning season  in full swing, one-third of the Dow and S&amp;P 500 later to post results, this  week.</p><p>Checking market action this morning, we have Futures are slightly lower  across the board, but much news is coming down the pipeline to move those  markets, 19-point loss on Dow Futures, right now.  On Friday, all three  major market gauges finished the day, little change.  It was still an up  week for the Dow and S&amp;P.</p><p>In Europe, we have declines across the board, in England, France and  Germany, stocks selling off in just a bit.

It is an alcohol substitute, now being  served aboard star ships.  It simulates the appearance, taste and smell of  alcohol, but the intoxicating effects can be easily dismissed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Details of new liquor that contains vodka from space and also an  award to the producer who located that clip from Star Trek generation.  But  to our top story this half hour, technology in focus, among the big names  reporting earnings today, Google's parent company, Alphabet, less than a  week after the company was hit with a record five billion-dollar fine by  the E.U.</p><p>Our next guest is, there's opportunity here, joining me now is Alfred  Eskandar, CEO of Salt Financial, Alfred, good to see you.</p><p>ALFRED ESKANDAR, CEO, SALT FINANCIAL:  Good morning, good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  What are you expecting from Alphabet today?</p><p>ESKANDAR:  We're pretty excited about Google's earnings today.  And we  think</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, just call (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ESKANDAR:  We think it has shown a lot more life lately.  It has gone from  what we viewed as a very calm stock only rising about 1.1 percent more than  the S&amp;P for the first few months to now, actually showing a whole lot more  sensitivity and what we really look for are stocks and sectors that are  sensitive to the overall market because we think that's where investors can  get an edge.  </p><p>BELL:  Well, volatility, really, when we enter this year, it's just been a  theme, it's been returned to the market and I think a lot of individual  investors have had a hard time dealing with that. </p><p>But the good news about that is it resulted in a decoupling of individual  securities from the actual overall market, how do you take advantage of  that and is tech the biggest place that you can take advantage of it?</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Well, tech has really been the big story all year.  In fact, if  you look at its performance, it's up around 50 percent, year to date,  versus, what, five percent for the S&amp;P, so -- but if you're going to have a  broader market rally, other sectors need to participate as well.</p><p>Volatility as you mentioned, has spiked up this year.  Certainly, we all  remember February.  But if you look at last year, we all kind of fell  asleep.  Volatility was incredibly low.  The market was tremendously  resilient and just showed no sign of slowing down or going down.</p><p>This year, volatility has returned a little bit more to normal, I believe  (INAUDIBLE) around 12, 13 right now.  Normally, it's actually around 17.   So, we are still somewhat calm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where do you think is the greatest risk in terms of even if you  just want to look at industries that are overpriced right for volatility?   I was just looking at how these big tech stocks perform month to date, and  Alphabet going into this earnings report is still up six percent.</p><p>It's not up as much say, a Facebook, an Amazon or even a Microsoft,  Microsoft is up closer to eight percent, but it's still got a really nice  fat gain on in for the month.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Well, you know, it's interesting that you mention Facebook,  that's also going to report later on, I believe it's on Wednesday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Amazon, later on the week.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  And Amazon.  But just focusing on Facebook for a second, the  thing that's important for investors, particularly retail, you know,  there's only three ways to make money in the market, your selection, your  timing and your overall allocation.</p><p>And Facebook has been a relatively calm stock, believe it or not, I mean,  it had a little bit of an issue in February -- in March, I believe, it  brushed it off, hit new highs.  But it's not moving as much with the  market.</p><p>And that's what we look for in terms of giving an edge back to investors to  basically participate more in the up rally.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Alfred, if you want to, sort of, look beyond the big tech names  who've clearly driving the S&amp;P, where are the places in the S&amp;P 500, what  sectors would you, sort of, rotate to if you are just worried about how  frothy some of those names have gotten.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  So, we love financials, industrials, as you guys mentioned  earlier, and technology.  Those are the three biggest sectors right now in  our fund.  We see these sectors again way more sensitive to the overall  market than some of the others.</p><p>And we think that's where you want to be exposed for this quarter.   Ironically, Energy was the big surprise, second quarter.  I don't think  anyone really called it out.  But it actually outpaced technology, it was a  14 percent surprise gainer versus five percent, I believe, for technology  at the same time.</p><p>So, thinking about sectors -- you know, again, industrials, financials and  technologies, where you want to be right now.</p><p>BELL:  So, you think Energy's over though, because this is going a good  quarter, probably for Energy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  11 billion-barrels a day --</p><p>BELL:  Prices up 41 percent in the second quarter, so the numbers should be  really good.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  True, but then we saw some pressure on crude and we saw that the  Energy trade slip away.  If we are going to get into a bounce and if we are  going to have a little bit more momentum in the second half of the year, we  don't see Energy right now as the place to be.</p><p>The industrials, financials and technology sectors right now, are  demonstrating to us the highest true beta scores.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mentioned industrials.  But industrials would be and are the  most vulnerable to this trade fight that we have gotten into, even our  major trading partners with the steel and aluminum tariff, initially, even  the washing machine tariffs early in the year, that kicked in in January.</p><p>Now, we're in this fight.  And so, there is the greatest downside risk in  industrials.  I pointed out Caterpillar in 3M, are down 13 and 14 percent,  respectively, year to date.  And we've got 3M Harley Davidson whirlpool  come out with earnings later this week.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  You know, industrials, obviously, much more sensitive to trade  tariffs and some of the other sectors.  When we look at tariffs at 32  billion, you know, it's not a big piece of the overall economy.  I think  last week with the Trump administration talking about potentially 500  billion.  That's a different -- that's a different ball game.</p><p>So it will be challenged.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did the market react to that at all, because again, it was kind  of a so-so.  </p><p>ESKANDAR:  It flinched.  It flinched a little bit and, you know, it didn't  have a massive move.  And I think, you know, for investors to take some  comfort, the market has become incredibly efficient and resilient.  </p><p>And by that, I mean -- you know, in my 20 plus years of being in this  business, I have seen the market become better and better and better in  distilling information, not getting, you know, actually being able to  differentiate between sensationalism and substance and.  I think we is that  last week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, what about the sensationalism and or substance of the  President tweeting about the Federal Reserve and the U.S. dollar and other  currencies because, again, Secretary Mnuchin came out and said, well, the  President believes in an independent Federal Reserve.</p><p>But in the past, you know, when you have presidential pressure on the  central bank, it down the road has created some serious problems for the  country and I'm talking about runaway inflation in the 70s.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Well, Chairman Powell, I think, did a great job with his  testimony last week.  And I think what he demonstrated was a clarity in how  he sees things progressing.  It's very hard to not be optimistic about the  second half of the year, given how tremendous the job market looks right  now.</p><p>And if anything, I think he's doing the President a favor, you know, by  controlling inflation, you get to continue the growth that we're enjoying  right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, maybe the President is -- we will see if the President is  hearing that message because the Wall Street Journal reported that he  picked J Powell over Kevin Marsh and John Taylor because he was told that J  Powell would be more malleable.</p><p>So, again, there is some expectation.  There could be some executive branch  control over the fed, but we will see what happens.  Good to see you,  Alfred.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Alfred Eskandar, thank you.  And President Trump is tweeting  this morning.  So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and  fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the  DNC, that was knowingly and falsely submitted to FISA and which was  responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller  witch hunt.  </p><p>We will dig into more of that, but, again, those FISA documents released,  they're still redacted but released over the weekend and the President has  been busy tweeting on that note.  And we will discuss it coming up.</p><p>We will also talk about oil, all eyes watching the cost of crude with  global trade worries, the President's threats toward Iran and then we have  x on Mobile and Chevron reporting earnings, later this week.  Busy week for  big oil, we break down on what you need to know.</p><p>Plus, giving moonshine a whole new meaning, there's a new Star Trek vodka  that promises to be out-of-this-world.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Energy in focus, oil prices searching for direction after coming  of their third weekly decline in a row.  Joining us now, the Schork Report  Publisher, Stephen Schork, Stephen, with the President tweeting about Iran,  uses some tough language on that regime, what are you looking at in terms  of driving oil prices today and this week?</p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Well, I tell you what, Dagen,  there's nothing like waking up as an oil trader at 4:00 o'clock in the  morning and seeing a tweet storm between Trump and the Muellers, that  certainly going to put a hop in your step right there.  </p><p>That said, I can't imagine what the Iranians are thinking of.  It's as if  they are daring Trump to release barrels from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve.  And I have been talking about this now for the past two months,  actually, since Trump re-enacted the sanctions against Iran.  You got two  big factors that the bulls are counting on right now, Dagen.  </p><p>First and foremost, we had an unplanned outage bitchumen, mining operation  out in Calgary, Canada.  So, imports in Canada, this summer, peak driving  season have just fallen to the floor.  So, a significant amount of barrels,  in fact, over recent five-week stretch, we saw 31 million-barrel decline in  U.S. crude oil stocks.  That's the largest five-week decline we've ever  seen.</p><p>We also have a situation Heating Oil here in New York Harbor which is where  you may take delivery on a NYMEX diesel contract, where we're looking at  supplies given those nor'easters that we saw in March and the yields that  we were seeing from refineries, heating off stocks at the lowest points  since 2000.  So Trump outside of his ego has two very real fundamental  economic justifications for release of the SPR, so the Iranians ought to  trend lightly in this case.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we've got about 650 million barrels in the SPR right now.   When do you roughly, I think it's a little bit more than that.  Stephen,  when do you -- </p><p>SCHORK:  Yes, something like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when do you expect this would happen?  And again, you also  have trade tensions with Canada which is critical and even Mexico, but  Canada which is a critical supplier of oil into the United States.  So,  when do you think this SPR release happens?</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, it's a possibility right there and it's certainly on our  radar.  At this point of the season, and I think your prior guest said that  he's not into energy right now, it's a good thought because right now  demand has peaked right now for crude oil.  We're at the peak crude oil  demand season.  We're at the apogee of the market right now.  And in the  weeks, months ahead, crude oil demand will begin to fall off as we  transition out of the summer.</p><p>And when we look at supply productions at a record all-time, 11 million  barrels a day.  We're also looking at gasoline stocks.  Unlike diesel  stocks, gasoline stocks are one of the highest levels for the month of July  we've ever seen.  So, right now, the demand is falling.  So I think the big  caveat out there, Dagen, is the situation with geopolitics.  Watch your  Twitter accounts and your Twitter feeds, because from a fundamental  standpoint, if we are going to see continued pullback in crude oil prices,  we're at the point, like I said, demand has peak.  It's going to start  falling in the weeks ahead for both crude oil and gasoline.  We're going  into the fall shoulder months, so we're looking at the falling demand,  rising production.</p><p>So the coast is clear for lower prices.  We just have to wait and see and  the one caveat out there, as I said, is the diesel situation in New York  Harbor and, of course, the geopolitical tensions with our friends over in  Tehran.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I will point out in terms of you talking about gasoline  stocks high, demand peaking, the national average for gasoline has been  falling.  It's at $2.84 right now.  That is the current average.  That is  higher than it was a year ago, but that is lower than it was a month ago,  lower than it was a week ago as well.  Lindsey.</p><p>SCHORK:  Absolutely.  I guess what happens -- yes, sorry, I'm sorry.</p><p>BELL:  I was just going say we saw Halliburton numbers came out just now  and they missed pretty significantly.  We saw -- I think it's 41 cents  versus 58 cents expected on the bottom line.  We saw Schlumberger last  week.  It was a pretty decent report.  What are you expecting from the  energy sector as a whole?  I know these are service companies, but what are  you expecting this earning season?</p><p>SCHORK:  Yes.  No, I expect from both an upstream and a downstream.  I'm  expecting another solid quarter coming out of the industry.  We're looking  an industry a year ago where they were hoping for $50 barrel oil to be  sustainable.  A year later we've got 65, 70, $75 oil where the market is  holding.  So, we are significantly higher from an oil perspective.  So  certainly from -- and from the demand perspective.  So all these people who  want to complain, like they think gasoline prices are too high.  Well, if  they're too high, why is demand for gasoline at an all-time high?  So,  obviously gasoline prices are not too high.  It's because the economy is  much stronger.  And the stronger economy leads commodity prices.  Commodity  prices are following the economy and therefore I would expect the earnings  from this industry to follow in accord.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Same story can be said about interest rates too, Stephen, good  to see you, my friend.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.</p><p>SCHORK:  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stephen Schork.</p><p>Coming up, turning the erupting Hawaii volcano into an explosion of cash.   Next, Hawaii's plan to help boost tourism by using the same lava that's  damaging the industry.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Papa John's taking action against its former chairman.  Cheryl  Casone has the details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  The drama continues for Papa John's.  Their board has voted to  adopt a poison pill aimed to preventing John Schnatter from getting a  controlling stake in the company that he founded with just one pizza oven.   That poison pill defense can be used to prevent a hostile takeover.   Schnatter who owns 29 percent stake in Papa John's resigned as chairman  earlier this month after using a racial slur during a conference call.  He  wasn't pressured to resign.  He did so, but things may be changing now.   Shares of Papa John's down eight percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, this is fascinating.  It's images of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, stun  the world.  Once small Hawaii town is hoping it can profit off of lava  tourism.  Big Island businesses are asking for a lava viewing site  somewhere on the island, but authorities haven't found a safe way to do  this.  Pressures mounting from local merchants, tour guides, and others who  have seen the tourism industry completely drop off on the island since  Kilauea began erupting back in May.  It is basically decimating their small  businesses and that small town is right near the volcano.  It's the entry  gate to the volcano in that park.</p><p>And then here is this.  One company boldly going where no man has gone  before and making a Star Trek-inspired space vodka.  It's going to be named  Ten-Forward vodka after the spaceship bar that is featured in Star Trek:  The Next Generation, the T.V. show.  The company says it's going to send a  small batch of vodka into atmosphere using a high altitude balloon to  ensure, quote, \"That every portion of every bottle will contain vodka  officially from space.\"  It will then be blended and bottled here on earth.   The vodka available for preorder for $29.99.  And, yes, Dagen, best Star  Trek clip ever was featured in your reset back at 6:30 this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was very impressed by that.  So a shout-out, apparently it's  going to go into the mesosphere.  You know where the mesosphere is?</p><p>BELL:  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The region of our atmosphere above the stratosphere and below  the thermosphere.  Between about 30 and 50 miles in altitude.  I know how  to use Google very well.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I know nautical terms, not space terms.  I can't -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Vodka is vodka, though, isn't it?  I wonder if they're paying  loyalties to the estate of Gene Roddenberry, just asking.  I don't think  it's -- the word start -- yes, USS Enterprise.  I'm sure of that.</p><p>CARTER:  It must be.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Lee, this is about branding.</p><p>CARTER:  Clearly that's branding.  I mean, this is a total gimmick,  obviously.  But you know what?  We're talking about it and would we be  talking about a vodka launch otherwise?  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would argue that Star Trek fans are even more loyal and  serious about their devotion than Star Wars fans.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh, there's no doubt.  There is no doubt.  And people feel  strongly about both.  You feel one way or the other.  But there's no doubt  that Trekkies are more active in their support.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do not insult Star Trek.</p><p>CARTER:  No way.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  More importantly, we don't have vodka right now on the set.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Just to be clear. Just water.  Just water.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks, Mitch.  You want me to tell the story about when you  were coming in this morning?  I was like, Mitch, what's on your mind?  And  you're like, I'm still asleep.  He's waking up.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I'm waking up now.  I'm awake.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The alarming number of millennials tapping into their 401(k)  plans to buy their first home.

President Trump will host a White House event showcasing American products  from all 50 states today.  The display follows escalating trade tensions  with Europe, Mexico, Canada and China -- a battle that has American  manufacturers wrestling with the fallout from Trump's tariffs.</p><p>Joining me now -- Gordon Chang, author of \"The Coming Collapse of China\".   Gordon -- this even follows President Trump's threats to impose tariffs on  all $500 billion worth of Chinese imports into this country every year.   The Commerce Department had a hearing last week about imposing tariffs on  auto imports.  That still remains to be seen.</p><p>But how much retaliation can we expect from China?  How dangerous is this  to the United States economy, do you think?  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\":  Well, the Chinese  certainly will retaliate -- Dagen.  But, you know, they really -- first of  all, they've run out of bullets.  So we only import -- or export to them  about $130 billion or something, and we take from them $505.5 billion last  year.  It's going to be more this year because we've got a robust economy.</p><p>You know, a lot of people say well, you know, the Chinese can retaliate  against U.S. companies in China, but Chinese officials don't want that to  happen because they're worried about the effect on the Europeans and others  who are investing in China.  And they think that that could really  boomerang on China and hurt Beijing much more than it hurts us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was -- he amplified President  Trump's trade threats in Argentina over the weekend at that G-20 meeting of  finance ministers.  The Secretary said this, quote, \"That he wouldn't  minimize the chance of the U.S. imposing tariffs on all -- its half a  trillion dollars with Chinese goods that we import into the United States,  but he still promises a light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>So listen to this, and I want to get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  President Trump is determined to have free and fair and more  balanced trade, and we just want to make sure American companies and  American workers are treated fairly.  And, yes, I do see a light at the end  of the tunnel.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How do you think this plays out?  Do you think that it doesn't  get to the point where we do slap tariffs on all imports coming in from  China?  </p><p>CHANG:  You know, that's a real possibility.  You know, we've got remember  that this is for the theft of U.S. intellectual property and its forced  taking.  These are imposed under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 after  that investigation into China's thievery.</p><p>So yes, we call this a trade war, but really this is about a remedy for  thievery.  It has trade implications, of course, but we've got to do this,  Dagen -- because the Chinese take hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S.  IP a year.  This is just unsustainable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well then, why didn't we take the tack that was pushed by Peter  Navarro in terms of cracking down on Chinese companies buying entities here  in the United States and then the technology exports into China?  Instead,  we kind of took a little bit of a lighter touch with the increased CFIUS  restrictions or committee on foreign investment in the U.S.</p><p>That was more what Secretary Mnuchin wanted, that's what Congress is moving  to do.  They actually came out of conference last week with how that would  be applied.  So they basically strengthened CFIUS.  So why didn't we do  more?  Why didn't we take a harder approach on that note then?  </p><p>CHANG:  Because we're Americans and we are so oblivious and have been for a  very long time.  You know, you started to see a change in Washington.  It  started in the last year of the Obama administration when the President  used CFIUS to block a Chinese deal.  And then President Trump has blocked  two or three acquisitions under CFIUS.</p><p>So this is going to be something we're going to see much, much more of.   And you know, yes, people don't like tariffs, but now we're starting to  think about the alternatives.  And of course it's investment bans but also  it could end up sort of being like an import ban.  If we're starting to  look at goods that have been benefiting from China's IP thievery -- there's  all sorts of things that the administration can start to look at.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But does this administration need to start talking about how  this is going to play out in the U.S. economy?  More specifically say, hey,  half a trillion dollars worth of imports -- everybody in this country, if  you buy anything made in China, you're going to pay more for it.  Hey,  farmers, you've got 2.5 billion pounds of meat that's now piling up as  exports slow to these nations.  You have soybean farmers that are getting  hit. </p><p>There is going to be pain, and it could be widespread, but does this  administration need to be really frank with the American people about this?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, it certainly does, you know.  And President Trump has hinted  about the pain.  But clearly, you cannot have decades of really bad trade  policy and policies on IP theft and not expect that the U.S. isn't going to  suffer at all.</p><p>We are going to suffer, but we actually have to do this because of the  scale of China's predation.  </p><p>CARTER:  So there's a lot of people out there who are saying this is a game  of chicken.  And that, ultimately, that the Chinese are going to have to  give something up here.  How long do you think it's going to take that  we're going to be feeling this pain until there's some movement?  </p><p>CHANG:  You know, we could be in a decades-long struggle with China.  You  know, when the Treasury Secretary talks about having equal access to the  Chinese market -- that's just ridiculous.  The Chinese system is designed  to prevent access of foreigners into China.  And under Xi Jinping, the  current Chinese ruler, it's become less, you know -- less open than it was  before.</p><p>So, you know, this is going to be a long-term struggle.  So we can be in  this for a very, very, very long time.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Well, China's already devaluing  their currency.  They're releasing reserves from the banks.  They're  preparing.  And they must be feeling the pain right now already from these  early moves on trade.  What brings them to the table?  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, I think that when Xi Jinping realizes that there's no more  Chinese economy left, that's really when you get to the point.  Now look -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have that power?  Because again, if we want to take more  power away from -- </p><p>CHANG:  It's easy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but if we want to take more power away from China then we  stop running $1 trillion annual budget deficits, which is where we're  headed in the 2019 fiscal that we stop spending so much money and we don't  have to lean on China so much to buy our debt because we're not -- because  we can try to control spending.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  I don't think we have to worry about the debt.  The one  thing, you know, if President Trump really wants to hurt the Chinese  economy, he just allows Chairman Powell to raise rates.  Because what  you're seeing right now is U.S. interest rate increases are affecting the  Chinese economy.</p><p>Money is coming out.  And, you know, you go back to this whole thing about  the currency -- I don't think China is actually devaluing its currency.   The renminbi is declining.  It's tumbling and had its worst month ever last  year against the dollar -- I mean last month.</p><p>But the point right now is that the Chinese people are not expressing  confidence in their own currency.  And I think Beijing is trying to prevent  the fall rather than encourage it.</p><p>You know, down the road, you know, I could see Beijing changing tack and  forcefully driving down the renminbi to help exporters.  But they're not  doing that now because they're so worried about currency outflow which  almost killed the economy in 2015 and 2016.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Just from a capital markets perspective, we've seen money  flowing out of Chinese equity markets.  We're also seeing less money  invested domestically in infrastructure, in capital expenditures of their  companies, so is this beginning to happen?  And does their administration  realize that their economy's starting to get shaky?  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes, I think that the Chinese do understand that.  You have  academics in China starting to say look, we cannot sustain a long-term  struggle with the United States.  And right now you're starting to see real  signs of stress in the Chinese economy whether you're talking about the  tumbling stock markets, you know, the currency that looks like it's in the  early stages of collapse, all of the debt defaults.  You know, private  companies -- the problems with the peer-to-peer lenders, it just goes on  and on -- Mitch.</p><p>All the problems -- I don't know if Xi Jinping has any answer to this  except to try to take on more debt, and Chinese people are starting to look  at this and say, no, this doesn't work.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But if they continue to take on more debt there, do they have  the wallet to buy our debt?  Because that could drive our interest rates  even higher if there's no bid coming from China for U.S. Treasuries.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Well, you know, China's going to have to sell dollars to  support their currency.  They've been doing that up to now over the last  several months.  They're going to have to do more of that just because of  their own internal problems.</p><p>So, you know, China's going to do what it's going to have to do because  their economy's at the point where, you know, anything could -- if it goes  wrong -- could trigger those crises of confidence that we saw three years  ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If we're getting tough on China, why didn't we stick by that ban  on ZTE in this country?  It appears that the sanctions that were put back  in this defense bill were stripped out again.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  You know, amen to that -- you know, we should not have given  them relief.  But administration officials don't talk to me, but my guess  is this Wednesday there is the deadline on Qualcomm's deal to buy NXP, the  semiconductor company.  That deal will be held up if China does not give  approval.</p><p>My guess, Dagen -- and this is just pure speculation is that the  administration gave relief to ZTE so that Qualcomm will get that approval  for the acquisition.  I don't know, but it makes a lot of sense to me that  you could have a tit for tat sort of we'll do something for you, you do  something for us.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So we've got $34 billion in Chinese imports right now that have  tariffs on them that they've retaliated dollar for dollar, if you will;  another $16 billion coming, an additional $200 billion that's being  studied.</p><p>CHANG:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think that the United States puts a tariff on every  dollar worth of imports into this country, more than half a trillion?  Do  you think that happens?  </p><p>CHANG:  I think we get up to maybe $400 billion is just my guess, you know.   And this is nothing that I know.  It's just sort of thinking about it, that  President Trump will actually go forward with the $200 billion and more  beyond that.  I don't think we get to the whole $505.5 billion but, you  know, we're going to get very, very close.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there's really no way to truly know how China retaliates,  isn't it?  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Xi Jinping is a tough guy.  I mean Larry Kudlow said at that  conference a couple of days ago.  Look, you know, the Chinese trade  officials they want to deal with us, but Xi Jinping is saying no.  </p><p>So this has become very, very political.  They're heading into their August  conference, the Communist Party senior officials at Beidaihe.  They're  going to be talking about this.  This is the number one topic on their  agenda because Xi Jinping is in trouble politically because he now owns  this crisis.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How quickly does this show up when people go to a store and want  to buy something?  They can't find it or they have to pay a lot more for  it?  </p><p>CHANG:  I don't think there's a problem because, you know, China is no  longer the low cost producer.  Companies can shift -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good point.</p><p>CHANG:  -- production very, very quickly.  The only company that can't  shift production on a dime is Apple because they're stuck with Foxconn.   Foxconn is in Shenzhen and other locations in China.  Apple can really get  hurt because they're going to be the number one target that the Chinese  officials are going to look at.</p><p>Yes, they might like Tim Cook today, but tomorrow they see that he's the  weak point in the U.S. economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gordon Chang -- great to talk to you.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Take care.

I say that is not a bad thing.  We've got that  story after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Millennials are taking risks against their older, future selves  in order to buy a home.</p><p>Gerri Willis is here with this story.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning -- Dagen.</p><p>That's right.  More money problems for millennial -- members of this  younger generation opting to raid their retirement savings for a down  payment on a home.  According to a new survey from Bank of the West, nearly  one in three millennials say they tapped or borrowed against their 401(k)  or IRA, that is, to buy their home.</p><p>Financial advisers caution against it saying it could put their retirement  at risk in the future.  One of them said this, quote,  \"Tapping your 401(k) to buy a home should be a last resort.  Millennial  home buyers should exhaust all other funding options first.\"</p><p>Now if you do borrow experts note that Roth IRAs allow penalty-free  withdrawals of up to $10,000 for first-time home purchases.  Borrowing from  the 401(k) on the other hand triggers federal and state income tax and a 10  percent early withdrawal penalty.</p><p>Home ownership is a priority for millennials who say, hey, it's a good  financial investment -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Gerri -- here's or what I'll argue.  If you actually borrow  from your 401(k) and your company -- it's up to whether your company allows  it -- it doesn't trigger as long as you begin to repay it, you don't have  to pay the penalty and you don't have to pay tax on it.  You can take your  own money out of your 401(k) plan, and then it's automatically repaid  through paycheck deduction.  </p><p>WILLIS:  And the problem with that is ok -- there are several problems with  that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you think there's a problem?  Because I know -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Yes, I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- plenty of people who have done that.</p><p>WILLIS:  Everybody does it.  That's just the problem.  Right now at this  very moment in this country 20 percent of folks have a loan out against  their 401(k), but when you take that money out, it automatically reduces  your take-home because you're paying that back immediately through  withdrawals on, you know, your income, right?</p><p>Secondly, you're probably going to end up selling high and buying -- or  buying low and selling high, when we say it's the opposite way because  you'll sell when the S&amp;P 500 is at one level and by the time you're ready  to reinvest again, it'll be at a higher level probably.  So, you know, it's  just a recipe for -- </p><p>BELL:  And you give up compound interest.  </p><p>WILLIS:  That was my next point.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know but it's your -- my issue is it is your money.  It's your  money in a 401(k) plan and it's a way to access it without paying an IRS  penalty, without paying tax on it and without having to go to your parents  or relatives to borrow it.</p><p>I would rather owe myself than owe mama and daddy because you know they'll  be -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Nobody's advocating borrowing from mom and dad.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know but if the issue is hey I need an extra -- </p><p>WILLIS:  Save it yourself.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- if I need an extra $10,000 to get this down payment because,  again the higher the down payment, the better the terms of the loan.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Think of it this way.  T. Rowe Price showed in a recent survey  that you borrow $10,000 from that 401(k), that's $100,000 at retirement.   So, you know, the end result is people who borrow once tend to borrow  multiple times.  At the end of the day, you're going to have less savings  for retirement -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well but -- </p><p>WILLIS:  -- and I think that's what people want to avoid.  And when you  look at the new changes they're going to make to a 401(k), they're going to  make it even easier for you to save money.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  -- trends in how people are buying their first-time home.  People  aren't buying starter homes anymore and working up.  They want to go in and  get everything all at once.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Right.  </p><p>CARTER:  Like there's a total shift -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, these mutual fund companies and these money managers  they're going to tell you that it's a bad idea because it means less in  fees if you take the money out.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Listen, I'm not going to defend 401(k)s and I'm not going to  defend the way these things are managed because they do charge ridiculous  fees.  You can always do an IRA if you don't get the match, but you do want  that free money.</p><p>Look, it's not a perfect system, for sure, but I just think, golly, you  know, the last thing you want to do is make your life in your 70th year  worse, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I don't think it's worse if you have a nice home that's  completely paid off.  And particularly if home prices are low and you want  to get in, it's like now is the time to buy -- </p><p>WILLIS:  You know what I like about what you're saying?  It sounds like you  think that homeownership is a good investment.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I do, ultimately.  I think that it's better than renting and not  having any vested interest or any actual financial interest where you live.</p><p>And another -- one critical thing I'll point out about when you do borrow  from your 401(k), if you leave that job, that money has to be repaid -- </p><p>WILLIS:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- very quickly.  It's a very short window.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Two months, 60 days.  Sixty days -- do it inside 60 days, and  there is hell to pay if you don't make it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The IRS isn't going to come after you.  You just have to pay the  -- </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Fingers crossed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you have to pay the taxes and penalty on it immediately -- </p><p>BELL:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- if you don't repay the money.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  You pay yourself-interest though when you take the loan out.   You do pay yourself interest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, again, it's your money, and you're paying yourself interest  rather than borrowing it from somebody.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I still don't go along with it, guys.  I disagree.  Not the best  way to fund a new house.  Buy a starter home.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  With your borrowed 401(k) money.  How about that?</p><p>We'll split it.

The Department of  Justice releasing the documents behind the warrant on Carter Page, heavily  redacting information.  President Trump tweeting this morning on the  release, doubling down on his calls of the witch hunt, writing this: so we  now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that  was paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC that was knowingly and  falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the  totally conflicted and discredited Mueller witch hunt.  And here's how  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte reacted yesterday on  \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" with Maria.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODLATTE:  Democratic operatives related to the Clinton campaign and the  Democratic National Committee paid for the creation of the so-called Steele  dossier and then turned it over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   But what's so unprecedented about this is the FBI then took it, weaponized  it without ever verifying its credibility and brought it to the FISA court  without disclosing the source of that information.  That is deeply  troubling.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, criminal defense attorney, Fox News legal  analyst Mercedes Colwin.  Mercedes, your thoughts on the release of this  FISA document.  Again, an unvetted dossier paid for by the Democrats.  </p><p>MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  Sure, I mean, there are other  provisions of that application.  That's already been at report.  One of  them, of course, is the fact that Carter himself had begun and says that he  was an informal advisor to the -- to the Russians.  So that certainly is  something that the judges could have hung their hats on.  They also talked  about the fact that he may have had discussions with these Russian  officials.  So, there's other things that the court could have latched on  in terms of this application.  Not just the dossier.  </p><p>So, there are other issues that have come up in that application.  And,  frankly, there is a lot of opposition to that application because, one,  that's a lot of redaction, so we don't know the full breadth of what the  application stood for, what the judges actually read in its entirety.  And,  two, the fact that the dossier was even part of the application is  troubling to many individuals that said, look, this should have been fully  vetted before it got to the judges.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you evened had Jim Comey when Bret Baeir interviewed him  when he was on that book tour.</p><p>COLWIN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey had the audacity to look at Bret Baier and say I don't  know who paid for it.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Well, sure.  I mean, now, of course, we know that there -- that  this was paid for -- the dossier was paid for.  So obviously, it's  compromised.  The fact that it was in this application is troubling to many  people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch, I should clarify that, he said he only knew who paid for  it, it wasn't actually running the FBI, that they didn't bother to find out  who paid for it, it was -- he'd read reports that the Clinton campaign had  paid for it.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Mercedes -- </p><p>COLWIN:  And, Dagen, anybody that comes forward and has an application for  wiretapping, it is such an extreme measure and it is such an extreme  measure that when you make these applications, you have to fully vet the  information that you're providing to the judges.  And that's what's so  troubling to everyone, because this is an extreme measure taken by the DOJ.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Mercedes, the documents that were released were heavily  redacted, I don't know that I've ever seen a document so redacted.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  One of the things Judge Napolitano's talked about with us is  potentially going to a judge and letting a judge read the unredacted  version.</p><p>COLWIN:  Sure.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Do you think there's going to be any possibility of getting  that done?  Because if we want transparency, we certainly don't have it  right now.  </p><p>COLWIN:  That's a great point, and a lot of things can happen in camera  which is call in camera.  Where the judges can read this in privacy.  It's  not published to the public, and it is critical especially when you're  talking about issues of this magnitude when such extreme measures are taken  in terms of wiretapping.  That is the most extreme measure that can be  taken when it comes to these types of investigations.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, Mercedes, I'm really --</p><p>COLWIN:  So certainly, that could be done.  </p><p>CARTER:  So, I'm really curious what you think.  This weekend the left is  acting like something great happened, and the right's acting like something  great happened, but did we really learn anything new at all?  </p><p>COLWIN:  (INAUDIBLE) frankly, not really because there are extreme  redactions done in the application.  Two, Carter Page was already in the --  in the -- in the crosshairs of the DOJ in terms of what he had already  presented.  By his own admission in 2013, he had written that he had -- he  had informal advisor to the Russians.  </p><p>So, he was already in that universe.  He was already -- I don't want to say  targeted, but certainly he was already looked at by the DOJ because anyone  that may have these informal ties to Russia would necessary -- would  necessarily be in that -- in that realm of at least scrutiny by the DOJ.  </p><p>So, we've already -- he's already in their crosshairs.  And once he started  orbiting close to the Trump campaign, that's when, of course, it piqued  their interest even greater, and that's when they moved forward with the  wiretap.  At least the application for the wiretapping.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mercedes, Chairman Goodlatte also confirmed to Maria that former  CIA Director John Brennan will be called to testify.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODLATTE:  We have lots of questions for John Brennan, and he will  definitely be sought by the committees for an interview.  This is an  extremely disturbing thing, to see both he and James Comey supposedly  impartial government officials carrying out their jobs in very important  areas in intelligence gathering and law enforcement express the kind of  extreme bias that they've shown now which I think reflects quite accurately  on what they were doing back in 2016.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mercedes, could Brennan face legal ramifications for his role in  the surveillance?  </p><p>COLWIN:  Well, certainly if there is any indication that he had lied to --  within the process, certainly he could face prosecution.  So, it really  depends on what representations are made in the past, what representation  he's going to make once he testifies, and there's always the specter of  perjury, which is they're lying under oath.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he has acknowledged that he's -- he egged on the FBI's probe  of Trump and Russia.  That was in a Wall Street Journal editorial last  Friday.  </p><p>Turning to the Supreme Court, majority leader Mitch McConnell is said to be  willing to call Democrats' bluff on nominee Brett Kavanaugh, let the vote  slip until right before the midterm elections.  Do you see any way  Kavanaugh is not confirmed before or the midterms in November?  </p><p>COLWIN:  I know there's going to be a lot of push.  The Democrats are  seeking over a million pages of documents, so it certainly could -- it  could last beyond the midterm elections, but there's going to be a  tremendous push to put him -- to put him forward, to have a vote.  There's  going to be a lot of that.  But it all depends on how much information's  being sought by the Democrats.  And, frankly, at this point it's  unreasonable in terms of how much they're seeking.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I want to point this out, because you raised this issue.   Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>COLWIN:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm talking to Lee Carter real quick, this is one of the reasons  that the president's approval rating has held up so well and actually  ticked up.  </p><p>CARTER:  That's absolutely right.  I think the Republican base continues to  support this president even when things are not going great with him.   They're saying you know what, the most important thing to me is the Supreme  Court, and I'm very -- like zero laser focused on it. </p><p>I'm fascinated to see though, if they don't get this done, is it going to  energize Democrats?  Because Democrats haven't had anything to vote for,  for so long, there's been a lot of resist messages, not a lot of things to  get out there and vote for.  People are wanting to go out and support for  gay marriage, Roe v. Wade, which is what the Democrats are saying on the  line here.  And then, that's not necessarily true.  But a million pages --  asking for a million pages, that is obstructionist, that is sending  American people are not going to favor no matter where they sit on the  aisle.  I think that the Democrats have got to start moving things forward  and get to stand for something.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mercedes, I'm going to give you the final word.  </p><p>COLWIN:  So, and it's also disruptive to the Supreme Court.  I mean, what  we have a vacancy that needs to be filled.  So, without that vacant seats  filled, you will not have decisions necessarily rendered, because it may be  a 4-4 split.  You need that deciding vote, whichever way it swings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, and the Democrats --</p><p>COLWIN:  So, it should be very disruptive in the long term.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Democrats would love that, doing a whole lot of nothing.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're good at it.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mercedes Colwin, thank you so much, Mercedes.  Great to see you.   Thanks for getting up early.  </p><p>COLWIN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, caught on camera without knowing it.  Uber and Lyft  dropping a driver for live streaming passengers.  The fallout ahead.  </p><p>Plus, profitability problems.  Tesla now reportedly asking suppliers for  refunds to help it turn a profit.  The latest headache for the electric  carmaker.  Look at that stock drop.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uber and Lyft under fire again, this time for a driver who was  secretly live streaming passengers.  Cheryl Casone has the detail on this  appalling story, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  It really is, Dagen, thank you.  Uber and Lyft under scrutiny  right now after a driver for both companies secretly live streamed  passengers' trips.  A St. Louis newspaper says the driver recorded live  streams hundreds of passengers' rides to the live video web site Twitch.   That driver has been suspended by Uber which calls the behavior troubling.   Lyft says it also has stopped using that driver that you see on your  screen, by the way.  </p><p>OK, Tesla reportedly asking some of its suppliers to return some of the  money it's paid them.  The Wall Street Journal reports the request for  refunds is part of Tesla's plan to turn a profit.  Yes.  Tesla's CEO Elon  Musk this morning tweeted only costs that actually apply to the third  quarter and beyond will be counted.  Shares of Tesla are trading sharply  lower in the premarket, down more than four percent.  Look at that.</p><p>And ten finally there is this, Dagen, just for you.  A video that's going  viral of a dog caught on camera howling the exact tune of a Britney Spears  song.  You may know it.  </p><p>OK, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I hear it.  I hear it.</p><p>CASONE:  Don't you hear it?  So, the howl sounds, I think identical to the  strings part of the song Toxic.  Here's the real song.  </p><p>Somebody had fun editing this morning here at Fox Business.  </p><p>Anyway, the newfound fame has made the dog, named Riley, a social media  star.  The video's been seen more than four million times.  That's a lot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I ask -- all right, I'm going to say it again, the producers are  crushing it.</p><p>CASONE:  Thank you, Ellie.  Thank you for editing that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  My eyes are watering, that was -- that mash-up, it doesn't get  any better than that, Cheryl.  </p><p>Although, I think you'll agree with me, you kind of -- it's cute, but you  kind of hope your own dogs don't make that sound, can you imagine if that  was your dog?  That was terrible.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Or your neighbors' dogs make those -- </p><p>CASONE:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  You have Coconut and Cannon.  They don't make those  sounds, do they?  </p><p>CARTER:  They don't make those sounds, but Kevin does think he's a  doorbell.  If he hears anything, he's like -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Barks?  </p><p>CARTER:  Smart alert.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, if you pick Charlie up and he don't want to be picked up,  he groans, like that.</p><p>Enough.  Coming up, crying foul.  The Chicago Cubs stepping in after a  grown man steals a foul ball from a little boy.  We have that story in  sports after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just in case anyone needs a refresher course, the Chicago Cubs  remind us that baseball is a kids' game.  Jared, you've got that story.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Dagen, baseball's version of  taking candy from a baby is not a good look.  But things had a way of  working out into the end.  Check out what happened at Wrigley Field Sunday.   Cubs first base coach tosses a baseball to a young fan to a front row but  the ball fell under a seat.  The ball dude in the row behind says, hey,  mom, look what I found, and I'm not giving it back to the kid.  Yes,  seriously, the guy just takes the baseball.  So, the Cubs make it right.   Not only did the team give the young fan an official Major League Baseball  All-Star shortstop, Javier Baez signed one for the little guy.  </p><p>And by the way, the Cubs a win, Cubs a win.</p><p>Seems hard to believe, but no Italian-born golfer had ever won any of  golf's four major tournaments, until yesterday.  When 35 year old Francesco  Molinari played mistake three golf.  Final 37 holes in the British Open,  not one bogey.  His birdie on the 72nd and final hole secured a two-shot  victory.  </p><p>Now, while Tiger Woods was one of seven golfers who held the lead  yesterday, first time doing so in the final round of a major seven years,  Tiger double bogeyed on 11, then bogeyed on 12, finished three back tied  for sixth.  </p><p>Also, in golf yesterday we take a look at the leaderboard.  Francesco  Molinari wins it by the couple of strokes.  Rory McIlroy held the lead  briefly, finished tied for second.  Defending champ Jordan Spieth was tied  for ninth.  Near 61-year-old Bernhard Langer finished one under, the same  score as Phil Mickelson.  </p><p>20 years younger than Bernard Langer, Tom Brady and the Patriots open  training camp today and Tom Brady, obviously, still has it.  Watch this.   Brady with all Patriots targets Wes Welker on the back of a golf cart,  watch Brady hit his target, and he doesn't even look.  He's like a baseball  player who takes the swing, and it's just gone.  So, he's all set.  Tom  Brady ready for training camp today.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yey, Tom Brady.  Let's talk about the grown man stealing a ball,  a foul ball from a young child.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  I mean, when I was young, my grandfather used to take us to  Yankees' spring training back when it was in Fort Lauderdale.  And I  remember somebody once tried to do the same thing.  Leaned in, and my  grandfather's big voice stood, hey, what the hell -- you know, and we got  the ball, it was a quick thing.  So, I saw that story, I said, yes, that  brings me back.  </p><p>CARTER:  I just can't believe the fans around him didn't do anything.  Give  me a break.  Yes, give the kid another ball, but seriously?  That man ought  to be ashamed.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I'm surprised that -- is that, see the person who he's  there with, you would have thought that she would have been, give that ball  back.  </p><p>CARTER:  No, she's like taking a picture of it, posting it to Instagram.   Look at my ball.</p><p>MAX:  Well, today's world I'm sure both of them at their job, their  colleagues will shame them on Twitter, and they'll probably never be able  to work again. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I hope they're not making any disturbing about Cubs fans.   Because that is not a Cubs' problem, that's a jerk problem.  An individual  jerk problem.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  Apparently two jerk problem.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but the Cubs made it right which is awesome.  </p><p>CARTER:  How about Tiger's come back?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  Unbelievable.  The line between Tiger not winning and Tiger winning,  very small, three shots.  Had Tiger won this event, and for me that he's  just about there, today it's the biggest story not only in sports, but  probably in the news.  And it's an amazing story of a comeback that I  believe is inspirational.  Yes, the man has faults, and he's certainly  vilified for them and paid his price.  But it shows that even when you're  the absolute best number one in the world, you're the greatest at what you  do, the unbelievable fight that it takes, the determination, what it takes  to grind and come back to still be the best, and Tiger is just about there.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What tournament's after this Mitch?  </p><p>MAX:  He's already the fourth favorite at the PGA championship.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  One more major left.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  PGA championship, there's one more major left.  And when is  that, do you know?  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  In August.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  We'll find out when that is.  But again, people want to see  some follow through.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're rooting for him but they want --</p><p>MAX:  He's been building.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But you know what?  There's the playoffs which he probably  won't qualify for -- </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But beyond there there's the sort of the fall finish, and  there's a lot of tournaments that don't have the level of players in them.   I say he's going to win something before the end of the calendar year.  </p><p>MAX:  And then watch out for the FedEx Cup Playoffs. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what?  I'm not betting you on that.  I'll just say yes,  sir to that.  </p><p>Jared Max, thanks.

Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for the second  quarter reporting season.  One-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 set  to post results this week.  We look at what he numbers and guidance about  the state -- the United States economy.  We get the reading -- the first  reading on second quarter on gross domestic product -- economic growth on  Friday.</p><p>Look at these futures right here right now.  Three-point gain on the Dow  futures.  Markets searching for direction after the Dow and S&amp;P managed to  eke out small gains last week.  Although that was your Friday close, it was  some small across the board on Friday.  </p><p>And then moving on, let's check on Europe.  We have declines across the  board.  But contained the biggest loser the CAC Quarante in France down  half about half of one percent right now.  In Asia overnight, it was mixed  markets, the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng heading higher, the Nikkei  and KOSPI in South Korea suffering losses.</p><p>Tragedy in Toronto, the death toll rising in last night's deadly shooting  rampage.

And it is absolutely devastating.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest as authorities work to find a motive.  War of words.   President Trump threatening Iran with severe consequences if that nation  does not take a cautious tone with the United States.  And unexpected  change at the top of FiatChrysler.  The automaker replacing CEO Sergio  Marchionne after he suffered complications from recent surgery.  What the  change means for the future of the company.  </p><p>Making a private call with a superhero twist.  One company creating a  private cubicle with a Superman theme.  For the first time in decades, oh,  EPA chief Scott Pruitt now gone, could have gotten that phone booths in his  office instead of the one that he's had taxpayer for.  All of that and so  much more coming up this morning.  CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell.</p><p>Look who it is, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Lee Carter, the President of Maslansky and Partners.  Sean  Spicer has a new book.  There you go.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>SPICER:  And you've got a copy of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It's not signed.  I don't know what's wrong (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SPICER:  It will be.  It will be signed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It called a briefing.  We're going to talk about to Sean about  it.  Coming up, politics to press and the President.  And maybe the  President will tweet some this hour and we can get your instantaneous  response. </p><p>SPICER:  Probability is high.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  He's already been tweeting this morning.  So, Mr.  President, let's ramp that up to our top story this hour on trade with  China.  President Trump will host a White House event showcasing American  products from all 50 states today following his threats to impose tariffs  on all exports out of China and to the U.S.  We're talking more than $500  billion worth of annual imports.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin amplifying the threats saying he \"would --  he wouldn't minimize\" the chance of this actually happening.  And adding  that.  If Europe believes in free trade, the U.S. is ready for a deal.   Joining me now is Ohio Congressman, Jim Renacci.  A member of the House  Ways and Means Committee, House Budget Committee.  Congressman, first did I  pronounce your name correctly?  </p><p>REP. JIM RENACCI (R), OHIO:  You did.  Renacci, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  So what is your take on President Trump's trade  threats and have you heard concerns from your constituents?  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, it's a mixed bag.  As I talk talked to my constituents they  always say to me, look, we're a little concerned but we want you supporting  the President.  And it's interesting I've had everybody from soybeans, you  know, the agriculture industry into my office to manufactures.  Just last  week and I always say to him, what do you want me to tell President because  I have opportunity to sit with him and what would you rather mew saying?  </p><p>They go, well, we're concerned but we want to you support him.  We want you  -- we realize, you know, we have to go through this process.  It's amazing  because you can't get a straight answer even soybean manufacturer, the  growers, I said to them, now seriously, tell me because they come in and  they say they're concerned.  I said, so what -- so what would your -- if  you had a chance to sit down with him what would you say?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But their business is being hurt though because they -- because  the concern but once people start feeling a real world impact on their  livelihoods, it might be different, right? </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, they are feeling it, they told me they're feeling it but  they also understand the need to be able to go through this.  They  understand the President's negotiating.  That's what I tell them.  We're in  a negotiations phase, let's get through these negotiations.  I've had an  opportunity to sit with the President car where he says, look, I'm worried  about children and grandchildren.</p><p>And at some point in time, you know, we need to make sure that we're  working through this and give me some time and that's what I tell them.  </p><p>SPICER:  How much time do you think that will give him?  </p><p>RENACCI:  You know, it's going to be interesting.  I say that I asked that  question too last week and they said -- I said, how much time do you want  to give them?  And they said, well, let's look at, you know, four, five,  six months and we where we're at.  So that's ---</p><p>SPICER:  Because it feels like if you don't do anything, they suffer the  consequences of Chinese economic policies.  But if you do something that's  some short-term pain and I think that's where -- trying to figure out where  that balance is.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, I was telling them short-term pain, a long-term gain.  I  mean, that's like --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SPICER:  Right.</p><p>RENACCI:  And that's like anything else.  We have to go be willing to do  that.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  When you were -- we were just  talking to Gordon earlier and he was saying, this isn't going to be short- term pain, this could be 10, 20 years, it's a long game the way that the  Chinese play.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, and the truth of it is, we have a long game already because  the Chinese have been doing this to us for so many years.  So now it's time  to go through this process.  And look, the most powerful message I heard  from the President one time was when he said to me, I don't want our  children and grandchildren on their knees begging in the future.  We have  to be willing to work through this.  </p><p>BELL:  Well, I think you saw that in the poll -- the Wall Street Journal  poll that came out that people aren't necessarily happy with how he's  dealing with trade but his overall rating is going up because I think that  the stock market and also, you know, manufacturers, soybean growers and the  like, the whole country thinks that this is a negotiating tactic and it's  going to end well, but the problem is when does it end?  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I think it's also really, really important point though to  say can you can be both be concerned and want to support the President at  the same time.  And I think that a lot of people have missed that because,  you think that if you support a President you support him blindly.  And I  don't think that's the truth.  I think most people -- for a lot of people  somewhere in the middle depending on the issue.  </p><p>SPICER:  Well, I think that people have been told for a long time that  policies going to change and they finally see the President fighting for  them willing and they're willing to give them a little bit of latitude to  see where this thing ends up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Listen, I have been from breathe one, very concerned about these  tariffs that have been slapped on starting with washing machines but then  particularly steel and aluminum tariffs and the retaliation that we've  gotten from some of our trading but most important trading partners and  allies.  But the messaging, I want to hit on this, because the messaging  from day one when Peter Navarro was on this program quizzing me.</p><p>When I wasn't on set about how much is a cost of six pack of beer going to  go up.  And the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial last week saying  Peter Navarro says the harm is a rounding error and their take was -- well,  he is out of touch because there are a number of -- there is a pipeline  builder down in Texas that wanted a steel -- a waiver from the steel --  wanted a steel tariff exemption in other company -- another pipeline  producer as well.</p><p>They didn't get them.  And it's going to cost -- it's going to hurt because  they're going to delay investment in -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SPICER:  -- construction industry as well in term of the cost of whether  it's a beam or a screw.  Things are starting to go up and that's costing  people money.  The question I think that we're just asking the Congressman  is how long and how long will tolerate.  They want the fight, they've seen  Chinese economic policies, adversely affect our economy, our workers too  long and they're willing to give the President I think some latitude for a  while.</p><p>But the question is going to be how long. </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, I say the same thing but I always tell them let's judge  this President.  You get a chance to a judge the President in a couple more  years in election.  So let's judge him then, let's not judge him today.   Let's let them go through negotiations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you guys, well, people go to the polls to reelect you or not  come November and on that note let's talk about tax cuts 2.0 which the  House is working on, revitalizing the economy, the second round, a big part  of the GOP's plan to try and retain control of the House.  Here is what  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise told Maria yesterday morning on \"SUNDAY  MORNING FUTURES.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  The plans to continue  focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth,  and then locking it in.  We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes,  we're going to make the tax cuts permanent.  That bill Chairman Brady, his  committee are already working on.  We just did a jobs 3.0 bill.</p><p>A bill to provide more regulatory relief and do some things that will help  create more jobs and rebuild the middle class.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is it enough for you as people head to the polls if the House  passed that?  And the Senate already showing resistance to it.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, I can tell you in Ohio, tax 1.0 is working.  Companies are  now reinvesting, I had a company went from 70 to 140 employees already.  I  have companies who are talking about expanding.  They're also giving  bonuses out to their employees, they're raising wages.  So as I travel,  Ohio people are very happy.  Now, if we can lock that in which is important  because the only reason it's not locked in its gimmicks in Washington.</p><p>I mean, I'm a business guy.  I always chuckle at some of these little  gimmicks we have.  We couldn't lock in it because of this rule or that  rule.  So let's lock it in, let's make sure people have certainty and  predictability.  I think that's going to be the second thing.  And also on  2.0, we're going to be talking about savings.  So I think that's another  issue.  These -- a lot of people back in Ohio are now getting more money in  their pockets.</p><p>We need to make sure they can save it and use it for their -- whether it's  education, whatever.  So those -- that's what 2.0 is going to be all about.   I think it's -- can be best explained that way when I travel the state.  </p><p>SPICER:  I think the other thing is -- I mean, look, elections are binary  choice and it's not just what Jim Renacci is for, it's what Sherrod Brown  isn't for.  And that's a thing -- it's a big contrast that Ohio voters are  going to face.  It's not just are you going to keep more, we're going talk  about economic expansion, it's what Sherrod Brown isn't going to do to help  Ohio businesses and families.  I mean, that's pretty much. </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, that's true too.  And I mean, it's polar total opposites  because I'm running against somebody who didn't support the tax cuts bill.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not one Democrat voted for the tax cut so -- but then they were  upset.  You heard this from Nancy Pelosi but then they're upset that the  individual tax cuts weren't permanent and they keep -- or they're now  worried about the debt and the deficit all of a sudden, so which is it?   And you don't get -- you don't get to say because she didn't vote.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Right.  And, again, here is the issue for me.  I came here as a  businessman and now I look at the numbers, 85 percent of our deficit or  things unrelated to the tax cut and the tax cut actually if it grows the  economy which it's doing and we get sustained growth over three percent,  then it will pay for itself and it will grow the economy and it will pay  the debt down. So that's the key.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speaking of which, we're going to get the first reading on  second quarter growth.   And the -- it's going to be likely north of four percent.  The Wall Street  Journal estimate is 4.2, the GDP now from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank  is 4-1/2, they're whisperer is coming out of White House, it's going to be  north 4-1/2.  But again, does that stick with people.  Does that -- the  number resonate or are they already feeling that?  </p><p>BELL:  I think they're feeling it.  We've discussed it earlier in the show,  the consumers, the everyday people, working class people are out there  feeling the benefits in their paychecks, they're feeling better but, you  know, we have the most jobs available out there with the lowest jobless  rate that we've seen in almost 20 years.  The consumers feeling good,  confidence remains high so -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you see that in this Wall Street Journal NBC News poll that  found half of registered voters approve of the President handling of the  economy.  His highest mark on that question in the survey.  That same poll  found that President's approval rating edged higher even during the week,  Lee Carter, when he came under criticism for his handling of that Helsinki  Summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The President's approval rating rose to 45 percent.  That is the highest of  his presidency.  </p><p>CARTER:  It is.  And there's two reasons why.  I think number one, we can't  forget the importance of the Supreme Court to voters out there.  I think  Republicans will support the President almost no matter what because that  is so, so, so important to them.  And the other thing is, I think Democrats  really blew it big in the way that they responded to Helsinki and the  President's comments.</p><p>Because well, a lot of people were rightfully upset by what the President  did say.  He later tried to correct himself.  I think that the hysteria  that happened over that actually made people more likely defend the  President that anything else.  So the Democrats really think and the media  really needs to learn how to balance their coverage and say, well, we might  be concerned, we don't have to get hysterical over it if they won't make  any moves here.</p><p>It's also important to know though that even though these are -- these are  pretty high rates, this isn't necessarily significant in that other  presidents have had higher approval ratings at the same point, but I think  it's telling.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Congressman, but we have -- potentially Vladimir  Putin coming to the United States for another summit right before people go  to the polls in November.  Are you concerned about that? </p><p>RENACCI:  Not at all.  I think this is -- again, the President has to be  able to negotiate even with some of the people that are enemies of us and I  think that's the key.  So we will continue to go and as we said, this  confidence is going to continue to build.  I want to go back whether you're  firefighter or police, your 401(k)s and your pensions are going up and  that's positive.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) thank you, Congressman Renacci.  Still to come, an  unexpected leadership shake-up at FiatChrysler.  The details are the  automaker's longtime CEO is stepping down due to health issues.  Plus,  Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We break  down those numbers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  I'm Nicole Petallides live on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  The Dow futures this morning only slightly to the downside, down  six of the Dow Jones Industrial average.  And it's earning season, the big,  big week here, 170 S &amp; 500 companies coming out with numbers.</p><p>We'll kick it off with two that have reported this morning including  Halliburton and Hasbro. So Halliburton is looking to downside to the tune  of about to 1.1 percent while Hasbro is jumping 10percent.  The Halliburton  in particular, it was in line earnings per share, that's why you're seeing  a little bit of selling, everybody is getting so used to be so far this  season.  The estimates were 20.5 percent growth year-over-year for  earnings.</p><p>And in fact, we've seen most of these companies beating, so we've seen over  21percent but Halliburton did have quarterly revenue on the rise, higher  oil prices and more rigs at work.  Hasbro as I noted up 10-1/2 percent  there, topping and soaring as it handily beat those analysts' estimates for  profit and sales by a wide margin.  </p><p>At then we'll watch for Alphabet, Google after the bell today.  That will  be key, not only will they watch for consistent revenue gains but also some  of those other areas, apps, pixel smartphones, licensing also cloud  computing stock just down a quarter of one percent right now.  So keep it  right here because coming up, former FBI Director James Comey is getting  political once again.</p><p>Why he is urging Democrats to not lose their minds and rush to the  socialist left.  It's all ahead.  Plus, spice up your office space.   Details on the new cubicle inspired by Superman that costs over $8,000.   That is all later this hour.  Keep it right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Let's kick off this new week with slightly lower  futures, five -- four-point loss on the Dow futures right now.  But again,  the direction this week will be decided by earnings.  Alphabet, the parent  of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter all set to report quarterly  results this week.  Alphabet kicks things off after the close today.  The  Google parent company reporting after the bell.</p><p>Joining is now beyond sport global ambassador, Fox News contributor, my  dear friend, John Layfield.  John, your expectation for earnings going into  this week?  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think we have another great earning  season.  The last earnings season that we had was the best earnings beat in  25 years since the early 1990s.  We're seeing so far a third of S&amp;P 500  companies reported, 87 percent have had earnings expectations that had an  upside on those earnings, the estimates that they've had.  So it's going to  be interesting to see what we're going to see these earnings.</p><p>Especially when you have automakers reporting this week.  We have G.M. and  Ford which I own both reporting.  They've already have commodity inflation  problems.  So interesting to see how whether hedge for these tariffs going  forward and how these tariffs are going to affect projections going  forward.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, some other companies to watch are these industrial  companies.  I think Whirlpool, Harley-Davidson or two of the names out with  earnings this week.  We will be listening for those even 3M listening for  the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs.  And any kind of supply chain  disruption these companies are experiencing.  </p><p>BELL:  Absolutely.  We're seeing these companies, 94 percent of the  industrial companies that have reported have beat on both the top and the  bottom line.  The stocks are reacting really well, the question, John, is I  don't know if you have a thought on this, it feels like the question is, is  -- are orders being pulled forward?  Is the second quarter coming in  significantly better than expected?</p><p>Because people are trying to get ahead of tariffs and that's what's causing  raised guidance for full year or are we just doing better than we thought?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's a great question, Lindsey.  And it's a little bit of  both.  We are seeing earnings pulled forward, people getting around these  tariffs.  So you're seeing lot of stuff shift early because of this, but  you are seeing better-than-expected.  We're going to have a -- look like a  four percent GDP.  That's going to be a little inflated because people are  getting these orders out there ahead of these tariffs.  </p><p>The earnings season this year, I mean, this is the dichotomy of this  administration.  We're going to have 20 percent earnings a gain this  quarter.  About 35 to 40 percent of that comes from these tax cuts.  So the  administration has done a great job in spurring this economy that is  already long in the tooth in this bull market to revitalization.  The  problem is all 100 percent.  Now black cloud is these tariffs. </p><p>And what can happen if the potential trade war happens.  It could negate  everything that happens with these tax cuts.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But so far, John, it looks like the markets are giving the White  House, giving administration some breathing room on how long do you think  that can last?  I mean to your point, we're going to get guidance this week  from some major industrial companies, the automakers about any potential  fallout?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think it starts until it starts significantly hurting, you  know, it's easy when you talk about a potential trade war.  We're actually  in a trade war right now no matter what level of that trade war we're in,  we're actually in one right now.  You look at Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh, Salt  Lake, they're all reducing headcount right now in their newspaper business  because of the tariffs that we have on Canadian paper.</p><p>So you're starting to see problems right now, you see soybeans, you see  livestock right now, you see a glut of that going on because we have two  problems.  We had a huge amount of livestock produced this year and we also  have these tariffs that are coming also.  We have a glut.  Until you start  seeing these -- Americans start being hurt which I think we're going to  start seeing, I think you give the President a pass on this, this is  negotiations.</p><p>But this is sticking and matched next to (INAUDIBLE) and say, hey, I'm  going to blow up everything if you don't agree.  It is a dangerous,  dangerous game we're playing right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, how do you structure portfolio around that?  Because again  you're not getting paid that much to own fixed income here.  How do you  allocate money?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think dividend stocks become to de facto bonds like they had  been for the past several years.  I know interest rates are rising but  that's still a play.  Look, you have problems in the E.U.  If Englands are  upset of the E.U., which it looks like they're probably going to do with  probably a hard Brexit, that takes out a huge amount of fees going to E.U.   The E.U. looks like it could break up especially we started losing smaller  parts like Italy and somebody else follows.</p><p>You look at the problems in China right now, the U.S. stock market is still  the place to be and I think dividend stocks are going to be the safe play  going forward because I don't think people know what's going to happen with  this market.  This market should be significantly higher.  This economy is  absolutely on fire.  The only black cloud right now is the trade tariffs  and that's why I will stay with dividend stocks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll say this ahead of the head of the European  Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker is going to be at the White House on  Wednesday, maybe you get some positive developments out of that meeting?   You never know.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  He doesn't have high expectations according to people around him  but you're right, we could have something, a big upside surprise come out  of that.  I wouldn't be surprised if the E.U. says, you know, we're just  going to drop the 10 percent tariffs on cars and then see what the  President does because it's really about those tariffs then the President  will drop it and this trade war could end at least with our friends here.</p><p>The problem we have with Europe right now is they're now negotiations deals  with our trading partners that are our neighbors in Canada and Mexico.   This could be long-term structural damage if we don't get in front of this  right now and try to work out something with Mr. Juncker when he visits  this week.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  That tariff that we have on light trucks that are  imported, it's a 25 percent tariff, it's called the chicken tax among  people I grew up with because it was retaliation to this fight we had with  Europe over poultry in 1964 I think.  So, you think tariffs can't hang  around?  That one has been around since before I was born.  Thank you,  John.  And before you were born too, I should point out.  John Layfield.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Correct.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Always great to see you, my friend.  Coming up.  Escalating  tensions with Iran.  The new warning from President Trump after Iran's  leader says any conflict with the country would lead to the mother of all  wars.  Plus, a surprise shake-up at FiatChrysler.

One big week  for earnings, one-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 reporting, this  week, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, all on deck.  </p><p>This afternoon's big reveal will be from Alphabet, the parent company of  Google.  Take a look at how the stock is premarket.  Let's take a look at  the Futures across the board, the Dow and S&amp;P did manage to eke out small  gains last week, and they're up to -- they are in the green right now.</p><p>The NASDAQ, 100, the Futures there are lower as the NASDAQ was, last week,  slipping.  In Europe, markets are headed lower this morning as well, losses  across the board.

Now, all is a Superman themed cubicle, modelled after  the same telephone booth that the Man of Steel used to get changed in, with  a few modern perks, red cape, not included.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, President Trump giving a stern warning to  Iran, escalating a war of words with the country's leader, Kristina  Partsinevelos is live at the White House with the very latest.  Good  morning, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   And you are right, the escalation has continued, the rhetoric between both  countries Iran and United States, why is this happening, why is the  President tweeting in all caps?  </p><p>This comes after the president of Iran gave a speech on Sunday to his  population, and he said, that if any conflict bn between the United States  and Iran, occurs, then it would be the mother of all wars.  </p><p>President Trump took to twitter yesterday, in all capitals, when in the  online world, essentially means yelling, he wrote, never, ever threaten  United States again, or you will suffer consequences the likes of when few  throughout history have ever suffered before.  We are no longer a country  that will stand for your demented words or violence and death.  Be  cautious.</p><p>And when I say the rhetoric has continued to escalate, you know that the  United States has pulled out of Iran nuclear deal in 20 -- or 2015 Iran  nuclear deal in May.  Just last month, the United States said that they  were going to impose sanctions against any exports leaving Iran.  </p><p>This comes at a time when the country in Iran is suffering.  The economy is  not doing so well and that had a huge effect on the price of oil.  Today,  we're seeing a trade just around $68.92.  But over the past two months,  you've seen it fluctuate quite a bit and climb higher because of the lack  of supply around  the globe, especially coming from Iran.</p><p>Iran has retaliated saying that they too will block any type of shipments  coming out of there.  But so far, it's just back and forth rhetoric between  the two countries.  And it's only Monday morning, 8:00 a.m. and we're  getting all this news.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kristina, thank you for delivering it to us, Kristina  Partsinevelos, at the White House for us.  Sean, I want to get your  reaction to the President's tweet, especially since it seems to be one of  the --you know, message control is the most impossible thing to do.  </p><p>They're in the White House, because again, that's the President, tweeting  out.</p><p>SPICER:  I mean, the beauty is everyone knows talks about transparency.  I  mean, you are hearing directly from him what he thinks, when he tweets like  this.  </p><p>And if I were President Rouhani, I would take caution in making some of  those outlandish statements, threatening United States, because I think  this president doesn't like to be looked at like that and he will take  swift indecisive action.  </p><p>So, Rouhani may forget that we can all hear what he says, when he does it  in the modern world, but that was a mistake on his part. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Iran was still firing, firing missiles after the Iran nuclear  deal was done with death to America, death to Israel.</p><p>SPICER:  And I don't think this President -- this President-- you know,  Kristina mentioned it, but he -- this -- the Iran nuclear deal is something  that is he is consistently talked about being a bad deal, and if Iran ups  the game, he is going to do something. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And now, Europe has to come to us to get -- basically  get waivers from sanctions that we are preparing to impose on Iran.  </p><p>The President tweeted again, this morning, on Russia, when you hear the  fake news talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all  that I gave up, remember, I gave up nothing, we merely talked about future  benefits for both countries.  Also, we got along very well, which is a good  thing, except for the corrupt media.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sean, your take on that?  Again, the fact that it was discussed  that the likes of Michael McFaul, the former ambassador to Russia, that  Putin says to our President, why I want to interview these Americans.  The  fact that that even came up was bothersome to many.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, but, again, I don't -- part of what we don't know is what  exactly was said, the context it was said, and what Trump did or did not  respond.  I think the White House has made it very clear that the idea that  Russia would interrogate any United States citizen, never mind the former  ambassador, is fairly laughable.</p><p>And I think it's good that they clarified these kinds of things because  it's not -- I mean, the idea that a former government official would be  interrogated by any country, never mind Russia in Putin, is something that  we should be very clear about what our nation's position is. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If Putin -- assuming that Putin does come to the United States  right before the midterm elections and there was a second summit on U.S.  soil, be sure that there will be people in that tete-a-tete.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I think the President is seeing the reaction that he saw  walking out of that summit.  I think they're going to come in to any kind  of future summit with their A game.</p><p>CARTER:  Do you think that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, you are saying that wasn't the President's A game?</p><p>SPICER:  No, I think that they -- after meeting with Kim, I think they  looked at the model and they were -- there was largely a lot of praise  coming from that, how the President had handled that meeting, how the  reaction had been in terms of him engaging with Kim, talking about  denuclearization in the peninsula.</p><p>And I think that this Helsinki summit seemed to follow a very similar  pattern.  I don't think that they fully appreciated the reaction that Putin  would get, versus Kim.</p><p>CARTER:  I also think the President didn't help himself with some of the  statements that he made, following, right?  Where he was almost -- seemed  like he was (INAUDIBLE) more with Russia than --</p><p>SPICER:  Sure.  And I think it's a good thing that they went out and  clarified.</p><p>CARTER:  Now, how do you think -- what do you think about his  clarification?  Do you think that was enough?  Do you think people buy it?</p><p>SPICER:  You know, so far, it seems like they do, I think it's important.   I mean, look, he has been -- it's good that he clarified it.  And, you  know, I -- talk -- there is an intensity to this White House of how they  cover it -- how they cover this president unlike ever before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The (INAUDIBLE) and the media.</p><p>SPICER:  The media.  And that's why I wrote a book that literally goes  through a lot of these big moments and how -- thank you, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm holding - I was going to ask you about this.</p><p>SPICER:  OK.  What I mean, I think that there is a level of intensity in  scrutiny that in past administrations, they haven't had to face.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  True.  But it's called the briefing politics, the press and the  President.  I would say, you put the words, the press, on the front cover  of a book, that doesn't really help sales, my friend.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I will -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People hate the --</p><p>SPICER:  But I think part of what people want to know is, what is it really  like inside?  And that's the thing.  You see one thing on television.  You  get to see us sitting here at the table.  What's going on behind-the- scenes?  </p><p>And part of the reason that I wrote the book is that the press gets to have  their say.  They get to put in paper, or put on television what they want  you to see, what they want you to read.  What I wanted to do is take  readers behind-the-scenes and say, this is what's actually happening when - - that you don't see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- is it safe to say that this is a President, this is a  man, the leader of the country who if you are trying to craft a message,  you can't control the message, because he is going to say what he wants to  say, and you are more crisis response or just a respond --</p><p>SPICER:  I was going to say -- I wouldn't say no, because -- I mean, right,  I think you are clearly in response, he is the leader.  </p><p>And that is a very different role than I normally played many -- most press  people where your job is to craft and execute a message and a plan.  This  president leads the way in every one of those fronts.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There hasn't been any lasting fallout for the President or even  the White House.  I would argue for anything that on Twitter.  And even --</p><p>SPICER:  No, in fact, I wouldn't.  But that's probably why one of the  reasons he won.  I mean, he has been -- and I write about all of these  instances were any other political candidate would have been left for dead.   I mean, I guarantee you, if a candidate for office went to Lee and said,  poll what I just did.  </p><p>It would come back and say, you're dead.  Get out of the race.  And what  this President, every time, not only picked himself up, but in most cases,  came up stronger.</p><p>CARTER:  And it's part of -- I mean, it is part of who he is, right?  I  think people wanted somebody who is going to go down, shape things up and  do things differently than it's ever been before.  And so the fact that he  does this and continues to do it, I think, just reinforces that message.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to Jim Comey, yes, Jim Comey, the midterm  elections, three months away, Former FBI Director, Comey, issuing a warning  to Democrats.  </p><p>He tweeted this, yesterday, Democrats, please, please don't lose your minds  and rush to the socialist left.  This president and his Republican Party  are counting on you to do exactly that.  America's great middle wants  sensible, balanced, ethical leadership.</p><p>But where is the sensible balanced ethical candidate who's running for the  Democrat?</p><p>SPICER:  Well, his tweet's a little too late.  I mean, that run to the  left, already happened.  So, he's a little late on his tweet.  I mean,  that's the problem.  They are now having a -- they're tripping over  themselves, to go further and further to the left.</p><p>They are not progressives.  I mean, they are now like Bernie Sanders, was a  socialist running for president and was -- at one point, viewed as the  extreme.  He's now become the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and you  have to go further and further to the left, to get traction.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, I just wonder, though, I can't -- I look at all of this  and I think I don't necessarily believe that it's a whole of the Democrats  that are going left.  I think that it's a socialists, the far left, it's  the only part of the party that has a message that resonates to people  because they are talking about things that matter most.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're lying to the American people.</p><p>CARTER:  Whether or not --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know that they're absolutely lying.  </p><p>CARTER:  They're saying something besides resist.</p><p>SPICER:  To your point, I mean, you can talk about all of these things at  some point.  They never tell you about the price tag.  They never talk  about the economic consequences that these policies would have on our  economy.  </p><p>Walking around and telling everyone that everything is going to be free, is  a great message.  But the reality is, it's unsustainable, and it is not  something that is a direction in our country that we have been against for  a long time.  We have been against socialism and against a lot of this  stuff.</p><p>And now, we're talking about -- in the other day, they talked about the  minimum income -- you know, were people will be given a -- like, that's  insane.  The idea we should be talking about is how do we create an economy  that allows people to have the opportunities that they need, how do we  provide a social safety net.</p><p>But the idea that we're talking about guaranteeing everybody all of this  free stuff, is unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, in your book, you don't believe, as the President  suggested that most media is the enemy of the state.</p><p>SPICER:  No.  I wrote about it.  I actually write that there are a lot of  good reporters, and that we need in a democracy a robust and active press  corps, that's essential to our democracy.  But what we need to do is know  where the line is.  Call out bad reporters and bad stories and also praise  good reports and good stories.</p><p>And it is not about being tough that reporters should be in pursuit of the  truth.  They should write tough, tough stories.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  But they should be called out when they are wrong. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And cut out the rehearsed hysteria, right, the rehearsed  sneering.  Coming up, legend in the auto industry, stepping down.  The  surprise leadership shake-up after FiatChrysler CEO resigned.  Plus,  earning season in full swing, Stuart Varney weighs in, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A busy week in the world of Wall Street.  No, America!  Tech --  big tech companies: Alphabet, that's parent of Google, Facebook, reporting  earnings this week.  Also, we get the first reading on how fast the economy  was growing during the second quarter.  Everybody is watching it,  especially, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  I love it when  you talk earnings and economic numbers because I know that that's --</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, you don't.  You don't.   You hate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I do.  Actually, I love it because --</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to earnings --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's not true.  Again, who held onto his Microsoft stock?   You.  What stock hit an all-time high on Friday?  Microsoft.  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  I had nothing to do with earnings per share.  I couldn't tell you.   Or, QE3 or anything else, and believe me, it didn't.  Look, I think this is  a pivotal week.  The stuff going on this week which would make an enormous  difference to your money.  As you said, Dagen, first of all, you got the  earnings from big tech, it's a big week for big tech.  Here they come,  we're going to find out how much money they've made and how much they  expect to make in the future.  That will have a significant impact on those  stocks, big tech stocks, which have been leading this market for at least a  couple of years.  Then, we've got the GDP numbers, that's Friday morning,  8:30 Eastern Time.  I know you will be covering it and so will we.  I'm  expecting around four percent growth per year, annualized growth, four  percent.  </p><p>Now, that would be a blockbuster news item because we've never achieved  that rate of growth in the last four -- I think it's been four years since  we had a four percent quarter.  And then, don't forget, Wednesday, we have  the Europeans coming over here, top-level delegation coming over to the  White House.  They're talking trade.  There's the possibility of a  breakthrough right there.  Either that or a breakdown, one of the two, and  that again makes this a very pivotal week.  So, I'm glad everybody is  tuning in, it's worthwhile.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What if we get -- and so much -- I've talked till I'm blue in  the face about these potential tariffs on automobile imports and how that  would hurt U.S. carmakers and any carmaker abroad or here at home, so many  of the foreign automakers have plants here, produce most of the cars that  they sell here, in fact.  But Stuart, what if we do get a breakthrough,  what if we do have, hey, we're just going to get rid of all of the auto  tariffs between Europe and the United States?  We're safe in the next three  years.  What if that happens, it would be incredible?</p><p>VARNEY:  Huge for the markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the summer rally has been held back by all those negative  trade headlines.  It's not being pushed down so much as held back I would  say.  But if you get a breakthrough Wednesday, and they come out with at  least a lessening of the tension, an agreement in some form or other to  just maybe get rid of some tariffs, that I think would be absolutely huge,  that would really set the stage for a big rally.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think about this every morning when I get up.  That is the  danger of always being negative and --</p><p>VARNEY:  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  The first thing you think of when  you wake up in the morning, is, oh, the Europeans are coming to a trade  deal.  I don't believe it, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, being positive and making sure that you don't look at  everything through a negative lens because again, then you miss all the  good stuff.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's the whole point about the Trump presidency, isn't it?   Think positive.  He's winning, the economy is expanding, we've got  prosperity coming at us.  You know, think positive, that's why the market  is up so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And even with some mean tweets, that's why his approval ratings  are up, too.  Stuart, great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY:  True.  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, he starts in 10 minutes every day, 9:00 a.m. to  noon.  Coming up, a phone booth worthy of Superman.  Details on the new  office cubicle that will cost you over $8,000, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The death toll rising in last night's mass shooting in Toronto.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Dagen, we just got an  update from police.  A second victim has died from the rampage, a gunman  shot 14 people including a young girl in Toronto.  The 29-year-old  suspect's body was later found at the scene, but it's not clear at this  point whether the man actually killed himself or he was shot by police.   All of this happened in the Toronto neighborhood known as Greektown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would say I heard at least 20 shots in intervals.   You know, clippings spent, reloading, clipping spent, reloading, clipping  spent, that's what I heard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, investigators are trying to find a motive.  Police say they  would not rule out, at this point, terrorism.</p><p>Well, tragedy in Maryland overnight after a firefighter died while battling  a massive seven alarm blaze.  The unidentified firefighter, a 13-year  veteran fell through the floor.  Three people who were inside the house  were able to get out, though, in time.  The cause of the fire under  investigation, but lightning could be the cause.</p><p>Well, some stunning news over the weekend at a change at the top for FiatChrysler.  Long-time CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced.  Marchionne  underwent shoulder surgery three weeks ago but in those three weeks, his  condition has somehow worsened.  We're looking for more details.  Now, Mike  Manley, who runs the Jeep, SUV, and Ram truck division is the new CEO.   While the stock is something to watch today, shares are actually lower in  the premarket, it's down more than three percent right now.  Again,  stunning news over the weekend for this company.</p><p>Well, a Superman solution for workers who want more privacy, for the first  time in 80 years, the Superman cubicle booth is available for purchase.  It  fits two people inside -- if that makes sense -- it comes with modern  necessities like USB outlets and an Ethernet connection, LED lights.   You're going to have to make more money than Clark Kent, though, it's  actually running about $8500 per booth.  And by the way, in the description  it doesn't mention to actually having a phone.  I don't think people use  those anymore, all right.</p><p>And then, finally, there is this, we've been watching this clip over and  over again this morning on the show.  It appears to show a grown man  stealing a foul ball from a child.  Well, the Chicago Cubs saw the  situation play out in real-time.  They ended up giving the young boy an  autographed baseball instead.  But it turns out the man that everybody is  criticizing had helped that boy get a foul ball earlier in the game.  You  can see him holding a game-used baseball next to his new autographed one,  obviously.  Yes.  So, maybe the guy in the clip isn't as mean as we all  think, and we're all beating up on him this morning.  So, I wanted to, you  know, give you some new details on this developing story in baseball.   Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Glad I didn't call him a lot of mean -- maybe.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, I think he's -- I think he's a little on a defensive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The child deserves all the foul balls.  How about that, though?</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, some final thoughts from our all-stars.  We'll be  right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Bell, Lee Carter, quick final thoughts.  Five seconds.</p><p>SPICER:  I'm glad to be here to kick off the briefing.  Thanks for having  me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, take it away, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm surprised at Sean Spicer.  I thought he got more to him than  that one.  He had at least five seconds to spare there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SPICER:  I yield it to you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, you're a good man. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

We send it right over to Dagen McDowell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning ladies, we'll  see you both coming up shortly.  Good morning everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell  in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 6:00  a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for second quarter reporting  season, one-third of the Dow Industrials and the S&amp;P500 set to post results  this week.  We'll look at the numbers and guidance and what they all say  about the state of the United States economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are showing this this morning, we have slight losses but, again,  even a tweak from the president could change all of that.  After the close  today we get earnings from Alphabet, the parent of Google.  Again, that  just kicks off a blockbuster week.</p><p>Those markets, those Futures after the major market gauges finish the day  on Friday, little change.  You had the Dow and S&amp;P were up for the week,  but the NASDAQ Composite for the week was slightly lower last week.</p><p>In Europe we have declines across the board to tell you about, the biggest  loser there being the CAC Quarante in France down about half of one  percent.  In Asia overnight some mixed action, the Nikkei in Japan the  worst performer of the lot down more than one percent.</p><p>A tragedy in Toronto, a deadly shooting rampage late last night, a gunman  killing at least one, injuring more than a dozen others.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard at least 20 shots in intervals, you know,  clipping, spent, reloading, clipping, spent.  I saw at least four people  shot her by the fountain.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a street where people walk every day, go to  the groceries, have dinner, have an ice cream, sit in a square, enjoy their  summer and it's absolutely devastating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have the latest on the investigation coming up.  President  Trump takes on Iran, the president issuing a sharp warning in a late night  tweet threatening severe consequences if Iran doesn't take a cautious tone  with the United States.</p><p>And unexpected change at the top for FiatChrysler, the automaker replacing  well-known CEO Sergio Marchionne after he stopped for complications from  recent surgery.  What the change means for the future of the company.</p><p>And out of this world vodka, Star Trek fans will be able to get a taste  space with alcohol inspired by the Starship Enterprise.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, CFRA Investment  Strategist Lindsey Bell.  PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle.  And Maslansky &amp;  Partners President Lee Carter.  We're going to tee up what is going to be  an incredible week.  One thing we'd left out in the open is we get second  quarter GDP, the first reading on how fast this economy is growing, that  comes out on Friday.</p><p>We're going to hear from all of these major technology companies and get a  sense of what the financial world looks like in the health of the U.S.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  It's going to be a big  week for sure.  And we're going to finally see what corporate health looks  like.  Tech sector's going to be very, very strong.  </p><p>We've got over 22 percent growth for the second quarter from these tech  companies, that is a six quarter in a row for over 21 percent earnings  growth.  You're looking at the S&amp;P500, earnings growth of 20.8 percent  based on S&amp;P capital IQ estimates right now.</p><p>So things are looking good so far, companies are beating on the bottom  line, the top line beat rate at 76 percent has come down over the last  week.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BELL:  We'd like to see that improve a little bit but the dollar's kind of  weighing there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, we're going to dig into more of that.  You teed it up nicely  Lindsey Bell, thank you so much.  And then the president's approval rating  going up, so we're going to talk about that as well, I can't wait for that.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Such a fascinating topic  because who would have thought --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p>CARTER:  -- based on everything else (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- you know what, the people who believe in his policies are  tuning out the noise.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.  And that's what we talked about, he got a floor and  it's not going to move.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  We're going to talk about that coming up in just a few  minutes.</p><p>But first our top story this hour, tech earnings on tap, Futures are  searching for a little bit of direction his morning, a start of huge week  for corporate earnings.  Dow Industrial Futures are down 15 points at the  moment.</p><p>Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, all set to report second quarter  results this week with Apple -- with Alphabet leading the way today.  The  parent of Google reporting after the bell.  Lindsey, can you dig into  these?  </p><p>These are the companies that have been driving the performance and I'm  going to look up a step that I have on my phone, but how critical will --  just these big name tech companies be?</p><p>BELL:  It's going to be huge and what's most -- going to be the most  important as is every quarter but especially this quarter, we saw what  happened with Netflix guidance.</p><p>Guidance is going to be key, I don't think there's going to be any dispute  that this has been a great quarter.  Like what you said on Friday, we're  going to get an amazing economic GDP number.  But I think that what people  want to watch is what's happening with the top line and is guidance  improving?</p><p>And we have actually seen surprisingly industrial companies raising  guidance for the remainder of the year which you would -- a sector that's  been impacted by trade.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  This trade in a way as I'm listening to  some of those earnings calls, I would have expected using the tariffs as a  bit of an excuse.  You know, corporate managers often look for something  out there, it's a bit of an excuse just to sort of temporary guidance --</p><p>BELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- and they're not using tariffs, which is quite surprising.   You're also not using the tight labor market as an excuse.  So that's been  sort of interesting.</p><p>BELL:  I know.  Which is a change in tone from what we've seen previously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But speaking of the industrial earnings, Honeywell's numbers out  on Friday were great .  That they had higher sales in profit margins  across, I think, all four of their -- it's divisions, that was out on  Friday.</p><p>But in terms of trade impact and the tariffs that have gone into effect on  steel and aluminum, the retaliation from major trading partners, Canada,  Mexico and even China, we're going to get earnings this week from TRIUM,  Harley-Davidson, and Whirlpool.</p><p>So, again, you're going to have to decide Mitch whether they're using maybe  the trade dispute as an excuse or if it's having a legitimate impact on  business here.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And we'll see -- we'll see -- if it's the guidance, you don't  know.  But if it's impacting second quarter earnings then it's not an  excuse, it's reality.  So we'll see then.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So industrial stocks actually are down two percent year-to-date  while the S&amp;P500 is up nearly five percent.  And there are some stocks that  are in, well, the toilet.</p><p>Caterpillar is down 14 -- 13 percent, 3M is down 14 percent year-to-date.   And also Alcoa had -- has had a major selloff in recent days.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  Alcoa you saw the tariffs impacting their business with  aluminum.  They bring a lot of it in from Canada, so they -- they're saying  every month they expect a 12 to 14 million dollar hit to the profitability  of the company. </p><p>This is definitely a huge -- the big question I think when you think about  the industrial company is, are they pulling this business forward ahead of  the tariffs going into effect?  And so that's why the second quarter is  significantly better than expected.  </p><p>The industrial sector has been in the toilet like you said.  The fourth  worth performing sector of all 11, but the stocks are reacting very, very  positively to this news.  On average, the companies that have reported so  far have moved up two and a half percentage points versus the S&amp;P500 up  1.6.  Last quarter, stocks weren't reacting to earnings at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's great news.  And I was just going to -- what I was  pulling up on my phone, it's not -- I'm not ignoring you.  I'm not -- I'm  not texting -- I'm not texting with my mother.</p><p>But if you look at just last week, they were -- of the major technology  stocks, there were only two that were lower out, Netflix was -- fell off a  cliff --</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it was down nine percent because of that miss, partially to  blame its own guidance.  And then Alphabet was down going into this  earnings report, half of one percent last week.  But, again, Microsoft is  out with earnings, number one Dow stock and is -- hit an all-time high on  Friday I believe.</p><p>BELL:  And that bodes well for Alphabet because they're in the cloud  business, to the third largest cloud provider.  We want to see tonight how  those numbers look.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The economy a big part of republican plans to retain control of  the House.  Here's what House Major Whip Steve Scalise told Maria on Sunday  Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  The plans to continue  focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth  and then locking it in.  We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes,  we're going to make the tax cuts permanent.</p><p>That bill, Chairman Brady and his committee are already working on.  We  just did a jobs 3.0 bill, a bill to provide more regulatory relief and do  some more things that will help create more jobs and rebuild the middle  class.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This comes as a new Wall Street Journal NBC News Poll found that  half of registered voters approve of President Trump's handling on the  economy.  His highest mark on that question in the survey.</p><p>And also president's overall approval rating did inch up a little bit.   Lee, what do you make of that?</p><p>CARTER:  So I think it's really, really fascinating to say that the  president's job approval rating was the highest it's been after a lot of  people said they did not approve of his handling of the meeting with Putin,  that was over 68 percent of people, so they did not approve of that.</p><p>But the bottom line is this, when you look at Trump's handling of the  economy, 50 percent of Americans approve of it, 34 percent don't.  People  feel that it's in their pocketbooks, they're seeing the markets rise,  they're seeing their 401(k) balances go up, they're feeling better more  optimistic, they're seeing jobs, more opportunities for themselves.</p><p>So, even when these things happen, even when, you know, the president makes  comments that makes everybody uncomfortable after he did -- as he did in  Helsinki.  The more hysterical people get, the more upset, the more that  they go after him, the more his face is short up, and the more people go,  \"You know what though, I'm still feeling better economically.\"</p><p>And that is why people go to the polls.  Russia is down there, I think  number 16 as far as issues that are most important to the American people  right now.  And so I think what the democrats need to do, if they want to  win this in November is they've got to come up with a message that is going  to counter anything that the president's doing in the economy.</p><p>And I think that's why we're seeing a rise in the socialist movement  because people are saying, \"Here are some in it.  If we're going to do this  it's going to make life better for you.  We're going to give you jobs,  we're going to give you foreign income, we're going to get healthcare for  all.\"</p><p>That's the message that gets people excited whether we want to -- and we  can have a debate on that.  But just going after the president and saying  that he's the worst thing that's ever happen and really getting hysterical  about it, that's not going to work for the democrats.  And I think if  that's the way that they're going to approach November, they're going to  have big problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, it comes down to in terms of this democratic  socialist message or whatever you want to call them these days, it comes  down to how you're going to pay for it.  And that's one thing that does hit  people in the pocketbook.</p><p>That's by the president's tweets about the Federal Reserve last week, it  did resonate with people.  Like it or not, I mean we kind of worry about  the president interfering in what is so-called independent Federal Reserve  but, again, people -- that -- people understand that.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well what's interesting and sort of to Lee's point, I think at  the end of the day, the average voter isn't a creature of the new cycle  like the four of us are, OK?  They're not really paying attention to a lot  of it and they really focus on making ends meet, providing for their  family, and if they feel better about that, I think it's going to show up  in the polls.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I did want to point out Lee that -- because we were talking  about it, the president's overall approval rating did end higher in that  poll.  It ends up to 45 percent.  And, again, buoyed by strong support  within his base, within the republican base.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.  See, that I think as much as there where things  that went wrong in Helsinki, there's also things a lot of optimism on the  republicans by Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court appointment.  I think people  are feeling strong support there and I think that is really helping the  president right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's what the republicans and particularly the Senate,  they're showing resistance to this Tax cuts 2.0 that the House is pushing.   Ultimately it falls on the Senate to make sure that Kavanaugh is approved  and voted on to the Supreme Court --</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- by the midterm elections.  And then what -- we have another  Putin visit potentially in the fall, so we'll see how that goes.</p><p>CARTER:  Rise on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We'll see how that goes just in time for the midterm.   Coming up, tragedy in Toronto, at least one person dead, more than a dozen  hurt after a mass shooting.  We have the latest as police investigate the  motive behind the brazen attack.</p><p>And shifting gears at FiatChrysler, Mike Manley taking over the CEO job as  Sergio Marchionne suffers a sudden health crisis, the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A mass shooting in Toronto, Cheryl Casone has the details.   Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well Dagen, good morning.  A  frightening scene after a gunman killed at least one person and injured at  least 13 others including a young girl.</p><p>During the rampage, the suspect later killed at that scene, it happened at  the Toronto neighborhood known as Greek Town.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARK SAUNDERS, TORONTO POLICE CHIEF:  Shortly after 10:00p.m. what happened  was the police responded to a 911 call for sounds of gunshots.  A young  girl is in critical state right now and the other 13 are in the hospital  and being treated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well investigators are trying to find a motive and police say they  would not rule out terrorism.</p><p>Well, stunning news, and a change at the top for FiatChrysler breaking  over the weekend, its longtime CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced.   Marchionne underwent shoulder surgery about three weeks ago but his  condition has since worsened according to the company.  </p><p>Now Mike Manley who runs the Jeep SUV and RAM truck division is the new  CEO.  Shares of FiatChrysler we should say are lower on this news.   Sergio, of course, as stunning force for the company, down three percent in  the premarket as you can see.</p><p>And then there was a new record set at the box office this weekend, eight  of the top ten movies were sequels.

But --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  This is a business program, so I'd like to know how much ABBA  gets every time there's a -- one of those movies, \"Mama Mia\" movies.</p><p>BELL:  Oh yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I think we'll -- we will put the burden on you Mitch  Roscelle.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  I'm going to start Googling -- I'm a -- I ask a question,  research the results.  All right. </p><p>CARTER:  And theory.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>BELL:  I saw the show on Broadway and it was absolutely phenomenal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So this is the -- this is the sequel.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So if Meryl Streep is still in -- this is the sequel to the  original film.  So, again, ABBA who would have thought?</p><p>Coming up, war of words with Iran, President Trump ramping up the tough  talk as sanctions on the country are reinstated next week and after he  dumped the Obama Era nuclear deal.  The stern threat, next.</p><p>And now you can have vodka from the final frontier, find out how you can  throwback a cocktail made with just a hint of the extra-terrestrial. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Escalating tensions with Iran, President Trump calling out  Iran's president after the leader said U.S. policies toward the country  could lead to the \"mother of all wars\" with Iran.  </p><p>In a tweet last night the president wrote, \"To Iranian President Rouhani,  never ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences  the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before.  We  are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence  and death, be cautious.\"  All caps.</p><p>This coming as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling out Iran's  religious leaders and address plans to re-impose economic sanctions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Ayatollahs are in on the act  too.  Judging by their best, well they seem more concerned with riches than  religion.  These hypocritical (INAUDIBLE) all kinds of crooked schemes to  become some of the wealthiest men on earth while their people suffer.</p><p>Right now the United States is undertaking a diplomatic and financial  pressure campaign to cut off the funds that the regime uses to enrich  itself and support death and destruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us the Editorial Director for the Washington Examiner,  Hugo Gurdon.  Hugo, your take on this?</p><p>HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  You know, President  Trump is reminding the Iranians that things don't go well when those  countries threaten the United States.</p><p>Your viewers probably remember that Saddam Hussein promised the mother of  all battles against the United States but he was crying uncle after three  weeks o the first Gulf War and he was dead after the second.  </p><p>What you're really hearing is the fact that the Iranians are feeling the  strain of the end of the deal that President Obama put in place.  The  United States, Israel, and some Arab countries are really putting pressure  on Iran to undermine it throughout the region and the peeps have started to  squeak.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think that we get a new deal because, again, we're -- new  sanctions will go into place, I think it starts next month.  </p><p>There's the issue about Europe, but partly few American companies really  stepped up to begin doing business in a significant way in Iran after that  nuclear deal from President Obama because it was not ratified as a treaty  and they assumed that the next president because it could be a republican  would pull out of it and sure enough, that's what happened.</p><p>GURDON:  Right.  Well American companies did not but the European countries  certainly have.  But, you know, the European countries going to have to  make the calculation, do they want to do business with the Iranian economy  or do they want to do business with the much, much bigger American economy?   It's hardly a choice at all.</p><p>They are going to have to adjust, they're going to have to start scaling  back and ending business and, of course, there are the oil -- there's the  question of oil exports.  It's that that could mean as much as $1 trillion  of losses, loss revenue to the Iranians over the course of the next 10  years.  </p><p>This is really, really serious problems for the Iranians that the Mullahs  have losing support from the country, the country is fed up with their  theocracy.  And as I say, you know, the allies, the United States, Israel,  and countries like Saudi Arabia are increasing pressure to try and  undermine the Iranian Regime.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Hugo, Mitch Roschelle.  And Dagen made reference to it in terms  of whether or not there's a new deal.  If there was some sort of new deal,  what would the foundation of that deal be?  Obviously be much different  than the deal in the past but is there sort of a rubric or a framework for  what a deal would look like?</p><p>GURDON:  It seems to me that -- I mean, this obviously as to some extent a  speculation at this point.  It doesn't seem to me that there's a deal that  can be done with the Iranians, you know, in the way that the -- that Obama  Administration did.</p><p>I mean, the last thing that this administration wants to do is to cement  the Iranian Regime in place.  I don't know that there's any deal that could  be done which was acceptable to this country and acceptable to Iran.  I  mean, that's something we're going to have to read about and see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was going to -- just to clarify Hugo, I said the first  sanctions are set to be -- take place next month, it's actually on August  the 4th.  So it's coming up shortly, followed by the measures that will  target Iranian oil, that begins to happen on November 4th.</p><p>That's why it's so critical that the United States has a growing oil supply  that we're increasingly energy independent or heading toward that.</p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're the biggest exporter in the world of refine petroleum  product and that --</p><p>GURDON:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- gives us an incredible amount of leverage over someone like  Russia and its partner in crime Iran.</p><p>GURDON:  Exactly.  So, the United States became the biggest energy  producer.  I think more than a year ago it's now the biggest oil producer  as well, it's overtaking Saudi Arabia.</p><p>This gives it leverage all over the world.  For example, President Trump in  Europe just a week or so ago pressing Germany on the gas pipeline from  Russia, putting pressure on them to buy energy from the United States.  </p><p>The United States has a much greater ability than it has ever had to  control the price of oil and that's the way it can really squeeze the  Iranians.</p><p>BELL:  But then there was also the report that we were going to give some  of our allies in Europe a pass on purchasing oil from Iran, is that still  on the table because I've heard stories both ways?</p><p>GURDON:  Yes.  You know, I've hears stories both ways too.  You know,  there's also -- it's also being said that, \"No, the November deadline is a  deadline and the Europeans are going to have to fall into line.\"</p><p>And the closer we get to that deadline the more likely it is that the  Europeans are going to have to scramble to get themselves in position.   They don't want to lose business, they don't want to any sanctions that  prevent their access to the American market.  The Iranian market is much,  much smaller.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And all of this surely will be discussed with Jean-Claude  Juncker, the President of the European Commission who's visiting the White  House on Wednesday of this week because in recent months the -- Europe has  been talking about exploring activating accounts for the Iranian Central  Bank to basically keep this agreement alive.  So there's much to discuss in  terms of Iran in Europe.</p><p>GURDON:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hugo, thank you for being here.  It's great to see you as  always.</p><p>GURDON:  Thanks so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hugo Gurdon.

But  to our top story this half hour, technology in focus, among the big names  reporting earnings today, Google's parent company, Alphabet, less than a  week after the company was hit with a record five billion-dollar fine by  the E.U.</p><p>Our next guest is, there's opportunity here, joining me now is Alfred  Eskandar, CEO of Salt Financial, Alfred, good to see you.</p><p>ALFRED ESKANDAR, CEO, SALT FINANCIAL:  Good morning, good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  What are you expecting from Alphabet today?</p><p>ESKANDAR:  We're pretty excited about Google's earnings today.  And we  think</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, just call (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ESKANDAR:  We think it has shown a lot more life lately.  It has gone from  what we viewed as a very calm stock only rising about 1.1 percent more than  the S&amp;P for the first few months to now, actually showing a whole lot more  sensitivity and what we really look for are stocks and sectors that are  sensitive to the overall market because we think that's where investors can  get an edge.  </p><p>BELL:  Well, volatility, really, when we enter this year, it's just been a  theme, it's been returned to the market and I think a lot of individual  investors have had a hard time dealing with that. </p><p>But the good news about that is it resulted in a decoupling of individual  securities from the actual overall market, how do you take advantage of  that and is tech the biggest place that you can take advantage of it?</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Well, tech has really been the big story all year.  In fact, if  you look at its performance, it's up around 50 percent, year to date,  versus, what, five percent for the S&amp;P, so -- but if you're going to have a  broader market rally, other sectors need to participate as well.</p><p>Volatility as you mentioned, has spiked up this year.  Certainly, we all  remember February.  But if you look at last year, we all kind of fell  asleep.  Volatility was incredibly low.  The market was tremendously  resilient and just showed no sign of slowing down or going down.</p><p>This year, volatility has returned a little bit more to normal, I believe  (INAUDIBLE) around 12, 13 right now.  Normally, it's actually around 17.   So, we are still somewhat calm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where do you think is the greatest risk in terms of even if you  just want to look at industries that are overpriced right for volatility?   I was just looking at how these big tech stocks perform month to date, and  Alphabet going into this earnings report is still up six percent.</p><p>It's not up as much say, a Facebook, an Amazon or even a Microsoft,  Microsoft is up closer to eight percent, but it's still got a really nice  fat gain on in for the month.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Well, you know, it's interesting that you mention Facebook,  that's also going to report later on, I believe it's on Wednesday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Amazon, later on the week.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  And Amazon.  But just focusing on Facebook for a second, the  thing that's important for investors, particularly retail, you know,  there's only three ways to make money in the market, your selection, your  timing and your overall allocation.</p><p>And Facebook has been a relatively calm stock, believe it or not, I mean,  it had a little bit of an issue in February -- in March, I believe, it  brushed it off, hit new highs.  But it's not moving as much with the  market.</p><p>And that's what we look for in terms of giving an edge back to investors to  basically participate more in the up rally.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Alfred, if you want to, sort of, look beyond the big tech names  who've clearly driving the S&amp;P, where are the places in the S&amp;P 500, what  sectors would you, sort of, rotate to if you are just worried about how  frothy some of those names have gotten.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  So, we love financials, industrials, as you guys mentioned  earlier, and technology.  Those are the three biggest sectors right now in  our fund.  We see these sectors again way more sensitive to the overall  market than some of the others.</p><p>And we think that's where you want to be exposed for this quarter.   Ironically, Energy was the big surprise, second quarter.  I don't think  anyone really called it out.  But it actually outpaced technology, it was a  14 percent surprise gainer versus five percent, I believe, for technology  at the same time.</p><p>So, thinking about sectors -- you know, again, industrials, financials and  technologies, where you want to be right now.</p><p>BELL:  So, you think Energy's over though, because this is going a good  quarter, probably for Energy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  11 billion-barrels a day --</p><p>BELL:  Prices up 41 percent in the second quarter, so the numbers should be  really good.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  True, but then we saw some pressure on crude and we saw that the  Energy trade slip away.  If we are going to get into a bounce and if we are  going to have a little bit more momentum in the second half of the year, we  don't see Energy right now as the place to be.</p><p>The industrials, financials and technology sectors right now, are  demonstrating to us the highest true beta scores.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mentioned industrials.  But industrials would be and are the  most vulnerable to this trade fight that we have gotten into, even our  major trading partners with the steel and aluminum tariff, initially, even  the washing machine tariffs early in the year, that kicked in in January.</p><p>Now, we're in this fight.  And so, there is the greatest downside risk in  industrials.  I pointed out Caterpillar in 3M, are down 13 and 14 percent,  respectively, year to date.  And we've got 3M Harley Davidson whirlpool  come out with earnings later this week.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  You know, industrials, obviously, much more sensitive to trade  tariffs and some of the other sectors.  When we look at tariffs at 32  billion, you know, it's not a big piece of the overall economy.  I think  last week with the Trump administration talking about potentially 500  billion.  That's a different -- that's a different ball game.</p><p>So it will be challenged.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did the market react to that at all, because again, it was kind  of a so-so.  </p><p>ESKANDAR:  It flinched.  It flinched a little bit and, you know, it didn't  have a massive move.  And I think, you know, for investors to take some  comfort, the market has become incredibly efficient and resilient.  </p><p>And by that, I mean -- you know, in my 20 plus years of being in this  business, I have seen the market become better and better and better in  distilling information, not getting, you know, actually being able to  differentiate between sensationalism and substance and.  I think we is that  last week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, what about the sensationalism and or substance of the  President tweeting about the Federal Reserve and the U.S. dollar and other  currencies because, again, Secretary Mnuchin came out and said, well, the  President believes in an independent Federal Reserve.</p><p>But in the past, you know, when you have presidential pressure on the  central bank, it down the road has created some serious problems for the  country and I'm talking about runaway inflation in the 70s.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Well, Chairman Powell, I think, did a great job with his  testimony last week.  And I think what he demonstrated was a clarity in how  he sees things progressing.  It's very hard to not be optimistic about the  second half of the year, given how tremendous the job market looks right  now.</p><p>And if anything, I think he's doing the President a favor, you know, by  controlling inflation, you get to continue the growth that we're enjoying  right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, maybe the President is -- we will see if the President is  hearing that message because the Wall Street Journal reported that he  picked J Powell over Kevin Marsh and John Taylor because he was told that J  Powell would be more malleable.</p><p>So, again, there is some expectation.  There could be some executive branch  control over the fed, but we will see what happens.  Good to see you,  Alfred.</p><p>ESKANDAR:  Good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Alfred Eskandar, thank you.  And President Trump is tweeting  this morning.  So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and  fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the  DNC, that was knowingly and falsely submitted to FISA and which was  responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller  witch hunt.  </p><p>We will dig into more of that, but, again, those FISA documents released,  they're still redacted but released over the weekend and the President has  been busy tweeting on that note.  And we will discuss it coming up.</p><p>We will also talk about oil, all eyes watching the cost of crude with  global trade worries, the President's threats toward Iran and then we have  x on Mobile and Chevron reporting earnings, later this week.  Busy week for  big oil, we break down on what you need to know.</p><p>Plus, giving moonshine a whole new meaning, there's a new Star Trek vodka  that promises to be out-of-this-world.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Energy in focus, oil prices searching for direction after coming  of their third weekly decline in a row.  Joining us now, the Schork Report  Publisher, Stephen Schork, Stephen, with the President tweeting about Iran,  uses some tough language on that regime, what are you looking at in terms  of driving oil prices today and this week?</p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Well, I tell you what, Dagen,  there's nothing like waking up as an oil trader at 4:00 o'clock in the  morning and seeing a tweet storm between Trump and the Muellers, that  certainly going to put a hop in your step right there.  </p><p>That said, I can't imagine what the Iranians are thinking of.  It's as if  they are daring Trump to release barrels from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve.  And I have been talking about this now for the past two months,  actually, since Trump re-enacted the sanctions against Iran.  You got two  big factors that the bulls are counting on right now, Dagen.  </p><p>First and foremost, we had an unplanned outage bitchumen, mining operation  out in Calgary, Canada.  So, imports in Canada, this summer, peak driving  season have just fallen to the floor.  So, a significant amount of barrels,  in fact, over recent five-week stretch, we saw 31 million-barrel decline in  U.S. crude oil stocks.  That's the largest five-week decline we've ever  seen.</p><p>We also have a situation Heating Oil here in New York Harbor which is where  you may take delivery on a NYMEX diesel contract, where we're looking at  supplies given those nor'easters that we saw in March and the yields that  we were seeing from refineries, heating off stocks at the lowest points  since 2000.  So Trump outside of his ego has two very real fundamental  economic justifications for release of the SPR, so the Iranians ought to  trend lightly in this case.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we've got about 650 million barrels in the SPR right now.   When do you roughly, I think it's a little bit more than that.  Stephen,  when do you -- </p><p>SCHORK:  Yes, something like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when do you expect this would happen?  And again, you also  have trade tensions with Canada which is critical and even Mexico, but  Canada which is a critical supplier of oil into the United States.  So,  when do you think this SPR release happens?</p><p>SCHORK:  Well, it's a possibility right there and it's certainly on our  radar.  At this point of the season, and I think your prior guest said that  he's not into energy right now, it's a good thought because right now  demand has peaked right now for crude oil.  We're at the peak crude oil  demand season.  We're at the apogee of the market right now.  And in the  weeks, months ahead, crude oil demand will begin to fall off as we  transition out of the summer.</p><p>And when we look at supply productions at a record all-time, 11 million  barrels a day.  We're also looking at gasoline stocks.  Unlike diesel  stocks, gasoline stocks are one of the highest levels for the month of July  we've ever seen.  So, right now, the demand is falling.  So I think the big  caveat out there, Dagen, is the situation with geopolitics.  Watch your  Twitter accounts and your Twitter feeds, because from a fundamental  standpoint, if we are going to see continued pullback in crude oil prices,  we're at the point, like I said, demand has peak.  It's going to start  falling in the weeks ahead for both crude oil and gasoline.  We're going  into the fall shoulder months, so we're looking at the falling demand,  rising production.</p><p>So the coast is clear for lower prices.  We just have to wait and see and  the one caveat out there, as I said, is the diesel situation in New York  Harbor and, of course, the geopolitical tensions with our friends over in  Tehran.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I will point out in terms of you talking about gasoline  stocks high, demand peaking, the national average for gasoline has been  falling.  It's at $2.84 right now.  That is the current average.  That is  higher than it was a year ago, but that is lower than it was a month ago,  lower than it was a week ago as well.  Lindsey.</p><p>SCHORK:  Absolutely.  I guess what happens -- yes, sorry, I'm sorry.</p><p>BELL:  I was just going say we saw Halliburton numbers came out just now  and they missed pretty significantly.  We saw -- I think it's 41 cents  versus 58 cents expected on the bottom line.  We saw Schlumberger last  week.  It was a pretty decent report.  What are you expecting from the  energy sector as a whole?  I know these are service companies, but what are  you expecting this earning season?</p><p>SCHORK:  Yes.  No, I expect from both an upstream and a downstream.  I'm  expecting another solid quarter coming out of the industry.  We're looking  an industry a year ago where they were hoping for $50 barrel oil to be  sustainable.  A year later we've got 65, 70, $75 oil where the market is  holding.  So, we are significantly higher from an oil perspective.  So  certainly from -- and from the demand perspective.  So all these people who  want to complain, like they think gasoline prices are too high.  Well, if  they're too high, why is demand for gasoline at an all-time high?  So,  obviously gasoline prices are not too high.  It's because the economy is  much stronger.  And the stronger economy leads commodity prices.  Commodity  prices are following the economy and therefore I would expect the earnings  from this industry to follow in accord.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Same story can be said about interest rates too, Stephen, good  to see you, my friend.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.</p><p>SCHORK:  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stephen Schork.</p><p>Coming up, turning the erupting Hawaii volcano into an explosion of cash.   Next, Hawaii's plan to help boost tourism by using the same lava that's  damaging the industry.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Papa John's taking action against its former chairman.  Cheryl  Casone has the details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  The drama continues for Papa John's.  Their board has voted to  adopt a poison pill aimed to preventing John Schnatter from getting a  controlling stake in the company that he founded with just one pizza oven.   That poison pill defense can be used to prevent a hostile takeover.   Schnatter who owns 29 percent stake in Papa John's resigned as chairman  earlier this month after using a racial slur during a conference call.  He  wasn't pressured to resign.  He did so, but things may be changing now.   Shares of Papa John's down eight percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, this is fascinating.  It's images of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, stun  the world.  Once small Hawaii town is hoping it can profit off of lava  tourism.  Big Island businesses are asking for a lava viewing site  somewhere on the island, but authorities haven't found a safe way to do  this.  Pressures mounting from local merchants, tour guides, and others who  have seen the tourism industry completely drop off on the island since  Kilauea began erupting back in May.  It is basically decimating their small  businesses and that small town is right near the volcano.  It's the entry  gate to the volcano in that park.</p><p>And then here is this.  One company boldly going where no man has gone  before and making a Star Trek-inspired space vodka.  It's going to be named  Ten-Forward vodka after the spaceship bar that is featured in Star Trek:  The Next Generation, the T.V. show.  The company says it's going to send a  small batch of vodka into atmosphere using a high altitude balloon to  ensure, quote, \"That every portion of every bottle will contain vodka  officially from space.\"  It will then be blended and bottled here on earth.   The vodka available for preorder for $29.99.  And, yes, Dagen, best Star  Trek clip ever was featured in your reset back at 6:30 this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was very impressed by that.  So a shout-out, apparently it's  going to go into the mesosphere.  You know where the mesosphere is?</p><p>BELL:  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The region of our atmosphere above the stratosphere and below  the thermosphere.  Between about 30 and 50 miles in altitude.  I know how  to use Google very well.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I know nautical terms, not space terms.  I can't -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Vodka is vodka, though, isn't it?  I wonder if they're paying  loyalties to the estate of Gene Roddenberry, just asking.  I don't think  it's -- the word start -- yes, USS Enterprise.  I'm sure of that.</p><p>CARTER:  It must be.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Lee, this is about branding.</p><p>CARTER:  Clearly that's branding.  I mean, this is a total gimmick,  obviously.  But you know what?  We're talking about it and would we be  talking about a vodka launch otherwise?  I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would argue that Star Trek fans are even more loyal and  serious about their devotion than Star Wars fans.</p><p>CARTER:  Oh, there's no doubt.  There is no doubt.  And people feel  strongly about both.  You feel one way or the other.  But there's no doubt  that Trekkies are more active in their support.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do not insult Star Trek.</p><p>CARTER:  No way.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  More importantly, we don't have vodka right now on the set.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Just to be clear. Just water.  Just water.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks, Mitch.  You want me to tell the story about when you  were coming in this morning?  I was like, Mitch, what's on your mind?  And  you're like, I'm still asleep.  He's waking up.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I'm waking up now.  I'm awake.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The alarming number of millennials tapping into their 401(k)  plans to buy their first home.  The details next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, July 23rd.

We send it right over to Dagen McDowell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning ladies, we'll  see you both coming up shortly.  Good morning everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell  in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 6:00  a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for second quarter reporting  season, one-third of the Dow Industrials and the S&amp;P500 set to post results  this week.  We'll look at the numbers and guidance and what they all say  about the state of the United States economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Futures are showing this this morning, we have slight losses but, again,  even a tweak from the president could change all of that.  After the close  today we get earnings from Alphabet, the parent of Google.  Again, that  just kicks off a blockbuster week.</p><p> Those markets, those Futures after the major market gauges finish the day  on Friday, little change.  You had the Dow and S&amp;P were up for the week,  but the NASDAQ Composite for the week was slightly lower last week.</p><p> In Europe we have declines across the board to tell you about, the biggest  loser there being the CAC Quarante in France down about half of one  percent.  In Asia overnight some mixed action, the Nikkei in Japan the  worst performer of the lot down more than one percent.</p><p> A tragedy in Toronto, a deadly shooting rampage late last night, a gunman  killing at least one, injuring more than a dozen others.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard at least 20 shots in intervals, you know,  clipping, spent, reloading, clipping, spent.  I saw at least four people  shot her by the fountain.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a street where people walk every day, go to  the groceries, have dinner, have an ice cream, sit in a square, enjoy their  summer and it's absolutely devastating.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have the latest on the investigation coming up.  President  Trump takes on Iran, the president issuing a sharp warning in a late night  tweet threatening severe consequences if Iran doesn't take a cautious tone  with the United States.</p><p> And unexpected change at the top for FiatChrysler, the automaker replacing  well-known CEO Sergio Marchionne after he stopped for complications from  recent surgery.  What the change means for the future of the company.</p><p> And out of this world vodka, Star Trek fans will be able to get a taste  space with alcohol inspired by the Starship Enterprise.</p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning, CFRA Investment  Strategist Lindsey Bell.  PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle.  And Maslansky &amp;  Partners President Lee Carter.  We're going to tee up what is going to be  an incredible week.  One thing we'd left out in the open is we get second  quarter GDP, the first reading on how fast this economy is growing, that  comes out on Friday.</p><p> We're going to hear from all of these major technology companies and get a  sense of what the financial world looks like in the health of the U.S.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  It's going to be a big  week for sure.  And we're going to finally see what corporate health looks  like.  Tech sector's going to be very, very strong.  </p><p> We've got over 22 percent growth for the second quarter from these tech  companies, that is a six quarter in a row for over 21 percent earnings  growth.  You're looking at the S&amp;P500, earnings growth of 20.8 percent  based on S&amp;P capital IQ estimates right now.</p><p> So things are looking good so far, companies are beating on the bottom  line, the top line beat rate at 76 percent has come down over the last  week.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p> BELL:  We'd like to see that improve a little bit but the dollar's kind of  weighing there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, we're going to dig into more of that.  You teed it up nicely  Lindsey Bell, thank you so much.  And then the president's approval rating  going up, so we're going to talk about that as well, I can't wait for that.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Such a fascinating topic  because who would have thought --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well --</p><p> CARTER:  -- based on everything else (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- you know what, the people who believe in his policies are  tuning out the noise.</p><p> CARTER:  That's right.  And that's what we talked about, he got a floor and  it's not going to move.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  We're going to talk about that coming up in just a few  minutes.</p><p> But first our top story this hour, tech earnings on tap, Futures are  searching for a little bit of direction his morning, a start of huge week  for corporate earnings.  Dow Industrial Futures are down 15 points at the  moment.</p><p>Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, all set to report second quarter  results this week with Apple -- with Alphabet leading the way today.  The  parent of Google reporting after the bell.  Lindsey, can you dig into  these?  </p><p> These are the companies that have been driving the performance and I'm  going to look up a step that I have on my phone, but how critical will --  just these big name tech companies be?</p><p> BELL:  It's going to be huge and what's most -- going to be the most  important as is every quarter but especially this quarter, we saw what  happened with Netflix guidance.</p><p> Guidance is going to be key, I don't think there's going to be any dispute  that this has been a great quarter.  Like what you said on Friday, we're  going to get an amazing economic GDP number.  But I think that what people  want to watch is what's happening with the top line and is guidance  improving?</p><p> And we have actually seen surprisingly industrial companies raising  guidance for the remainder of the year which you would -- a sector that's  been impacted by trade.</p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  This trade in a way as I'm listening to  some of those earnings calls, I would have expected using the tariffs as a  bit of an excuse.  You know, corporate managers often look for something  out there, it's a bit of an excuse just to sort of temporary guidance --</p><p> BELL:  Absolutely.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  -- and they're not using tariffs, which is quite surprising.   You're also not using the tight labor market as an excuse.  So that's been  sort of interesting.</p><p> BELL:  I know.  Which is a change in tone from what we've seen previously.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But speaking of the industrial earnings, Honeywell's numbers out  on Friday were great .  That they had higher sales in profit margins  across, I think, all four of their -- it's divisions, that was out on  Friday.</p><p> But in terms of trade impact and the tariffs that have gone into effect on  steel and aluminum, the retaliation from major trading partners, Canada,  Mexico and even China, we're going to get earnings this week from TRIUM,  Harley-Davidson, and Whirlpool.</p><p> So, again, you're going to have to decide Mitch whether they're using maybe  the trade dispute as an excuse or if it's having a legitimate impact on  business here.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And we'll see -- we'll see -- if it's the guidance, you don't  know.  But if it's impacting second quarter earnings then it's not an  excuse, it's reality.  So we'll see then.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So industrial stocks actually are down two percent year-to-date  while the S&amp;P500 is up nearly five percent.  And there are some stocks that  are in, well, the toilet.</p><p>Caterpillar is down 14 -- 13 percent, 3M is down 14 percent year-to-date.   And also Alcoa had -- has had a major selloff in recent days.</p><p> BELL:  Right.  Alcoa you saw the tariffs impacting their business with  aluminum.  They bring a lot of it in from Canada, so they -- they're saying  every month they expect a 12 to 14 million dollar hit to the profitability  of the company. </p><p> This is definitely a huge -- the big question I think when you think about  the industrial company is, are they pulling this business forward ahead of  the tariffs going into effect?  And so that's why the second quarter is  significantly better than expected.  </p><p> The industrial sector has been in the toilet like you said.  The fourth  worth performing sector of all 11, but the stocks are reacting very, very  positively to this news.  On average, the companies that have reported so  far have moved up two and a half percentage points versus the S&amp;P500 up  1.6.  Last quarter, stocks weren't reacting to earnings at all.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's great news.  And I was just going to -- what I was  pulling up on my phone, it's not -- I'm not ignoring you.  I'm not -- I'm  not texting -- I'm not texting with my mother.</p><p> But if you look at just last week, they were -- of the major technology  stocks, there were only two that were lower out, Netflix was -- fell off a  cliff --</p><p> BELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- it was down nine percent because of that miss, partially to  blame its own guidance.  And then Alphabet was down going into this  earnings report, half of one percent last week.  But, again, Microsoft is  out with earnings, number one Dow stock and is -- hit an all-time high on  Friday I believe.</p><p> BELL:  And that bodes well for Alphabet because they're in the cloud  business, to the third largest cloud provider.  We want to see tonight how  those numbers look.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The economy a big part of republican plans to retain control of  the House.  Here's what House Major Whip Steve Scalise told Maria on Sunday  Morning Futures.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  The plans to continue  focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth  and then locking it in.  We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes,  we're going to make the tax cuts permanent.</p><p> That bill, Chairman Brady and his committee are already working on.  We  just did a jobs 3.0 bill, a bill to provide more regulatory relief and do  some more things that will help create more jobs and rebuild the middle  class.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This comes as a new Wall Street Journal NBC News Poll found that  half of registered voters approve of President Trump's handling on the  economy.  His highest mark on that question in the survey.</p><p> And also president's overall approval rating did inch up a little bit.   Lee, what do you make of that?</p><p> CARTER:  So I think it's really, really fascinating to say that the  president's job approval rating was the highest it's been after a lot of  people said they did not approve of his handling of the meeting with Putin,  that was over 68 percent of people, so they did not approve of that.</p><p> But the bottom line is this, when you look at Trump's handling of the  economy, 50 percent of Americans approve of it, 34 percent don't.  People  feel that it's in their pocketbooks, they're seeing the markets rise,  they're seeing their 401(k) balances go up, they're feeling better more  optimistic, they're seeing jobs, more opportunities for themselves.</p><p> So, even when these things happen, even when, you know, the president makes  comments that makes everybody uncomfortable after he did -- as he did in  Helsinki.  The more hysterical people get, the more upset, the more that  they go after him, the more his face is short up, and the more people go,  \"You know what though, I'm still feeling better economically.\"</p><p> And that is why people go to the polls.  Russia is down there, I think  number 16 as far as issues that are most important to the American people  right now.  And so I think what the democrats need to do, if they want to  win this in November is they've got to come up with a message that is going  to counter anything that the president's doing in the economy.</p><p> And I think that's why we're seeing a rise in the socialist movement  because people are saying, \"Here are some in it.  If we're going to do this  it's going to make life better for you.  We're going to give you jobs,  we're going to give you foreign income, we're going to get healthcare for  all.\"</p><p> That's the message that gets people excited whether we want to -- and we  can have a debate on that.  But just going after the president and saying  that he's the worst thing that's ever happen and really getting hysterical  about it, that's not going to work for the democrats.  And I think if  that's the way that they're going to approach November, they're going to  have big problems.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, again, it comes down to in terms of this democratic  socialist message or whatever you want to call them these days, it comes  down to how you're going to pay for it.  And that's one thing that does hit  people in the pocketbook.</p><p> That's by the president's tweets about the Federal Reserve last week, it  did resonate with people.  Like it or not, I mean we kind of worry about  the president interfering in what is so-called independent Federal Reserve  but, again, people -- that -- people understand that.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Well what's interesting and sort of to Lee's point, I think at  the end of the day, the average voter isn't a creature of the new cycle  like the four of us are, OK?  They're not really paying attention to a lot  of it and they really focus on making ends meet, providing for their  family, and if they feel better about that, I think it's going to show up  in the polls.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I did want to point out Lee that -- because we were talking  about it, the president's overall approval rating did end higher in that  poll.  It ends up to 45 percent.  And, again, buoyed by strong support  within his base, within the republican base.</p><p> CARTER:  That's right.  See, that I think as much as there where things  that went wrong in Helsinki, there's also things a lot of optimism on the  republicans by Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court appointment.  I think people  are feeling strong support there and I think that is really helping the  president right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that's what the republicans and particularly the Senate,  they're showing resistance to this Tax cuts 2.0 that the House is pushing.   Ultimately it falls on the Senate to make sure that Kavanaugh is approved  and voted on to the Supreme Court --</p><p> CARTER:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- by the midterm elections.  And then what -- we have another  Putin visit potentially in the fall, so we'll see how that goes.</p><p> CARTER:  Rise on that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We'll see how that goes just in time for the midterm.   Coming up, tragedy in Toronto, at least one person dead, more than a dozen  hurt after a mass shooting.  We have the latest as police investigate the  motive behind the brazen attack.</p><p> And shifting gears at FiatChrysler, Mike Manley taking over the CEO job as  Sergio Marchionne suffers a sudden health crisis, the details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A mass shooting in Toronto, Cheryl Casone has the details.   Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well Dagen, good morning.  A  frightening scene after a gunman killed at least one person and injured at  least 13 others including a young girl.</p><p> During the rampage, the suspect later killed at that scene, it happened at  the Toronto neighborhood known as Greek Town.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARK SAUNDERS, TORONTO POLICE CHIEF:  Shortly after 10:00p.m. what happened  was the police responded to a 911 call for sounds of gunshots.  A young  girl is in critical state right now and the other 13 are in the hospital  and being treated.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well investigators are trying to find a motive and police say they  would not rule out terrorism.</p><p> Well, stunning news, and a change at the top for FiatChrysler breaking  over the weekend, its longtime CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced.   Marchionne underwent shoulder surgery about three weeks ago but his  condition has since worsened according to the company.  </p><p> Now Mike Manley who runs the Jeep SUV and RAM truck division is the new  CEO.  Shares of FiatChrysler we should say are lower on this news.   Sergio, of course, as stunning force for the company, down three percent in  the premarket as you can see.</p><p> And then there was a new record set at the box office this weekend, eight  of the top ten movies were sequels.  And the top spot went to a surprise  upset.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They killed my friend.  (INAUDIBLE) in everyone of them  and the only disappointment is that I only get to do it once.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well Sony's \"The Equalizer 2\" starring Denzel Washington brought  in $35.8 million.  Equalizer narrowly beat another sequel, Universal's  \"Mama Mia Here We Go Again\" which made $34.4 million which beat the  original film by the way by about seven million bucks, pretty good.</p><p> Taking third, Sony's \"Hotel Transylvania III\" with $23.3 million.  Rounding  up top five, \"Ant Man and the Wasp\" and \"Incredibles 2\" Dagen.  Feel free  to have \"Mama Mia\" stuck in your head for the rest of the morning as I do  right at this moment.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know why it beat the original?  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  One word, Cher.</p><p> CASONE:  Cher.  Got you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just despite her craziness on Twitter, I can't even -- she  speaks a language of her own on Twitter.  But --</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  This is a business program, so I'd like to know how much ABBA  gets every time there's a -- one of those movies, \"Mama Mia\" movies.</p><p> BELL:  Oh yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well I think we'll -- we will put the burden on you Mitch  Roscelle.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  I'm going to start Googling -- I'm a -- I ask a question,  research the results.  All right. </p><p> CARTER:  And theory.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p> BELL:  I saw the show on Broadway and it was absolutely phenomenal.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So this is the -- this is the sequel.</p><p> BELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So if Meryl Streep is still in -- this is the sequel to the  original film.  So, again, ABBA who would have thought?</p><p> Coming up, war of words with Iran, President Trump ramping up the tough  talk as sanctions on the country are reinstated next week and after he  dumped the Obama Era nuclear deal.  The stern threat, next.</p><p> And now you can have vodka from the final frontier, find out how you can  throwback a cocktail made with just a hint of the extra-terrestrial. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Escalating tensions with Iran, President Trump calling out  Iran's president after the leader said U.S. policies toward the country  could lead to the \"mother of all wars\" with Iran.  </p><p> In a tweet last night the president wrote, \"To Iranian President Rouhani,  never ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences  the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before.  We  are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence  and death, be cautious.\"  All caps.</p><p> This coming as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling out Iran's  religious leaders and address plans to re-impose economic sanctions.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Ayatollahs are in on the act  too.  Judging by their best, well they seem more concerned with riches than  religion.  These hypocritical (INAUDIBLE) all kinds of crooked schemes to  become some of the wealthiest men on earth while their people suffer.</p><p> Right now the United States is undertaking a diplomatic and financial  pressure campaign to cut off the funds that the regime uses to enrich  itself and support death and destruction.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us the Editorial Director for the Washington Examiner,  Hugo Gurdon.  Hugo, your take on this?</p><p> HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  You know, President  Trump is reminding the Iranians that things don't go well when those  countries threaten the United States.</p><p> Your viewers probably remember that Saddam Hussein promised the mother of  all battles against the United States but he was crying uncle after three  weeks o the first Gulf War and he was dead after the second.  </p><p> What you're really hearing is the fact that the Iranians are feeling the  strain of the end of the deal that President Obama put in place.  The  United States, Israel, and some Arab countries are really putting pressure  on Iran to undermine it throughout the region and the peeps have started to  squeak.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think that we get a new deal because, again, we're -- new  sanctions will go into place, I think it starts next month.  </p><p> There's the issue about Europe, but partly few American companies really  stepped up to begin doing business in a significant way in Iran after that  nuclear deal from President Obama because it was not ratified as a treaty  and they assumed that the next president because it could be a republican  would pull out of it and sure enough, that's what happened.</p><p> GURDON:  Right.  Well American companies did not but the European countries  certainly have.  But, you know, the European countries going to have to  make the calculation, do they want to do business with the Iranian economy  or do they want to do business with the much, much bigger American economy?   It's hardly a choice at all.</p><p> They are going to have to adjust, they're going to have to start scaling  back and ending business and, of course, there are the oil -- there's the  question of oil exports.  It's that that could mean as much as $1 trillion  of losses, loss revenue to the Iranians over the course of the next 10  years.  </p><p> This is really, really serious problems for the Iranians that the Mullahs  have losing support from the country, the country is fed up with their  theocracy.  And as I say, you know, the allies, the United States, Israel,  and countries like Saudi Arabia are increasing pressure to try and  undermine the Iranian Regime.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Hugo, Mitch Roschelle.  And Dagen made reference to it in terms  of whether or not there's a new deal.  If there was some sort of new deal,  what would the foundation of that deal be?  Obviously be much different  than the deal in the past but is there sort of a rubric or a framework for  what a deal would look like?</p><p> GURDON:  It seems to me that -- I mean, this obviously as to some extent a  speculation at this point.  It doesn't seem to me that there's a deal that  can be done with the Iranians, you know, in the way that the -- that Obama  Administration did.</p><p> I mean, the last thing that this administration wants to do is to cement  the Iranian Regime in place.  I don't know that there's any deal that could  be done which was acceptable to this country and acceptable to Iran.  I  mean, that's something we're going to have to read about and see.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was going to -- just to clarify Hugo, I said the first  sanctions are set to be -- take place next month, it's actually on August  the 4th.  So it's coming up shortly, followed by the measures that will  target Iranian oil, that begins to happen on November 4th.</p><p> That's why it's so critical that the United States has a growing oil supply  that we're increasingly energy independent or heading toward that.</p><p> GURDON:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're the biggest exporter in the world of refine petroleum  product and that --</p><p> GURDON:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- gives us an incredible amount of leverage over someone like  Russia and its partner in crime Iran.</p><p> GURDON:  Exactly.  So, the United States became the biggest energy  producer.  I think more than a year ago it's now the biggest oil producer  as well, it's overtaking Saudi Arabia.</p><p> This gives it leverage all over the world.  For example, President Trump in  Europe just a week or so ago pressing Germany on the gas pipeline from  Russia, putting pressure on them to buy energy from the United States.  </p><p> The United States has a much greater ability than it has ever had to  control the price of oil and that's the way it can really squeeze the  Iranians.</p><p> BELL:  But then there was also the report that we were going to give some  of our allies in Europe a pass on purchasing oil from Iran, is that still  on the table because I've heard stories both ways?</p><p> GURDON:  Yes.  You know, I've hears stories both ways too.  You know,  there's also -- it's also being said that, \"No, the November deadline is a  deadline and the Europeans are going to have to fall into line.\"</p><p> And the closer we get to that deadline the more likely it is that the  Europeans are going to have to scramble to get themselves in position.   They don't want to lose business, they don't want to any sanctions that  prevent their access to the American market.  The Iranian market is much,  much smaller.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And all of this surely will be discussed with Jean-Claude  Juncker, the President of the European Commission who's visiting the White  House on Wednesday of this week because in recent months the -- Europe has  been talking about exploring activating accounts for the Iranian Central  Bank to basically keep this agreement alive.  So there's much to discuss in  terms of Iran in Europe.</p><p> GURDON:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hugo, thank you for being here.  It's great to see you as  always.</p><p> GURDON:  Thanks so much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hugo Gurdon.  Coming up, pizza fight, the board of Papa John's  is going to extremes to prevent the company's founder from gaining  controlling interest after stepping down for using a racial epitaph.

It is an alcohol substitute, now being  served aboard star ships.  It simulates the appearance, taste and smell of  alcohol, but the intoxicating effects can be easily dismissed.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Details of new liquor that contains vodka from space and also an  award to the producer who located that clip from Star Trek generation.  But  to our top story this half hour, technology in focus, among the big names  reporting earnings today, Google's parent company, Alphabet, less than a  week after the company was hit with a record five billion-dollar fine by  the E.U.</p><p> Our next guest is, there's opportunity here, joining me now is Alfred  Eskandar, CEO of Salt Financial, Alfred, good to see you.</p><p> ALFRED ESKANDAR, CEO, SALT FINANCIAL:  Good morning, good to be here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  What are you expecting from Alphabet today?</p><p> ESKANDAR:  We're pretty excited about Google's earnings today.  And we  think</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, just call (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> ESKANDAR:  We think it has shown a lot more life lately.  It has gone from  what we viewed as a very calm stock only rising about 1.1 percent more than  the S&amp;P for the first few months to now, actually showing a whole lot more  sensitivity and what we really look for are stocks and sectors that are  sensitive to the overall market because we think that's where investors can  get an edge.  </p><p> BELL:  Well, volatility, really, when we enter this year, it's just been a  theme, it's been returned to the market and I think a lot of individual  investors have had a hard time dealing with that. </p><p> But the good news about that is it resulted in a decoupling of individual  securities from the actual overall market, how do you take advantage of  that and is tech the biggest place that you can take advantage of it?</p><p> ESKANDAR:  Well, tech has really been the big story all year.  In fact, if  you look at its performance, it's up around 50 percent, year to date,  versus, what, five percent for the S&amp;P, so -- but if you're going to have a  broader market rally, other sectors need to participate as well.</p><p> Volatility as you mentioned, has spiked up this year.  Certainly, we all  remember February.  But if you look at last year, we all kind of fell  asleep.  Volatility was incredibly low.  The market was tremendously  resilient and just showed no sign of slowing down or going down.</p><p> This year, volatility has returned a little bit more to normal, I believe  (INAUDIBLE) around 12, 13 right now.  Normally, it's actually around 17.   So, we are still somewhat calm.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Where do you think is the greatest risk in terms of even if you  just want to look at industries that are overpriced right for volatility?   I was just looking at how these big tech stocks perform month to date, and  Alphabet going into this earnings report is still up six percent.</p><p> It's not up as much say, a Facebook, an Amazon or even a Microsoft,  Microsoft is up closer to eight percent, but it's still got a really nice  fat gain on in for the month.</p><p> ESKANDAR:  Well, you know, it's interesting that you mention Facebook,  that's also going to report later on, I believe it's on Wednesday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Amazon, later on the week.</p><p> ESKANDAR:  And Amazon.  But just focusing on Facebook for a second, the  thing that's important for investors, particularly retail, you know,  there's only three ways to make money in the market, your selection, your  timing and your overall allocation.</p><p> And Facebook has been a relatively calm stock, believe it or not, I mean,  it had a little bit of an issue in February -- in March, I believe, it  brushed it off, hit new highs.  But it's not moving as much with the  market.</p><p> And that's what we look for in terms of giving an edge back to investors to  basically participate more in the up rally.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Alfred, if you want to, sort of, look beyond the big tech names  who've clearly driving the S&amp;P, where are the places in the S&amp;P 500, what  sectors would you, sort of, rotate to if you are just worried about how  frothy some of those names have gotten.</p><p> ESKANDAR:  So, we love financials, industrials, as you guys mentioned  earlier, and technology.  Those are the three biggest sectors right now in  our fund.  We see these sectors again way more sensitive to the overall  market than some of the others.</p><p> And we think that's where you want to be exposed for this quarter.   Ironically, Energy was the big surprise, second quarter.  I don't think  anyone really called it out.  But it actually outpaced technology, it was a  14 percent surprise gainer versus five percent, I believe, for technology  at the same time.</p><p> So, thinking about sectors -- you know, again, industrials, financials and  technologies, where you want to be right now.</p><p> BELL:  So, you think Energy's over though, because this is going a good  quarter, probably for Energy.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  11 billion-barrels a day --</p><p> BELL:  Prices up 41 percent in the second quarter, so the numbers should be  really good.</p><p> ESKANDAR:  True, but then we saw some pressure on crude and we saw that the  Energy trade slip away.  If we are going to get into a bounce and if we are  going to have a little bit more momentum in the second half of the year, we  don't see Energy right now as the place to be.</p><p> The industrials, financials and technology sectors right now, are  demonstrating to us the highest true beta scores.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You mentioned industrials.  But industrials would be and are the  most vulnerable to this trade fight that we have gotten into, even our  major trading partners with the steel and aluminum tariff, initially, even  the washing machine tariffs early in the year, that kicked in in January.</p><p> Now, we're in this fight.  And so, there is the greatest downside risk in  industrials.  I pointed out Caterpillar in 3M, are down 13 and 14 percent,  respectively, year to date.  And we've got 3M Harley Davidson whirlpool  come out with earnings later this week.</p><p> ESKANDAR:  You know, industrials, obviously, much more sensitive to trade  tariffs and some of the other sectors.  When we look at tariffs at 32  billion, you know, it's not a big piece of the overall economy.  I think  last week with the Trump administration talking about potentially 500  billion.  That's a different -- that's a different ball game.</p><p> So it will be challenged.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did the market react to that at all, because again, it was kind  of a so-so.  </p><p> ESKANDAR:  It flinched.  It flinched a little bit and, you know, it didn't  have a massive move.  And I think, you know, for investors to take some  comfort, the market has become incredibly efficient and resilient.  </p><p> And by that, I mean -- you know, in my 20 plus years of being in this  business, I have seen the market become better and better and better in  distilling information, not getting, you know, actually being able to  differentiate between sensationalism and substance and.  I think we is that  last week.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, what about the sensationalism and or substance of the  President tweeting about the Federal Reserve and the U.S. dollar and other  currencies because, again, Secretary Mnuchin came out and said, well, the  President believes in an independent Federal Reserve.</p><p> But in the past, you know, when you have presidential pressure on the  central bank, it down the road has created some serious problems for the  country and I'm talking about runaway inflation in the 70s.</p><p> ESKANDAR:  Well, Chairman Powell, I think, did a great job with his  testimony last week.  And I think what he demonstrated was a clarity in how  he sees things progressing.  It's very hard to not be optimistic about the  second half of the year, given how tremendous the job market looks right  now.</p><p> And if anything, I think he's doing the President a favor, you know, by  controlling inflation, you get to continue the growth that we're enjoying  right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, maybe the President is -- we will see if the President is  hearing that message because the Wall Street Journal reported that he  picked J Powell over Kevin Marsh and John Taylor because he was told that J  Powell would be more malleable.</p><p> So, again, there is some expectation.  There could be some executive branch  control over the fed, but we will see what happens.  Good to see you,  Alfred.</p><p> ESKANDAR:  Good to be here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Alfred Eskandar, thank you.  And President Trump is tweeting  this morning.  So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and  fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the  DNC, that was knowingly and falsely submitted to FISA and which was  responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller  witch hunt.  </p><p> We will dig into more of that, but, again, those FISA documents released,  they're still redacted but released over the weekend and the President has  been busy tweeting on that note.  And we will discuss it coming up.</p><p> We will also talk about oil, all eyes watching the cost of crude with  global trade worries, the President's threats toward Iran and then we have  x on Mobile and Chevron reporting earnings, later this week.  Busy week for  big oil, we break down on what you need to know.</p><p> Plus, giving moonshine a whole new meaning, there's a new Star Trek vodka  that promises to be out-of-this-world.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Energy in focus, oil prices searching for direction after coming  of their third weekly decline in a row.  Joining us now, the Schork Report  Publisher, Stephen Schork, Stephen, with the President tweeting about Iran,  uses some tough language on that regime, what are you looking at in terms  of driving oil prices today and this week?</p><p> STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  Well, I tell you what, Dagen,  there's nothing like waking up as an oil trader at 4:00 o'clock in the  morning and seeing a tweet storm between Trump and the Muellers, that  certainly going to put a hop in your step right there.  </p><p> That said, I can't imagine what the Iranians are thinking of.  It's as if  they are daring Trump to release barrels from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve.  And I have been talking about this now for the past two months,  actually, since Trump re-enacted the sanctions against Iran.  You got two  big factors that the bulls are counting on right now, Dagen.  </p><p> First and foremost, we had an unplanned outage bitchumen, mining operation  out in Calgary, Canada.  So, imports in Canada, this summer, peak driving  season have just fallen to the floor.  So, a significant amount of barrels,  in fact, over recent five-week stretch, we saw 31 million-barrel decline in  U.S. crude oil stocks.  That's the largest five-week decline we've ever  seen.</p><p> We also have a situation Heating Oil here in New York Harbor which is where  you may take delivery on a NYMEX diesel contract, where we're looking at  supplies given those nor'easters that we saw in March and the yields that  we were seeing from refineries, heating off stocks at the lowest points  since 2000.  So Trump outside of his ego has two very real fundamental  economic justifications for release of the SPR, so the Iranians ought to  trend lightly in this case.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But we've got about 650 million barrels in the SPR right now.   When do you roughly, I think it's a little bit more than that.  Stephen,  when do you -- </p><p> SCHORK:  Yes, something like that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- when do you expect this would happen?  And again, you also  have trade tensions with Canada which is critical and even Mexico, but  Canada which is a critical supplier of oil into the United States.  So,  when do you think this SPR release happens?</p><p> SCHORK:  Well, it's a possibility right there and it's certainly on our  radar.  At this point of the season, and I think your prior guest said that  he's not into energy right now, it's a good thought because right now  demand has peaked right now for crude oil.  We're at the peak crude oil  demand season.  We're at the apogee of the market right now.  And in the  weeks, months ahead, crude oil demand will begin to fall off as we  transition out of the summer.</p><p> And when we look at supply productions at a record all-time, 11 million  barrels a day.  We're also looking at gasoline stocks.  Unlike diesel  stocks, gasoline stocks are one of the highest levels for the month of July  we've ever seen.  So, right now, the demand is falling.  So I think the big  caveat out there, Dagen, is the situation with geopolitics.  Watch your  Twitter accounts and your Twitter feeds, because from a fundamental  standpoint, if we are going to see continued pullback in crude oil prices,  we're at the point, like I said, demand has peak.  It's going to start  falling in the weeks ahead for both crude oil and gasoline.  We're going  into the fall shoulder months, so we're looking at the falling demand,  rising production.</p><p> So the coast is clear for lower prices.  We just have to wait and see and  the one caveat out there, as I said, is the diesel situation in New York  Harbor and, of course, the geopolitical tensions with our friends over in  Tehran.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I will point out in terms of you talking about gasoline  stocks high, demand peaking, the national average for gasoline has been  falling.  It's at $2.84 right now.  That is the current average.  That is  higher than it was a year ago, but that is lower than it was a month ago,  lower than it was a week ago as well.  Lindsey.</p><p> SCHORK:  Absolutely.  I guess what happens -- yes, sorry, I'm sorry.</p><p> BELL:  I was just going say we saw Halliburton numbers came out just now  and they missed pretty significantly.  We saw -- I think it's 41 cents  versus 58 cents expected on the bottom line.  We saw Schlumberger last  week.  It was a pretty decent report.  What are you expecting from the  energy sector as a whole?  I know these are service companies, but what are  you expecting this earning season?</p><p> SCHORK:  Yes.  No, I expect from both an upstream and a downstream.  I'm  expecting another solid quarter coming out of the industry.  We're looking  an industry a year ago where they were hoping for $50 barrel oil to be  sustainable.  A year later we've got 65, 70, $75 oil where the market is  holding.  So, we are significantly higher from an oil perspective.  So  certainly from -- and from the demand perspective.  So all these people who  want to complain, like they think gasoline prices are too high.  Well, if  they're too high, why is demand for gasoline at an all-time high?  So,  obviously gasoline prices are not too high.  It's because the economy is  much stronger.  And the stronger economy leads commodity prices.  Commodity  prices are following the economy and therefore I would expect the earnings  from this industry to follow in accord.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Same story can be said about interest rates too, Stephen, good  to see you, my friend.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.</p><p> SCHORK:  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stephen Schork.</p><p> Coming up, turning the erupting Hawaii volcano into an explosion of cash.   Next, Hawaii's plan to help boost tourism by using the same lava that's  damaging the industry.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Papa John's taking action against its former chairman.  Cheryl  Casone has the details.  Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  The drama continues for Papa John's.  Their board has voted to  adopt a poison pill aimed to preventing John Schnatter from getting a  controlling stake in the company that he founded with just one pizza oven.   That poison pill defense can be used to prevent a hostile takeover.   Schnatter who owns 29 percent stake in Papa John's resigned as chairman  earlier this month after using a racial slur during a conference call.  He  wasn't pressured to resign.  He did so, but things may be changing now.   Shares of Papa John's down eight percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, this is fascinating.  It's images of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, stun  the world.  Once small Hawaii town is hoping it can profit off of lava  tourism.  Big Island businesses are asking for a lava viewing site  somewhere on the island, but authorities haven't found a safe way to do  this.  Pressures mounting from local merchants, tour guides, and others who  have seen the tourism industry completely drop off on the island since  Kilauea began erupting back in May.  It is basically decimating their small  businesses and that small town is right near the volcano.  It's the entry  gate to the volcano in that park.</p><p> And then here is this.  One company boldly going where no man has gone  before and making a Star Trek-inspired space vodka.  It's going to be named  Ten-Forward vodka after the spaceship bar that is featured in Star Trek:  The Next Generation, the T.V. show.  The company says it's going to send a  small batch of vodka into atmosphere using a high altitude balloon to  ensure, quote, \"That every portion of every bottle will contain vodka  officially from space.\"  It will then be blended and bottled here on earth.   The vodka available for preorder for $29.99.  And, yes, Dagen, best Star  Trek clip ever was featured in your reset back at 6:30 this morning.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was very impressed by that.  So a shout-out, apparently it's  going to go into the mesosphere.  You know where the mesosphere is?</p><p> BELL:  I don't know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The region of our atmosphere above the stratosphere and below  the thermosphere.  Between about 30 and 50 miles in altitude.  I know how  to use Google very well.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  I know nautical terms, not space terms.  I can't -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Vodka is vodka, though, isn't it?  I wonder if they're paying  loyalties to the estate of Gene Roddenberry, just asking.  I don't think  it's -- the word start -- yes, USS Enterprise.  I'm sure of that.</p><p> CARTER:  It must be.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, Lee, this is about branding.</p><p> CARTER:  Clearly that's branding.  I mean, this is a total gimmick,  obviously.  But you know what?  We're talking about it and would we be  talking about a vodka launch otherwise?  I don't know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I would argue that Star Trek fans are even more loyal and  serious about their devotion than Star Wars fans.</p><p> CARTER:  Oh, there's no doubt.  There is no doubt.  And people feel  strongly about both.  You feel one way or the other.  But there's no doubt  that Trekkies are more active in their support.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do not insult Star Trek.</p><p> CARTER:  No way.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  More importantly, we don't have vodka right now on the set.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Just to be clear. Just water.  Just water.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thanks, Mitch.  You want me to tell the story about when you  were coming in this morning?  I was like, Mitch, what's on your mind?  And  you're like, I'm still asleep.  He's waking up.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  I'm waking up now.  I'm awake.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The alarming number of millennials tapping into their 401(k)  plans to buy their first home.  The details next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, July 23rd.  Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Earnings and focus.  It would be the busiest week for the second quarter  reporting season.

We send it right over to Dagen McDowell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning ladies, we'll see you both coming up shortly. Good morning everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for second quarter reporting season, one-third of the Dow Industrials and the S&amp;P500 set to post results this week. We'll look at the numbers and guidance and what they all say about the state of the United States economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are showing this this morning, we have slight losses but, again, even a tweak from the president could change all of that. After the close today we get earnings from Alphabet, the parent of Google. Again, that just kicks off a blockbuster week.</p><p>Those markets, those Futures after the major market gauges finish the day on Friday, little change. You had the Dow and S&amp;P were up for the week, but the NASDAQ Composite for the week was slightly lower last week.</p><p>In Europe we have declines across the board to tell you about, the biggest loser there being the CAC Quarante in France down about half of one percent. In Asia overnight some mixed action, the Nikkei in Japan the worst performer of the lot down more than one percent.</p><p>A tragedy in Toronto, a deadly shooting rampage late last night, a gunman killing at least one, injuring more than a dozen others.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I heard at least 20 shots in intervals, you know, clipping, spent, reloading, clipping, spent. I saw at least four people shot her by the fountain.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a street where people walk every day, go to the groceries, have dinner, have an ice cream, sit in a square, enjoy their summer and it's absolutely devastating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We have the latest on the investigation coming up. President Trump takes on Iran, the president issuing a sharp warning in a late night tweet threatening severe consequences if Iran doesn't take a cautious tone with the United States.</p><p>And unexpected change at the top for FiatChrysler, the automaker replacing well-known CEO Sergio Marchionne after he stopped for complications from recent surgery. What the change means for the future of the company.</p><p>And out of this world vodka, Star Trek fans will be able to get a taste space with alcohol inspired by the Starship Enterprise.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell. PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle. And Maslansky &amp; Partners President Lee Carter. We're going to tee up what is going to be an incredible week. One thing we'd left out in the open is we get second quarter GDP, the first reading on how fast this economy is growing, that comes out on Friday.</p><p>We're going to hear from all of these major technology companies and get a sense of what the financial world looks like in the health of the U.S.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Yes. It's going to be a big week for sure. And we're going to finally see what corporate health looks like. Tech sector's going to be very, very strong.</p><p>We've got over 22 percent growth for the second quarter from these tech companies, that is a six quarter in a row for over 21 percent earnings growth. You're looking at the S&amp;P500, earnings growth of 20.8 percent based on S&amp;P capital IQ estimates right now.</p><p>So things are looking good so far, companies are beating on the bottom line, the top line beat rate at 76 percent has come down over the last week.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BELL: We'd like to see that improve a little bit but the dollar's kind of weighing there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, we're going to dig into more of that. You teed it up nicely Lindsey Bell, thank you so much. And then the president's approval rating going up, so we're going to talk about that as well, I can't wait for that.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Such a fascinating topic because who would have thought --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well --</p><p>CARTER: -- based on everything else (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- you know what, the people who believe in his policies are tuning out the noise.</p><p>CARTER: That's right. And that's what we talked about, he got a floor and it's not going to move.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. We're going to talk about that coming up in just a few minutes.</p><p>But first our top story this hour, tech earnings on tap, Futures are searching for a little bit of direction his morning, a start of huge week for corporate earnings. Dow Industrial Futures are down 15 points at the moment.</p><p>Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, all set to report second quarter results this week with Apple -- with Alphabet leading the way today. The parent of Google reporting after the bell. Lindsey, can you dig into these?</p><p>These are the companies that have been driving the performance and I'm going to look up a step that I have on my phone, but how critical will -- just these big name tech companies be?</p><p>BELL: It's going to be huge and what's most -- going to be the most important as is every quarter but especially this quarter, we saw what happened with Netflix guidance.</p><p>Guidance is going to be key, I don't think there's going to be any dispute that this has been a great quarter. Like what you said on Friday, we're going to get an amazing economic GDP number. But I think that what people want to watch is what's happening with the top line and is guidance improving?</p><p>And we have actually seen surprisingly industrial companies raising guidance for the remainder of the year which you would -- a sector that's been impacted by trade.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: This trade in a way as I'm listening to some of those earnings calls, I would have expected using the tariffs as a bit of an excuse. You know, corporate managers often look for something out there, it's a bit of an excuse just to sort of temporary guidance --</p><p>BELL: Absolutely.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: -- and they're not using tariffs, which is quite surprising. You're also not using the tight labor market as an excuse. So that's been sort of interesting.</p><p>BELL: I know. Which is a change in tone from what we've seen previously.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But speaking of the industrial earnings, Honeywell's numbers out on Friday were great . That they had higher sales in profit margins across, I think, all four of their -- it's divisions, that was out on Friday.</p><p>But in terms of trade impact and the tariffs that have gone into effect on steel and aluminum, the retaliation from major trading partners, Canada, Mexico and even China, we're going to get earnings this week from TRIUM, Harley-Davidson, and Whirlpool.</p><p>So, again, you're going to have to decide Mitch whether they're using maybe the trade dispute as an excuse or if it's having a legitimate impact on business here.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And we'll see -- we'll see -- if it's the guidance, you don't know. But if it's impacting second quarter earnings then it's not an excuse, it's reality. So we'll see then.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So industrial stocks actually are down two percent year-to-date while the S&amp;P500 is up nearly five percent. And there are some stocks that are in, well, the toilet.</p><p>Caterpillar is down 14 -- 13 percent, 3M is down 14 percent year-to-date. And also Alcoa had -- has had a major selloff in recent days.</p><p>BELL: Right. Alcoa you saw the tariffs impacting their business with aluminum. They bring a lot of it in from Canada, so they -- they're saying every month they expect a 12 to 14 million dollar hit to the profitability of the company.</p><p>This is definitely a huge -- the big question I think when you think about the industrial company is, are they pulling this business forward ahead of the tariffs going into effect? And so that's why the second quarter is significantly better than expected.</p><p>The industrial sector has been in the toilet like you said. The fourth worth performing sector of all 11, but the stocks are reacting very, very positively to this news. On average, the companies that have reported so far have moved up two and a half percentage points versus the S&amp;P500 up 1.6. Last quarter, stocks weren't reacting to earnings at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's great news. And I was just going to -- what I was pulling up on my phone, it's not -- I'm not ignoring you. I'm not -- I'm not texting -- I'm not texting with my mother.</p><p>But if you look at just last week, they were -- of the major technology stocks, there were only two that were lower out, Netflix was -- fell off a cliff --</p><p>BELL: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- it was down nine percent because of that miss, partially to blame its own guidance. And then Alphabet was down going into this earnings report, half of one percent last week. But, again, Microsoft is out with earnings, number one Dow stock and is -- hit an all-time high on Friday I believe.</p><p>BELL: And that bodes well for Alphabet because they're in the cloud business, to the third largest cloud provider. We want to see tonight how those numbers look.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The economy a big part of republican plans to retain control of the House. Here's what House Major Whip Steve Scalise told Maria on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: The plans to continue focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth and then locking it in. We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes, we're going to make the tax cuts permanent.</p><p>That bill, Chairman Brady and his committee are already working on. We just did a jobs 3.0 bill, a bill to provide more regulatory relief and do some more things that will help create more jobs and rebuild the middle class.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: This comes as a new Wall Street Journal NBC News Poll found that half of registered voters approve of President Trump's handling on the economy. His highest mark on that question in the survey.</p><p>And also president's overall approval rating did inch up a little bit. Lee, what do you make of that?</p><p>CARTER: So I think it's really, really fascinating to say that the president's job approval rating was the highest it's been after a lot of people said they did not approve of his handling of the meeting with Putin, that was over 68 percent of people, so they did not approve of that.</p><p>But the bottom line is this, when you look at Trump's handling of the economy, 50 percent of Americans approve of it, 34 percent don't. People feel that it's in their pocketbooks, they're seeing the markets rise, they're seeing their 401(k) balances go up, they're feeling better more optimistic, they're seeing jobs, more opportunities for themselves.</p><p>So, even when these things happen, even when, you know, the president makes comments that makes everybody uncomfortable after he did -- as he did in Helsinki. The more hysterical people get, the more upset, the more that they go after him, the more his face is short up, and the more people go, \"You know what though, I'm still feeling better economically.\"</p><p>And that is why people go to the polls. Russia is down there, I think number 16 as far as issues that are most important to the American people right now. And so I think what the democrats need to do, if they want to win this in November is they've got to come up with a message that is going to counter anything that the president's doing in the economy.</p><p>And I think that's why we're seeing a rise in the socialist movement because people are saying, \"Here are some in it. If we're going to do this it's going to make life better for you. We're going to give you jobs, we're going to give you foreign income, we're going to get healthcare for all.\"</p><p>That's the message that gets people excited whether we want to -- and we can have a debate on that. But just going after the president and saying that he's the worst thing that's ever happen and really getting hysterical about it, that's not going to work for the democrats. And I think if that's the way that they're going to approach November, they're going to have big problems.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, again, it comes down to in terms of this democratic socialist message or whatever you want to call them these days, it comes down to how you're going to pay for it. And that's one thing that does hit people in the pocketbook.</p><p>That's by the president's tweets about the Federal Reserve last week, it did resonate with people. Like it or not, I mean we kind of worry about the president interfering in what is so-called independent Federal Reserve but, again, people -- that -- people understand that.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Well what's interesting and sort of to Lee's point, I think at the end of the day, the average voter isn't a creature of the new cycle like the four of us are, OK? They're not really paying attention to a lot of it and they really focus on making ends meet, providing for their family, and if they feel better about that, I think it's going to show up in the polls.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I did want to point out Lee that -- because we were talking about it, the president's overall approval rating did end higher in that poll. It ends up to 45 percent. And, again, buoyed by strong support within his base, within the republican base.</p><p>CARTER: That's right. See, that I think as much as there where things that went wrong in Helsinki, there's also things a lot of optimism on the republicans by Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court appointment. I think people are feeling strong support there and I think that is really helping the president right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that's what the republicans and particularly the Senate, they're showing resistance to this Tax cuts 2.0 that the House is pushing. Ultimately it falls on the Senate to make sure that Kavanaugh is approved and voted on to the Supreme Court --</p><p>CARTER: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- by the midterm elections. And then what -- we have another Putin visit potentially in the fall, so we'll see how that goes.</p><p>CARTER: Rise on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. We'll see how that goes just in time for the midterm. Coming up, tragedy in Toronto, at least one person dead, more than a dozen hurt after a mass shooting. We have the latest as police investigate the motive behind the brazen attack.</p><p>And shifting gears at FiatChrysler, Mike Manley taking over the CEO job as Sergio Marchionne suffers a sudden health crisis, the details next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A mass shooting in Toronto, Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well Dagen, good morning. A frightening scene after a gunman killed at least one person and injured at least 13 others including a young girl.</p><p>During the rampage, the suspect later killed at that scene, it happened at the Toronto neighborhood known as Greek Town.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK SAUNDERS, TORONTO POLICE CHIEF: Shortly after 10:00p.m. what happened was the police responded to a 911 call for sounds of gunshots. A young girl is in critical state right now and the other 13 are in the hospital and being treated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well investigators are trying to find a motive and police say they would not rule out terrorism.</p><p>Well, stunning news, and a change at the top for FiatChrysler breaking over the weekend, its longtime CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced. Marchionne underwent shoulder surgery about three weeks ago but his condition has since worsened according to the company.</p><p>Now Mike Manley who runs the Jeep SUV and RAM truck division is the new CEO. Shares of FiatChrysler we should say are lower on this news. Sergio, of course, as stunning force for the company, down three percent in the premarket as you can see.</p><p>And then there was a new record set at the box office this weekend, eight of the top ten movies were sequels. And the top spot went to a surprise upset.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They killed my friend. (INAUDIBLE) in everyone of them and the only disappointment is that I only get to do it once.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well Sony's \"The Equalizer 2\" starring Denzel Washington brought in $35.8 million. Equalizer narrowly beat another sequel, Universal's \"Mama Mia Here We Go Again\" which made $34.4 million which beat the original film by the way by about seven million bucks, pretty good.</p><p>Taking third, Sony's \"Hotel Transylvania III\" with $23.3 million. Rounding up top five, \"Ant Man and the Wasp\" and \"Incredibles 2\" Dagen. Feel free to have \"Mama Mia\" stuck in your head for the rest of the morning as I do right at this moment.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know why it beat the original?</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One word, Cher.</p><p>CASONE: Cher. Got you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There you go.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just despite her craziness on Twitter, I can't even -- she speaks a language of her own on Twitter. But --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: This is a business program, so I'd like to know how much ABBA gets every time there's a -- one of those movies, \"Mama Mia\" movies.</p><p>BELL: Oh yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well I think we'll -- we will put the burden on you Mitch Roscelle.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. I'm going to start Googling -- I'm a -- I ask a question, research the results. All right.</p><p>CARTER: And theory.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BELL: I saw the show on Broadway and it was absolutely phenomenal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So this is the -- this is the sequel.</p><p>BELL: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So if Meryl Streep is still in -- this is the sequel to the original film. So, again, ABBA who would have thought?</p><p>Coming up, war of words with Iran, President Trump ramping up the tough talk as sanctions on the country are reinstated next week and after he dumped the Obama Era nuclear deal. The stern threat, next.</p><p>And now you can have vodka from the final frontier, find out how you can throwback a cocktail made with just a hint of the extra-terrestrial.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Escalating tensions with Iran, President Trump calling out Iran's president after the leader said U.S. policies toward the country could lead to the \"mother of all wars\" with Iran.</p><p>In a tweet last night the president wrote, \"To Iranian President Rouhani, never ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death, be cautious.\" All caps.</p><p>This coming as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling out Iran's religious leaders and address plans to re-impose economic sanctions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The Ayatollahs are in on the act too. Judging by their best, well they seem more concerned with riches than religion. These hypocritical (INAUDIBLE) all kinds of crooked schemes to become some of the wealthiest men on earth while their people suffer.</p><p>Right now the United States is undertaking a diplomatic and financial pressure campaign to cut off the funds that the regime uses to enrich itself and support death and destruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining us the Editorial Director for the Washington Examiner, Hugo Gurdon. Hugo, your take on this?</p><p>HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: You know, President Trump is reminding the Iranians that things don't go well when those countries threaten the United States.</p><p>Your viewers probably remember that Saddam Hussein promised the mother of all battles against the United States but he was crying uncle after three weeks o the first Gulf War and he was dead after the second.</p><p>What you're really hearing is the fact that the Iranians are feeling the strain of the end of the deal that President Obama put in place. The United States, Israel, and some Arab countries are really putting pressure on Iran to undermine it throughout the region and the peeps have started to squeak.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you think that we get a new deal because, again, we're -- new sanctions will go into place, I think it starts next month.</p><p>There's the issue about Europe, but partly few American companies really stepped up to begin doing business in a significant way in Iran after that nuclear deal from President Obama because it was not ratified as a treaty and they assumed that the next president because it could be a republican would pull out of it and sure enough, that's what happened.</p><p>GURDON: Right. Well American companies did not but the European countries certainly have. But, you know, the European countries going to have to make the calculation, do they want to do business with the Iranian economy or do they want to do business with the much, much bigger American economy? It's hardly a choice at all.</p><p>They are going to have to adjust, they're going to have to start scaling back and ending business and, of course, there are the oil -- there's the question of oil exports. It's that that could mean as much as $1 trillion of losses, loss revenue to the Iranians over the course of the next 10 years.</p><p>This is really, really serious problems for the Iranians that the Mullahs have losing support from the country, the country is fed up with their theocracy. And as I say, you know, the allies, the United States, Israel, and countries like Saudi Arabia are increasing pressure to try and undermine the Iranian Regime.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Hugo, Mitch Roschelle. And Dagen made reference to it in terms of whether or not there's a new deal. If there was some sort of new deal, what would the foundation of that deal be? Obviously be much different than the deal in the past but is there sort of a rubric or a framework for what a deal would look like?</p><p>GURDON: It seems to me that -- I mean, this obviously as to some extent a speculation at this point. It doesn't seem to me that there's a deal that can be done with the Iranians, you know, in the way that the -- that Obama Administration did.</p><p>I mean, the last thing that this administration wants to do is to cement the Iranian Regime in place. I don't know that there's any deal that could be done which was acceptable to this country and acceptable to Iran. I mean, that's something we're going to have to read about and see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was going to -- just to clarify Hugo, I said the first sanctions are set to be -- take place next month, it's actually on August the 4th. So it's coming up shortly, followed by the measures that will target Iranian oil, that begins to happen on November 4th.</p><p>That's why it's so critical that the United States has a growing oil supply that we're increasingly energy independent or heading toward that.</p><p>GURDON: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're the biggest exporter in the world of refine petroleum product and that --</p><p>GURDON: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- gives us an incredible amount of leverage over someone like Russia and its partner in crime Iran.</p><p>GURDON: Exactly. So, the United States became the biggest energy producer. I think more than a year ago it's now the biggest oil producer as well, it's overtaking Saudi Arabia.</p><p>This gives it leverage all over the world. For example, President Trump in Europe just a week or so ago pressing Germany on the gas pipeline from Russia, putting pressure on them to buy energy from the United States.</p><p>The United States has a much greater ability than it has ever had to control the price of oil and that's the way it can really squeeze the Iranians.</p><p>BELL: But then there was also the report that we were going to give some of our allies in Europe a pass on purchasing oil from Iran, is that still on the table because I've heard stories both ways?</p><p>GURDON: Yes. You know, I've hears stories both ways too. You know, there's also -- it's also being said that, \"No, the November deadline is a deadline and the Europeans are going to have to fall into line.\"</p><p>And the closer we get to that deadline the more likely it is that the Europeans are going to have to scramble to get themselves in position. They don't want to lose business, they don't want to any sanctions that prevent their access to the American market. The Iranian market is much, much smaller.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And all of this surely will be discussed with Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission who's visiting the White House on Wednesday of this week because in recent months the -- Europe has been talking about exploring activating accounts for the Iranian Central Bank to basically keep this agreement alive. So there's much to discuss in terms of Iran in Europe.</p><p>GURDON: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hugo, thank you for being here. It's great to see you as always.</p><p>GURDON: Thanks so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hugo Gurdon. Coming up, pizza fight, the board of Papa John's is going to extremes to prevent the company's founder from gaining controlling interest after stepping down for using a racial epitaph. We've got the details on the so-called poison pill.</p><p>And turning nature's wrath into a tourist destination, Hawaii's plan to help boost tourism by using the same lava that's damaging the industry.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern. Earning season in full swing, one-third of the Dow and S&amp;P 500 later to post results, this week.</p><p>Checking market action this morning, we have Futures are slightly lower across the board, but much news is coming down the pipeline to move those markets, 19-point loss on Dow Futures, right now. On Friday, all three major market gauges finished the day, little change. It was still an up week for the Dow and S&amp;P.</p><p>In Europe, we have declines across the board, in England, France and Germany, stocks selling off in just a bit. The biggest loser is the CAC Quarante in France, down half of one percent. In Asia overnight, markets closing mixed. The Nikkei in Japan and the KOSPI in South Korea, both lower.</p><p>A board room battle heating up. Why Papa John's board members are adopting a poison pill to stop its founder from gaining controlling stake in the pizza chain. That's ahead.</p><p>Plus, Hawaii is working to bring business back after volcanic eruptions displaced residents. How the state could start a lava tourism business, later this hour. And a new alcohol is taking inspiration from Star Trek.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Captain Scott is unaware of the existence of Synthehol.</p><p>CAPTAIN SCOTT: Synthehol?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir. It is an alcohol substitute, now being served aboard star ships. It simulates the appearance, taste and smell of alcohol, but the intoxicating effects can be easily dismissed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Details of new liquor that contains vodka from space and also an award to the producer who located that clip from Star Trek generation. But to our top story this half hour, technology in focus, among the big names reporting earnings today, Google's parent company, Alphabet, less than a week after the company was hit with a record five billion-dollar fine by the E.U.</p><p>Our next guest is, there's opportunity here, joining me now is Alfred Eskandar, CEO of Salt Financial, Alfred, good to see you.</p><p>ALFRED ESKANDAR, CEO, SALT FINANCIAL: Good morning, good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good to see you. What are you expecting from Alphabet today?</p><p>ESKANDAR: We're pretty excited about Google's earnings today. And we think</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, just call (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>ESKANDAR: We think it has shown a lot more life lately. It has gone from what we viewed as a very calm stock only rising about 1.1 percent more than the S&amp;P for the first few months to now, actually showing a whole lot more sensitivity and what we really look for are stocks and sectors that are sensitive to the overall market because we think that's where investors can get an edge.</p><p>BELL: Well, volatility, really, when we enter this year, it's just been a theme, it's been returned to the market and I think a lot of individual investors have had a hard time dealing with that.</p><p>But the good news about that is it resulted in a decoupling of individual securities from the actual overall market, how do you take advantage of that and is tech the biggest place that you can take advantage of it?</p><p>ESKANDAR: Well, tech has really been the big story all year. In fact, if you look at its performance, it's up around 50 percent, year to date, versus, what, five percent for the S&amp;P, so -- but if you're going to have a broader market rally, other sectors need to participate as well.</p><p>Volatility as you mentioned, has spiked up this year. Certainly, we all remember February. But if you look at last year, we all kind of fell asleep. Volatility was incredibly low. The market was tremendously resilient and just showed no sign of slowing down or going down.</p><p>This year, volatility has returned a little bit more to normal, I believe (INAUDIBLE) around 12, 13 right now. Normally, it's actually around 17. So, we are still somewhat calm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where do you think is the greatest risk in terms of even if you just want to look at industries that are overpriced right for volatility? I was just looking at how these big tech stocks perform month to date, and Alphabet going into this earnings report is still up six percent.</p><p>It's not up as much say, a Facebook, an Amazon or even a Microsoft, Microsoft is up closer to eight percent, but it's still got a really nice fat gain on in for the month.</p><p>ESKANDAR: Well, you know, it's interesting that you mention Facebook, that's also going to report later on, I believe it's on Wednesday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Amazon, later on the week.</p><p>ESKANDAR: And Amazon. But just focusing on Facebook for a second, the thing that's important for investors, particularly retail, you know, there's only three ways to make money in the market, your selection, your timing and your overall allocation.</p><p>And Facebook has been a relatively calm stock, believe it or not, I mean, it had a little bit of an issue in February -- in March, I believe, it brushed it off, hit new highs. But it's not moving as much with the market.</p><p>And that's what we look for in terms of giving an edge back to investors to basically participate more in the up rally.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Alfred, if you want to, sort of, look beyond the big tech names who've clearly driving the S&amp;P, where are the places in the S&amp;P 500, what sectors would you, sort of, rotate to if you are just worried about how frothy some of those names have gotten.</p><p>ESKANDAR: So, we love financials, industrials, as you guys mentioned earlier, and technology. Those are the three biggest sectors right now in our fund. We see these sectors again way more sensitive to the overall market than some of the others.</p><p>And we think that's where you want to be exposed for this quarter. Ironically, Energy was the big surprise, second quarter. I don't think anyone really called it out. But it actually outpaced technology, it was a 14 percent surprise gainer versus five percent, I believe, for technology at the same time.</p><p>So, thinking about sectors -- you know, again, industrials, financials and technologies, where you want to be right now.</p><p>BELL: So, you think Energy's over though, because this is going a good quarter, probably for Energy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: 11 billion-barrels a day --</p><p>BELL: Prices up 41 percent in the second quarter, so the numbers should be really good.</p><p>ESKANDAR: True, but then we saw some pressure on crude and we saw that the Energy trade slip away. If we are going to get into a bounce and if we are going to have a little bit more momentum in the second half of the year, we don't see Energy right now as the place to be.</p><p>The industrials, financials and technology sectors right now, are demonstrating to us the highest true beta scores.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You mentioned industrials. But industrials would be and are the most vulnerable to this trade fight that we have gotten into, even our major trading partners with the steel and aluminum tariff, initially, even the washing machine tariffs early in the year, that kicked in in January.</p><p>Now, we're in this fight. And so, there is the greatest downside risk in industrials. I pointed out Caterpillar in 3M, are down 13 and 14 percent, respectively, year to date. And we've got 3M Harley Davidson whirlpool come out with earnings later this week.</p><p>ESKANDAR: You know, industrials, obviously, much more sensitive to trade tariffs and some of the other sectors. When we look at tariffs at 32 billion, you know, it's not a big piece of the overall economy. I think last week with the Trump administration talking about potentially 500 billion. That's a different -- that's a different ball game.</p><p>So it will be challenged.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did the market react to that at all, because again, it was kind of a so-so.</p><p>ESKANDAR: It flinched. It flinched a little bit and, you know, it didn't have a massive move. And I think, you know, for investors to take some comfort, the market has become incredibly efficient and resilient.</p><p>And by that, I mean -- you know, in my 20 plus years of being in this business, I have seen the market become better and better and better in distilling information, not getting, you know, actually being able to differentiate between sensationalism and substance and. I think we is that last week.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, what about the sensationalism and or substance of the President tweeting about the Federal Reserve and the U.S. dollar and other currencies because, again, Secretary Mnuchin came out and said, well, the President believes in an independent Federal Reserve.</p><p>But in the past, you know, when you have presidential pressure on the central bank, it down the road has created some serious problems for the country and I'm talking about runaway inflation in the 70s.</p><p>ESKANDAR: Well, Chairman Powell, I think, did a great job with his testimony last week. And I think what he demonstrated was a clarity in how he sees things progressing. It's very hard to not be optimistic about the second half of the year, given how tremendous the job market looks right now.</p><p>And if anything, I think he's doing the President a favor, you know, by controlling inflation, you get to continue the growth that we're enjoying right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, maybe the President is -- we will see if the President is hearing that message because the Wall Street Journal reported that he picked J Powell over Kevin Marsh and John Taylor because he was told that J Powell would be more malleable.</p><p>So, again, there is some expectation. There could be some executive branch control over the fed, but we will see what happens. Good to see you, Alfred.</p><p>ESKANDAR: Good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Alfred Eskandar, thank you. And President Trump is tweeting this morning. So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly and falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller witch hunt.</p><p>We will dig into more of that, but, again, those FISA documents released, they're still redacted but released over the weekend and the President has been busy tweeting on that note. And we will discuss it coming up.</p><p>We will also talk about oil, all eyes watching the cost of crude with global trade worries, the President's threats toward Iran and then we have x on Mobile and Chevron reporting earnings, later this week. Busy week for big oil, we break down on what you need to know.</p><p>Plus, giving moonshine a whole new meaning, there's a new Star Trek vodka that promises to be out-of-this-world.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Energy in focus, oil prices searching for direction after coming of their third weekly decline in a row. Joining us now, the Schork Report Publisher, Stephen Schork, Stephen, with the President tweeting about Iran, uses some tough language on that regime, what are you looking at in terms of driving oil prices today and this week?</p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, FOUNDER, THE SCHORK REPORT: Well, I tell you what, Dagen, there's nothing like waking up as an oil trader at 4:00 o'clock in the morning and seeing a tweet storm between Trump and the Muellers, that certainly going to put a hop in your step right there.</p><p>That said, I can't imagine what the Iranians are thinking of. It's as if they are daring Trump to release barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And I have been talking about this now for the past two months, actually, since Trump re-enacted the sanctions against Iran. You got two big factors that the bulls are counting on right now, Dagen.</p><p>First and foremost, we had an unplanned outage bitchumen, mining operation out in Calgary, Canada. So, imports in Canada, this summer, peak driving season have just fallen to the floor. So, a significant amount of barrels, in fact, over recent five-week stretch, we saw 31 million-barrel decline in U.S. crude oil stocks. That's the largest five-week decline we've ever seen.</p><p>We also have a situation Heating Oil here in New York Harbor which is where you may take delivery on a NYMEX diesel contract, where we're looking at supplies given those nor'easters that we saw in March and the yields that we were seeing from refineries, heating off stocks at the lowest points since 2000. So Trump outside of his ego has two very real fundamental economic justifications for release of the SPR, so the Iranians ought to trend lightly in this case.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we've got about 650 million barrels in the SPR right now. When do you roughly, I think it's a little bit more than that. Stephen, when do you --</p><p>SCHORK: Yes, something like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- when do you expect this would happen? And again, you also have trade tensions with Canada which is critical and even Mexico, but Canada which is a critical supplier of oil into the United States. So, when do you think this SPR release happens?</p><p>SCHORK: Well, it's a possibility right there and it's certainly on our radar. At this point of the season, and I think your prior guest said that he's not into energy right now, it's a good thought because right now demand has peaked right now for crude oil. We're at the peak crude oil demand season. We're at the apogee of the market right now. And in the weeks, months ahead, crude oil demand will begin to fall off as we transition out of the summer.</p><p>And when we look at supply productions at a record all-time, 11 million barrels a day. We're also looking at gasoline stocks. Unlike diesel stocks, gasoline stocks are one of the highest levels for the month of July we've ever seen. So, right now, the demand is falling. So I think the big caveat out there, Dagen, is the situation with geopolitics. Watch your Twitter accounts and your Twitter feeds, because from a fundamental standpoint, if we are going to see continued pullback in crude oil prices, we're at the point, like I said, demand has peak. It's going to start falling in the weeks ahead for both crude oil and gasoline. We're going into the fall shoulder months, so we're looking at the falling demand, rising production.</p><p>So the coast is clear for lower prices. We just have to wait and see and the one caveat out there, as I said, is the diesel situation in New York Harbor and, of course, the geopolitical tensions with our friends over in Tehran.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I will point out in terms of you talking about gasoline stocks high, demand peaking, the national average for gasoline has been falling. It's at $2.84 right now. That is the current average. That is higher than it was a year ago, but that is lower than it was a month ago, lower than it was a week ago as well. Lindsey.</p><p>SCHORK: Absolutely. I guess what happens -- yes, sorry, I'm sorry.</p><p>BELL: I was just going say we saw Halliburton numbers came out just now and they missed pretty significantly. We saw -- I think it's 41 cents versus 58 cents expected on the bottom line. We saw Schlumberger last week. It was a pretty decent report. What are you expecting from the energy sector as a whole? I know these are service companies, but what are you expecting this earning season?</p><p>SCHORK: Yes. No, I expect from both an upstream and a downstream. I'm expecting another solid quarter coming out of the industry. We're looking an industry a year ago where they were hoping for $50 barrel oil to be sustainable. A year later we've got 65, 70, $75 oil where the market is holding. So, we are significantly higher from an oil perspective. So certainly from -- and from the demand perspective. So all these people who want to complain, like they think gasoline prices are too high. Well, if they're too high, why is demand for gasoline at an all-time high? So, obviously gasoline prices are not too high. It's because the economy is much stronger. And the stronger economy leads commodity prices. Commodity prices are following the economy and therefore I would expect the earnings from this industry to follow in accord.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Same story can be said about interest rates too, Stephen, good to see you, my friend. Thank you so much. Thank you.</p><p>SCHORK: Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stephen Schork.</p><p>Coming up, turning the erupting Hawaii volcano into an explosion of cash. Next, Hawaii's plan to help boost tourism by using the same lava that's damaging the industry.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Papa John's taking action against its former chairman. Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: The drama continues for Papa John's. Their board has voted to adopt a poison pill aimed to preventing John Schnatter from getting a controlling stake in the company that he founded with just one pizza oven. That poison pill defense can be used to prevent a hostile takeover. Schnatter who owns 29 percent stake in Papa John's resigned as chairman earlier this month after using a racial slur during a conference call. He wasn't pressured to resign. He did so, but things may be changing now. Shares of Papa John's down eight percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, this is fascinating. It's images of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, stun the world. Once small Hawaii town is hoping it can profit off of lava tourism. Big Island businesses are asking for a lava viewing site somewhere on the island, but authorities haven't found a safe way to do this. Pressures mounting from local merchants, tour guides, and others who have seen the tourism industry completely drop off on the island since Kilauea began erupting back in May. It is basically decimating their small businesses and that small town is right near the volcano. It's the entry gate to the volcano in that park.</p><p>And then here is this. One company boldly going where no man has gone before and making a Star Trek-inspired space vodka. It's going to be named Ten-Forward vodka after the spaceship bar that is featured in Star Trek: The Next Generation, the T.V. show. The company says it's going to send a small batch of vodka into atmosphere using a high altitude balloon to ensure, quote, \"That every portion of every bottle will contain vodka officially from space.\" It will then be blended and bottled here on earth. The vodka available for preorder for $29.99. And, yes, Dagen, best Star Trek clip ever was featured in your reset back at 6:30 this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was very impressed by that. So a shout-out, apparently it's going to go into the mesosphere. You know where the mesosphere is?</p><p>BELL: I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The region of our atmosphere above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. Between about 30 and 50 miles in altitude. I know how to use Google very well.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I know nautical terms, not space terms. I can't --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Vodka is vodka, though, isn't it? I wonder if they're paying loyalties to the estate of Gene Roddenberry, just asking. I don't think it's -- the word start -- yes, USS Enterprise. I'm sure of that.</p><p>CARTER: It must be.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, Lee, this is about branding.</p><p>CARTER: Clearly that's branding. I mean, this is a total gimmick, obviously. But you know what? We're talking about it and would we be talking about a vodka launch otherwise? I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I would argue that Star Trek fans are even more loyal and serious about their devotion than Star Wars fans.</p><p>CARTER: Oh, there's no doubt. There is no doubt. And people feel strongly about both. You feel one way or the other. But there's no doubt that Trekkies are more active in their support.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do not insult Star Trek.</p><p>CARTER: No way.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: More importantly, we don't have vodka right now on the set.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Just to be clear. Just water. Just water.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thanks, Mitch. You want me to tell the story about when you were coming in this morning? I was like, Mitch, what's on your mind? And you're like, I'm still asleep. He's waking up.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I'm waking up now. I'm awake.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The alarming number of millennials tapping into their 401(k) plans to buy their first home. The details next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, July 23rd.

Today, it was 3Com (COMS:Nasdaq), and then shortly after, Motorola (MOT:NYSE) delivered some bad news.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Motorola is getting killed by tough year-over-year comparisons,\" says Charles DiSanza, an analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison, which downgraded the stock last week from a buy to a hold.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One observation from this week: It looks as if preannouncement season is coming earlier and nastier than in previous quarters. Last quarter, remember, Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq) gave up the bad news in the second week of December. Here in the first week of March investors have had to slog through ugly pre-earnings news from big tech stocks such as Texas Instruments (TXN:NYSE), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD:NYSE) and, of course, Intel (INTC:Nasdaq). And earnings season -- the ridge on the other side of this investing valley -- is still a good month away.\u00a0</p><p>Motorola has always played an enigmatic, secretive role on Wall Street. By preannouncing, it makes a normally fuzzy picture more obtuse. DiSanza, who was one of the lowest on the Street for Motorola's March quarter at 45 cents, says he will be burning the midnight oil trying to figure out a more accurate number. \"If you need a number right now, I'd have to say we're going to come down to 40 cents,\" says DiSanza. First Call consensus estimates were for 47 cents, but should fall significantly Friday morning. This morning Intel's consensus earnings expectations for the first quarter plunged from more than 90 cents a share to around 71 cents a share after the company warned of slowing growth.\u00a0</p><p>DiSanza says that he figured the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics company wasn't going to meet expectations based purely on last year's numbers. \"For the first two quarters this year, Motorola is coming up against some tough comparisons,\" he says, pointing specifically to the company's posting 34% gross margins in 1997's first quarter. In the fourth quarter, gross margins had dropped to 32%. \"If you combine that with a decrease in semiconductor demand and the Asian problem, you have a company primed to miss expectations.\"\u00a0</p><p>The Gerard Klauer analyst believes, however, that the company's \"less than wonderful\" second half last year will give it much easier comparisons down the line. \"I fully expect to be recommending Motorola once again in July.\"\u00a0</p><p>Investors working Motorola options got exactly what they were expecting today. Smart, or maybe just lucky, money chased Motorola's March 55 puts (\"doubles,\" in floor lingo). Volume on that contract cracked 7,000, compared with open interest of just 5,671, showing fresh demand at that strike price. The value of the March 55s climbed 3/8 ($37.50) to 1 1/8 ($112.50). The March 60 puts posted volume of 3,926, while no Motorola call series broke the 700-contract mark. Puts give investors the right to sell a company's shares at a specified price before the third Friday in the contract month.\u00a0</p><p>For 3Com, the problems may become more serious than weaker margins. Its earning problems stemmed from accounting irregularities. 3Com revised its historical earnings after talking with the Securities and Exchange Commission about how to account for its pooling merger with U.S. Robotics.\u00a0</p><p>CFO Chris Paisley declined to describe the company's conversations with federal securities regulators, when analysts prodded him in a conference call Thursday evening. The SEC, he said, is waiting for 3Com to register amended documents.\u00a0</p><p>The changes will slash charges to earnings for the combined company in the first fiscal quarter ended Aug. 31. 3Com will take a restructuring charge of $270 million, instead of $426 million as previously estimated. Three factors turned out differently than expected: product swapouts, the elimination of duplicate facilities, and goodwill writeoffs for prior acquisitions by USRX.\u00a0</p><p>Accordingly, the first-quarter loss shrank to 15 cents per share from 43 cents per share.\u00a0</p><p>However, earnings for fiscal 1997 were trimmed to $500.5 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, from $597.6 million, or $1.69 per diluted share. 3Com readjusted the timing of the U.S. Robotics period it included. (As originally posted, this story incorrectly said 3Com readjusted the timing of its old fiscal year.) The new combined results include the 12 months ended May 1997 for 3Com and July 1996 through May 1997 for USRX, and then include USRX's March 1997 a second time. Wall Street might not appreciate the confusion.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's not a reflection of their business going forward,\" says one analyst with a buy on the stock who requested anonymity. But such bullishness may not last. Many Street watchers worry that 3Com has severely harmed its credibility with the cloudy accounting.\u00a0</p><p>3Com reports earnings for the fiscal quarter ended Feb. 28 later this month. A First Call survey expects 14 cents per diluted share.\u00a0</p><p>Options players seemed to have been caught a little off-guard by 3Com's announcement. Trading today was concentrated in the March 35 calls, where volume reached 3,065 contracts. Volume on the other side of the aisle -- the March 35 puts -- was 1,257, but the price popped 13/16 ($81.25) to 1 1/2 ($150).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#12877#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3X4K-B9D0-00MP-T1K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 1998 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>March 5, 1998 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>\u00a0INTEL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>\u00a0HP INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>\u00a0ORACLE CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>MSI (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>\u00a0INTC (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>\u00a0HPQ (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0AMD (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0AMD (FRA)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>\u00a0ORCL (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>\u00a0TXN (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS334220 RADIO &amp;

This forecast marks a sharp rebound from a drop of 3.2 percent just a year ago, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.<br/>Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note that the information technology sector \"appears to be the most undervalued sector,\" giving investors more reasons to be bullish on tech stocks.<br/> The implied earnings-per-share growth for the tech sector has been 5.4 percentage points above the SP 500 on average over the past 10 years, but it is now just 1.0 percentage point above the benchmark index, according to the Goldman Sachs note.<br/> While the Dow Jones industrial average and the SP 500 have hit record highs recently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is still more than 700 points away from its all-time intraday high on March 10, 2000, suggesting to some investors that the sector may have more room to the upside.<br/> The tech sector's earnings are \"going to certainly be important because the market started to gain momentum as economic data got better,\" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, which is based in Newark, New Jersey.<br/> \"We want to hear good solid numbers and if we get that from tech names, it will help.\"<br/> Nine of the 13 sub-industries in the tech sector are expected to report higher earnings than a year ago, with semiconductors and semiconductor equipment having the highest growth rates within the sector, according to Thomson Reuters data.<br/> The Nasdaq is up 5.7 percent for the year, while the semiconductor index is up 20.3 percent.<br/> BIG BANKS IN THE SPOTLIGHT<br/> Among the 10 SP 500 sectors, financials have the worst earnings forecast with a decline of 3.5 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Nine of the sector's 21 sub-industries are expected to post a drop in earnings.<br/> Earnings from some of major banks next week will include JPMorgan Chase Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday; Bank of America Corp on Wednesday and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.<br/> Analysts are expecting subdued results because a slowdown in revenue from mortgage refinancing and trading is offsetting gains from other areas like investment banking and money management. Higher legal, regulatory and compliance costs are also weighing on results.<br/>Wells Fargo Co on Friday underscored some of those problems as the largest U.S. mortgage lender reported a 39 percent decline in revenue from that business.<br/> In addition to keeping a close watch on earnings, Wall Street will also tune in next week to what Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen says when she makes a couple of trips to Capitol Hill. She is scheduled to testify on the U.S. central bank's monetary policy in a semi-annual appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.<br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IBTX10876714051334517522682100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CMY-VFF1-JCMN-Y566-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><timeReceived>2:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 12, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002EUA</classCode><className>THOMSON REUTERS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002E8X</classCode><className>EBAY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0001T6V</classCode><className>YAHOO!

If this is his harrowing warning, then why do Silicon Valley C.E.O.s love him so?</p><p>  ''One possibility is that my message is not threatening to them, and so they embrace it?'' a puzzled Mr. Harari said one afternoon in October. ''For me, that's more worrying. Maybe I'm missing something?''</p><p>  When Mr. Harari toured the Bay Area this fall to promote his latest book, the reception was incongruously joyful. <person><nameText>Reed Hastings, </nameText></person>the chief executive of Netflix, threw him a dinner party. The leaders of X, Alphabet's secretive research division, invited Mr. Harari over. Bill Gates reviewed the book (''Fascinating'' and ''such a stimulating writer'') in The New York Times.</p><p>  ''I'm interested in how Silicon Valley can be so infatuated with Yuval, which they are -- it's insane he's so popular, they're all inviting him to campus -- yet what Yuval is saying undermines the premise of the advertising- and engagement-based model of their products,'' said Tristan Harris, Google's former in-house design ethicist and the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.</p><p>  Part of the reason might be that Silicon Valley, at a certain level, is not optimistic on the future of democracy. The more of a mess Washington becomes, the more interested the tech world is in creating something else, and it might not look like elected representation. Rank-and-file coders have long been wary of regulation and curious about alternative forms of government. A separatist streak runs through the place: Venture capitalists periodically call for California to secede or shatter, or for the creation of corporate nation-states. And this summer, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who has recommended Mr. Harari to his book club, acknowledged a fixation with the autocrat Caesar Augustus. ''Basically,'' Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>told The New Yorker, ''through a really harsh approach, he established 200 years of world peace.''</p><p>  Mr. Harari, thinking about all this, puts it this way: ''Utopia and dystopia depends on your values.''</p><p>  Mr. Harari, who has a Ph.D. from Oxford, is a 42-year-old Israeli philosopher and a history professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The story of his current fame begins in 2011, when he published a book of notable ambition: to survey the whole of human existence. ''Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,'' first released in Hebrew, did not break new ground in terms of historical research. Nor did its premise -- that humans are animals and our dominance is an accident -- seem a likely commercial hit. But the casual tone and smooth way Mr. Harari tied together existing knowledge across fields made it a deeply pleasing read, even as the tome ended on the notion that the process of human evolution might be over. Translated into English in 2014, the book went on to sell more than eight million copies and made Mr. Harari a celebrity intellectual.</p><p>  He followed up with ''Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,'' which outlined his vision of what comes after human evolution. In it, he describes Dataism, a new faith based around the power of algorithms. Mr. Harari's future is one in which big data is worshiped, artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, and some humans develop Godlike abilities.</p><p>  Now, he has written a book about the present and how it could lead to that future: ''21 Lessons for the 21st Century.'' It is meant to be read as a series of warnings. His recent TED Talk was called ''Why fascism is so tempting -- and how your data could power it.''</p><p>  His prophecies might have made him a Cassandra in Silicon Valley, or at the very least an unwelcome presence. Instead, he has had to reconcile himself to the locals' strange delight. ''If you make people start thinking far more deeply and seriously about these issues,'' he told me, sounding weary, ''some of the things they will think about might not be what you want them to think about.''</p><p>  'Brave New World' as Aspirational Reading</p><p>  Mr. Harari agreed to let me tag along for a few days on his travels through the Valley, and one afternoon in September, I waited for him outside X's offices, in Mountain View, while he spoke to the Alphabet employees inside. After a while, he emerged: a shy, thin, bespectacled man with a dusting of dark hair. Mr. Harari has a sort of owlish demeanor, in that he looks wise and also does not move his body very much, even while glancing to the side. His face is not particularly expressive, with the exception of one rogue eyebrow. When you catch his eye, there is a wary look -- like he wants to know if you, too, understand exactly how bad the world is about to get.</p><p>  At the Alphabet talk, Mr. Harari had been accompanied by his publisher. They said that the younger employees had expressed concern about whether their work was contributing to a less free society, while the executives generally thought their impact was positive.</p><p>  Some workers had tried to predict how well humans would adapt to large technological change based on how they have responded to small shifts, like a new version of Gmail. Mr. Harari told them to think more starkly: If there isn't a major policy intervention, most humans probably will not adapt at all.</p><p>  It made him sad, he told me, to see people build things that destroy their own societies, but he works every day to maintain an academic distance and remind himself that humans are just animals. ''Part of it is really coming from seeing humans as apes, that this is how they behave,'' he said, adding, ''They're chimpanzees. They're sapiens. This is what they do.''</p><p>  He was slouching a little. Socializing exhausts him.</p><p>  As we boarded the black gull-wing Tesla Mr. Harari had rented for his visit, he brought up Aldous Huxley. Generations have been horrified by his novel ''Brave New World,'' which depicts a regime of emotion control and painless consumption. Readers who encounter the book today, Mr. Harari said, often think it sounds great. ''Everything is so nice, and in that way it is an intellectually disturbing book because you're really hard-pressed to explain what's wrong with it,'' he said. ''And you do get today a vision coming out of some people in Silicon Valley which goes in that direction.''</p><p>  An Alphabet media relations manager later reached out to Mr. Harari's team to tell him to tell me that the visit to X was not allowed to be part of this story. The request confused and then amused Mr. Harari. It is interesting, he said, that unlike politicians, tech companies do not need a free press, since they already control the means of message distribution.</p><p>  He said he had resigned himself to tech executives' global reign, pointing out how much worse the politicians are. ''I've met a number of these high-tech giants, and generally they're good people,'' he said. ''They're not Attila the Hun. In the lottery of human leaders, you could get far worse.''</p><p>  Some of his tech fans, he thinks, come to him out of anxiety. ''Some may be very frightened of the impact of what they are doing,'' Mr. Harari said.</p><p>  Still, their enthusiastic embrace of his work makes him uncomfortable. ''It's just a rule of thumb in history that if you are so much coddled by the elites it must mean that you don't want to frighten them,'' Mr. Harari said. ''They can absorb you. You can become the intellectual entertainment.''</p><p>  Dinner, With a Side of Medically Engineered Immortality</p><p>  C.E.O. testimonials to Mr. Harari's acumen are indeed not hard to come by. ''I'm drawn to Yuval for his clarity of thought,'' Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter and Square, wrote in an email, going on to praise a particular chapter on meditation.</p><p>  And Mr. Hastings wrote: ''Yuval's the anti-Silicon Valley persona -- he doesn't carry a phone and he spends a lot of time contemplating while off the grid. We see in him who we wish we were.'' He added, ''His thinking on A.I. and biotech in his new book pushes our understanding of the dramas to unfold.''</p><p>  At the dinner Mr. Hastings co-hosted, academics and industry leaders debated the dangers of data collection, and to what degree longevity therapies will extend the human life span. (Mr. Harari has written that the ruling class will vastly outlive the useless.) ''That evening was small, but could be magnified to symbolize his impact in the heart of Silicon Valley,'' said Dr. Fei-Fei Li, an artificial intelligence expert who pushed internally at Google to keep secret the company's efforts to process military drone footage for the Pentagon. ''His book has that ability to bring these people together at a table, and that is his contribution.''</p><p>  A few nights earlier, Mr. Harari spoke to a sold-out theater of 3,500 in San Francisco. One ticket-holder walking in, an older man, told me it was brave and honest for Mr. Harari to use the term ''useless class.''</p><p>  The author was paired for discussion with the prolific intellectual Sam Harris, who strode onstage in a gray suit and well-starched white button-down. Mr. Harari was less at ease, in a loose suit that crumpled around him, his hands clasped in his lap as he sat deep in his chair. But as he spoke about meditation -- Mr. Harari spends two hours each day and two months each year in silence -- he became commanding. In a region where self-optimization is paramount and meditation is a competitive sport, Mr. Harari's devotion confers hero status.</p><p>  He told the audience that free will is an illusion, and that human rights are just a story we tell ourselves. Political parties, he said, might not make sense anymore. He went on to argue that the liberal world order has relied on fictions like ''the customer is always right'' and ''follow your heart,'' and that these ideas no longer work in the age of artificial intelligence, when hearts can be manipulated at scale.</p><p>  Everyone in Silicon Valley is focused on building the future, Mr. Harari continued, while most of the world's people are not even needed enough to be exploited. ''Now you increasingly feel that there are all these elites that just don't need me,'' he said. ''And it's much worse to be irrelevant than to be exploited.''</p><p>  The useless class he describes is uniquely vulnerable. ''If a century ago you mounted a revolution against exploitation, you knew that when bad comes to worse, they can't shoot all of us because they need us,'' he said, citing army service and factory work.</p><p>  Now it is becoming less clear why the ruling elite would not just kill the new useless class. ''You're totally expendable,'' he told the audience.</p><p>  This, Mr. Harari told me later, is why Silicon Valley is so excited about the concept of universal basic income, or stipends paid to people regardless of whether they work. The message is: ''We don't need you. But we are nice, so we'll take care of you.''</p><p>  On Sept. 14, he published an essay in The Guardian assailing another old trope -- that ''the voter knows best.''</p><p>  ''If humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don't reflect our free will, what should the point of politics be?'' he wrote. ''How do you live when you realize ... that your heart might be a government agent, that your amygdala might be working for Putin, and that the next thought that emerges in your mind might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourself? These are the most interesting questions humanity now faces.''</p><p>  'O.K., So Maybe Humankind Is Going to Disappear'</p><p>  Mr. Harari and his husband, Itzik Yahav, who is also his manager, rented a small house in Mountain View for their visit, and one morning I found them there making oatmeal. Mr. Harari observed that as his celebrity in Silicon Valley has risen, tech fans have focused on his lifestyle.</p><p>  ''Silicon Valley was already kind of a hotbed for meditation and yoga and all these things,'' he said. ''And one of the things that made me kind of more popular and palatable is that I also have this bedrock.'' He was wearing an old sweatshirt and denim track pants. His voice was quiet, but he gestured widely, waving his hands, hitting a jar of spatulas.</p><p>  Mr. Harari grew up in Kiryat Ata, near Haifa, and his father worked in the arms industry. His mother, who worked in office administration, now volunteers for her son handling his mail; he gets about 1,000 messages a week. Mr. Yahav's mother is their accountant.</p><p>  Most days, Mr. Harari doesn't use an alarm clock, and wakes up between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m., then meditates and has a cup of tea. He works until 4 or 5 p.m., then does another hour of meditation, followed by an hourlong walk, maybe a swim, and then TV with Mr. Yahav.</p><p>  The two met 16 years ago through the dating site Check Me Out. ''We are not big believers in falling in love,'' Mr. Harari said. ''It was more a rational choice.''</p><p>  ''We met each other and we thought, 'O.K., we're -- O.K., let's move in with each other,''' Mr. Yahav said.</p><p>  Mr. Yahav became Mr. Harari's manager. During the period when English-language publishers were cool on the commercial viability of ''Sapiens'' -- thinking it too serious for the average reader and not serious enough for the scholars -- Mr. Yahav persisted, eventually landing the Jerusalem-based agent Deborah Harris. One day when Mr. Harari was away meditating, Mr. Yahav and Ms. Harris finally sold it at auction to Random House in London.</p><p>  Today, they have a team of eight based in Tel Aviv working on Mr. Harari's projects. The director Ridley Scott and documentarian Asif Kapadia are adapting ''Sapiens'' into a TV show, and Mr. Harari is working on children's books to reach a broader audience.</p><p>  Mr. Yahav used to meditate, but has recently stopped. ''It was too hectic,'' he said while folding laundry. ''I couldn't get this kind of huge success and a regular practice.'' Mr. Harari remains dedicated.</p><p>  ''If it were only up to him, he would be a monk in a cave, writing things and never getting his hair cut,'' Mr. Yahav said, looking at his husband. ''Can I tell that story?''</p><p>  Mr. Harari said no.</p><p>  ''On our first meeting,'' Mr. Yahav said, ''he had cut his hair by himself. And it was a very bad job.''</p><p>  The couple are vegan, and Mr. Harari is particularly sensitive to animals. He identified the sweatshirt he was wearing as one he got just before one of his dogs died. Mr. Yahav cut in to ask if he could tell another story; Mr. Harari seemed to know exactly what he meant, and said absolutely not.</p><p>  ''In the middle of the night,'' Mr. Yahav said, ''when there is a mosquito, he will catch him and take him out.''</p><p>  Being gay, Mr. Harari said, has helped his work -- it set him apart to study culture more clearly because it made him question the dominant stories of his own conservative Jewish society. ''If society got this thing wrong, who guarantees it didn't get everything else wrong as well?'' he said.</p><p>  ''If I was a superhuman, my superpower would be detachment,'' Mr. Harari added. ''O.K., so maybe humankind is going to disappear -- O.K., let's just observe.''</p><p>  For fun, the couple watches TV. It is their primary hobby and topic of conversation, and Mr. Yahav said it was the only thing from which Mr. Harari is not detached.</p><p>  They just finished ''Dear White People,'' and they loved the Australian series ''Please Like Me.''

Apple Inc.AAPL[1], Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN[2], Alphabet Inc.</p><p>GOOGL[3] and Facebook, Inc.FB[4] together racked up profits of almost $29 billion on sales of nearly $200 billion in the second quarter. And combined revenues for the four, excluding Alphabet's traffic acquisition cost, or TAC, was $198.11 billion, beating Wall Street's expectations of combined revenues of $181.5 billion, and way more than $165.7 billion in the year-ago quarter.Interestingly, the big four tech companies reported stellar results a day after a five-and-a-half-hour-long grilling of their CEOs by house members in a historic antitrust hearing. Nonetheless, shares of the big tech companies in after-hour trading pushed toward a market cap increase of more than $200 billion. Currently, the big four tech companies' worth is almost $5 trillion.Apple displayed strength across all segments, especially the June quarter has been strong for Macs and iPads. In late trading on Jul 30, the iPhone maker's shares rallied 6%, topping $400 a share for the first time. Notably, the company posted revenues of $59.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.58, beating analysts' expectations of $52.1 billion and $2.09 a share.Similarly, Amazon's $88.9 billion in sales in the quarter ending June 2020 was nearly $8 billion higher than the company's original guidance. Amazon's second-quarter profit of $5.2 billion or $10.30 a share were also five times the consensus estimate. Despite Chief Executive Jeff Bezos spending a huge amount related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon's stunning results were mostly due to an uptick in e-commerce business of 47.8% from last year to $45.9 billion in the second quarter. Amazon's stock rallied 5% in late trading on Jul 30.Search giant Google's parent Alphabet also registered revenues of $38.3 billion and profits of $10.13 a share in the said quarter, ahead of analysts' expectations of $37.3 billion and $7.94 a share. YouTube and Cloud services have been the saving grace for Alphabet. YouTube's ad business increased 6% from a year ago, while Google Cloud's revenues climbed 43%. Alphabet rose 0.5% after hours.The social network giant Facebook also posted revenues of $18.7 billion and profits of $1.80 a share, higher than expectations of $17.3 billion and $1.39, respectively. Facebook's apps, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, witnessed a surge in traffic in the June quarter, helping the company report stunning results. After hours, Facebook's shares were up 6.2% to $249, just short of its intra-day record high of $250.12.Not just these big four, last week, Microsoft CorporationMSFT[5] saw its Intelligent Cloud division rake in $13.4-billion sales for the fiscal fourth quarter against analysts' estimate of $13.11 billion. Sales also grew 17% year over year. In fact, Microsoft reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $11.2 billion or $1.46 a share on revenues of $38 billion. Analysts expected profit of $1.38 a share on sales of $36.59 billion.What's more, for the tech sector as a whole, second-quarter earnings are expected to decline 10.9% despite 0.3% higher revenues. But that's far better compared to the overall earnings picture. This is because total earnings for the S&amp;#38;P 500 companies are projected to decline 41.1% on 8.9% lower revenues (read more: An Improving Earnings Outlook Despite Covid-19 Concerns[6]). Basically, the broader tech sector has remained reasonably unscathed in the second quarter amid the current economic downturn owing the pandemic. This is primarily because investors saw that these companies have been gaining immensely from secular trends like cloud computing and robust telecommunications infrastructure \u2014 demand for which skyrocketed amid the health crisis.Further, with majority of the population trapped at home with an Internet connection, trends like streaming media, video chats with friends and online connections with co-workers have picked up. These trends, in turn, have bolstered the need for newer technologies.Another factor working in favor of tech shares is the receding threat of regulations. Before the pandemic, policymakers worldwide were devising plans to impose regulations on these companies but this has taken a back seat owing to the pandemic.Invest in Tech Now: 5 Picks for the Rest of the Year &amp;#38; BeyondAs mentioned above, the pandemic hasn't been able to diminish the allure of tech players.

TD was even highlighted in a press release as \"the first Canadian-headquartered bank to issue an Amazon credit card.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rewards card is being issued on Mastercard Inc.'s global payments network and will let Amazon Prime members earn back 2.5 per cent when using the card at Amazon.ca and Whole Foods Market in Canada, and one per cent for all other eligible purchases. Non-Prime cardholders get 1.5 per cent on Amazon purchases and one per cent on the rest.</p><p>\"This is a major win for TD Bank,\" wrote Eight Capital analyst Steve Theriault. \"Coupled with the anticipated launch of a revamped Air Canada card in 2020, we believe that TD Bank is well positioned to drive increased credit card market share over the medium term. This is also a significant win for TD as Canadian banks continue to solidify their rewards ecosystems and defend market share in an increasingly digital marketplace.\"</p><p>The other shot fired across the banks' bow on Tuesday was by Facebook Inc., which officially announced a plan for a new digital currency by as early as next year.</p><p>That plan - which includes an independent, not-for-profit governing entity based in Geneva, Switzerland called the Libra Association - is \"as loud an announcement of entry into Fintech as you will find,\" said Lex Sokolin, global fintech co-head at blockchain technology company ConsenSys.</p><p>\"The incumbents in the banking industry rightly stand to lose both marketshare and future market opportunity as a result of this move,\" he said in an email.</p><p>Libra, the planned cryptocurrency, is to be a \"stable currency built on a secure and stable open-source blockchain, backed by a reserve of real assets, and governed by an independent association,\" according to a white paper released by the Libra Association.</p><p>But the vision also includes \"more access to better, cheaper, and open financial services,\" and backing from companies like Mastercard and Uber Technologies Inc. \"We believe that collaborating and innovating with the financial sector, including regulators and experts across a variety of industries, is the only way to ensure that a sustainable, secure and trusted framework underpins this new system,\" the white paper added. \"And this approach can deliver a giant leap forward toward a lower-cost, more accessible, more connected global financial system.\"</p><p>Traditional lenders have cautiously embraced big tech, which is a significant source of customers and consumer data, but also a cause for concern due to the possibility that the banks will be elbowed aside by new players in the financial system.</p><p>There is risk to reputation as well, as big-tech companies face renewed scrutiny from governments and regulators over competition and privacy concerns.</p><p>In April, following Apple Inc.'s announcement of a credit card with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., TD president and chief executive Bharat Masrani was asked about the possibility of a similar big tech-big bank partnership. The CEO responded that partnerships are not a new thing for the bank, which is a card issuer in the U.S. for retailers Nordstrom Inc. and Target Corp.</p><p>\"Any opportunity, if they were to present themselves, we would look at it,\" Masrani told reporters following TD's annual meeting of shareholders. \"And (it) depends on which market, what's the positioning, what kind of partner do we have - because our brand is also exposed there, and that's important to us - what kind of risks are acceptable.\"</p><p>While the target of Facebook's payments plan may actually be more along the lines of Chinese financial-technology giants such as Ant Financial Services Group and its Alipay platform, Sokolin said banks may be prompted to join in the crypto-endeavour.</p><p>\"I expect that many of them, if the initiative at least appears to be successful, may want to become nodes in the network to sustain the cryptocurrency,\" he said. \"The fact that traditional financial institutions are not leading something like this, and instead it is being built by Silicon Valley, tells a powerful story about who can take advantage of frontier technology.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGE-394158863FRDG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGLR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCW-RG81-JCT2-K3CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"739\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Gleaner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Gleaner (New Brunswick)</publicationName><edition>Web Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>developments,reshape,relationship,banks,technology,companies</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF XLK[5] lost about 3.8% on the day as investors dumped high-flying names like AppleAAPL[6] and Facebook (read: Apple Woes Trigger Tech Sector Rout: ETFs Under Threat[7]).News of Apple lowering iPhone production and 'a WSJ report[8] that CEO Mark Zuckerberg is becoming much more aggressive in how he manages the tech giant' devastated the technology sector.Apple shares were down about 4% and Facebook lost about 5.7% on Nov 19.

Now he wants big tech regulated.Benioff doubled down[1] on his recent critique of Facebook being as dangerously addictive as cigarettes, suggesting that it must be regulated to make sure it serves the public good. In the NBC News Interview with Kara Swisher[2] he stated, 'I've been saying this now for a while ... You look at what's going on with brands like Facebook. </p><p>Facebook is the new cigarettes. It's addictive, it's not good for you, there's people trying to get you to use that even you don't understand what's going on The government needs to step in, the government needs to really regulate what's happening. This is the role of government, to protect us ... at times of severe change, and you know they did that with the cigarette industry, they need to do that with the technology industry ... Facebook can have very serious effects on society the same way that cigarettes can.' Benioff is one of the numerous leaders from all manner of political backgrounds who have proposed regulations on big tech, especially social media. French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed regulating Facebook for 'hate speech.' [3]Brad Parscale of the Trump campaign, on the other hand, has suggested regulating Facebook and other social media platforms to protect free speech[4]. Whether condemning speech they find offensive, or protecting the ability to speak freely, leaders with opposing ideologies can agree that tech companies have an unprecedented level of power over our culture that is largely unchecked.Revelations about the impact of big tech on culture and politics have divided both parties as well as the GOP itself. Ted Cruz, as staunch an advocate of the free market and constitutional law as any, recently proposed that Big Tech needs to be held accountable[5] by the government if the Republic is to survive:'Even though Congress shouldn't regulate the content Right now big tech enjoys immunity from liability on the assumption they can be neutral and fair If they're going to be biased, we should repeal the immunity The giant tech companies if they're abusing the market powers of monopoly, the antitrust laws should be enforced.'The measure he is referring to here is Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. which designates social media as platforms, not as a publishers. This designation is important because it frees companies like Facebook or Youtube from legal prosecution for illegal activity. The purpose of this was to provide a forum for public debate.

Now he wants big tech regulated.Benioff doubled down[1] on his recent critique of Facebook being as dangerously addictive as cigarettes, suggesting that it must be regulated to make sure it serves the public good. In the NBC News Interview with Kara Swisher[2] he stated, 'I've been saying this now for a while ... You look at what's going on with brands like Facebook. </p><p>Facebook is the new cigarettes. It's addictive, it's not good for you, there's people trying to get you to use that even you don't understand what's going on The government needs to step in, the government needs to really regulate what's happening. This is the role of government, to protect us ... at times of severe change, and you know they did that with the cigarette industry, they need to do that with the technology industry ... Facebook can have very serious effects on society the same way that cigarettes can.' Benioff is one of the numerous leaders from all manner of political backgrounds who have proposed regulations on big tech, especially social media. French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed regulating Facebook for 'hate speech.' [3]Brad Parscale of the Trump campaign, on the other hand, has suggested regulating Facebook and other social media platforms to protect free speech[4]. Whether condemning speech they find offensive, or protecting the ability to speak freely, leaders with opposing ideologies can agree that tech companies have an unprecedented level of power over our culture that is largely unchecked.Revelations about the impact of big tech on culture and politics have divided both parties as well as the GOP itself. Ted Cruz, as staunch an advocate of the free market and constitutional law as any, recently proposed that Big Tech needs to be held accountable[5] by the government if the Republic is to survive:'Even though Congress shouldn't regulate the content Right now big tech enjoys immunity from liability on the assumption they can be neutral and fair If they're going to be biased, we should repeal the immunity The giant tech companies if they're abusing the market powers of monopoly, the antitrust laws should be enforced.'The measure he is referring to here is Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. which designates social media as platforms, not as a publishers. This designation is important because it frees companies like Facebook or Youtube from legal prosecution for illegal activity. The purpose of this was to provide a forum for public debate.

And it encourages big tech companies to relocate their production centers to other countries, creating foreign jobs rather than American jobs.</p><p>\"We need to look at immigration as a job-creating engine,\" Lofgren said. \"If you talk to the tech firms, the real hotshots have a lot of opportunities. They're being recruited by companies all over the world.\"</p><p>Rep. <person><nameText>Darrell Issa </nameText></person>(R-Calif.) has already introduced legislation that would eliminate an outdated green card lottery program and instead reallocate those 50,000 visas to foreign-born individuals who have obtained a graduate degree in science or engineering from a U.S. university.</p><p>While Lofgren's bill would issue additional permanent green card visas, Issa said it's more important to keep the net number of visas the same.</p><p>\"The U.S. is laying out the welcome mat to the highly skilled students we need and then yanking it out from under them once they become skilled workers,\" Issa said in a statement to POLITICO. \"My approach will reform the current system by adding more skilled workers.</p><p>\"If these workers in key industries stay here, they create jobs for Americans - if they leave, jobs will be created overseas. That is the solution, not just throwing more quotas on top of a burdened and broken system.\"</p><p>There have been other Republican overtures on highly skilled immigration reform - but a bipartisan approach in the House has not yet materialized.</p><p>Last week, McCarthy told technology executives that some sort of immigration reform isn't out of the question for this Congress. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith recently said attracting skilled workers from abroad would \"make our high-tech companies competitive.\"</p><p>\"This is a guaranteed job generator,\" he said. Smith, like Issa, has taken the position that the number of visas should remain at current levels.</p><p>Immigration reform is also a key part of the Republican Technology Working Group's policy agenda for this Congress.</p><p>At a news conference this month, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) - a member of the working group - called for reforms that would allow U.S.-educated immigrants to stay in the country after graduating. Foreign-born students receive 40 percent of engineering master's degrees and 53 percent of engineering Ph.D.'s, she said. </p><p> \"We need to revise our visa system so highly educated professionals can stay in this country, promote U.S. economic growth and spur job creation here at home,\" she said. </p><p> Lofgren's bill would give green cards to graduates with advanced degrees in science and technology from U.S. research universities. It would also allow highly skilled immigrants who receive a certain amount of U.S. venture capital funding to get green cards. In addition, it would grant green cards to foreign-born entrepreneurs who start businesses and create a certain number of jobs. </p><p> \"It's all about the jobs, whether it's the Ph.D. in computer science or someone who's building a small business,\" Lofgren said. </p><p> Raising the caps for H-1B visas has typically dominated the discussion on highly skilled immigration. H-1B visas allow U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations, such as engineering, mathematics or advanced sciences. Current law allows 85,000 H-1B visas each year. </p><p> Smith, Issa and McCarthy have conveyed optimism that the H-1B program can be improved. </p><p> But Lofgren would rather see more green cards, which are permanent. Recipients of temporary H-1B visas have to leave the country when their work contracts end, giving them little incentive to settle in the U.S. and start businesses, she said. </p><p> Some tech companies think the administration could be taking a more active role. Over the past few months, President Barack Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness has held meetings with business leaders and some advocacy groups on the issue. </p><p> \"There are some regulatory steps that can be taken to stem the tide of high-skilled labor going back to countries like China and Russia,\" said Peter Cleveland, director of Global Public Policy at Intel. </p><p> Among those steps: raising the cap on employment-based green cards and eliminating per-country visa limits, Cleveland said. </p><p> The per-country limit is a problem, Cleveland said, because it allocates the same number of visas to every country. That means Iceland receives the same number of visas as India, even though India has a much larger pool of engineers and technologists waiting for a visa to come to the U.S.</p><p> \"That should change so that hundreds of thousands of engineers don't have to wait in line for 10 years,\" Cleveland said. \"That is within the administration's power.\" </p><p> But the House may be at the center of the debate in the near term, with the Senate watching and waiting. </p><p> \"It's clear that the leaders on immigration policy agree that we cannot ignore the benefits of attracting emerging scientists to the U.S.,\" said Stewart Verdery, partner at Monument Policy Group, which lobbies for immigration reform on behalf of clients including Microsoft and the Entertainment Software Association. </p><p> Even without a GOP co-sponsor, Lofgren's bill is a starting point for bipartisan dialogue, said Ralph Hellmann, a top lobbyist for the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Dell and eBay. </p><p> \"The tech community is very supportive of what Lofgren's going to introduce, and we also plan to work with House Republicans who are now publicly committing to move something on high-skilled immigration,\" Hellmann said. \"Hopefully, the two sides will eventually find common ground.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-56868</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5338-XNW1-F118-93TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1153\"/><timeReceived>11:29 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2011  Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>June 13, 2011 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Issuance of Visas</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mzg4RUQxNkU4QUZBNEJGNEE1NkFBMDk1QzEzMTE0QzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM5NTNBQjk2MUM3NDBCQ0E1NEU3MDI4QkY4NEVBNzA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Registration &amp;

The names of the companies have not explicitly been provided yet but recent reports have indicated that Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple are all potentially going to need to take part in the probe. Each has been called out by a number of US representatives over the past several months and has been rumored[2] as under potential antitrust investigations conducted by the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department. The four companies are said to be split evenly between the two government bodies. </p><p>Sentiments about how to handle the companies have generally been split across the political divide, although calls to dismantle the tech giants has been seen on both sides. Some Democratic Senators such as Elizabeth Warren have explicitly for a break up of the larger companies while Republicans such asHouse Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy have stated that they don't see what purpose that could serve. That split does not extend to the probe itself, which members of each party are calling for. This could just be a repeat of last year Now, this certainly isn't the first time executives and leaders at major technology firms have been asked to testify in a US House Judiciary probe and those who have watched such probes in the past are likely not expecting much to be discovered. In the past, companies have typically skirted tough questions with claims that improvements and changes both need to and would be made. Typically, tough questions haven't been asked at all, with members of the government body repeatedly showing an uncanny lack of understanding about how the technology they are asking about actually works. Among notable instances that have occurred is the most recent appearance of Google before a House Judiciary Committee late last year[3] but Facebook and others have appeared before committees with similar results. Like that previous probe, a key focus for several lawmakers seems to be whether or not the companies do enough to protect user privacy and data while allowing for a fair exchange of information without bias. No immediate consequences There's no reason to presume the questioning in this probe or answers provide will go another way but there is at least one differentiator. Representatives have increasingly participated in calls to break up the big tech giants due to the amount of influence each has in a plethora of technology industries[4]. So the companies in question may ultimately face much more impactful consequences as a result of the probe, regardless of whether or not the majority of questions are relevant at all. If the probe does go badly for the companies, a deeper investigation by the FTC and DOJ will probably be kicked off to determine exactly what the outcome for the tech giant's will be. Any legislative or regulatory changes that are needed will likely come later, as those will require further deliberation.

We're watching for the fallout from Emerson Electric's $28 billion takeover bid for Rockwell Automation, one of the biggest merger offers of the year so far. (And we're still waiting on the House's tax bill, obviously.) More on that in a minute.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tell us what you think: We've put together a survey about the economy, business and public policy with our friends at Morning Consult. Take it here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  A reminder: DealBook's sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, takes place on Nov. 9. Want to join us? Apply to participate here.</p><p>  It's Round 2 for tech executives in Washington.</p><p>  Today, top lawyers for Facebook, Google and Twitter will face not one but two Congressional panels, offering explanations of how their companies can limit foreign interference in American elections.</p><p>  Here's what Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Recode he wants to know:</p><p>  ''Hopefully, the companies are going to come even more fully clean with what happened in 2016,'' he began. ''Second is, I want to know ... what else they're going to do to work with us to prevent it from happening in the future.'' And most ambitiously, the senator said, he wants to ''really get the message out to the public, writ large, how pervasive this problem is and how everyone needs to be a little better consumer of news.''</p><p>  Lawmakers on the Senate and House intelligence committees are certain to demand more information than they're going to get, based on yesterday's testimonies.</p><p>  When Senator Al Franken of Minnesota pressed Facebook's general counsel, Colin Stretch, about rejecting political ads purchased in foreign currencies, the tech executive said that such a policy might not deter bad actors. The Democratic senator responded with exasperation, ''My goal is for you to think through this stuff a little bit better,'' according to The NYT.</p><p>  Critics' corner: Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University and a frequent critic of big tech companies, was unimpressed. ''I like that they are contrite, but these issues are existential and they aren't taking any structural changes,'' he told The NYT.</p><p>  Speaking of regulating tech ...</p><p>   Yelp is using the moment to continue pressing for a tighter rein on tech giants. Its vice president of public policy wrote in a WSJ op-ed: ''In the absence of rigorous antitrust enforcement, the consumer internet has become too concentrated in a few dominant companies, creating easy targets for bad actors.''</p><p>  What we still don't know about the G.O.P. tax plan.</p><p>  The D-Day for House Republicans to unveil their tax proposal is now tomorrow, as they lock down final details. But several questions are yet to be answered. Richard Rubin, Siobhan Hughes and Kristina Peterson of The WSJ note three of the big ones:</p><p>  [T]he income cutoffs for individual tax brackets, the size of the child tax credit and which rules apply to a 25 percent tax rate for businesses such as partnerships that pay taxes through their owners' individual tax returns</p><p>  Things we do know: House Republicans have acquiesced to President Trump's wishes and plan to cut the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent immediately, rather than phase in the reduction over five years. And they will keep some deductions for state and local taxes.</p><p>  The bill will also have a worldwide minimum tax on multinational corporations' profits, which would be on all global income rather than on a country-by-country basis, according to The NYT.</p><p>  Mnuchin speaks: Some highlights of what the treasury secretary told Alan Rappeport of The NYT about the tax effort:</p><p>   ''If you look at the stock market, as I've said, the stock market is clearly up in anticipation of economic activity and economic growth from the Trump administration plan.''</p><p>   Tax cuts will pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth. ''For every percent of G.D.P., there's $2.5 trillion of additional revenues.''</p><p>   After the tax campaign will come a push to change financial regulations. ''We think there's definitely aspects of Dodd-Frank that people think should be reformed.''</p><p>  Another way to understand the system: Shawn Tully of Fortune walks through Apple's 2016 taxes to explain the current structure of taxation and why changes could help the economy.</p><p>  Elsewhere in Washington</p><p>   Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, is scheduled to speak with Robert Mueller and his team. (Politico)</p><p>   Meet the prosecutor Andrew Weissmann, a top lieutenant to Mr. Mueller. One defense lawyer who battled him during the Enron trial said of him, ''Frankly, I can't think of two people who deserve each other more than Andrew Weissmann and Donald Trump.'' (NYT)</p><p>   See how Paul Manafort laundered and spent $18 million, according to federal prosecutors, although his spending habits didn't exactly impress connoisseurs of luxury. (NYT)</p><p>   Eduardo Porter asks in his latest NYT column, ''What if President Trump's ultimate goal is to kill the World Trade Organization?''</p><p>  Is a bidding war brewing for Rockwell Automation?</p><p>  Now that Emerson Electric's $28 billion takeover offer is in the open, deal makers are wondering: Will Rockwell, a longtime leader in industrial automation, be forced to sell itself to Emerson -- or to a European rival like Schneider or ABB?</p><p>  What you need to know: Emerson approached Rockwell twice this year after having coveted the industrial parts maker for years. The first offer was in August, at $200 a share, while the second was made early last month, at $215 a share, half in cash, half in stock. Rockwell spurned those offers privately and, after CNBC reported the bids, publicly as well.</p><p>  The issues: People close to Emerson say that putting the two companies together would yield a leader in automated industrial processes, with $6 billion in cost savings. And they point to analysts who reckon that the target company's stock is richly valued compared to peers. People close to Rockwell say that their company is performing well and that they are leery of taking stock from Emerson, which they assert has a spotty track record on acquisitions.</p><p>  What's next: Emerson is hoping that Rockwell's investors will put pressure on management, while Rockwell has defenses in the form of a staggered board and no provision for shareholders to call special meetings. So far, Rockwell investors are pleased, but Emerson shareholders appear wary.</p><p>  Who's advising whom: Emerson has Centerview Partners and JPMorgan Chase on its side, while Rockwell has Goldman Sachs and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz.</p><p>  Don't count on Vornado to rescue the Kushners' albatross.</p><p>  ''There have been rumors in the marketplace, more than rumors that the marketplace about tearing the building down and doing all manner of fairly grand development schemes. It's likely that those are not feasible. And so it's likely that the building will revert to an office building.''</p><p>  That was Steven Roth, the C.E.O. of Vornado Realty Trust, speaking about the financially troubled 666 Fifth Avenue skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan that his company co-owns with the Kushner Companies. Though the Kushners -- led by Jared Kushner until his move to the White House -- have pursued grand dreams to reshape the complex, Vornado has now publicly confirmed that it isn't on board with those plans.</p><p>  The ambitious redevelopment plan envisioned by the Kushners was central to their efforts to clear $1.2 billion in debt on the building. As The WaPo notes, it's unclear what options the family has left.</p><p>  Revolving Door</p><p>Saudi Arabia is to appoint Alireza Zaimi, a managing director at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, to a top management post at its sovereign wealth fund, according to people with knowledge of the matter. (FT)</p><p>SoftBank has recruited executives from companies like UBS, Elliott Management and PwC to work on the Vision Fund from London. (Private Equity News)</p><p>  Quote of the Day</p><p>  ''A-Rod would have done very well in business if he had never seen a baseball.''</p><p>  -- Warren Buffett, telling Vanity Fair that the former New York Yankee (a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of sorts) has a ''money mind.''</p><p>  The Speed Read</p><p>  M. &amp; A.</p><p>   The real attraction of Aetna is its potential ability to send clients CVS's way for medical services like vaccinations. (Breakingviews)</p><p>   Clariant's chief executive said it would look for another merger partner after its proposed tie-up with Huntsman was scuppered by activist investors. (FT)</p><p>Imagination Technologies shareholders approved a $730 million cash takeover by Canyon Bridge on Tuesday, a day after the buyout firm's founder was charged with insider trading. (Reuters)</p><p>  Policy and Legal</p><p>Airbus, already shaken by a corruption investigation in Europe, said on Tuesday that it may have violated American rules on arms exports. (NYT)</p><p>   The labor market has created more so-called superstars in recent decades, and they can often evade the consequences of bad behavior. But the costs of retaining a superstar accused of harassment outweigh the benefits. (NYT)</p><p>   The Weinstein Company's talks with Fortress Investment Group about a lifeline have stalled, amid concerns about the studio's financial situation. (NY Post)</p><p>   A new academic paper has found that Securities and Exchange Commission employees tend to be better than average at selling shares ahead of bad corporate news. (Bloomberg)</p><p>  Private Capital (P.E. and V.C.)</p><p>SoftBank's proposed multibillion-dollar investment in Uber by SoftBank is being held up because Travis Kalanick objects to a provision in the deal, according to people familiar with the matter: one that would require a majority vote on any further directors he appoints.

(WSJ)</p><p>  Business and Economy</p><p>   CME Group said it would offer a futures contract based on Bitcoin, sending the digital currency above $6,400 for the first time. (WSJ)</p><p>   When internet start-ups began going belly up in the early 2000s, banks, private equity firms and other financial institutions sought more tangible enterprises. One result is that there may now be too many restaurants. (NYT)</p><p>Google is facing questions about privacy after a glitch in Docs locked users out of innocuous documents on the grounds that they violated its terms of service. (NYT)</p><p>   In defense of corporate jets: Executives' time is precious, it's a more efficient way to travel and GE may not even save that much by getting rid of its corporate fleet.

We\u2019re watching for the fallout from Emerson Electric\u2019s $28 billion takeover bid for Rockwell Automation, one of the biggest merger offers of the year so far. (And we\u2019re still waiting on the House\u2019s tax bill, obviously.)

And they will keep some deductions for state and local taxes.</p><p>The bill will also have a worldwide minimum tax on multinational corporations\u2019 profits, which would be on all global income rather than on a country-by-country basis, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/politics/trump-house-republicans-tax-cut-rollout-wednesday.html\">The NYT</url>.</p><p>Mnuchin speaks: Some highlights of what the treasury secretary <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/politics/mnuchin-taxes-treasury.html?dlbk\">told Alan Rappeport of The NYT</url> about the tax effort:</p><p> \u201cIf you look at the stock market, as I\u2019ve said, the stock market is clearly up in anticipation of economic activity and economic growth from the Trump administration plan.\u201d</p><p> Tax cuts will pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth. \u201cFor every percent of G.D.P., there\u2019s $2.5 trillion of additional revenues.\u201d</p><p> After the tax campaign will come a push to change financial regulations. \u201cWe think there\u2019s definitely aspects of Dodd-Frank that people think should be reformed.\u201d</p><p>Another way to understand the system: Shawn Tully of Fortune <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2017/10/31/trump-tax-reform-apple-multinational-companies/\">walks through Apple\u2019s 2016 taxes</url> to explain the current structure of taxation and why changes could help the economy.</p><p>Elsewhere in Washington</p><p> Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, is scheduled to speak with Robert Mueller and his team.

The first offer was in August, at $200 a share, while the second was made early last month, at $215 a share, half in cash, half in stock. Rockwell spurned those offers privately and, after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/31/emerson-electric-has-made-multiple-offers-for-rockwell-automation-sources-say.html\">CNBC reported</url> the bids,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ir.rockwellautomation.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2017/Rockwell-Automation-Board-Of-Directors-Unanimously-Rejected-Unsolicited-Proposals-From-Emerson/default.aspx\">publicly as well</url>.</p><p>The issues: People close to Emerson say that putting the two companies together would yield a leader in automated industrial processes, with $6 billion in cost savings. And they point to analysts who reckon that the target company\u2019s stock is richly valued compared to peers. People close to Rockwell say that their company is performing well and that they are leery of taking stock from Emerson, which they assert has a spotty track record on acquisitions.</p><p>What\u2019s next: Emerson is hoping that Rockwell\u2019s investors will put pressure on management, while Rockwell has defenses in the form of a staggered board and no provision for shareholders to call special meetings. So far, Rockwell investors are pleased, but Emerson shareholders appear wary.</p><p>Who\u2019s advising whom: Emerson has Centerview Partners and JPMorgan Chase on its side, while Rockwell has Goldman Sachs and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz.</p><p>Don\u2019t count on Vornado to rescue the Kushners\u2019 albatross.</p><p>\u201cThere have been rumors in the marketplace, more than rumors that the marketplace about tearing the building down and doing all manner of fairly grand development schemes. It\u2019s likely that those are not feasible.

Though the Kushners \u2014 led by Jared Kushner until his move to the White House \u2014 have pursued grand dreams to reshape the complex, Vornado has now publicly confirmed that it isn\u2019t on board with those plans.</p><p>The ambitious redevelopment plan envisioned by the Kushners was central to their efforts to clear $1.2 billion in debt on the building.

The government estimates a delay to the full rollout of 5G of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/997da795-e088-467e-aa54-74f76c321a75\"> up to three years</url>, and \u00a32bn in extra costs.

This permeates to the consumer level, with DB surveys recording 41 per cent of Americans and 35 per cent of Chinese saying they will not buy each other\u2019s products.</p><p>The $3.5tn figure comes from a $400bn reduction a year in domestic end demand from China and $100bn a year as a \u201cTech Wall\u201d creates extra costs for companies dealing with rival internet platforms, operating systems, and communications and payment networks. A further $1tn in costs would come from rebuilding and reconfiguring the supply chain, mainly falling on \u201cfinal goods manufacturers\u201d who currently use China as a manufacturing base.</p><p>If there is any upside, it might come from similar dynamics to the US-USSR cold war, where a ramp in spending on defence and the space race could translate as a leap in tech investment this century. US government spending alone on R&amp;D more than doubled as a percentage of GDP between 1957 and 1964 \u2014 to 2.2 per cent. Tech investment might not match that in this post-Covid era, but it could still provide a much needed blast of warmth for the sector in icy times.</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.

El-Erian</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big tech continues to dominate the news and has become a major driver of US stock markets. But the sector's dominant narrative has changed in the last few months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazement at the power of disruptive innovation to change not just what we do but also how we do it is now accompanied, if not tempered, by concerns about misuse and other unintended adverse consequences. This has raised important questions about interventions by governments, companies' self-regulation, incentive alignments, corporate responsibility and financial prospects.</p><p>It is also an inherently fluid situation. Consider the following six issues:</p><p>* Speed of change: Many of those who are closely involved in tech inventions and innovations feel that we may now be in the midst of accelerating disruption. Some say that even highly informed insiders are no longer confident about predicting advances in their field and the implications. This is particularly true for artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning and mobility, as well as their increasingly wide interactions.</p><p>* Competitive behaviour: As big tech has gotten bigger and richer, its willingness and ability to buy successful new sector entrants have increased. This behaviour is fuelled by considerations relating to both offence and defence: to provide an enabling platform for the new innovative entrants to flourish and to pre-empt significant competition down the road. Indeed, this behaviour has become so dominant that most start-ups target such takeovers as their major monetisation objective.</p><p>* Risk of backlash: This process has accelerated so much that it's no longer just governments, users and competitors that are struggling to keep up with the disruptions and their broader societal and political consequences. Even the tech companies themselves are having trouble, increasing the probability of a regulatory backlash for which they are unevenly prepared.</p><p>Add to that more long-standing concerns about labour displacements and other wage pressures. No wonder it seems that public policy experts are as much in demand in Silicon Valley these days as engineers.</p><p>* Weak global coordination: Although tech is inherently global, current government responses remain overwhelmingly national. For now, there are no credible and effective forums for their coordination and alignment. The resulting incentive for cross-border arbitrage would only add to the often-heard complaint that big tech pays insufficient attention to corporate responsibilities and social impact.</p><p>* Bipolar leadership: The US is losing its traditional lead and dominance. Helped by the inherent advantage of size and government support, tech companies and scientists in China have been making major inroads. In the process, two models of big tech are emerging.</p><p>In the US, government is kept at a distance as much as possible. And in China, government is much more of an integral part of the business. For now, both countries are largely operating on their own playing fields, but it's only a matter of time until the overlap becomes consequential.</p><p>* Productivity impact: There is now more reason to be hopeful about a good solution to the productivity puzzle of why visible technological advances have not been reflected in a pickup in productivity measures. Harvard's Ken Rogoff recently suggested that it takes time for companies to update their operating models and, thus, for economies to reach productivity tipping points.</p><p>Rogoff has also suggested that the ability of companies to incorporate innovations may be accelerated by the beneficial impact of the synchronised pickup in global growth.</p><p>The one clear and consistent message from these six factors is that tech-induced change is likely to become even more uncertain. Much will depend on the companies' ability to respond to their greater systemic importance, how government regulation and other intervention evolve, cross-border coordination, and society's tolerance for highly publicised tech-related slippages.</p><p>The resulting message for market participants is also clear. You can add this to the list of factors currently contributing to an ongoing shift in operating regime: from the unusual calm of 2017 to bigger, frequent and unsettling two-way asset price volatility.</p><p>\u2014 Washington Post</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-113519738</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S17-TMC1-JDJN-609S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

People called it Silicon Valley, and out of it flowed knowledge, ideas and innovations that gave us almost unthinkable powers to learn, to communicate, to transform our lives into exactly what we wanted them to be. The region's denizens toiled happily at the cutting edge, and day by day, they were making the world a better place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But today, this beautiful land is under attack from within and without. The products and services it sends out into the world are being called addictive, divisive and even damaging, raising the cry that instead of making the world better, they are making it worse.</p><p>As technology plays a deeper and more pervasive role in nearly every aspect of our lives, the industry that has upended everything from shopping and travel to education and human relationships is facing a backlash the likes of which Silicon Valley has never seen.</p><p>Polarizing online content and Russian manipulation of social media platforms have fuelled calls from the right and the left for greater regulation of firms like Google, Facebook and Twitter. World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, leftist billionaire George Soros, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and conservative Fox News host Tucker Carlson have all joined the chorus demanding the government take action.</p><p>Critics argue that the big tech firms have become too economically dominant, intruded too far into our lives and have too much control over what gets seen and shared online. At the same time, critics contend, those same companies have failed to take responsibility for the misuse of their services by malevolent actors, for the spread of fake news and for the way their platforms and algorithms can be gamed.</p><p>Stanford computer science students are protesting Apple, demanding it make less addictive devices. The #MeToo movement has amplified a debate over sexual harassment and diversity in Silicon Valley. And conservatives have attacked the whole region as a liberal echo chamber that stifles precisely the open debate it claims to embrace.</p><p>Thus the backlash.</p><p>\"What makes it categorically different now is that this is the first time I have seen that people are saying, 'Hmmm, maybe Silicon Valley needs to be taken down to size,' \" said Leslie Berlin, project historian for Stanford University's Silicon Valley Archives. \"This notion that what Silicon Valley represents actually threatens rather than embodies what makes the country great, that is new.\"</p><p>Berners-Lee in an open letter recently called the tech giants \"a new set of gatekeepers\" whose platforms can be \"weaponized\" to widen social rifts and interfere in elections. Benioff told CNBC in January that social media was \"addictive\" and should be regulated like cigarettes. Carlson wants Google treated like a public utility because it \"shuts down free speech for political reasons.\" Former president Barack Obama, at a February conference at MIT, said social media was Balkanizing public discourse. Even Facebook has jumped in with an unusual mea culpa, issuing a news release in February admitting it was \"far too slow to recognize how bad actors were abusing our platform.\"</p><p>Despite its critics, Silicon Valley remains hugely successful and influential, with 21 per cent of employed people working in tech, according to a 2017 Federal Reserve Bank report. Though the region's economy has shown some signs of slowing, job growth in Silicon Valley has been more than double the national rate since the beginning of the economic recovery in 2010. And the region remains home to the two most valuable public companies in the world, Apple and Google's parent firm Alphabet, as well as world-class universities. Every day, people around the world benefit from Silicon Valley-built tools that have transformed communication, opened access to information, and made life easier.</p><p>The notion that Silicon Valley's best days are over is far from new - people have been predicting its demise ever since the advent of the microprocessor, said Berlin.</p><p>\"It was going to be the oil shocks of the '70s that were going to take it down, and Japanese competition was going to take it down, India and China, the Dot Com bust, Y2K - it's just been one thing after another, the '08 crash,\" Berlin said. \"Time and again, Silicon Valley has bounced back from these perceived threats. Silicon Valley has always been sort of the golden child of the Golden State.\"</p><p>But this time, Berlin and others see something shifting.</p><p>\"It is unprecedented,\" UC Berkeley Haas School of Business professor Abhishek Nagaraj, said of the backlash. \"I think this is because of how deeply penetrated tech is in people's lives.\"</p><p>Nagaraj, who studies the tech industry, compared the demonization of Silicon Valley to the outcry against Wall Street after deceptive investment banking practices knocked the U.S. into the Great Recession. \"It appears as if, basically, tech is the new finance,\" Nagaraj said.</p><p>Increasingly, the public views the tech industry as a force against which they are powerless, said San Jose State University anthropology professor Jan English-Lueck, who researches Silicon Valley's culture.</p><p>\"It's now on people's radar screen to be a place of the elite, where they're changing the world in a way that ordinary people don't have an influence on that change,\" English-Lueck said.</p><p>While the devices and social media platforms created by hugely successful Silicon Valley tech firms have given us new ways to connect, they've also thrown the worst of human nature into our faces, said English-Lueck.</p><p>\"You don't have to look in somebody's eyes when you're telling someone something ugly,\" English-Lueck said. \"That's really exaggerated people's ability to hate.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley boosters such as Peggy Burke, CEO of Palo Alto branding agency 1185, will tell you the technology industry can fix the problems it creates.</p><p>\"You have to weigh the good and the bad, and if the bad gets so bad that it outweighs the good, someone will solve for that,\" Burke said. \"If there's a problem - traffic, transportation, housing, stopping Russians, fake news - someone in the Valley right now is working on solving for that problem. I've been in the Valley for 30 years and I've seen it happen over and over.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2018032245384358</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXV-DHB1-F105-61R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1050\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

It kept swinging up and down after that, the latest examples of the lightning-quick shifts in momentum that have rocked Wall Street recently. Through the tumultuous week, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.5% to clinch its its first back-to-back weekly loss in four months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market\u2019s recent selling, lost 66.05, or 0.6%, to 10,853.55 after also flip-flopping between gains and losses. Its 4.1% drop for the week was its worst since market panic was peaking about the coronavirus and stocks hit a bottom in late March.</p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.06, or 0.5%, to 27,665.64, but not before careening between a gain of 294 points and a loss of 86 points.</p><p> Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties is what to do with Big Tech stocks, which critics have long said were due for a slide after soaring too high through the summer.</p><p> \u201cThe technology sell-off continues,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is anything more than a technical pullback that\u2019s cleansing. It\u2019s healthy and was anticipated.\u201d</p><p>Apple, Amazon and others soared through the pandemic as their businesses boomed despite the recession. The coronavirus accelerated a shift to online life that\u2019s benefited them, and a pile-on of investors into Big Tech sent their share prices soaring to levels that critics said were overvalued.</p><p>Apple had a nearly irrepressible run this summer where it rose in 12 out of 13 weeks. Zoom Video Communications surged above $450 per share earlier this month after starting the year at less than $70.</p><p> That all came to an abrupt halt last week. Worries that the stocks had gotten overheated helped send the S&amp;P 500 to its worst three-day run in nearly three months, and the Nasdaq composite slid 10%. Tech stocks recovered a bit on Wednesday, and they seemed to regain their stride Thursday morning, only for an afternoon swoon to batter them again.</p><p> On Friday, tech stocks again swung from gains to losses. The fluctuations came even after Oracle reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. After leaping as much as 7.9% in the morning, its stock slipped 0.6%.</p><p> Big Tech and the high-growth area of the stock market \"just got ahead of itself,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how it got there, it matters that it got there and now we\u2019re kind of deflating that overvaluation a little bit.\u201d</p><p> After rising as much as 1.5% shortly after trading began, Apple fell back to a loss of 1.3%. It dropped 7.4% over the week, its worst since March. Movements for it and other Big Tech stocks matter more than ever for broad market indexes because their immense size means they can influence the S&amp;P 500 almost by themselves. Five Big Tech companies make up nearly 23% of the index\u2019s entire value.</p><p> One big factor that remains in the stock market\u2019s favor is the Federal Reserve, which continues to pump aid into the economy. It has slashed short-term interest rates to record lows and bought up all kinds of bonds to support markets. It also said recently it will keep delivering stimulus even if inflation rises above its target level, as long as inflation had been well under it before then.</p><p> A report on Friday showed that inflation remains low, though it was higher than economists expected. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in August from a year earlier, a shade above the 1.2% that investors were expecting.</p><p> The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.66% from 0.68% late Thursday.</p><p> Unprecedented amounts of aid from Congress, along with the Federal Reserve, also helped the stock market halt its nearly 34% plummet in late March.</p><p> But it looks less likely by the day that Congress will approve more support for the limping economy before the November elections, even though investors say such stimulus is crucial after unemployment benefits and other stimulus has expired. Senate Democrats on Thursday shot down a scaled-back package proposed by Republicans, saying it shortchanged too many needs.</p><p> Investors are also worried about all the uncertainty that elections bring generally, which can result in big changes for tax laws and regulations that affect corporate profits. Concerns are likewise high about trade tensions between the United States and China, among other major economies, and whether the expectations building for a coming COVID-19 vaccine prove to be too optimistic.</p><p> European stock markets made modest moves. The German DAX was close to flat, and the French CAC 40 rose 0.2%. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5%</p><p> Asian markets were stronger.

It kept swinging up and down after that, the latest examples of the lightning-quick shifts in momentum that have rocked Wall Street recently. Through the tumultuous week, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.5% to clinch its its first back-to-back weekly loss in four months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market\u2019s recent selling, lost 66.05, or 0.6%, to 10,853.55 after also flip-flopping between gains and losses. Its 4.1% drop for the week was its worst since market panic was peaking about the coronavirus and stocks hit a bottom in late March.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.06, or 0.5%, to 27,665.64, but not before careening between a gain of 294 points and a loss of 86 points.</p><p>Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties is what to do with Big Tech stocks, which critics have long said were due for a slide after soaring too high through the summer.</p><p>\u201cThe technology sell-off continues,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is anything more than a technical pullback that\u2019s cleansing. It\u2019s healthy and was anticipated.\u201d</p><p>Apple, Amazon and others soared through the pandemic as their businesses boomed despite the recession. The coronavirus accelerated a shift to online life that\u2019s benefited them, and a pile-on of investors into Big Tech sent their share prices soaring to levels that critics said were overvalued.</p><p>Apple had a nearly irrepressible run this summer where it rose in 12 out of 13 weeks. Zoom Video Communications surged above $450 per share earlier this month after starting the year at less than $70.</p><p>That all came to an abrupt halt last week. Worries that the stocks had gotten overheated helped send the S&amp;P 500 to its worst three-day run in nearly three months, and the Nasdaq composite slid 10%. Tech stocks recovered a bit on Wednesday, and they seemed to regain their stride Thursday morning, only for an afternoon swoon to batter them again.</p><p>On Friday, tech stocks again swung from gains to losses. The fluctuations came even after Oracle reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. After leaping as much as 7.9% in the morning, its stock slipped 0.6%.</p><p>Big Tech and the high-growth area of the stock market \"just got ahead of itself,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how it got there, it matters that it got there and now we\u2019re kind of deflating that overvaluation a little bit.\u201d</p><p>After rising as much as 1.5% shortly after trading began, Apple fell back to a loss of 1.3%. It dropped 7.4% over the week, its worst since March. Movements for it and other Big Tech stocks matter more than ever for broad market indexes because their immense size means they can influence the S&amp;P 500 almost by themselves. Five Big Tech companies make up nearly 23% of the index\u2019s entire value.</p><p>One big factor that remains in the stock market\u2019s favor is the Federal Reserve, which continues to pump aid into the economy. It has slashed short-term interest rates to record lows and bought up all kinds of bonds to support markets. It also said recently it will keep delivering stimulus even if inflation rises above its target level, as long as inflation had been well under it before then.</p><p>A report on Friday showed that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/09f76f08edbf9afaeb984ddb7f3c9121\">inflation</url> remains low, though it was higher than economists expected. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in August from a year earlier, a shade above the 1.2% that investors were expecting.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.66% from 0.68% late Thursday.</p><p>Unprecedented amounts of aid from Congress, along with the Federal Reserve, also helped the stock market halt its nearly 34% plummet in late March.</p><p>But it looks less likely by the day that Congress will approve more support for the limping economy before the November elections, even though investors say such stimulus is crucial after unemployment benefits and other stimulus has expired. Senate Democrats on Thursday <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/3588901312dec9607b6cd22bc83029c2\">shot down</url> a scaled-back package proposed by Republicans, saying it shortchanged too many needs.</p><p>Investors are also worried about all the uncertainty that elections bring generally, which can result in big changes for tax laws and regulations that affect corporate profits. Concerns are likewise high about trade tensions between the United States and China, among other major economies, and whether the expectations building for a coming COVID-19 vaccine prove to be too optimistic.</p><p>European stock markets made modest moves. The German DAX was close to flat, and the French CAC 40 rose 0.2%. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5%</p><p>Asian markets were stronger. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.7%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.8% and stocks in Shanghai added 0.8%. The Kospi in South Korea was close to flat.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-84d02eb7aee3698d59e551ca21b65aea20200911</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TD-Y701-JC5B-G1FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><timeReceived>8:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It kept swinging up and down after that, the latest examples of the lightning-quick shifts in momentum that have rocked Wall Street recently. Through the tumultuous week, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.5% to clinch its its first back-to-back weekly loss in four months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market\u2019s recent selling, lost 66.05, or 0.6%, to 10,853.55 after also flip-flopping between gains and losses. Its 4.1% drop for the week was its worst since market panic was peaking about the coronavirus and stocks hit a bottom in late March.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.06, or 0.5%, to 27,665.64, but not before careening between a gain of 294 points and a loss of 86 points.</p><p>Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties is what to do with Big Tech stocks, which critics have long said were due for a slide after soaring too high through the summer.</p><p>\u201cThe technology sell-off continues,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is anything more than a technical pullback that\u2019s cleansing. It\u2019s healthy and was anticipated.\u201d</p><p>Apple, Amazon and others soared through the pandemic as their businesses boomed despite the recession. The coronavirus accelerated a shift to online life that\u2019s benefited them, and a pile-on of investors into Big Tech sent their share prices soaring to levels that critics said were overvalued.</p><p>Apple had a nearly irrepressible run this summer where it rose in 12 out of 13 weeks. Zoom Video Communications surged above $450 per share earlier this month after starting the year at less than $70.</p><p>That all came to an abrupt halt last week. Worries that the stocks had gotten overheated helped send the S&amp;P 500 to its worst three-day run in nearly three months, and the Nasdaq composite slid 10%. Tech stocks recovered a bit on Wednesday, and they seemed to regain their stride Thursday morning, only for an afternoon swoon to batter them again.</p><p>On Friday, tech stocks again swung from gains to losses. The fluctuations came even after Oracle reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. After leaping as much as 7.9% in the morning, its stock slipped 0.6%.</p><p>Big Tech and the high-growth area of the stock market \"just got ahead of itself,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how it got there, it matters that it got there and now we\u2019re kind of deflating that overvaluation a little bit.\u201d</p><p>After rising as much as 1.5% shortly after trading began, Apple fell back to a loss of 1.3%. It dropped 7.4% over the week, its worst since March. Movements for it and other Big Tech stocks matter more than ever for broad market indexes because their immense size means they can influence the S&amp;P 500 almost by themselves. Five Big Tech companies make up nearly 23% of the index\u2019s entire value.</p><p>One big factor that remains in the stock market\u2019s favor is the Federal Reserve, which continues to pump aid into the economy. It has slashed short-term interest rates to record lows and bought up all kinds of bonds to support markets. It also said recently it will keep delivering stimulus even if inflation rises above its target level, as long as inflation had been well under it before then.</p><p>A report on Friday showed that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/09f76f08edbf9afaeb984ddb7f3c9121\">inflation</url> remains low, though it was higher than economists expected. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in August from a year earlier, a shade above the 1.2% that investors were expecting.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.66% from 0.68% late Thursday.</p><p>Unprecedented amounts of aid from Congress, along with the Federal Reserve, also helped the stock market halt its nearly 34% plummet in late March.</p><p>But it looks less likely by the day that Congress will approve more support for the limping economy before the November elections, even though investors say such stimulus is crucial after unemployment benefits and other stimulus has expired. Senate Democrats on Thursday <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/3588901312dec9607b6cd22bc83029c2\">shot down</url> a scaled-back package proposed by Republicans, saying it shortchanged too many needs.</p><p>Investors are also worried about all the uncertainty that elections bring generally, which can result in big changes for tax laws and regulations that affect corporate profits. Concerns are likewise high about trade tensions between the United States and China, among other major economies, and whether the expectations building for a coming COVID-19 vaccine prove to be too optimistic.</p><p>European stock markets made modest moves. The German DAX was close to flat, and the French CAC 40 rose 0.2%. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5%</p><p>Asian markets were stronger. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.7%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.8% and stocks in Shanghai added 0.8%. The Kospi in South Korea was close to flat.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-84d02eb7aee3698d59e551ca21b65aea20200911</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TD-Y7T1-JC5B-G1FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><timeReceived>8:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.78, or 0.1%, to 3,340.97, but only after a roller-coaster day where a gain of 0.9% gave way to a loss of 0.9%. It kept swinging up and down after that, the latest examples of the lightning-quick shifts in momentum that have rocked Wall Street recently. Through the tumultuous week, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.5% to clinch its its first back-to-back weekly loss in four months.    The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market's recent selling, lost 66.05, or 0.6%, to 10,853.55 after also flip-flopping between gains and losses. Its 4.1% drop for the week was its worst since market panic was peaking about the coronavirus and stocks hit a bottom in late March.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.06, or 0.5%, to 27,665.64, but not before careening between a gain of 294 points and a loss of 86 points.    Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties is what to do with Big Tech stocks, which critics have long said were due for a slide after soaring too high through the summer.    \"The technology sell-off continues,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. \"We don't think this is anything more than a technical pullback that's cleansing. It's healthy and was anticipated.\"    Apple, Amazon and others soared through the pandemic as their businesses boomed despite the recession. The coronavirus accelerated a shift to online life that's benefited them, and a pile-on of investors into Big Tech sent their share prices soaring to levels that critics said were overvalued.    Apple had a nearly irrepressible run this summer where it rose in 12 out of 13 weeks. Zoom Video Communications surged above $450 per share earlier this month after starting the year at less than $70.    That all came to an abrupt halt last week. Worries that the stocks had gotten overheated helped send the S&amp;P 500 to its worst three-day run in nearly three months, and the Nasdaq composite slid 10%. Tech stocks recovered a bit on Wednesday, and they seemed to regain their stride Thursday morning, only for an afternoon swoon to batter them again.    On Friday, tech stocks again swung from gains to losses. The fluctuations came even after Oracle reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. After leaping as much as 7.9% in the morning, its stock slipped 0.6%.    Big Tech and the high-growth area of the stock market \"just got ahead of itself,\" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede. \"It doesn't matter how it got there, it matters that it got there and now we're kind of deflating that overvaluation a little bit.\"    After rising as much as 1.5% shortly after trading began, Apple fell back to a loss of 1.3%. It dropped 7.4% over the week, its worst since March. Movements for it and other Big Tech stocks matter more than ever for broad market indexes because their immense size means they can influence the S&amp;P 500 almost by themselves. Five Big Tech companies make up nearly 23% of the index's entire value.    One big factor that remains in the stock market's favor is the Federal Reserve, which continues to pump aid into the economy. It has slashed short-term interest rates to record lows and bought up all kinds of bonds to support markets. It also said recently it will keep delivering stimulus even if inflation rises above its target level, as long as inflation had been well under it before then.    A report on Friday showed that inflation remains low, though it was higher than economists expected. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in August from a year earlier, a shade above the 1.2% that investors were expecting.    The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.66% from 0.68% late Thursday.    Unprecedented amounts of aid from Congress, along with the Federal Reserve, also helped the stock market halt its nearly 34% plummet in late March.    But it looks less likely by the day that Congress will approve more support for the limping economy before the November elections, even though investors say such stimulus is crucial after unemployment benefits and other stimulus has expired. Senate Democrats on Thursday shot down a scaled-back package proposed by Republicans, saying it shortchanged too many needs.    Investors are also worried about all the uncertainty that elections bring generally, which can result in big changes for tax laws and regulations that affect corporate profits. Concerns are likewise high about trade tensions between the United States and China, among other major economies, and whether the expectations building for a coming COVID-19 vaccine prove to be too optimistic.

The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.78, or 0.1%, to 3,340.97, but only after a roller-coaster day where a gain of 0.9% gave way to a loss of 0.9%. It kept swinging up and down after that, the latest examples of the lightning-quick shifts in momentum that have rocked Wall Street recently. Through the tumultuous week, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.5% to clinch its its first back-to-back weekly loss in four months.    The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market\u2019s recent selling, lost 66.05, or 0.6%, to 10,853.55 after also flip-flopping between gains and losses. Its 4.1% drop for the week was its worst since market panic was peaking about the coronavirus and stocks hit a bottom in late March.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.06, or 0.5%, to 27,665.64, but not before careening between a gain of 294 points and a loss of 86 points.    Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties is what to do with Big Tech stocks, which critics have long said were due for a slide after soaring too high through the summer.    \u201cThe technology sell-off continues,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this is anything more than a technical pullback that\u2019s cleansing. It\u2019s healthy and was anticipated.\u201d    Apple, Amazon and others soared through the pandemic as their businesses boomed despite the recession. The coronavirus accelerated a shift to online life that\u2019s benefited them, and a pile-on of investors into Big Tech sent their share prices soaring to levels that critics said were overvalued.    Apple had a nearly irrepressible run this summer where it rose in 12 out of 13 weeks. Zoom Video Communications surged above $450 per share earlier this month after starting the year at less than $70.    That all came to an abrupt halt last week. Worries that the stocks had gotten overheated helped send the S&amp;P 500 to its worst three-day run in nearly three months, and the Nasdaq composite slid 10%. Tech stocks recovered a bit on Wednesday, and they seemed to regain their stride Thursday morning, only for an afternoon swoon to batter them again.    On Friday, tech stocks again swung from gains to losses. The fluctuations came even after Oracle reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. After leaping as much as 7.9% in the morning, its stock slipped 0.6%.    Big Tech and the high-growth area of the stock market \"just got ahead of itself,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how it got there, it matters that it got there and now we\u2019re kind of deflating that overvaluation a little bit.\u201d    After rising as much as 1.5% shortly after trading began, Apple fell back to a loss of 1.3%. It dropped 7.4% over the week, its worst since March. Movements for it and other Big Tech stocks matter more than ever for broad market indexes because their immense size means they can influence the S&amp;P 500 almost by themselves. Five Big Tech companies make up nearly 23% of the index\u2019s entire value.    One big factor that remains in the stock market\u2019s favor is the Federal Reserve, which continues to pump aid into the economy. It has slashed short-term interest rates to record lows and bought up all kinds of bonds to support markets. It also said recently it will keep delivering stimulus even if inflation rises above its target level, as long as inflation had been well under it before then.    A report on Friday showed that inflationremains low, though it was higher than economists expected. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in August from a year earlier, a shade above the 1.2% that investors were expecting.    The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.66% from 0.68% late Thursday.    Unprecedented amounts of aid from Congress, along with the Federal Reserve, also helped the stock market halt its nearly 34% plummet in late March.    But it looks less likely by the day that Congress will approve more support for the limping economy before the November elections, even though investors say such stimulus is crucial after unemployment benefits and other stimulus has expired. Senate Democrats on Thursday shot downa scaled-back package proposed by Republicans, saying it shortchanged too many needs.    Investors are also worried about all the uncertainty that elections bring generally, which can result in big changes for tax laws and regulations that affect corporate profits. Concerns are likewise high about trade tensions between the United States and China, among other major economies, and whether the expectations building for a coming COVID-19 vaccine prove to be too optimistic.    European stock markets made modest moves. The German DAX was close to flat, and the French CAC 40 rose 0.2%. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5%    Asian markets were stronger. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.7%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.8% and stocks in Shanghai added 0.8%. The Kospi in South Korea was close to flat.    ___    AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43054811669</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TK-PCH1-JCSC-J3JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NBC Chicago</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Federated Hermes Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federated Hermes Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federated Hermes Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zoom Video Communications Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>3KC</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>3KC</className><className>DUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FHI</className><className>NYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ZM</className><className>NAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>5ZM</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>5ZM</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>5ZM</className><className>BER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>5ZM</className><className>DUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ZOOM</className><className>WBO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>5ZM</className><className>MUN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>5ZM</className><className>HAM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>5ZM</className><className>HAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ZM</className><className>MEX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>Hearings &amp;

Meanwhile, the steep decline in the value of the pound against the dollar makes sales to U.K. consumers worth less when translated back into U.S. firms' home currency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Economists at investment bank Goldman Sachs estimate that the U.K.'s gross domestic product, a broad measure of all the goods and services produced in the country, will grow by 1.5 percent this year, down from a previous estimate of 2 percent growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the Northwest's biggest technology companies, including Microsoft, Amazon.com and Expedia, the U.K. accounts for an estimated 5 to 10 percent of their global sales.</p><p>Goldman analysts say Brexit's impact will likely translate to a drop of about 1 percent in global sales.</p><p>Companies' list of potential concerns goes beyond broad economic trends.</p><p>Regulations governing cross-border movement of workers could affect companies that use the U.K. as a significant hub, including Microsoft's 5,000-strong sales, marketing and research arm there, and Tableau's London office, a cornerstone of the fast-growing data-visualization software company's international presence.</p><p>Possible tougher immigration regulations concern Seattle startups as well. The companies often set up London offices as their first foray into Europe, given the shared-language advantage.</p><p>Raja Mukerji, co-founder and president of Seattle-based IT operations and analytics company ExtraHop, said the vote was \"jarring.\"</p><p>Technology is increasingly used to connect people and trade around the world, and he was surprised to see the U.K. retract from those growing connections.</p><p>\"As a technologist - one who was raised in the U.K. - I'd hoped to see the U.K. embrace the Information Age rather than run from it,\" Mukerji said.</p><p>Startups and big tech companies alike are also anxious to see what impact Brexit might bring to regulations that control data centers, especially involving data-privacy laws. Many of these are already confusing; some countries require data to be stored within their borders, others have more relaxed laws.</p><p>The EU lets much data about EU residents be stored in any one country across the region. Britain's exit may force a change or review of its agreement.</p><p>That could mean companies from Microsoft to smaller firms may have to re-evaluate where they store what data.</p><p>\"With the passing of Brexit, there is little doubt that (EU) regulations and requirements will grow significantly more complex,\" said Mark Mader, CEO of Smartsheet, a Bellevue project-management software company.</p><p>Coming next to the internet: videos of people eating.</p><p>Twitch, the popular Amazon.com-owned video website best known as a portal for people to broadcast playing video games while chatting with fans, is adding a \"Social Eating\" category to its lineup of video streams.</p><p>Broadcasters on the service \"will be able to socialize with their viewers over their favorite meals,\" the company said in a media release. Amazon bought San Francisco-based Twitch for $1 billion in 2014.</p><p>Twitch says food-consumption videos are popular among South Korean users of the site. South Korea has been a trailblazer of other internet age trends that later caught on elsewhere, including e-sports, or competitive video gaming.</p><p>A visit to the new Twitch section Friday morning showed a couple-dozen live streams in English. One broadcaster showed off placing a pizza order, waiting for delivery and eating the pie. Another showed a guinea pig chowing down on some greens. At one point, that stream had 58 viewers.</p><p>Air travelers know it's possible to cut through those horrible airport security lines designed to protect us from terrorism - as long as they pay.</p><p>Now a private company is coming to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport offering a new shortcut via biometric technology.</p><p>But the price is steep.</p><p>Frequent travelers are likely familiar with the Transportation Security Administration's PreCheck program. You pay $85, go through an interview and a background check, and then for five years you can take a much shorter line through security.</p><p>And you get to keep your laptop in your bag and your shoes on your feet.</p><p>Now CLEAR, a private New York company, is setting up technology at Sea-Tac in early July to bypass that prior part of the line where TSA personnel inspect your driver's license or passport to establish your identity.</p><p>CLEAR's biometric iris- and fingerprint-scanning technology will identify you without paperwork.</p><p>People will be able to enroll at the airport, then use the technology to bypass the ID line and go straight into the baggage-search line when passing through Sea-Tac or any other airports where CLEAR has set up.</p><p>Right now, the list of U.S. airports with CLEAR is hardly comprehensive. The biggest are San Francisco, San Jose, Denver, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston.</p><p>And the price? A subscription is $15 per month. Every month.</p><p>That seems a big ask, given that the ID part of the security process takes just a moment while you are waiting in line anyway for the much-longer baggage search.</p><p>For the rich and well-traveled, who likely already have TSA PreCheck, it may be a no-brainer.</p><p>For everyone else, CLEAR makes the TSA PreCheck program look like a steal.</p><p>The nation's cities are always ranked for being the biggest and the greatest. One list released last week went small and two Washington cities measured up.</p><p>Kirkland and Burien cracked a list of top 10 fastest-growing small cities in the U.S., according to career advice website zippia.com. Kirkland ranked No. 2 and Burien No. 10.</p><p>Zippia used census data from the 2010 and 2014 American Community Surveys to rank 3,031 small cities in America by growth rate. To qualify, the city's population has to be between 5,000 and 100,000 people.</p><p>The website found that Kirkland's population grew from less than 48,000 in 2010 to more than 83,000 in 2014, making it the second fastest-growing small city in the country, behind Zionsville, Ind. Zippia characterized Kirkland as an affordable place surrounded by nature with a bustling downtown and art scene.</p><p>The website also found that Burien's population grew from 32,743 in 2010 to 49,291 in 2014, characterizing it as a city surrounded by beautiful nature with a charming downtown and a short commute to Seattle.</p><p>While the numbers shot up, the growth of both cities has been boosted by annexation. In 2011 Kirkland annexed the Finn Hill, North Juanita and Kingsgate areas, bringing in more than 30,000 residents. Likewise, the annexation of the North Highline area brought about 17,000 into Burien.</p><p>\"We are growing, but like a lot of the communities around here we are expected to take a certain amount of growth in the urban areas and we are building a lot of development,\" said Kirkland Deputy City Manager Marilynne Beard.</p><p>Burien Communications Officer Katie Whittier echoed a similar sentiment. \"Burien is growing, we love development and we are attracting a lot of new people,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-5b4ef4603ff211e6818c18feff798553</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K5K-BSV1-JBKM-D48P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1201\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>July 3, 2016 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF3C</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION REGULATION &amp;

Beijing\u2019s ...</p><p>(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s sweeping national security law has forced technology firms to reconsider their presence in Hong Kong. The nimblest among them -- the city\u2019s startups -- are already moving data and people out or are devising plans to do so.   Beijing\u2019s polarizing law, which took effect this month, upended Hong Kong\u2019s tech scene just as it seemed on a path to becoming a regional hub. Entrepreneurs now face a wave of concern from overseas clients and suppliers about the implications of running data and internet services under the law\u2019s new regime of vastly expanded online policing powers. Many are making contingency plans and restructuring their operations away from Hong Kong.   Their actions may foreshadow similar decisions from internet giants like Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Twitter Inc., all of which confront the same set of uncertainties. The larger firms are taking time to fully assess the impact of the new law, while sentiment in the city itself is dour with about half of U.S. business people saying they plan to leave, according to a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.   Read more: U.S. Firms Worried About Hong Kong Security Law, AmCham Says   \u201cWe are now in a dilemma. If we follow the law in Hong Kong, we may violate other countries\u2019 regulations,\u201d said Ben Cheng, co-founder of software company Oursky. \u201cWe worry that people will not trust us someday if we tell them we are a Hong Kong-based company.\u201d   Twelve-year-old Oursky has already had trouble in the short period since the law came into force, with some foreign cloud service providers refusing to work with Hong Kong-based entities and reviewing the practice, Cheng said without elaborating. To circumnavigate these issues, his company will set up offices in the U.K. in about a year and then expand to Japan.   Tech companies that handle data are particularly vulnerable under the new law. Police can ask them to delete or restrict access to content deemed to endanger national security, with non-compliance punishable with a fine of HK$100,000 (around $13,000) and six months in prison for representatives of infringing publishers. Such provisions put technology companies under \u201ctremendous risk and liability,\u201d said Charles Mok, a Hong Kong lawmaker. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to these companies to be very careful. If you want to be safe and you don\u2019t want the uncertainty, then maybe you have to leave Hong Kong.\u201d   In recent years, the global financial center has grown into an attractive destination for fintech entrepreneurs, and its close proximity to Shenzhen and the so-called Greater Bay Area has helped foster research and development ties between startups and Chinese universities. Hong Kong had been expected to reach $1.7 billion in datacenter revenue by 2023, rivaling nearby Singapore whose server market brought in $1.4 billion last year, according to data from Structure Research. All that is now under threat.   More than half of Measurable AI\u2019s clients are U.S.-based. The Hong Kong firm tracks business receipts and provides transactional data to hedge funds and corporations, many of whom have expressed concern about how data trade may be affected by the Beijing law as well as Washington\u2019s retaliatory measure of rescinding Hong Kong\u2019s special trade status. \u201cRight now might be a good time for us to rethink how we can restructure or have the operations outside of Hong Kong,\u201d co-founder Heatherm Huang said, adding that the company\u2019s accelerating plans to migrate parts of its business development and sales to Singapore and New York.   \u201cDoing a startup in Hong Kong is already difficult. It\u2019s a super expensive city,\u201d Scott Salandy-Defour, co-founder of energy-tech startup Liquidstar, told Bloomberg News. Even before the new law, the situation in the city was fraught with U.S.-China tensions over everything from trade to human rights. Investors have become very cautious about people and businesses with ties to China and the new law \u201cis like the last nail in the coffin,\u201d said the entrepreneur, who is now planning to relocate to Singapore.   One founder of an edtech venture, who like several executives interviewed asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said their company had transferred all its data to portable offline storage in case there was a need to leave Hong Kong in the future.

I think after they understand the society is more stable, businesses will come back,\u201d said Terence Chong, an associate professor of economics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cHong Kong is the gateway to China. If they want to have access to China\u2019s market, it is the best place for them.\u201d Supporters of the law see it as a necessary step to restore investor and business confidence by curbing months of sometimes-violent unrest that have rocked the former British colony.   For some, the allure of closer integration with China through the Greater Bay Area is too good a chance to pass up. \u201cI think Hong Kong can still play the role it\u2019s always played, bringing international and Chinese players in technology closer together,\u201d said Tony Verb, co-founder of GreaterBay Ventures.\u201cI don\u2019t see reasons right now to run away.\u201d   \u00a92020

Tech firms can't even trust each other to play by the rules - to the extent that there are rules - as witnessed by the ongoing courtroom CEO smackdown over patents in Oracle v. Google, or Larry vs. Larry as it's known here.</p><p>\"It's a Type A world,\" explained Carl Guardino, president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents more than 360 of Silicon Valley's employers, including many tech firms. \"We don't have friends. We don't have enemies. We have frenemies.\"</p><p>Tech has a reputation for being fiercely competitive in the marketplace, but watchdogs and regulators say some of that cut-throat DNA has been turned against the little guy, with big tech firms driving up prices, stiffing workers and laughing at the law.</p><p>\"There has been all too often in the tech community a mindset, 'Gee, we know best, so just trust us,'\" said John M. Simpson, consumer advocate at the Consumer Watchdog. \"They have been driven by data and a mindset to push the envelope and a tendency to look at regulation and other constraints as mere annoyances that ought to be ignored.\"</p><p>But it's getting harder for Silicon Valley to ignore Washington. Tech companies want things from Congress - like a tax holiday on overseas earnings - and Congress wants things from them. Sometimes it's campaign contributions; sometimes it's answers about corporate wrongdoing.</p><p>Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) took Google to task last week for supplying\u00a0FCC investigators looking into the so-called Wi-Spy scandal\u00a0 \"with robotic, generic responses,\" and Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) called for a hearing. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), ranking member of the Senate's antitrust panel, said he has \"serious concerns\" about Apple and the e-book market. Meanwhile, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), called last month for antitrust officials to keep a closer eye on Google and Facebook - lest they become monopolies.</p><p>\"The high tech community has had some big victories in D.C. recently, but there are reputational concerns that many individual companies are facing and big policy battles looming,\" said one lobbyist familiar with tech issues. \"Growing and already established tech companies, especially ones that are household names, need to engage today to protect their long-term interests in Washington.\"</p><p>Some firms are trying to protect their interests in D.C. - the old fashioned way. Google spent $5 million to lobby in the first quarter of 2012 - nearly half of what the company spent in all of 2011, according to lobbying disclosures filed this weekend. Facebook, likewise, saw a big jump, although Apple's spending dropped a bit.</p><p>A congressional source noted that other industries - including health care and the airlines - have also faced questions about their anti-competitive antics, but argued that tech is enjoying a particularly disproportionate share of the spotlight due to the wow-factor of iPads and Androids. \"It's more the flavor of the moment rather than anything crazy going on in this sector,\" the Hill insider said.</p><p>Tech firms are still wildly popular with the American public - more so than politicians - with one recent ABC News/Washington Post poll putting Google's favorable rating at 82 percent, Apple's at 74 percent and Facebook's at 58 percent.</p><p>But some of the exploits outlined in court papers and regulatory findings recently may give pause to even the most ardent</p><p>Apple addict or Google groupie.</p><p>On Thursday, a federal judge in San Jose refused to dismiss a lawsuit against seven Valley companies - Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Pixar, Lucasfilm and Adobe - in which five engineers say the firms engaged in a conspiracy to eliminate competition between them for skilled labor\" with the goal of driving down pay and limiting mobility.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh found that the existence of \"Do Not Cold Call\" agreements among the companies \"supports the plausible inference that the agreements were negotiated, reached and policed at the highest levels\" of the boardrooms. The companies in 2010 settled a Justice Department lawsuit containing similar charges - without admitting wrongdoing but detailing practices they would stop.</p><p>In Silicon Valley, the devil is often in the email.</p><p>Court records detailed a reported email exchange from 2007 between the late Steve Jobs and Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt, over an apparent Google attempt to woo an engineer from Apple.</p><p>Jobs wrote to Schmidt: \"I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this.\"</p><p>Schmidt forwarded the email to others, requesting that they \"get this stopped.\"</p><p>The companies had sought to dismiss the suit on grounds that the facts didn't support the claim of an \"overarching conspiracy\" to suppress wages, that the conspiracy is implausible and that the engineers lack standing.</p><p>Neither Apple nor Google would comment for this article.</p><p>Meanwhile, a week ago, the FCC fined Google $25,000 for having \"deliberately impeded and delayed\" the agency's effort to determine whether the company ran afoul of anti-eavesdropping rules when it gathered data from home Wi-Fi networks while trying to map the world through its Street View project. The FCC accused Google of deliberately stalling the investigation, claiming at one point that searching its employee email would be too onerous. One Google employee pleaded the Fifth rather than be deposed by investigators.</p><p>A Google spokeswoman disputed the agency's \"characterization of our cooperation.\" The firm plans to file a response.</p><p>Two weeks ago, it was Apple's turn. Apple and five publishers were sued by the Justice Department for e-book price fixing in a scheme that allegedly cost consumers \"tens of millions of dollars more for e-books than they would have otherwise paid.\" Apple lawyer Daniel Floyd told a federal judge last week that the case was \"not appropriate\" and it is seeking a trial because it \"would like the case to be decided on the merits,\" according to Reuters.</p><p>Tech troubles seem to be mounting.</p><p>Google, for one, is the subject of an antitrust probe by the FTC into search services and also for allegedly bypassing privacy settings of Apple Safari browser users. Facebook, set to go public on May 17, settled an FTC case last year over its privacy practices, and it's currently embroiled in a tit-for-tat patent fight with Yahoo.</p><p>The European Commission, meanwhile, is exploring antitrust complaints against Motorola Mobility, which is being acquired by Google, over its use of standards patents in smartphone and mobile device technology to block rival products. Apple and Microsoft brought the complaints.</p><p>And as tech companies snap up patents, they are battling each other in courts around the world.</p><p>\"Mutually assured destruction\" is what antitrust attorney Gary Reback called it. \"That's the way antitrust lawyers describe it. If someone has a lot of weapons, we'll let someone else buy weapons as an offset. The problem is that the patents get into the hands of crazies and they shoot at smaller people who can't buy 20,000 patents.\"</p><p>An insider's view of the competitive atmosphere in Silicon Valley is coldly calculating, where \"companies can cooperate with each other and gouge each other's eye out and experience no dissonance,\" Reback said.</p><p>It's a long way from Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard working together in their Palo Alto garage - or even Larry Page and Sergey Brin working together on a Stanford Ph.D. project. And some caution that Washington not crush what makes Silicon Valley unique and successful.</p><p>\"The amount of damage you can do with an injunction in an industry you don't understand is pretty severe. So you want to make sure you're right,\" Hovenkamp, the law professor said.</p><p>Silicon Valley knows it may have to man up for its missteps.</p><p>\"Everyone loves startups, everyone loves small business - unless and until you have the temerity to be successful and grow large. Then the gloves are off,\" said Silicon Valley Leadership Group's Guardino. \"In a sense, that's OK. As we mature, we are even more accountable for all of our actions as well as all of our deeds and misdeeds.\"\u00a0</p><p>This article first appeared on POLITICO Pro at 5:30 a.m. on April 23, 2012.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-75498</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55GF-RJB1-F118-90H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1523\"/><timeReceived>5:39 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2012  Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>April 23, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CJ</classCode><className>JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000408</classCode><className>CORPORATE WRONGDOING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N926110GJ</classCode><className>CONSUMER PROTECTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DDG6</classCode><className>CONSUMER WATCHDOGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZBY</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><className>International Trade Law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJX1</classCode><className>FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N922120CC</classCode><className>LAW ENFORCEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000369</classCode><className>CONSPIRACY</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0FGMDkyQTE0NTI1NEUyNkE0NjUxM0E2OTBDQjQ0NUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBMzM3QjFDOTcxNENCNzhBNTE0MzVGMzBBMzdERUY</classCode><className>Conspiracy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>N611310QM</classCode><className>LAW SCHOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000649</classCode><className>ESPIONAGE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000CTIZ</classCode><className>SCANDALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

The act, scheduled to be released as a formal proposal before the end of the year, will also include new rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that could curb the power of big tech.   \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42562693922</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B0-PHY1-F07F-84P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"293\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>BNN Bloomberg</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0001O57</classCode><className>BLOOMBERG LP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The firm is among tech companies in firing line over data breaches. AFP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cast your mind back 15 years and consider this: how much of your personal information was readily available to strangers?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook had just launched. The iPhone was still over three years away. Yes, you probably had a few loyalty cards and \u2013 whisper it \u2013 maybe even a Myspace account, but you could attend a job interview confident in the knowledge that an embarrassing photo of you wasn't lurking on the internet waiting to be found. You could also be reasonably certain that the prosaic personal data you had shared was relatively safe.</p><p>As we approach 2020, everything has changed. Most of us volunteer so much information today that a 20:20 vision of us can be created from our activity online. From spending habits to political persuasions, via health, wealth, family and relationships, almost nothing is sacred. What's more, this information is looking increasingly vulnerable.</p><p>At Gisec in Dubai last week, hacker Kevin Mitnick showed stunned delegates how easy it is to break open entire networks and plunder their content. Reports described his presentation as \"eye-opening\" but given recent revelations from the world of Big Tech, it should also have been unsurprising. As we digitise our lives, digesting and divesting information wherever we go, our individual data trails are becoming unmanageably long.</p><p>The bad news for tech companies is that governments are waking up. There is growing recognition from those businesses with most to lose that perhaps they have more to gain by admitting they need help; even if that request encompasses a desire to share responsibility and blame. A problem shared is a problem halved \u2013 at the very least.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg began his campaign in earnest last week, with an OpEd in The Washington Post aimed at getting his platform ahead of future internet regulation. It came with a plethora of Facebook announcements, partly as a reaction to criticism of its inability prevent the spread of horrifying live footage broadcast during the Christchurch Mosque killings.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg called for \"new rules\" for the internet, focusing on harmful content alongside legislation to safeguard elections, privacy and data. All very valid points, but as Facebook furiously wiggles the bolts on its stable doors, it is hard to escape the view that numerous prize stallions have already galloped away.</p><p>In fact, one such horse was still prancing about outside: as Mr Zuckerberg's plan was published, cybersecurity firm UpGuard announced it had found hundreds of millions of Facebook records held \"in plain sight\" on Amazon's cloud computing service.</p><p>It's not just about data privacy; social media's role in influencing politics remains an unanswered question. The Mueller Enquiry may have found little evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia ahead of the 2016 elections, but US intelligence experts have already concluded Russian digital interference took place.</p><p>Meanwhile, I have been camped outside the UK Houses of Parliament for the past three weeks as the country tears itself apart over Brexit. Digital disinformation may have played a key role there too: a UK parliamentary committee enquiry into fake news was highly critical of the Leave campaign and described British electoral law as \"not fit for purpose\" in the digital age.</p><p>Britain and America are just two examples among many. In the face of this, social media firms like Facebook face a huge challenge to regain trust. Even those with an intimate understanding of Facebook are raising the alarm. \"Things that are good for us individually, fun for us, can still cause us great harm,\" Roger Macnamee, a former mentor of Mr Zuckerberg, told me recently. \"We have to find a balance that protects people from the harm that's caused by them.\"</p><p>\"Technology has taken a bad turn,\" he continued. \"It used to be about empowering people. Steve Jobs used to say it was like a bicycle for the mind. We need to get back to that.\"</p><p>The question is, how? Investors appeared to snooze through Facebook's announcements last week, as well as new revelations of data privacy laxity. Herein lies the rub: when investors don't punish social media companies by selling stock, when advertisers don't shift their budgets, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 when we as users don't delete our accounts, there is little incentive for change. Facebook remains the dominant social channel in the UAE, where over 97 per cent use it.</p><p>The past 15 years have seen a technological shift, but also a cultural one; many people appear too relaxed or simply unaware they are trading data and privacy in exchange for social connectivity. The algorithms involved have also created an echo chamber of like-minded views that makes us vulnerable to misinformation. A recent study by SIS and McAfee showed the UAE is among those countries being particularly targeted by cybercriminals.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg called for \"global action\" in his OpEd. Perhaps he is right; but we shouldn't wait for Big Tech or governments to step up.</p><p>The onus is on us, and we owe it to ourselves and the next generation to act fast.</p><p>First Move with Julia Chatterley airs weekdays at 6pm on CNN International</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/88/155488340236.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/88/155488340236.jpg</url></p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.

PHOTO: Alex Brandon/Associated Press</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - Momentum is gaining in Washington for a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of the largest technology companies to collect and make money off people's personal data. A national law, the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies would need permission to release such information. If it takes effect, a law would also likely shrink Big Tech's profits from its lucrative business of making personal data available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target. </p><p>Behind the drive for a law is rising concern over the compromise of private data held by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have earned riches by aggregating consumer information. The industry traditionally has been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation. Support for a privacy law is part of a broader effort by regulators and lawmakers to lessen the domination of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Some, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, have called for the tech giants to be split up. The Trump White House has said in the past that it could endorse a broad data privacy law. The big tech companies have been nervously eyeing a tough privacy law taking effect next year in California. That measure will allow Californians to see the personal data being collected on them and where it's being distributed and to forbid the sale of it. With some exceptions, consumers could also request that their personal information be deleted entirely. Whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges is expected to be less stringent than the California measure and to supersede it. As a result, the tech industry is trying to help shape any national restrictions. \"This is the first time ever that the industry wants legislation,\" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. \"The industry is terrified.\" On Tuesday, a House committee will press Google and Facebook executives about another urgent concern involving Big Tech: Whether they're doing enough to curb the spread of hate crimes and white nationalism through online platforms. The Judiciary Committee hearing follows a series of violent incidents fueled in part by online communication. Facebook, used by 2-billion-plus people including over 200 million in the U.S., has been a particular lightning rod for industry critics. Having had its reputation tarnished over data privacy lapses, a tide of hate speech and a spread of disinformation that allowed Russian agents to target propaganda campaigns, Facebook appears ready to embrace a national privacy law. Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, published a column last month in the Washington Post calling for tighter regulations to protect consumer data, control harmful content and ensure election integrity and data portability. \"The internet,\" Zuckerberg wrote, \"needs new rules.\" Amazon says it has built its business on protecting people's information, \"and we have been working with policymakers on how best to do that.\" \"There is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection,\" Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, has said in a policy paper. \"Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation.\" A sweeping \"privacy shield\" law in the European Union, covering how tech companies handle personal data in the 28-country bloc, should be a model, Zuckerberg wrote. EU regulators recently fined Google $1.7 billion for freezing out rivals in the online ad business - their third penalty against the search giant in two years. The EU watchdogs have also ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook for providing misleading information in its acquisition of WhatsApp. On Monday, Britain unveiled plans to vastly increase government oversight of social media companies, with a watchdog that could fine executives or even ban companies that fail to block such content as terrorist propaganda and images of child abuse. The entire debate cuts to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable commerce in online users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to the individuals they want to reach. Facebook drew 99 percent of its revenue from advertising last year. For Google's parent Alphabet, it was 85 percent, according to Scott Kessler of the research firm CFRA. Amazon doesn't just sell products online; it provides ad space, too. The company doesn't say how much but has said that the \"other\" revenue in its financial reports is mainly from ads. Its \"other\" revenue topped $10 billion last year. The tech giants' problematic relationship with advertisers was spotlighted by action regulators took last month. The Department of Housing and Urban Development filed civil charges against Facebook, accusing it of allowing landlords and real estate brokers to exclude certain racial or ethnic groups from seeing ads for houses and apartments. Facebook could face penalties. The company has separately agreed to overhaul its ad targeting system and end some of the practices noted by HUD to prevent discrimination in housing listings as well as credit and employment ads.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN66044770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVH-T1M1-JC8S-D2BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

It's why NSPCC Cymru/Wales has long called for, through our Wild West Web campaign, an independent regulator, safe accounts for children and detailed reporting on how tech firms are keeping children safe.</p><p>Emma Motherwell Local Campaigns Manager NSPCC Cymru</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WESTML-157474225</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WESTML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6M-1H61-DYTY-C1B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244366</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"220\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Western Mail and Echo Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Western Mail</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLG6</classCode><className>CHILD SAFETY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926130QJ</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926130QJ</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

British Prime Minister Theresa May has been particularly active in accusing tech companies of not doing enough to keep extremists off their platforms and has called for international regulation to force the companies to do more.</p><p>The companies, for their part, have recently been highlighting their progress in using artificial intelligence and tools like the shared hash database to identify and remove terrorist content faster. Last week, Facebook officials said in a blog post that their automated systems spotted 99 per cent of the ISIL and al-Qaida-related content the social network removes before the offending posts were flagged by users - and that in some cases the system was able to prevent the content from ever being published in the first place.</p><p>Twitter said in September that it also removed 99 per cent of terrorist posts without relying on user complaints. YouTube said that, as of November, its algorithms automatically spotted about 83 per cent of the terrorist-related content that the company removes. As a result, terrorist groups have increasingly shifted their efforts to smaller social media platforms.</p><p>The four big tech companies said Ask.fm, Cloudinary, Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook, Justpaste.it, LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, Oath, and Snap Inc. were going to begin participating in the shared terrorist content hash database.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2017120544368933</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R41-PM51-F105-630V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"398\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

A big part of that shift stems from tech companies' rapid buildout of cloud storage centers and a move to burnish their public image by vowing they'll run these centers on sources like wind and solar.</p><p>Rather than lose these deep-pocketed customers, the nation's power companies are changing policies and crafting deals that meet increased demands for renewable energy, in some cases shifting away from traditional electricity supplies like coal and natural gas. Even in coal mining states like West Virginia.</p><p>\"We have the ability to shape the market,\" said Michael Terrell, head of Google Energy Policy. If you build it, we will come.</p><p>Last year, the top four corporate users of renewable energy in the world were Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Google announced this month that as of 2017, all its facilities and data centers were running on 100% renewable electricity.</p><p>Coal declining</p><p>A practice of insisting power companies offer wind- and solar-sourced power supplies is spreading to other sectors Walmart, GM and Budweiser all have goals to run more of their global business off renewable energy.</p><p>This is bad news for the struggling coal industry. Coal producers have seen their share of U.S. power generation decrease since 2008, even as the <person><nameText>Trump Administration </nameText></person>has promised to roll back what it considers hostile environmental regulations.</p><p>The coal industry has said it now knows that at least the government is not going to discourage production, and it's only got to deal with the marketplace.</p><p>The problem is that a growing portion of the marketplace is demanding green energy.</p><p>There's no federal or state law out there today that says you must do this, but there are boards of directors that say We want to set a carbon footprint goal for our companies,' said Appalachian Power President and COO Chris Beam.</p><p>In December, the Charleston, W.Va-based utility contracted with Bluff Point Wind Energy Center in Indiana to buy 120 megawatts of wind-generated electricity, green power it can now offer to companies that are making it a core requirement on where they'll site their businesses, Beam said.</p><p>Today Appalachian Power generates 61% of its electricity by burning coal and 5% from wind and solar. By 2031, Beam says he hopes to get that mix to 51% coal and 25% wind and solar.</p><p>There's also a trickle-down effect. Big tech companies are pushing their suppliers to go green. Apple, which said last month that 100% of the electricity it uses for its facilities and data centers comes from renewables, says nearly two dozen of its suppliers such as manufacturers of batteries, keyboards and lenses have also made a commitment to 100% renewable energy.</p><p>The smart ones are seeing it as a competitive advantage, said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives and former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama Administration.</p><p>They know they have an edge in competing for Apple's business.\"</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft in Virginia</p><p>The biggest energy companies are changing their policies to court big tech energy buyers, who can often promise 20-year contracts.</p><p>Three years ago, Amazon wanted to build a new data center in northern Virginia. Because of its commitment to 100% renewable energy, it required that center to be run on electricity generated by wind or solar.</p><p>Richmond, Va.-based Dominion Energy, the local utility, didn't have any way for Amazon to source all its electricity from solar. So it created a special power purchase agreement that allowed the Seattle company to contract for 100% renewable electricity, something that wasn't previously possible in Virginia.</p><p>\"We thought about it, we understood their reasoning, we convinced ourselves that it was in our best interests to do it and we ended up signing,\" said Greg Morgan, director of customer rates and regulations for Dominion.</p><p>Last month Microsoft announced it is contracting to buy electricity from a giant solar array in Virginia in what will be the largest ever corporate purchase of solar energy in the United States and will double the state's solar capacity.</p><p>Other buyers are following. When it goes online in 2019, the solar array in Spotsylvania county, southwest of Washington D.C, will produce 500 megawatts of electricity, with Microsoft buying 315 megawatts. Customers are already lined up for the megawatts it won't be using, said Microsoft. The deal will bring Microsoft's total purchase of renewable energy globally up to 1.2 gigawatts.</p><p>A public shaming</p><p>The tech push towards renewable began in earnest in 2011, when Greenpeace released a report calling out data centers for being huge users of electricity created by non-renewable sources. It came at an opportune time. Going green fit tech's corporate ethos. The companies were also flush with cash, making it easier for them to make choices that at least in the beginning were more expensive.</p><p>\"Over the last few years, the tech companies have knowingly and willingly paid a premium for green power and they've been willing to do so because it advanced their self-stated goals,\" said Dominion's Morgan.</p><p>Data centers that store racks of iCloud and Google Photos servers use just 1.8% of the United States' overall energy, according to Arman Shehabi, author of a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 2016 report on data center energy usage.</p><p>But demand to source these from green energy has changed the mix.</p><p>Close to 50% of corporate investment in offsite renewable energy in the United States has been from tech companies, the highest of all market segments, said John Hoekstra, vice president at Schneider Electric, a Paris-based energy management and automation company.</p><p>Walmart, Budweiser</p><p>But other big corporate buyers of electricity have set similar goals. Walmart was one of the first Fortune 500 companies to make a commitment to going 100% renewable, in 2005, said Sam Kimmins at The Climate Group and head of RE100, which sets standards for companies making green energy commitments. Walmart recently said it gets 28% of its global electric needs from renewable energy and wants to hit 50% by 2025.</p><p>Last year Budweiser announced that it would be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2025. General Motors plans to get there by 2050.</p><p>It's become such a movement that last year, U.S. corporations bought more renewable power than utilities did, said Timothy Fox, vice president at ClearView Energy Partners, an energy consulting company.</p><p>Today, corporate America is happy to throw its weight around, said Bryn Baker, the World Wildlife Fund's deputy director of renewable energy. \"Companies are coming in and saying, 'If you want us to be here, you have to give us access to clean energy.'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122034873</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5S-1541-JCBF-S4MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1202\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 22, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Needless to say, the election of Donald Trump had made them very, very upset.</p><p>Google co-founder Sergey Brin is seen trying to calm the crowd but admits he is \u201cdeeply offended\u201d by the election of Donald Trump. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d Brin said, \u201cmost people here are pretty upset and pretty sad because of the election.</p><p>\u201cMyself as an immigrant and a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive,\u201d he said.</p><p>Google CFO Ruth Porat teared up as she described hearing the news that Hillary Clinton had lost the election. She then promised that Google would \u201cuse the great strength and resources and reach we have to continue to advance really important values.\u201d</p><p>VP for Global Affairs Kent Walker suggested Trump voters were motivated by \u201cfear, xenophobia, hatred and a desire for answers that may or may not be there.\u201d</p><p>In a profoundly pathetic moment, a Google employee implored some of the gathered to improve themselves, saying, \u201cSpeaking to white men, there\u2019s an opportunity for you right now to understand your privilege. Go through the bias-busting training, read about privilege, read about the real history of oppression in our country. \u2026 Discuss the issues you are passionate about during Thanksgiving dinner and don\u2019t back down and laugh it off when you hear the voice of oppression speak through metaphors.\u201d The room erupted in applause.</p><p>The video is very enlightening and shows the perils of progressive echo chambers in which no divergent thought is accepted.</p><p>On a more practical level, it validates concerns by many conservatives that algorithms at play in Facebook, Google and Twitter are designed to work against them. Conservatives are routinely suspended or booted from social media sites while progressives \u2014 even those using violent rhetoric \u2014 are not treated as harshly.</p><p>One of the wonderful things about the internet is the lack of overall regulation, and we do not want the federal government micromanaging the day-to-day activities of companies in Silicon Valley. However, with these institutions being as big and powerful as they are, there should be a modicum of oversight to ensure there is fairness where there is an expectation of fairness. In Google\u2019s case, we now know what the leadership really thinks. Without this video we\u2019d have to take their word that they are a non-biased party, which they are not.</p><p>In the video, most speakers expressed a desire to have conversations with people who have differing views. It does not seem as though they\u2019ve gotten around to doing that but now would be a good time.

The conviction rate for crimes related to making, distributing, or possessing indecent images of children has fallen in Merseyside in recent years, from 53% in 2015 to 49% in 2018.</p><p>The rate last year was the lowest proportion since 2009, when comparable records began.</p><p>It was also one of the lowest proportions in England and Wales. Only Lincolnshire saw a lower percentage of convictions, at 43%.</p><p>Of the 148 prosecutions, those involving white men aged between 50 and 59 were the most common, a total of 31 cases.</p><p>Just two involved women, four involved young people aged between 18 and 20, and six someone aged 70 or over. White people were more likely to be prosecuted (131 cases) than black people (seven) and other ethnic backgrounds (10).</p><p>Of the 67 convictions in Merseyside last year, people were jailed on 11 occasions, with sentences ranging from between one and two months to four years.</p><p>Twenty sentences were suspended, while six received a community sentence.</p><p>There were 4,782 prosecutions in England and Wales last year relating to child abuse images. Of those, 2,479 ended with a conviction, or 52%.</p><p>Commenting on the figures, NSPCC head of child safety online policy, Andy Burrows, said: \"Children endure appalling abuse for these kind of images and videos to be created and shared.</p><p>\"However, law enforcement cannot solve this problem alone - big tech must be made to use their expertise and resources to quickly remove them from their platforms and identify who put them there in the first place.</p><p>\"Our government can lead the world in tackling the threat if it presses ahead with the Online Harms Bill and creates a regulator that has the power to take criminal action against tech firms who fail to protect young people on their platforms.\"</p><p>According to CEO of the charity Stop It Now! helpline, Deborah Denis, parents, grandparents and carers have a vital role to play in learning more about online safety, and teaching children that safety when on a phone, tablet or laptop is just as important as when in the street.</p><p>\u00a6 For advice on child safety, or if you need help with your own or someone else's behaviour, call Stop It Now! on 0808 1000 900 or the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000.</p><p/><p>Law enforcement cannot solve this problem alone - big tech must be made to use their expertise and resources.

Lynn's sin?</p><p> Publicly applauding the EU's fine against Google. Such bullying will haunt Google - at least if the anti-monopoly backlash plays out according to the traditional American script.</p><p> But that's a huge if.</p><p> Standard Oil and AT&amp;T had monopolistic control of gasoline supplies and telephone service, respectively - major bills most American households pay.</p><p>Google's and Facebook's chief services are addictive - and free.</p><p> Still, as everyday life makes clear, Americans are stirred up.</p><p> The Trump and Sanders wings of the two largest political parties want and expect dramatic change.</p><p> If they get their way, the most powerful forces in this country are likely to feel the fallout.

The total number of offences across the two countries is accelerating, with 23% taking place in the six months up to October last year.</p><p>But the NSPCC is warning there could be a sharper increase this year due to the unique threats caused by coronavirus that are being exacerbated by years of industry failure to design basic child protection into platforms.</p><p>The charity is now calling on the Prime Minister to urgently press ahead with legislation that would help prevent offenders from using social media to target children for sexual abuse.</p><p>The NSPCC also revealed Facebook-owned apps were used in 55% of all the cases in Wales and England from April 2017 to October 2019 where police recorded information about how a child was groomed. Where the means of communication were provided, there were over 3,200 instances of Facebook-owned apps (Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp) being used, of which half involved Instagram. Snapchat was used over 1,060 times.</p><p>Emily (not her real name) was 13 when she exchanged messages and photos with a man she believed to be 15 on Facebook and Snapchat. The man turned out to be 24 and sexually abused her.</p><p>Emily's mum Wendy (also not her real name) said: \"It's important for social media to be regulated and for Facebook and Instagram to take more responsibility to keep the people who use their platform safe. All other businesses have a duty of care to keep children safe, so why not them?\" In February, then UK Government Digital Minister Matt Warman promised to publish an Online Harms Bill during the current UK parliamentary session following White Paper proposals for independent regulation of social networks, with potential criminal sanctions if tech directors fail to keep children safe on their platforms.</p><p>However, frustration is growing at delays to the legislation with a full response to consultation on the White Paper not now expected until the end of the year and concerns we might not see a regulator until 2023.</p><p>The NSPCC is calling on the Prime Minister to deliver an Online Harms Bill, that sets out a duty of care on tech firms to make their sites safer for children, within 18 months.</p><p>NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless spoke to Boris Johnson at a hidden harms round table last week and highlighted how coronavirus had created a perfect storm for abusers because platforms hadn't done enough to tackle safety risks going into the crisis. He urged the PM to ensure there is no unnecessary delay to legislation.</p><p>Mr Wanless said: \"Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids. Last week, the Prime Minister signalled to me his determination to stand up to Silicon Valley and make the UK the world leader in online safety.</p><p>\"He can do this by committing to an Online Harms Bill that puts a legal duty of care on big tech to proactively identify and manage safety risks.</p><p>\"Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.\"</p><p>A Government spokesperson said: \"We will legislate as soon as possible for a new duty of care on online companies to protect their users from illegal and harmful content.

New figures obtained via freedom of information (FoI) requests show that 667 offences of sexual communication with a child were recorded by police in Wales in the two and a half years since the law came into force following an NSPCC campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During this period, as many as 10,119 crimes were recorded across Wales and England. The total number of offences across the two countries is accelerating, with 23% taking place in the six months up to October last year.</p><p>But the NSPCC is warning there could be a sharper increase this year due to the unique threats caused by coronavirus that are being exacerbated by years of industry failure to design basic child protection into platforms.</p><p>The charity is now calling on the Prime Minister to urgently press ahead with legislation that would help prevent offenders from using social media to target children for sexual abuse.</p><p>The NSPCC also revealed Facebookowned apps were used in 55% of all the cases in Wales and England from April 2017 to October 2019 where police recorded information about how a child was groomed.</p><p>Where the means of communication were provided, there were over 3,200 instances of Facebook-owned apps (Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp) being used, of which half involved Instagram. Snapchat was used over 1,060 times.</p><p>Emily (not her real name) was 13 when she exchanged messages and photos with a man she believed to be 15 on Facebook and Snapchat. The man turned out to be 24 and sexually abused her.</p><p>Emily's mum Wendy (also not her real name) said: \"It's important for social media to be regulated and for Facebook and Instagram to take more responsibility to keep the people who use their platform safe. All other businesses have a duty of care to keep children safe, so why not them?\" In February, then UK Government Digital Minister Matt Warman promised to publish an Online Harms Bill during the current UK parliamentary session following proposals set out in a White Paper. These proposals set out independent regulation of social networks, with potential criminal sanctions if tech directors fail to keep children safe on their platforms.</p><p>However, frustration is growing at delays to the legislation with a full response to consultation on the White Paper not now expected until the end of the year and concerns we might not see a regulator until 2023.</p><p>This has been expressed by the chairs of both the UK Parliament Home Affairs and Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committees, who scrutinise the work of the UK Government departments responsible for online harms. The NSPCC is calling on the Prime Minister to deliver an Online Harms Bill, that sets out a duty of care on tech firms to make their sites safer for children, within 18 months.</p><p>NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless spoke to Boris Johnson at a hidden harms round table last week and highlighted how coronavirus had created a perfect storm for abusers because platforms hadn't done enough to tackle safety risks going into the crisis. He urged the PM to ensure there is no unnecessary delay to legislation.</p><p>Mr Wanless said: \"Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids.</p><p>\"Last week, the Prime Minister signalled to me his determination to stand up to Silicon Valley and make the UK the world leader in online safety.</p><p>He can do this by committing to an Online Harms Bill that puts a legal duty of care on big tech to proactively identify and manage safety risks.</p><p>\"Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.\"</p><p>A Government spokesperson said: \"Child sexual abuse is a sickening crime and predators who abuse children will face the full force of the law. Just last week the Prime Minister hosted a Hidden Harms Summit, which brought together government and partners to drive forward action on crimes including child sexual abuse.</p><p>\"We will legislate as soon as possible for a new duty of care on online companies to protect their users from illegal and harmful content. This will be overseen by an independent regulator with tough powers to hold them to account.\"</p><p>\u00bb Comment: Page 24 &gt; More than 650 online grooming crimes have been recorded by police in Wales</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WESTML-160328417</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WESTML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-JMP1-DYTY-C29R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244366</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Western Mail and Echo Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Western Mail</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Put it back up. Stop policing speech. Start silencing extremists. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's just a sampling of the intense, often contradictory demands facing tech companies and their social media platforms as they try to oversee internet content without infringing on First Amendment rights. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence, following a mass shooting in Texas in which the suspect had posted a racist screed online. </p><p>For Facebook, Google, Twitter and others, it's a no-win whipsaw, amplified by a drumbeat of accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that their platforms are steeped in anti-conservative bias. With lawmakers and regulators in Washington poring over their business practices, the tech companies are anxious to avoid missteps - but finding criticism at every turn. </p><p>\"There's a thin line between disgusting and offensive speech, and political speech you just don't like. People are blurring the lines,\" says Jerry Ellig, a professor at George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center who was a policy official at the Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>Companies operating social media platforms have long enjoyed broad legal immunity for posted content. Under the 1996 Communications Decency Act, they have a legal shield for both for content they carry and for removing postings they deem offensive. </p><p>Be it social media posts, uploaded videos, user reviews of restaurants or doctors, or classified ads - the shelter from lawsuits and prosecution has been a tent pole of social networking, and undoubtedly contributed to its growth. </p><p>But in the current climate of hostility toward Big Tech, that legal protection is getting a second look. </p><p>Legislation proposed last spring by GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, an outspoken conservative critic, would require the companies to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its immunity from legal action. </p><p>It remains to be seen whether such a system could pass muster under the First Amendment. </p><p>Hawley's legislation drew pushback from Michael Beckerman, who heads the major trade group internet Association. He said it forces the platforms \"to make an impossible choice: either host reprehensible, but First Amendment-protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism. That shouldn't be a trade-off.\" </p><p>The bias issue has dogged Silicon Valley for years, though there's been no credible evidence that political leanings factor into Google's search algorithms or what users see on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube. </p><p>That's done little to silence critics on the right, including at the White House, where Trump promised at a \"social media summit\" last month to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\" While no details were given, the remark hinted at an approach similar to Hawley's bill. </p><p>Some critics of Big Tech say the industry's woes are partly of their own making. Having championed their commitment to free speech, the argument goes, their users weren't prepared for the reality that content, at times, will be restricted. </p><p>\"They were insisting they were neutral, or just technology platforms,\" said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and co-director of its High Tech Law Institute. </p><p>That argument was persuasive, until disappointment set in. \"It eventually blew up and caused consumers to lose trust in them,\" Goldman said. </p><p>Others note that the industry has well-documented problems that can't be blamed on Washington. </p><p>Tech companies have faced criticism over diversity, their treatment of women and how they address sexual harassment and discrimination - both online and off. </p><p>Protests from tech employees, many of them highly paid engineers, have sometimes boiled over into dramatic actions like the global walkout and street demonstrations by Google employees last November. In that case, the company responded by changing the way it investigates misconduct claims and simplifying the complaint process. </p><p>Then there are also the scandals surrounding lax data privacy and rampant foreign influence, which have consumed much of Washington's attention since the 2016 election. </p><p> Under pressure from lawmakers, tech companies are now working to devise protections against \"deepfake\" bogus but realistic-seeming videos and other online manipulations that could be used to influence the 2020 election. </p><p>Called before Congress, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google have detailed their policies: livestreaming banned for those who have violated rules, accounts suspended for breaches related to promoting terrorism, deceptive conduct prohibited in search, news and video. </p><p>\"Our efforts include deploying multiple teams that identify and take action against malicious actors,\" Derek Slater, Google's director of information policy, told lawmakers at a House hearing. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful that our platforms reflect a broad array of sources and information, and there are important free-speech considerations.\" </p><p>Faced with complaints that Trump is able to post incendiary messages that would otherwise be removed, Twitter has sought a middle ground. </p><p>Under a new policy announced in June, tweets that the service deems to involve matters of public interest, but which violate its rules, will be obscured by a warning explaining the violation. Users will have to tap through the warning to see the underlying message. </p><p>It's a fine line that may not satisfy anyone. Calling someone a \"lowlife,\" a \"dog\" or a \"stone cold LOSER,\" as Trump has done, may not by itself be a violation. But repeated insults against someone might amount to prohibited harassment. </p><p>Twitter said Trump's recent tweets questioning how people could live in a \"disgusting\" and \"rodent-infested\" Baltimore didn't violate its rules on \"dehumanizing language\" targeted at specific ethnic groups, as opposed to people living in a given place. </p><p>\"It's a step in the right direction,\" said Keegan Hankes, research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center's intelligence project, who focuses on far-right extremist propaganda.</p><p> But, he added, Twitter is essentially arguing \"that hate speech can be in the public interest. I am arguing that hate speech is never in the public interest.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPRESS-VA0101301481</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPRESS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYX-GNN1-DY37-F2MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173096</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Press, Inc.

Put it back up. Stop policing speech. Start silencing extremists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's just a sampling of the intense, often contradictory demands facing tech companies and their social media platforms as they try to oversee internet content without infringing on First Amendment rights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence, following a mass shooting in Texas in which the suspect had posted a racist screed online.</p><p>For Facebook, Google, Twitter and others, it's a no-win whipsaw, amplified by a drumbeat of accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that their platforms are steeped in anti-conservative bias. With lawmakers and regulators in Washington poring over their business practices, the tech companies are anxious to avoid missteps -- but finding criticism at every turn.</p><p>\"There's a thin line between disgusting and offensive speech, and political speech you just don't like. People are blurring the lines,\" says Jerry Ellig, a professor at George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center who was a policy official at the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Companies operating social media platforms have long enjoyed broad legal immunity for posted content. Under the 1996 Communications Decency Act, they have a legal shield for both for content they carry and for removing postings they deem offensive.</p><p>Be it social media posts, uploaded videos, user reviews of restaurants or doctors, or classified ads -- the shelter from lawsuits and prosecution has been a tent pole of social networking, and undoubtedly contributed to its growth.</p><p>But in the current climate of hostility toward Big Tech, that legal protection is getting a second look.</p><p>Legislation proposed last spring by GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, an outspoken conservative critic, would require the companies to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its immunity from legal action.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether such a system could pass muster under the First Amendment.</p><p>Hawley's legislation drew pushback from Michael Beckerman, who heads the major trade group internet Association. He said it forces the platforms \"to make an impossible choice: either host reprehensible, but First Amendment-protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism.

The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence, following a mass shooting in Texas where the suspect had posted a racist screed online, The Associated Press reported.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Facebook, Google, Twitter and others, it's a no-win whipsaw, amplified by a drumbeat of accusations from US President Donald Trump and his allies that their platforms are steeped in anti-conservative bias. With lawmakers and regulators in Washington poring over their business practices, the tech companies are anxious to avoid missteps \u2014 but finding criticism at every turn.</p><p>\"There's a thin line between disgusting and offensive speech, and political speech you just don't like. People are blurring the lines,\" said Jerry Ellig, a professor at George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center who was a policy official at the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Companies operating social media platforms have long enjoyed broad legal immunity for posted content. Under the 1996 Communications Decency Act, they have a legal shield for both for content they carry and for removing postings they deem offensive. Be it social media posts, uploaded videos, user reviews of restaurants or doctors, or classified ads \u2014 the shelter from lawsuits and prosecution has been a tent pole of social networking, and undoubtedly contributed to its growth.</p><p>But in the current climate of hostility toward Big Tech, that legal protection is getting a second look.</p><p>Legislation proposed last spring by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, an outspoken conservative critic, would require the companies to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its immunity from legal action. It remains to be seen whether such a system could pass muster under the First Amendment.</p><p>Hawley's legislation drew pushback from Michael Beckerman, who heads the major trade group Internet Association. He said it forces the platforms \"to make an impossible choice: Either host reprehensible, but First Amendment-protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism. That shouldn't be a tradeoff.\"</p><p>The bias issue has dogged Silicon Valley for years, though there's been no credible evidence that political leanings factor into Google's search algorithms or what users see on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.</p><p>That's done little to silence critics on the right, including at the White House, where Trump promised at a \"social media summit\" last month to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\" While no details were given, the remark hinted at an approach similar to Hawley's bill.</p><p>Some critics of Big Tech say the industry's woes are partly of their own making.

Tech companies have faced criticism over diversity, their treatment of women and how they address sexual harassment and discrimination, both online and off. Protests from tech employees, many of them highly paid engineers, have sometimes boiled over into dramatic actions like the global walkout and street demonstrations by Google employees last November. In that case, the company responded by changing the way it investigates misconduct claims and simplifying the complaint process.</p><p>Then there are also the scandals surrounding lax data privacy and rampant foreign influence, which have consumed much of Washington's attention since the 2016 election.</p><p>A massive Russian influence campaign used phony Facebook and other social media postings, seeking to sow discord among the millions of Americans who viewed them. Under pressure from lawmakers, tech companies are now working to devise protections against \"deepfake\" bogus but realistic-seeming videos and other online manipulations that could be used to influence the 2020 election.</p><p>Called before Congress, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google have detailed their policies: Livestreaming banned for those who have violated rules, accounts suspended for breaches related to promoting terrorism, deceptive conduct prohibited in search, news and video.</p><p>\"Our efforts include deploying multiple teams that identify and take action against malicious actors,\" Derek Slater, Google's director of information policy, told lawmakers at a House hearing.</p><p>\"At the same time, we have to be mindful that our platforms reflect a broad array of sources and information, and there are important free-speech considerations. There is no silver bullet, but we will continue to work to get it right.\"</p><p>Perhaps no company has faced louder criticism for its content policies than Twitter, Trump's social media platform of choice.</p><p>Faced with complaints that Trump is able to post incendiary messages that would otherwise be removed, Twitter has sought a middle ground. Under a new policy announced in June, tweets that the service deems to involve matters of public interest, but which violate its rules, will be obscured by a warning explaining the violation. Users will have to tap through the warning to see the underlying message.</p><p>It's a fine line that may not satisfy anyone. Calling someone a \"lowlife,\" a \"dog\" or a \"stone cold LOSER,\" as Trump has done, may not by itself be a violation. But repeated insults against someone might amount to prohibited harassment.</p><p>Twitter said Trump's recent tweets questioning how people could live in a \"disgusting\" and \"rodent-infested\" Baltimore didn't violate its rules on \"dehumanizing language\" targeted at specific ethnic groups, as opposed to people living in a given place.</p><p>\"It's a step in the right direction,\" said Keegan Hankes, research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center's intelligence project, who focuses on far-right extremist propaganda. But, he added, Twitter is essentially arguing \"that hate speech can be in the public interest. I am arguing that hate speech is never in the public interest.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/319/1056/86/156700156751.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/319/1056/86/156700156751.jpeg</url></p><p>Tech firms struggle to police content while avoiding bias<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRNDLY-152584381</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRNDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXF-HGH1-JDJN-615P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1153\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Iran Cultural &amp;

Put it back up. Stop policing speech. Start silencing extremists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's just a sampling of the intense, often contradictory demands facing tech companies and their social media platforms as they try to oversee internet content without infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence, following a mass shooting in Texas in which the suspect had posted a racist screed online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Facebook, Google, Twitter and others, it's a no-win whipsaw, amplified by a drumbeat of accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that their platforms are steeped in anti-conservative bias. With lawmakers and regulators in Washington poring over their business practices, the tech companies are anxious to avoid missteps - but rinding criticism at every turn.</p><p>\"There's a thin line between disgusting and offensive speech, and political speech you just don't like. People are blurring the lines,\" says Jerry Ellig, a professor at George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center who was a policy official at the Federal Trade Commission. Companies operating social media platforms have long enjoyed broad legal immunity for posted content. Under the 1996 Communications Decency Act, they have a legal shield for both content they carry and for removing postings they deem offensive. Be it social media posts, uploaded videos, user reviews of restaurants or doctors, or classified ads - the shelter from lawsuits and prosecution has been a tent pole of social networking, and undoubtedly contributed to its growth.</p><p>But in the current climate of hostility toward Big Tech, that legal protection is getting a second look. Legislation proposed last spring by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, an outspoken conservative critic, would require the companies to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its immunity from legal action. It remains to be seen whether such a system could pass muster under the First Amendment.</p><p>Hawley's legislation drew push-back from Michael Beckerman, who heads the major trade group Internet Association. He said it forces the platforms \"to make an impossible choice: either host reprehensible, but First Amendment-protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism. That shouldn't be a tradeoff.\"</p><p>The bias issue has dogged Silicon Valley for years, though there's been no credible evidence that political leanings factor into Google's search algorithms or what users see on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.</p><p>That's done little to silence critics on the right, including at the White House, where Trump promised at a \"social media summit\" last month to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\" While no details were given, the remark hinted at an approach similar to Hawley's bill.</p><p>Some critics of Big Tech say the industry's woes are partly of their own making. Having championed their commitment to free speech, the argument goes, their users weren't prepared for the reality that content, at times, will be restricted.</p><p>\"They were insisting they were neutral, or just technology platforms,\" said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and co-director of its High Tech Law Institute.</p><p>That argument was persuasive, until disappointment set in. \"It eventually blew up and caused consumers to lose trust in them,\" Goldman said.</p><p>Others note that the industry has well-documented problems that can't be blamed on Washington. Tech companies have faced criticism over diversity, their treatment of women and how they address sexual harassment and discrimination, both online and off. Protests from tech employees, many of them highly paid engineers, have sometimes boiled over into dramatic actions like the global walkout and street demonstrations by Google employees last November. In that case, the company responded by changing the way it investigates misconduct claims and simplifying the complaint process.</p><p>Then there are also the scandals surrounding lax data privacy and rampant foreign influence, which have consumed much of Washington's attention since the 2016 election.</p><p>A massive Russian influence campaign used phony Facebook and other social media postings, seeking to sow discord among the millions of Americans who viewed them. Under pressure from lawmakers, tech companies are now working to devise protections against \"deep-fake\" bogus but realistic-seeming videos and other online manipulations that could be used to influence the 2020 election.</p><p>Called before Congress, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google have detailed their policies: livestreaming banned for those who have violated rules, accounts suspended for breaches related to promoting terrorism, deceptive conduct prohibited in search, news and video.</p><p>\"Our efforts include deploying multiple teams that identify and take action against malicious actors,\" Derek Slater, Google's director of information policy, told lawmakers at a House hearing. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful that our platforms reflect a broad array of sources and information, and there are important free-speech considerations. There is no silver bullet, but we will continue to work to get it right.\"</p><p>Perhaps no company has faced louder criticism for its content policies than Twitter, Trump's social media platform of choice.</p><p>Faced with complaints that Trump is able to post incendiary messages that would otherwise be removed, Twitter has sought a middle ground. Under a new policy announced in June, tweets that the service deems to involve matters of public interest, but which violate its rules, will be obscured by a warning explaining the violation. Users will have to tap through the warning to see the underlying message.</p><p>It's a fine line that may not satisfy anyone. Calling someone a \"lowlife,\" a \"dog\" or a \"stone cold LOSER,\" as Trump has done, may not by itself be a violation. But repeated insults against someone might amount to prohibited harassment.</p><p>Twitter said Trump's recent tweets questioning how people could live in a \"disgusting\" and \"rodent-infested\" Baltimore didn't violate its rules on \"dehumanizing language\" targeted at specific ethnic groups, as opposed to people living in a given place.</p><p>\"It's a step in the right direction,\" said Keegan Hankes, research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center's intelligence project, who focuses on far-right extremist propaganda. But, he added, Twitter is essentially arguing \"that hate speech can be in the public interest. I am arguing that hate speech is never in the public interest .\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2290797761</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">46355ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X40-MHV1-DYR7-84M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1141\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Louisiana Weekly Publishing Co.

Put it back up. Stop policing speech. Start silencing extremists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's just a sampling of the intense, often contradictory demands facing tech companies and their social media platforms as they try to oversee internet content without infringing on First Amendment rights. The pendulum has swung recently toward restricting hateful speech that could spawn violence, following a mass shooting in Texas in which the suspect had posted a racist screed online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Facebook, Google, Twitter and others, it's a no-win whipsaw, amplified by a drumbeat of accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that their platforms are steeped in anti-conservative bias. With lawmakers and regulators in Washington poring over their business practices, the tech companies are anxious to avoid missteps - but finding criticism at every turn.</p><p>\"There's a thin line between disgusting and offensive speech, and political speech you just don't like. People are blurring the lines,\" says Jerry Ellig, a professor at George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center who was a policy official at the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Companies operating social media platforms have long enjoyed broad legal immunity for posted content. Under the 1996 Communications Decency Act, they have a legal shield for both for content they carry and for removing postings they deem offensive. Be it social media posts, uploaded videos, user reviews of restaurants or doctors, or classified ads - the shelter from lawsuits and prosecution has been a tent pole of social networking, and undoubtedly contributed to its growth.</p><p>But in the current climate of hostility toward Big Tech, that legal protection is getting a second look.</p><p>Legislation proposed last spring by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, an outspoken conservative critic, would require the companies to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its immunity from legal action. It remains to be seen whether such a system could pass muster under the First Amendment.</p><p>Hawley's legislation drew pushback from Michael Beckerman, who heads the major trade group Internet Association. He said it forces the platforms \"to make an impossible choice: either host reprehensible, but First Amendment-protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism. That shouldn't be a tradeoff.\"</p><p>The bias issue has dogged Silicon Valley for years, though there's been no credible evidence that political leanings factor into Google's search algorithms or what users see on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.</p><p>That's done little to silence critics on the right, including at the White House, where Trump promised at a \"social media summit\" last month to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\" While no details were given, the remark hinted at an approach similar to Hawley's bill.</p><p>Some critics of Big Tech say the industry's woes are partly of their own making. Having championed their commitment to free speech, the argument goes, their users weren't prepared for the reality that content, at times, will be restricted.</p><p>\"They were insisting they were neutral, or just technology platforms,\" said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and co-director of its High Tech Law Institute.</p><p>That argument was persuasive, until disappointment set in. \"It eventually blew up and caused consumers to lose trust in them,\" Goldman said.</p><p>Others note that the industry has well-documented problems that can't be blamed on Washington. Tech companies have faced criticism over diversity, their treatment of women and how they address sexual harassment and discrimination, both online and off. Protests from tech employees, many of them highly paid engineers, have sometimes boiled over into dramatic actions like the global walkout and street demonstrations by Google employees last November. In that case, the company responded by changing the way it investigates misconduct claims and simplifying the complaint process.</p><p>Then there are also the scandals surrounding lax data privacy and rampant foreign influence, which have consumed much of Washington's attention since the 2016 election.</p><p>A massive Russian influence campaign used phony Facebook and other social media postings, seeking to sow discord among the millions of Americans who viewed them. Under pressure from lawmakers, tech companies are now working to devise protections against \"deepfake\" bogus but realistic-seeming videos and other online manipulations that could be used to influence the 2020 election.</p><p>Called before Congress, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google have detailed their policies: livestreaming banned for those who have violated rules, accounts suspended for breaches related to promoting terrorism, deceptive conduct prohibited in search, news and video.</p><p>\"Our efforts include deploying multiple teams that identify and take action against malicious actors,\" Derek Slater, Google's director of information policy, told lawmakers at a House hearing. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful that our platforms reflect a broad array of sources and information, and there are important free-speech considerations. There is no silver bullet, but we will continue to work to get it right.\"</p><p>Perhaps no company has faced louder criticism for its content policies than Twitter, Trump's social media platform of choice.</p><p>Faced with complaints that Trump is able to post incendiary messages that would otherwise be removed, Twitter has sought a middle ground. Under a new policy announced in June, tweets that the service deems to involve matters of public interest, but which violate its rules, will be obscured by a warning explaining the violation. Users will have to tap through the warning to see the underlying message.</p><p>It's a fine line that may not satisfy anyone. Calling someone a \"lowlife,\" a \"dog\" or a \"stone cold LOSER,\" as Trump has done, may not by itself be a violation. But repeated insults against someone might amount to prohibited harassment.</p><p>Twitter said Trump's recent tweets questioning how people could live in a \"disgusting\" and \"rodent-infested\" Baltimore didn't violate its rules on \"dehumanizing language\" targeted at specific ethnic groups, as opposed to people living in a given place.</p><p>\"It's a step in the right direction,\" said Keegan Hankes, research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center's intelligence project, who focuses on far-right extremist propaganda. But, he added, Twitter is essentially arguing \"that hate speech can be in the public interest. I am arguing that hate speech is never in the public interest.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Gordon on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/mgordonap\">http://www.twitter.com/mgordonap</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-483752848e144227b53e3c38de5f5e7c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXK-BS81-JC65-551R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1154\"/><timeReceived>10:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 28, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
