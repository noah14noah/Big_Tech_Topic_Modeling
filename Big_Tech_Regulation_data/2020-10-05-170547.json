Background[3]. * Cunningham v. Montes, 2019 WL 1978624 (W.D. Wis. May 3, 2019): Defendants cite no cases concluding that  230(c)(1) shields a provider of telemarketing services from TCPA liability, and the court has found none. To the contrary, Nunes v. Twitter, Inc.[4], 194 F. Supp. </p><p>3d 959 (N.D. Cal. 2016), suggests that  230(c)(1) would not apply to TCPA liability because the harm addressed by the TCPA is not related to the content of the robocalls.In other words, the TCPA holds purveyors of illegal robocalls liable not as publishers of objectionable content, but as tortfeasors who intrude on the privacy of others. Even if  230(c)(1) were available to telemarketing providers who did not exercise control over their clients, that would be of no help to defendants in this case. As discussed above, Cunningham has adduced evidence that Montes exerted control over his clients' use of TollFreeZone.com's telemarketing platform. If this is so, then Montes would not be able to show that TollFreeZone.com was a neutral conduit for his clients' messages, such that he would be entitled to immunity as an internet service provider. The Communications Decency Act is not a basis for summary judgment for defendants. * Eberhart v. Amazon, 2018 WL 4080348 (SDNY Aug. 27, 2018). 'to the extent that the New York Court of Appeals would consider the laws and judicial opinions of other jurisdictions, it would encounter an emerging consensus against construing Amazon as a 'seller' or 'distributor'\u2014and, therefore, against holding Amazon strictly liable for defective products sold on its website. Because Amazon did not manufacture, sell, or otherwise distribute the allegedly defective coffeemaker to Eberhart, it owed no duty to him with respect to that product.' In a footnote: 'To the extent that Eberhart seeks to assert a claim that Amazon is liable, either directly or vicariously, for the content it permitted CoffeeGet to post onamazon.com[5], such a claim is preempted by  230 of the Communications Decency Act.' * Turo v. Los Angeles, 2019 WL 186608 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 14, 2019): This particular claim is therefore not ripe for adjudication because the City has not yet taken any enforcement action against Turo, and the Court cannot issue an advisory opinion based on a hypothetical enforcement action. The Court therefore dismisses Turo's claim for declaratory relief with respect to its immunity under the CDA. * Takhvar v. Page, 2018 WL 4677808 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 25, 2018): 'it appears that the crux of the complaint relates to Mr. Takhvar's dislike of third-party advertisements that appear on Google when searching 'Mauiwowie.' Consequently, Mr. Takhvar's claims are barred by the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C.  230(c)(1), which provides internet service providers, such as Google, with broad immunity from content-based claims originating from third parties. This would include 'Leafly,' the third-party site mentioned in Mr. Takhvar's complaint that includes information regarding cannabis.' * Bravado Int'l Grp. Merchandising Servs., Inc. v. Gearlaunch, Inc., 2018 WL 6017035 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 9, 2018): 'to the extent Plaintiffs' state law claims are premised on Defendants' alleged manufacturing and sale of Infringing Merchandise, and not merely passive publication of designs created by third parties, the CDA does not preempt the state law claims.' * Gilmore v. Jones, 2019 WL 1418291 (W.D. Va. March 29, 2019): Gilmore adequately alleges that Hoft, Wilburn, Hickford, and Words-N-Ideas are 'information content providers.' Gilmore alleges that both Hoft and Wilburn authored their respective articles, and both defendants concede this point in sworn declarations. Although Hoft included screenshots from a Reddit thread in his Gateway Pundit article, he contributed significant original content, including a headline, statements about Gilmore, and an assertion that 'the State Department was involved in [the] Charlottesville rioting and is trying to cover it up.' Similarly, although Wilburn quoted a YourNewsWire.com article, Wilburn added an original headline and statements, asserting that the 'depth of this conspiracy runs deeper' before quoting material about Signer and Gilmore, and stating that, 'if true,' the information his article imparts 'points directly to the reality of the 'deep state' ' and the 'lengths that the Soros/Clinton/Obama one-world government cabal will go.' Thus, Gilmore adequately alleges that Hoft and Wilburn did more than allow 'others' content to be posted or re-posted' but rather 'created [at least] some of the defamatory statements' in the articles. 'Section 230 immunity does not cover content which [the defendant] created [himself] or other content, although originating with a third party, which [the defendant] significantly altered.' With respect to Hickford and Words-N-Ideas, these defendants concede that one theory under which they could be held liable for Wilburn's Allen B. West article is that 'WNI or Ms. Hickford was Mr. Wilburn's employer.' Gilmore alleges liability under this exact theory. If either Hickford or Words-N-Ideas was 'the creator or developer, in whole or in part, of the content at issue,' neither is 'entitled to immunity under  230(c)(1) as to that content.' Here, Gilmore's plausible allegations that Hickford served as editor-in-chief of AllenBWest.com and 'president' of Words-N-Ideas, that Words-N-Ideas owned AllenBWest.com, and that these two defendants 'produced and ratified' Wilburn's article support an inference that these defendants played some role in developing Wilburn's article or maintained some agency relationship with Wilburn. Making all 'reasonable factual inferences' in Gilmore's favor, the Court finds that Gilmore plausibly alleges that Hickford and Words-NIdeas acted as information content providers. In sum, the Court concludes that Hoft, Wilburn, Hickford, and Words-N-Ideas are not immune from suit under  230. * Daphne Keller, Who Do You Sue?[6] A thoughtful exposition on why social media services aren't, and should not be, subject to must-carry rules. * Daphne Keller[7]: Build Your Own Intermediary Liability Law: A Kit for Policy Wonks of All Ages * Vox[8]: Ron Wyden wrote the law that built the internet.

Vox Media, Inc.[27], 2019 WL 1060804 (D.D.C. March 6, 2019). The court conditionally certifies a class when the plaintiffs allege: Plaintiffs allege that all Site Managers had similar responsibilities for their respective blogs, that Vox Media had a uniform policy of classifying Site Managers as independent contractors, and that each Site Manager has the same kinds of claims for unpaid wages and overtime. See id. (identifying similar facts presented by plaintiffs as sufficient to meet the first stage of conditional certification). Declarations from Plaintiffs (and current opt-in class members) demonstrate they were each subject to a similar Blogger Agreement and were paid on a monthly, flat-fee basis regardless of the number of hours worked. * Video of my talk at Princeton on 'Content Moderation Remedies[28]' (I'd appreciate your comments!)

Facebook, Inc., 2019 WL 2486566 (9th Cir. June 14, 2019): No reasonable jury could conclude that Facebooksubjected the photo uploaded to the Glenview Patch organizationalFacebookpage (which is the only photo at issue in this appeal) to facial recognition. The record contains declarations fromFacebookemployees as well as internal emails asserting that at the time the Glenview Patch photo was uploaded, facial recognition was turned off for organizational pages. The record also includes evidence specific to the Glenview Patch photo at issue, showing thatFacebookdid not subject it to facial recognition. </p><p>Although Gullen points to emails and testimony indicating that all photos uploaded by individualFacebookusers were subject to facial recognition, this evidence does not give rise to a reasonable inference that the particular Glenview Patch photo at issue, which was uploaded to an organizationalFacebookpage rather than a user page, was subject to facial recognition. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Gullen's claim thatFacebook violated BIPA. * Malibu Media v. Park, 2019 WL 2960146 (D. N.J. July 9, 2019): 'Plaintiff will have to show something more than merely tying Defendant to an IP address in order to sufficiently establish copyright infringement.' * NBC News[1]: Mark Zuckerberg leveraged Facebook user data to fight rivals and help friends, leaked documents show * 'the French Government has banned the publication of statistical information about judges' decisions[2] - with a five year prison sentence set as the maximum punishment for anyone who breaks the new law' * Politico[3]: How Silicon Valley gamed Europe's privacy rules * Wired[4]: Politicians Don't Trust Facebook\u2014Unless They're Campaigning E-Commerce * Keck v. Alibaba.com Hong Kong Ltd, 2019 WL 827636 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2019) although a close call, the Defendants are more similarly situated to the swap meet operator and Napster than to Google. Crucially, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' websites are online marketplaces that constitute 'a large ecosystem for online and mobile commerce' over which Defendants 'exercise high levels of control.' Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants are 'involved in the day-to-day operation, control, marketing, and design of [the marketplaces].' For example, Plaintiff specifically alleges that 'the Alibaba Defendants provide marketing services to merchants who operate on Taobao, Alibaba.com and AliExpress, provide guidance for the layout of the merchants' virtual stores, and facilitate transactions between merchants and buyers.' Thus, unlike in Amazon.com, the alleged direct infringement here takes place not 'on the internet' writ large but instead on Defendants' websites/ marketplaces. Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have the right and ability to terminate the membership of merchants who repeatedly infringe, the right to remove, modify, or reject unlawful content on the websites/ marketplaces, and the discretionary right to suspend access to the websites/marketplaces. In other words, where Google had the right to terminate the AdSense partnership\u2014which would not have stopped direct infringement by third parties\u2014here the Defendants could have ended the alleged direct infringement on their own websites/marketplaces by terminating or suspending the merchants' memberships. Plaintiff has adequately alleged that Defendants failed to police their websites/marketplaces to the fullest extent, thus permitting detectable acts of infringement to occur. For example, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have technology to proactively identify infringing material, and that Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendants of infringing material, but that Defendants nonetheless failed to remove the infringing material. As another example, Plaintiff alleges that so-called 'repeat offenders'\u2014merchants identified as having previously infringed\u2014were permitted to continue to use Defendants' websites/marketplaces despite Defendants' knowledge of the merchants' infringing activity. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants have failed to maintain adequate records of infringing activity, which the Court may reasonably infer hinders Defendants' ability to police their system * Singh v. Google, 2018 WL 4677601 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 27, 2018): Singh paid not for the AdWords service, but instead for a total number of clicks. To allege standing then, he must show that these clicks were not what he bargained for, namely clicks with a valid click rate of 90-95%. Thus, to show injury, he must demonstrate that the clicks he paid for had a valid click rate of less than 90-95%; otherwise, he got exactly what he paid for. This he does not do. And his conclusory allegations that he would not have advertised with Google had he known of the misrepresentations fail for this reason. He has alleged no support for this notion because he has not demonstrated that he paid anything beyond what he bargained to pay for. * Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc.[5], 2019 WL 2482674 (E.D.N.Y. June 14, 2019): Courts will give effect to hybridwrap terms where the button required to perform the action manifesting assent (e.g., signing up for an account or executing a purchase) is located directly next to a hyperlink to the terms and a notice informing the user that, by clicking the button, the user is agreeing to those terms. The more the hybridwrap design diverges from this basic layout\u2014such as by placing the notice further away from the action button, cluttering the screen with potentially distracting content, or omitting the language explicitly saying that by performing the action the user agrees to be bound by the terms\u2014the less likely courts are to find that inquiry notice has been provided. Annemarie testified that Dennis told her about the Mom program, that she gave Dennis the password to her Account, that Dennis told her he was signing her up for Mom, and that he did so with her 'permission.' From this record, there can be no dispute that Annemarie authorized Dennis to sign her up for Mom, thus establishing a principal-agent relationship. The second Mom sign-up screen contains a notice directly below the 'Sign up for Amazon Mom' button, which reads, 'By signing up, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Amazon Prime Terms and Conditions .' The proximity of this notice to the 'Sign up' button would make it very difficult for any user to miss, and its explicit use of contract-forming language, viz., 'you agree to the Amazon Prime Terms and Conditions,' leaves no doubt as to the legal consequences of proceeding with the transaction. Courts presented with similar hybridwrap interfaces have routinely found them sufficient If the validity of these contract terms waxed and waned depending on the identity of the human user behind the screen, it would impose a cloud of uncertainty over any contract formed over the internet. Any individual could avoid the terms of a website by simply logging on to a friend's or relative's account instead of creating their own. Common sense dictates that this could not possibly be the rule; and where common sense goes, the law must follow. When one uses an account to transact online, an implicit representation is made that they are the person identified with the account, and thus are bound by the same terms and conditions previously agreed to by the account's true owner. Platforms such as Amazon fulfill orders and provide other services in reliance on that implied representation. In this case, Plaintiff's use of the Account was tantamount to a representation that he was Annemarie Nicosia (and therefore bound by the arbitration provision to which she had previously agreed) the rule that the 'existence' of additional contract terms must be made 'reasonably conspicuous' is, this Court submits, largely a superfluity. The cases specify that such terms must be reasonably conspicuous from the point of view of a 'reasonably prudent' user. But is there any question that reasonably prudent internet users know that there are terms and conditions attached when they log onto Facebook, order merchandise on Amazon, or hail a ride on Uber? They know this, not because a loud, brightly-colored notice on the screen tells them so, but because it would be difficult to exist in our technological society without some generalized awareness of the fact. rather than scrutinizing hybridwrap agreements for contract formation issues, courts should recognize that such agreements, like other adhesive contracts, represent in substance a 'blanket assent' to any terms that are not objectively unreasonable * ABA Journal[6]: ADA questions remain over web accessibility cases and the lack of DOJ regulations * FTC Announces First Actions[7] Exclusively Enforcing the Consumer Review Fairness Act * Reuters[8]: New e-commerce rules jolt Amazon.com in India as products vanish * The Hustle[9]: 5-star phonies: Inside the fake Amazon review complex * AdWeek[10]: This Legally Binding Contract Lets People Sue Their Friends for Skipping Out on Drinks Advertising * The backstory of Burger King's 'Whopper Detour' campaign[11].

Fault lines have appeared in a flat world. A global arms race for cutting-edge technologies, the emergence of China as a global power, strongmen politicians voted in by stoking nationalism, trade and tech cold wars, and a raging pandemic have fundamentally altered the picture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Political economist Steven Weber, in his book Bloc By Bloc: How To Build A Global Enterprise For The New Regional Order, believes that we are transitioning into a new world order defined by \"regional\" blocs, dominated by the United States, China, and possibly the European Union.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is this view extreme or within the realm of probability? If so, along what fault lines will nations regroup? Will the present vectors - the race for a Covid-19 vaccine; the twin shocks of trade wars and the pandemic on supply chains; or the estrangement of nations over tech - determine friends and foes? And, how can Asean respond'</p><p>ONE VACCINE</p><p>While a few countries appear to have effectively flattened the infection curve, others report a resurgence of the Covid-19 virus and in some countries, a more infectious strain has emerged. Experts suggest that a vaccine is the only way to effectively combat the pandemic. A global race is on to find in the least possible time, the most valuable vaccine: that can be administered once, with high efficacy, and provide immunity for a few years. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 167 vaccine candidates with 29 under clinical studies and a few in advanced stages of human trials. Multi-year research has been collapsed into months and big pharma are eager to start production in parallel to late-phase trials. The frontrunners are predictably American, British and European, with China as a challenger and Russia a wildcard.</p><p>While it appears that a vaccine may be initially available between the last quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, several thorny questions need to be urgently addressed. Who will get access? How quickly? And at what cost? There are legitimate fears of \"vaccine nationalism\" by richer countries cornering stocks unfairly while big pharma seek patent protection and profits.</p><p>Public health advocates urge that the vaccine be free, achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. While the WHO is seeking international support for a mechanism that guarantees prompt and fair access to vaccines worldwide, implementation will throw up issues. Specialised logistics such as cryo-shipping or the need for a complex delivery device could deny access to geographies that lack the necessary infrastructure. Limited supply could force global policy makers to make tough decisions, setting off fault lines that divide the world.</p><p>TWO SUPPLY CHAINS</p><p>The twin vectors of the US-China trade wars and the pandemic have convulsed global supply chains. The deepening of fault lines can however be traced back over decades.</p><p>At the structural level, three forces have been at work. One, a shift in global demand from West to East powered by the burgeoning middle class in Asia, expected to be two-thirds of the world's middle class population by 2030.</p><p>Two, through robust investment-led cooperation within since the 1950s, Asia is increasingly producing for its own consumption and has evolved into a third regional bloc, the Americas and Europe being the other two. And finally, the offshoring of the renminbi by China, Asia's primary trading partner, has set the bloc in motion towards a single regional trading currency that powers its \"financial supply chain\".</p><p>A digital renminbi is slated for trial soon in Hong Kong and several mainland cities, aiming for low-cost and frictionless payments across domestic and regional supply chains.</p><p>At the event-driven level, the global production shock delivered by the Covid-19 virus has perhaps been the single biggest force. In an estimate by McKinsey, as much as US$4.6 trillion of global trade could relocate in the next five years, with supply chains pivoting to domestic production, nearshoring, or offshoring to new locations. Manufacturers worldwide face greater political pressure to grow employment in their home countries and to work with their government to ensure national health security, recently exposed as many countries looked to China for supplies of masks and respirators.</p><p>At the tactical level, there are two forces. One, China's Belt and Road Initiative has drawn emerging market nations into its orbit, creating new supply chains that serve its national interests. On the other hand, the US-China trade war and their recent estrangement over tech has forced many companies to reconfigure a contingent \"China+1\" supply-chain. In a recent interview with Financial Times, Liu Young-way, chairman of Foxconn, the largest Apple supplier and the world's largest electronic contract manufacturer, said he expected global technology supply chains to split into two camps: \"It will be one for China and those associated with it, and another for the US and their friends.\"</p><p>However, creating a full ecosystem of manufacturers within two separate supply chains in a short period is near impossible. Shifting US production from China to South-east Asian countries will be challenging as many locations do not have efficient, high-capacity ports that can handle large container ships to major markets. According to experts, that could mean longer transit times for trans-shipment through Singapore, Hong Kong, or other hubs and increase costs.</p><p>THREE INTERNETS</p><p>The question about a divided Internet has always been there with tech leaders talking about a \"splinternet\". In 2018, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt predicted \"a bifurcation into a Chinese-led Internet and a non-Chinese Internet led by America\". But, has the Internet been united in the first place'</p><p>The Internet, invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, enabled the ideal of a borderless world in a way that no other technology has done. However, there is little in the design of the Internet that makes it technologically, politically and geographically borderless. The Internet is not a singular technology, instead it is a stack: the \"content layer\" which hosts applications we interact with; a \"protocol\" layer that allows computers to connect to the Internet; and \"regulatory\" layers such as privacy, data protection and localisation laws. As governments increasingly direct Internet governance, fragmentation can occur within the Internet stack, creating \"blocs\" of interoperability and drawbridges across.</p><p>Back in 2016, US trade officials accused China of using its national firewall as a trade barrier. This has ratcheted up into a full-blown tech cold war, one that could cost up to US$3.5 trillion over the next five years according to a recent Deutsche Bank report. At the heart of the matter lies the global battle for 5G technology supremacy, currently being led by China's Huawei.</p><p>The US government, accusing Huawei of violating US laws, banned the company recently from the US market, with Pentagon placing it on a list of 20 companies it says are owned or controlled by China's military.</p><p>In a parallel development, Tiktok - the Chinese social video app that has taken the world by storm - was ordered to divest its US operations to an American company, on grounds of national security. A BBC report dated Aug 6 conjectured, \"If Microsoft (the frontrunner) does eventually buy the US arm, will there be three TikToks? A TikTok in China (called Douyin). A rest-of-the- world TikTok. And a TikTok in the US. Could that be a model for the future of the Internet'\"</p><p>The estrangement of nations over tech includes Europe. In recent years, US big tech has faced a plethora of European regulations aimed at curbing anticompetitive behaviour, paying more taxes and taking more responsibility for illegal content on their platforms. An European court recently struck down the Privacy Shield data sharing agreement between the US and EU. According to a BBC report, as many as 5,300 companies - up to two-thirds being SMEs or startups - depend on this agreement for transatlantic digital trade. The report quoted a legal expert as saying, \"What we are seeing here looks suspiciously like a privacy trade war, where Europe is saying their data standards can be trusted but those in the US cannot.\"</p><p>ASEAN &amp; THE NEW ABACUS</p><p>Faced with an increasingly divided new world order, Asean countries need to make thoughtful strategic decisions about national security, technology and trade. At a strategic level, Asean must carefully respond on the one hand to the US' \"Indo-Pacific\" geopolitical construct and on the other hand, to China's Belt and Road Initiative. It would be prudent for Asean to not align but continue to engage both, taking stances and making choices based on each issue, not a country.</p><p>However, neutrality is easier said than done. Singapore's recent decision on 5G is an instructive example of astute navigation. The nation's biggest telecom operators chose Europe's Ericsson and Nokia as their main 5G network providers, limiting Huawei to non-core elements of the network. This is seen as pre-empting possible disruption to national infrastructure should the US deny Huawei global access to semiconductors.</p><p>In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: \"If you ask us on security cooperations, certainly we are closer to the US than to China. But in terms of our trade, the Chinese are our biggest trading partner. In terms of our overall relationship, we have deep relationships with both.\"</p><p>PM Lee also opined that South-east Asian nations might one day be forced to choose if the world economy gets pulled apart into different blocs. The prescient view may well play out if the new abacus for a divided world does not add up.</p><p>The writer, a former retail banker and venture partner, is currently a senior external advisor to

Patient readers, I am going to throw out some red meat, then post my piece on the latest in Venezuela, and then return here to add more. -lambert Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune 2020Brown: 'Trump must be dancing for joy at Sherrod Brown news' [Paul Begala, CNN[2]]. 'Here's why Mr. Trump is doing the Humpty Dance on the Truman Balcony: Sherrod Brown could have beaten him, and I bet Trump knows it. </p><p>Why? The math is simple. Trump got 46% in 2016. He has not been over 50% in the national polls for a single day as president. Brown, a Midwestern economic populist, would have eaten into Trump's working-class support \u2014 a loss Trump could not offset by gaining ground among, say, people of color, or younger voters. With Trump in a cul-de-sac, unable to expand his appeal beyond working-class whites, a Democrat who could pry away some of those Trump voters looked like a winner to me. After all, Brown won a resounding re-election in November, winning his native Ohio by 6%. Hillary Clinton lost Ohio by 8% in 2016. You don't need to be a math major to know that a 15-point improvement over Hillary's razor-thin losses in the Big Ten states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan means the moving vans would be rolling up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.' \u2022 I dunno if Trump is that cornered. He's working hard to win the more reactionary segments of the Latin vote in Florida (Venezuela), and when he went into Beto's district to rally and whipped him, his crowd was quite diverse. Harris, wearing her favorite cologne, Eau de Performativit: Shirley Chisholm had guts. She had guts to oppose the Vietnam War. The guts to run for president in 1972. The guts to speak uncomfortable truths. To ensure her legacy continues to endure and thrive I've reintroduced a bill to place a statue of her in our nation's Capitol. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) March 7, 2019[3]A statue. Really? Hickenlooper: 'Hickenlooper kicks off campaign with fiery ode to pragmatism' [Associated Press[4]]. ''This isn't about unity for unity's sake,' Hickenlooper said. 'America stops working when we work against each other.It's time to end this American crisis of division. It's time to bring all Americans together. And that's why I'm running to be President of the United States.'' And nothing brings Americans together like drilling for oil near public schools! More: 'Echoing in the background of Hickenlooper's address were chants of a few dozen activists protesting Hickenlooper's reluctance to stop hydraulic fracturing, also known as 'fracking.' Activists for years have seethed at Hickenlooper, who remained close to the energy industry while he was governor.' \u2022 Colorado readers may wish to comment on 'remained close.' Sanders (1): 'Nearly 40 percent of Sanders 2020 donors so far appear to be new supporters: report' [The Hill[5]]. 'There are also more than 48,000 donors who have agreed to give Sanders recurring donations. Those recurring donations will be worth more than $1 million in total per month, the Times reported, citing statistics provided by the Sanders campaign. According to the Times, the average contribution was less than $26.' \u2022 Sanders is not generally seen as a strategist. But in 2016 he built (as we see here) a fundraising apparatus bypassing the Democrat party and its donor class. In 2018 he built a media apparatus[6] bypassing the mainstream press, whose commanding heights are, in the main, controlled by Democrats. If, in 2020, his canvassing operation of volunteers bypasses the Democrat Party at the district and precinct level, he will have built a competing structure to the Democrat Party within the Democrat Party (think, well, Alien-style chestbuster, if you're a liberal Democrat loyalist). In the primaries, that's the way to give Kamala Harris a run for her money without running an air war of costly television advertising (see ya later, Tad 'Creative Differences' Devine). In the general, that would give Sanders an organization with the discipline \u2014 sadly lacking in today's 'big tent' Democrat Party \u2014 to tack left (to pick up those voters who flipped to Trump from Obama in the midwest, for example), having previously tacked right in the primaries (more emphasis on identity politics as a rhetorical stance). If this picture is correct, 2020 should be very interesting indeed. Oh, and the press won't notice any of this, because it's outside their visual spectrum. But if you see attacks on Sanders that one might have expected, in the past, to succeed, mysteriously failing, the structure I have just laid out might be a place to look for the cause. It would be irresponsible not to speculate Sanders (2), in contrast to Hickenlooper: #BernieInIowa[7] \"Tonight we say to Donald Trump and the fossil fuel industry\" Bernie pauses Someone in the crowd yells \"FUCK YOU!\" ...e place erupts. Bernie, smiling, \"Well that is one way to phrase it, I was going to say it a lil bit differently, I am a Senator ya know.\"  \u2014 Winkle the BernieBro (@the_bernie_bro) March 8, 2019[8]Feisty! Warren (1): 'Elizabeth Warren's new plan: Break up Amazon, Google and Facebook' [CNN[9]]. 'The proposal was greeted with a cheer from New York State Sen. Julia Salazar, a Democratic Socialist ally of freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a vocal opponent of New York's deal to bring Amazon's second headquarters to Queens The plan would pose existential threats to the business models that turned certain giant tech firms into money spigots. Separating Google's ad business from its Search function, for example, would make Google ads \u2014 on which the company depends for nearly all of its revenue \u2014 much less valuable. So would requiring Google to divest DoubleClick, the company it acquired in 2008 that vastly expanded the reach of its advertising network.' \u2022 I think this is good policy. But I also would like Warren \u2014 and The New Trust-Busters\u2122 generally \u2014 to take their case one step further from fixing gamed markets to concrete material benefits for citizens. Until that's done, this is an academic, and not a political, question. (I believe Austin Frerick has done this in Iowa for Big Ag vs. farmers, but the practice really needs to become second nature for the entire school of thought.) Warren's actual proposal: Warren (2): 'Here's how we can break up Big Tech' [Elizabeth Warren, Medium[10]]. 'In this tradition, my administration would restore competition to the tech sector by taking two major steps: First, by passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as 'Platform Utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform Second, my administration would appoint regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers.' A quote:As these companies have grown larger and more powerful, they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation, and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people. To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies.Warren probably thinks she's throwing red meat there, but she's not. Where are the concrete material benefits? (Clue stick: 'innovation' doesn't cut it). 'The Democrats' Dilemma' [Politico[11]]. 'The Minnesota congresswoman, along with the likes of Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, represent the unapologetic new guard of progressivism, pushing the party's establishment to embrace tactics and positions that have heretofore been considered outside of the mainstream. Yet they face resistance not just from party elders but from many of their fellow freshmen, centrists who campaigned as fixers not firebrands, moderates who are watching warily as the Democrats' brand is being hijacked by the far left. One of these members is Omar's neighbor in Minnesota: Dean Phillips, a wealthy businessman who represents the 3rd District.' \u2022 Well worth a read. More: 'Fifty years old and fabulously wealthy, with black-rimmed glasses and waves of toffee-colored hair swept neatly back and behind his ears, Phillips looks the part of an industry mogul. His family is corporate royalty in the Twin Cities, with a liquor distilling empire that he took over after finishing his MBA and various properties scattered across the metro area.' Omar, on the other hand2019'Democrats in 2020 Race Rally Around Ilhan Omar Amid Anti-Semitism Flap' [Bloomberg[12]]. 'Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand denounced anti-Semitism in separate statements Thursday, while also saying Omar was being unfairly targeted by those who want to muffle criticism of Israel's policies.' \u2022 Good. And the sequence was Sanders, Harris, Warren, and Gillibrand, at least on the Twitter.Health Care'The Senate's rules will make it really hard to pass Medicare-for-all' [Matthew Yglesias, Vox[13]]. 'Medicare-for-all has plenty of obstacles standing in its way \u2014 the price tag, tax hikes, American aversion to disruptive change [like, you know, the Civil War or the Sixties or] \u2014 but none might be as intractable as the Senate's procedural rules. I've spoken with former and current Senate aides, academics who follow congressional procedure, and a former Senate parliamentarian over the past few weeks, and this was the unavoidable conclusion: The rules attached to budget reconciliation would make it nearly impossible to pass the Medicare-for-all bills being proposed by Sanders and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA). Reconciliation comes with serious fiscal constraints, and the provisions in those single-payer bills that prohibit private insurance and that expand the services covered by Medicare may not be allowed under the rules that govern the process.' \u2022 So there's a Rules Fairy as well as a Norms Fairy. Good to know.Obama LegacyFrom 'The Democrats' Dilemma,' cited above, Ilhan Omar:As she saw it, the party ostensibly committed to progressive values had become complicit in perpetuating the status quo. Omar says the 'hope and change' offered by Barack Obama was a mirage. Recalling the 'caging of kids' at the U.S.-Mexico border and the 'droning of countries around the world' on Obama's watch, she argues that the Democratic president operated within the same fundamentally broken framework as his Republican successor. 'We can't be only upset with Trump. His policies are bad, but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies. They just were more polished than he was,' Omar says. 'And that's not what we should be looking for anymore. We don't want anybody to get away with murder because they are polished. We want to recognize the actual policies that are behind the pretty face and the smile.'That should put the cat among the pigeonsRealignment and Legitimacy'Economics After Neoliberalism' [Cory Robin, Boston Review[14]]. 'The intrinsic links between moral and economic life as well as the intractability of moral conflict, the incommensurability of our moral views, were the kernels of insight that animated Hayek's most far-reaching writing against socialism. The socialist presumes an agreement on ultimate ends: the putatively shared understanding of principles such as justice or equality is supposed to make it possible for state planners to conceive of their task as technical, as the neutral application of an agreed upon rule. But no such agreement exists, Hayek insisted Hayek translated moral and political problems into an economic idiom. What we need now, I would argue, is a way to uninstall or reverse that translation Karl Marx attempted just such a project, but his answers were notoriously elusive. In a fascinating, but little-known 1927 essay, 'On Freedom,' Karl Polanyi also attempted such a project, giving us a stylized rendition of what it would mean for a political collective, rather than a firm or a consumer, to make an economic decision\u2014not in the marketplace, where price helps determine our decisions, but in a deliberative assembly, where other considerations are at play. ' \u2022Hmm. A deliberative assembly. Sounds like debate! (Maybe that would be a better framework for an updated framework of HR40 than a truth and reconciliation commission (commissions being biased toward presentations by subject matter experts, and thus giving a head start to the professional classes). 'Liberals and the left fail to notice - and celebrate - the intellectual death of conservatism' [Real Economics[15]]. 'Economic justice is basic to a republic because, for civic virtue to operate effectively, all citizens must be fully independent from the largess, benevolence, or tolerance of others. It is unacceptable, for example, having employers trying the coerce or even tell employees who to vote for. This concern over dependence in economic relations was the basis of the fight between the Hamiltonians and the Jeffersonians. Jefferson believed that only farmers who owned their own land were independent enough to honestly exercise the duties of citizenship \u2014 the fabled 'yeomanry' of Jefferson's ideal society. In fact, Jefferson wanted to delay as long as possible the advent of industrialization because he viewed subservient factory labor as being unable to exercise the independence required of citizens by civic virtue. The individual with direct access to the productive resources of nature need not rely on other men, or any man, for the basic means of existence. The Revolutionaries believed that every man had a natural right to this form of property, in the sense that he was entitled to autonomous control of the resources that were absolutely necessary to his existence. The personal independence that resulted from the ownership of land permitted a citizen to participate responsibly in the political process, for it allowed him to pursue spontaneously the common or public good, rather than the narrow interest of the men - or the government - on whom he depended for his support. Thus the Revolutionaries did not intend to provide men with property so they might flee from public responsibility into a selfish privatism; property was rather the necessary basis for a committed republican citizenry. What we have here is a strong rebuke to conservatives' fixation on property rights. Those rights were intended by the founders not to protect untrammeled avarice and unprincipled acquisition, but to provide as wide a basis as possible within the citizenry for the maintenance of republican civic virtue.' \u2022 This article is a long response to an article by the Cato Institute's Brink Lindsey in National Affairs. It's interesting for, among other things, citing to Radical Republican Charles Sumner discussing the Fourteenth Amendment. Why is it that we have an enormous work of scholarship, The Mind of the Master Class, by the Genoveses, on slaveholders, but nothing on the nearly forgotten Radical Republicans? Perhaps they would be a good place to start looking at the wrong turning the country took with the defeat of Reconstruction, and the subsequent rise to dominance of the noxious 'Last Cause' ideology, Jim Crow, etc. 'Movement Visions for a Renewed Left Politics' [Law and Political Economy[16]]. 'A generation of organizers and activists who have come of age post-Occupy are articulating visions for transforming the United States, including the relationship of the state to its constituents, and of human communities to each other and the planet. We should all\u2014politicians, professionals, students, engaged community members\u2014embrace the challenge posed by social movements rather than seek to deflect it, as Feinstein did in the meeting with her young constituents. For too long, the agendas of politicians on the center-left have been dominated by top-down, expert-driven, single issue forms of lawmaking supported by sporadic popular mobilization. Think of the Center for American Progress or MoveOn.org as the prototypical institutions oriented toward liberal legislative action in the last two decades. This was the approach used by the Obama Administration to pass its two historic legislative achievements, the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. That formula\u2014supported in part by corporate donors to the Democratic Party\u2014 tamps down anger with the way things are and prevents people from calling out their enemies in the new American oligarchy. The D.C. 'policy-industrial complex' co-opts popular sentiment, demands specific policy proposals, embraces and internalizes public austerity values, and advances their own non-universal half-measures that do not threaten donor interests on Wall Street or in the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, for example.' \u2022 Note thta 'prevents people from calling out their enemies in the new American oligarchy' and 'bringing the country together,' a la Gillibrand et al., are diametrically opposed.; 'On Amazon, a Qanon conspiracy book climbs the charts \u2014 with an algorithmic push' [NBC[17]]. ''QAnon: An Invitation to the Great Awakening,' which has no stated author, ranked at No. 56 at press time, was featured in the algorithmically generated 'Hot new releases' section on Amazon's books landing page. The book claims without evidence a variety of outlandish claims including that prominent Democrats murder and eat children and that the U.S. government created both AIDS and the movie Monsters Inc. Adherents of the Qanon conspiracy theory falsely believe that the world is run by a Satanic cabal helmed by former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and that President Donald Trump and Special Counsel Robert Mueller are secretly working in tandem to eliminate the cabal.' \u2022 Woo woo[18]. Civic virtue this is not.Stats Watch' Retail: 'The key factors behind K-pop's global success' [Quartzy[19]]. 'Hybridity is a distinguishing element of K-pop as it draws on other genres, like R...hip hop, pop, EDM, and more. K-pop labels have also assembled groups with members from places like China, Thailand, Japan, the US, even India to target specific powerful music centers. They even have manuals dictating how to craft videos or present the most optimal group to a specific market. No matter who you are, or how much Korean you speak, K-pop is built to be accessible and sound familiar. These labels are playing the game and it's working because K-pop has gone from being a niche genre to a $5 billion global industry. You haven't heard the last of it.' The Biosphere 'Wettest Winter in U.S. History' [Weather Underground[20]]. 'Across the three months of meteorological winter (December-February), the nationally averaged precipitation was 9.01\u2033, just above the old record of 8.99\u2033 from 1997-98. That winter's precipitation was goosed by a record-strong El Ni\u00f1o event, as was the case in 1982-83 (the fifth wettest winter on record) and 2015-16 (the fifteenth wettest). This past winter saw only borderline El Ni\u00f1o conditions, though This winter's moisture was well distributed, with most of the nation wetter than average. Leading the pack were states east of the Rockies, where heavy snows and torrential rains fell time and again on the north and south sides of a persistent storm track from the Southern Plains to New England. On the plus side, drought concerns are at a low ebb across the contiguous United States. Despite periods of intense drought in recent years, especially toward the Southwest\u2014with the impacts worsened by rising temperatures\u2014the overall trend over the last century has been toward wetter U.S. conditions. The 48-state annual precipitation average is now around 31\u2033 compared to 29\u2033 a century ago.' \u2022 Maybe we won't have to invade Canada for their water after all! 'Polar melting: 'Methane time bomb' isn't actually a 'bomb'' [Yale Climate Connection[21]]. 'This month's 'This is Not Cool' video explores a frightening scenario that scientists began exploring in earnest about a decade ago[22]. They worried that warming in the Earth's polar regions soon could lead to a meltdown of frozen methane deposits, causing an enormous release of that potent greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. 'It's not a situation where we trigger breakdown, and that that breakdown is going to suddenly \u2014 like the whole deposit's going to release its methane all of a sudden,' says geophysicist Carolyn Ruppel of the U.S. Geological Survey. 'That is not a scientifically sound worry.' Though a near-term bomb-like methane release is unlikely, it is true, and concerning, that the Arctic is gradually releasing methane as permafrost melts. That's still dangerous, and it's time to take action, scientists in the video suggest. 'If we mitigate, or reduce, human emissions, [it] looks like you can avoid 70 to 80 percent of the permafrost climate feedback,' Abbott says.' 'Proof of a 2,000 kilometre polar trade route in volcanic glass dating back at least 8,000 years' [The Siberian Times[23]]. 'Valuable obsidian travelled during Early Holocene times from Lake Krasnoe in Chukotka to Zhokhov Island deep in the Arctic. This Great Ice Road was in operation four times as long ago as the famous Silk Road in Central Asia, and it was twice as old as the Egyptian pyramids The conclusion is that ancient people used dog sleds to cover these remarkable distances 'at the ends of the earth'. 'The archaeological data from Zhokhov therefore indicate a super-long-distance Mesolithic exchange network,' conclude the international team of researchers in the Antiquity paper.' \u2022 Makes sense, especially in the Arctic. Obsidian is the onlly substance that can kill White Walkers. 'How to Have a Useful Conversation About Climate Change in 11 Steps' [Medium[24]].

So choose a friend and set yourself up for a win. This is your time to build communication skills and enhance your confidence.' \u2022Do we have any #fieldwork experts who can comment on this approach? It seemed a little creepy to me, but maybe that's just the introvert in me talking. Readers? Our Famously Free Press 'Hiding in Plain Sight: PAC-Connected Activists Set Up 'Local News' Outlets' [Snopes[25]]. 'On 6 February 2017, a website of uncertain origin named 'The Tennessee Star' was born. At the time, it was unclear who funded or operated this 'local newspaper,' which was largely filled with freely licensed content from organizations tied to conservative mega-donors. After some prodding[26] by Politico in early 2018, the Tennessee Star revealed its primary architects to be three Tea Party-connected conservative activists: Michael Patrick Leahy, Steve Gill, and Christina Botteri. Now, a Snopes investigation reveals in detail how these activists used the appearance of local newspapers to promote messages paid for or supported by outside or undisclosed interests. But this story is about more than just the Tennessee Star. Leahy, Botteri, and Gill have been expanding their version of journalism to other battleground states in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election. They are, they say, co-founders of a new, Delaware-registered company[27], Star News Digital Media, Inc., whose explicit strategy[28] is to target battleground states with conservative news. So far, Leahy, Gill, and Botteri have added The Ohio Star and The Minnesota Sun to their network of purportedly local newspapers. These papers are effective carbon copies of the Tennessee Star.' \u2022 [Family-blogging] creeps. 'WSJ to close Jakarta bureau, will restructure SE Asia' [Talking Biz News[29]].

Quoting the Free Press: 'Think of it like a carbon tax, which many countries impose on the oil industry to help clean up pollution. The United States should impose a similar mechanism on targeted advertising to counteract how the platforms amplify content that's polluting our civic discourse.' \u2022If carbon taxes are a good idea, this is a good idea.

[Oxford University] (original, too dense for me[40]). 'The concept of equilibrium is one of the most central ideas in economics. It is one of the core assumptions in the vast majority of economic models, including models used by policymakers on issues ranging from monetary policy to climate change, trade policy and the minimum wage. But is it a good assumption? In a recently-published Science Advances paper, Marco Pangallo, Torsten Heinrich and Doyne Farmer from the University of Oxford, investigate this question in the simple framework of games, and show that when the game gets complicated this assumption is problematic.

I live in the Cuyamaca mountains in the eastern suburbs of San Diego, California. Down in the city it is sunny and warm; up here at 4100\u2032 altitude we've been getting snow the last few days. The tree in the foreground is a Chinese Lantern tree, have to keep it in a planter as gophers live in the hill above us and they love tree roots, they've killed every tree planted up there. : ) Behind and above us are manzanita, scrub oak and oak trees. On the ground the California poppies have started pushing up here and there with some iris mixed in.I love garden projects, and this looks like a really interesting use of that slope. Perhaps Angie will send us an update when everything is in full bloom!* * *Readers: Water Cooler is a standalone entity not covered by the annual NC fundraiser. So do feel free to make a contribution today or any day. Here is why: Regular positive feedback both makes me feel good and lets me know I'm on the right track with coverage. When I get no donations for five or ten days I get worried. More tangibly, a constant trickle of small donations helps me with expenses, and I factor that trickle in when setting fundraising goals.

Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Trade UPDATE 'A data point seen as the bellweather for global trade just tanked \u2014 and 'the floor is not yet in sight'' [Business Insider[2]]. 'South Korean exports, widely viewed as a 'canary in the coal mine' for the world economy, slumped 4.9% year-on-year to $28 billion in the first 20 days of March. South Korea's export data is one of the first major economic indicators released each month. Even 20-day export volumes can indicate whether demand is flagging in China and Japan \u2014 two of the country's largest trading partners \u2014 and highlight trends in global trade.' 'China's Boeing Threat Has More Bite Than Bark' [Bloomberg[3]]. '[N]ow, with Boeing on the defensive, China's calculation of its political interests may be shifting. </p><p>China was the first country to ground the company's 737 Max jet after the plane's second fatal crash in just five months, and now it's reportedly considering excluding the aircraft from a proposal to ramp up purchases of American goods.' Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune 2020Biden: 'Scoop: Biden advisers debate Stacey Abrams as out-of-the-gate VP choice' [Axios[4]]. 'Close advisers to former Vice President Joe Biden are debating the idea of packaging his presidential campaign announcement with a pledge to choose Stacey Abrams as his vice president. Biden's position on the issue couldn't be learned \u2014 we were just told about the advisers' debate. Abrams met Biden in Washington last week to discuss her next political steps, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported[5]. Biden requested the lunchtime meeting, per AP[6].' \u2022Well, I guess now we know why Abrams abandoned Georgia and started taking checks from Neera Tanden in the Beltway. Gravel (1): Gravel has form: Good lord, Gravel absolutely dragged Obama, Clinton, and Biden on Iraq pic.twitter.com/voTtrzBvhb[7] \u2014 Carl \"Gravel Guy\" Beijer (@CarlBeijer) March 20, 2019[8]Gravel (2): While I respect Bernie, I disagree with him strongly on this. John McCain was a war hawk who sent American youth to fight and die and never met a problem he didn't think could be solved through invasion or intervention. The real heroes are those who fought for PEACE.#GravelGang[9] <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/a3l6700Vo4\">https://t.co/a3l6700Vo4</url>[10] \u2014 Mike Gravel (@MikeGravel) March 21, 2019[11]I don't know how long the Gravel account will run, but for now, the highschoolers (!?) running it are doing just fine. Gravel (3): Politicians aren't there to peddle inspirational quotes. Politicians aren't there to be your cool roommate. Politicians are there to enact policy. Look at the policies they back.#Gravel2020[12]#GravelGang[13]       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/llADkGReaI\">https://t.co/llADkGReaI</url>[14] \u2014 Mike Gravel (@MikeGravel) March 21, 2019[15]As above. Gravel (4): '88-Year-Old Mike Gravel Is the Latest Teen Sensation' [Rolling Stone[16]]. '[Columbia University freshman Henry Williams] says Gravel is interested in running. 'Over several conversations he articulated what he wanted to put out there and that he was interested in starting an exploratory committee,' Williams says. 'The senator has all these issues he wants to get into the public debate,' Williams adds. 'That's the premise of the campaign and of getting his name out there as something that could raise these issues and that could get him on the debate stage. We asked him whether he would be all right with us taking over his social media and testing the waters. We worked with him on a series of policy issues that were important to him, and wanted to phrase those in a way that would get traction on Twitter.'' \u2022 Lambert here: Gravel, like Sanders, is a consequence of the Democrat 'Third Way' having blighted an entire generation of politicians. As Benjamin Studebaker[17] writes: 'The vast majority of would-be young Bernies will still be under 35 in 2020 and won't be legally allowed to run for president. Ocasio-Cortez is young by American political standards but she's older than the vast majority of young people I know who might one day be interested in running for stuff. The people in their 40s who support Bernie never received the kind of grassroots support Bernie received when they were younger, and consequently they never had the opportunity to build a resume for the presidency. As a result, the overwhelming majority of Democratic politicians in their 40s and 50s are centrists who came of age politically in the 90s and 00s. \u2022So, the old codgers who were right all along are the only candidates left standing. Thanks, Bill! Thanks, Hillary! Thanks, Obama! Harris: 'Why did Kamala Harris let Herbalife off the hook?' [Yahoo News[18]]. 'Harris declined to investigate Herbalife, the nutritional supplement company that has been accused of fraudulent marketing practices. Documents exclusively obtained by Yahoo News show that in 2015, prosecutors in the San Diego office of the California attorney general sent Harris a lengthy memorandum that argued for an investigation into Herbalife and requested resources in order to undertake such an investigation. Similar investigations into Herbalife were already taking place elsewhere. About three weeks after the San Diego letter was sent, Harris received the first of three donations to her campaign for the U.S. Senate from Heather Podesta, the powerful Washington lobbyist whose ex-husband Tony's firm, then called the Podesta Group, had worked for Herbalife since 2013. Heather Podesta's own lobbying firm, Heather Podesta and Partners, would soon be hired by Herbalife, too. Harris did not pursue an investigation' \u2022 Poor optics, at the very least. Couldn't the Podestas have laundered the money better? O'Rourke (1): 'Beto O'Rourke's campaign received 128,000 'unique contributions' in the first 24 hours. Bernie Sanders had 225,000 donors.' [Texas Tribune[19]]. 'After a campaign stop here, O'Rourke told reporters that he received 'more than 128,000 unique contributions' in the first 24 hours, with an average donation size of $47. O'Rourke's campaign later corrected the average donation size, saying it was actually $48. By comparison, Sanders' campaign said its first-day haul came from over 225,000 individual donors for an average contribution size of $27. While O'Rourke didn't elaborate on what he meant by unique contributions, the measure is generally regarded as different from the number of individual donors.' \u2022 So if one person donated ten times, that would be ten 'unique contributions,' I assume. It took O'Rourke's campaign a whole news cycle to come up with that? O'Rourke (2): I suppose this is what a frenzied crowd looks like in Iowa: Thanks to everyone who joined us for a town hall in Conway this afternoon including Ms. Murdough's AP Government class from Kennett High School. pic.twitter.com/6WnOsIu94l[20]; \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) March 20, 2019[21]Seriously, who's the staffer who picked this photo? I'd like to have a word with them. Sanders (1): 'Bernie Sanders Is Hiring a Former Hillary Clinton Staffer As Research Chief' [New York Magazine[22]]. 'Bernie Sanders is preparing for the coming onslaught of attacks by hiring someone who knows the material best. The Vermont senator's campaign is bringing on [Tyson Brody, Clinton's deputy research director in 2016] who helped pull together the former secretary of State's opposition-research book on Sanders in 2016, according to Democrats familiar with the decision.' \u2022Hopefully, Brody isn't a mole. Sanders (2): 'The Atlantic's Attack On New Speechwriter For Bernie Sanders Completely Unravels' [Kevin Gosztola, Medium[23]]. \u2022 Apparently, having a 'Twitter attack dog' is a bad thing. Trump (1): 'Trump could be left off some states' ballots in 2020 if these bills become law' [WaPo[24]]. 'In refusing to release his tax returns, President Trump bucked decades of tradition and set off a Democrat hunt to obtain them. Now several statehouses are looking at making their release a condition of the 2020 presidential election: Show us your tax returns, or you can't be on the ballot.' \u2022 The tax returns talking point is and always has been the most vacuous ever; the rich have accountants, after all. But that doesn't prevent our Democrats from pushing it. Trump (2): 'Trump goes to Ohio to tout jobs and then attacks McCain at length' [Los Angeles Times[25]]. 'President Trump flew to Ohio on Wednesday to claim credit for keeping a government tank plant open, but distracted from his economic message with his harshest, lengthiest attack yet on Sen. John McCain, seven months after his death.' \u2022Same pattern of Trump not being able to let go as in 2016 with the Khan[26] family; with Trump always righting himself as part of the pattern, when poll numbers dropped. Yang: 'Andrew Yang's Basic Income is Stealth Welfare Reform' [Benjamin Studebaker[27]]. 'It has become increasingly clear, however, that Yang thinks he is a real presidential candidate and that his UBI is for now, not later. The thing is, UBI is traditionally marketed as a post-work policy. The point of UBI has always been to give every citizen a large enough basic income to give them a real choice about whether or not they take a job. This levels the playing field between employers and employees, forcing employers to offer people more substantial inducements to get them to work. But it's increasingly clear that this is not what his UBI is for. Its purpose is more sinister-it is a vehicle for legitimating benefits cuts for the poorest and most vulnerable people in our society. Yang's UBI pays less than $6 per hour with a 52-week year. This is lower than the already inadequate federal minimum wage. It cannot realistically liberate significant numbers of people from work, or achieve the objective of dramatically increasing the bargaining power of workers vis-a-vis their employers. This is no longer a post-work policy.' \u2022 Beware of Silicon Valley squillionaires with bright ideasNew Cold War'CNN Poll: Support for impeachment falls among Democrats' [CNN[28]]. ' In December, 80% of self-identified Democrats said they were in favor of impeachment \u2014 that now stands at 68%, a 12-point dip. Among independents and Republicans, support for impeachment has fallen 3 points over the same time. [Among] Democrats with college degrees, support for impeachment fell 17 points from 79% in December to 62% now.' 'As Russia collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges' [John Solomon, The Hill[29]]. 'Ukraine's top prosecutor divulged in an interview aired Wednesday on Hill.TV that he has opened an investigation into whether his country's law enforcement apparatus intentionally leaked financial records during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign about then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in an effort to sway the election in favor of Hillary Clinton. The leak of the so-called black ledger files to U.S. media prompted Manafort's resignation from the Trump campaign and gave rise to one of the key allegations in the Russia collusion probe that has dogged Trump for the last two and a half years. Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko's probe was prompted by a Ukrainian parliamentarian's release of a tape recording purporting to quote a top law enforcement official as saying his agency leaked the Manafort financial records to help Clinton's campaign.' \u2022 Big if true[30].Realignment and Legitimacy'To the White Men Running to Be the Democratic Presidential Candidate: Can You Not?' [Alexis Grennell, Daily Beast[31]]. 'There's no substantive reason to run this time around with Warren in the field, but instead of helping his ideological twin become the first female president, he's centering himself. 'Not us, but me, seems more accurate.' \u2022 Since Warren doesn't support #MedicareCareForAll, I guess Warren and Sanders are not identical twins, but fratern- Well, I can hardly use the word 'fraternal.' Dizygotic[32]. Better character assassins, please. ''Replacement Theory,' a Racist, Sexist Doctrine, Spreads in Far-Right Circles' [New York Times[33]]. 'Before the massacre of 50 people in New Zealand mosques last week, the suspect released a document called 'The Great Replacement.' The first sentence was: 'It's the birthrates.' He repeated it three times. If the phrase about replacement sounded familiar, perhaps that was because it echoed what white supremacists bearing tiki torches shouted in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017: 'You will not replace us.' It is also the slogan of the neo-Nazi group Identity Evropa. Behind the idea is a racist conspiracy theory known as 'the replacement theory,' which was popularized by a right-wing French philosopher. An extension of colonialist theory, it is predicated on the notion that white women are not having enough children and that falling birthrates will lead to white people around the world being replaced by nonwhite people.' \u2022 More on this thread, which is extremely ugly: Replacement theory is really important to understand as it is one of the central pillars of White Nationalism. Unfortunately, this @nytimes[34] piece by @NellieBowles[35] fails to identify a central factor of replacement theory: who is responsible. THREAD      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/6O2ldfhhB2\">https://t.co/6O2ldfhhB2</url>[36] \u2014 V. Judah Khaykin (@VKhaykin) March 20, 2019[37]Lambert here: I don't know why liberal Democrats who for years have been relying on 'changing demographics' \u2014 the 'coalition of the ascendant' or 'the Obama Coalition'[38] \u2014 to bring them to power didn't expect some sort of reaction; 'Replacement Theory' is 'the coalition of the ascendant' seen through the fun house mirror of reactionary politics. At this point, allow me to remark that it would be super-helpful if the liberal Democrats who still maintain a death grip on the party apparatus who run the party would address not only the opioid epidemic, and not only deaths of despair, but falling life expectancy generally, before some less-stupid-than-usual lizard-brained reactionary frames these tens of thousands of excess deaths as 'genocide,' and manages to form a militant tendency. Sanders-style universal concrete material benefits would help here, of course, but liberal Democrats are fighting him and them tooth and nail. 'I Support Strong Women of Color Unless They Are Politically to My Left' [McSweeney's Internet Tendency[39]]. 'Again, my problem is not with their skin tone or sex. I love that stuff about them. It's their hearts and minds and choices and beliefs I don't like. And isn't that what Martin Luther King Jr. once said \u2014 'Judge not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character'? I know he also talked about the dangers of the 'white moderate,' but I have to assume he was talking about an entirely different white person \u2014 probably Bernie Sanders.' 'Why Democratic 'disarray' is not a disaster' [Brookings Institution[40]]. '[T]he discussion Rep. Omar's remarks triggered will actually be good for the party, not just in Congress but in the 2020 elections as well. Although few political pundits understood why that could be the case, if you have worked in a company or in a non-profit organization to improve the performance of teams, you will instantly recognize the importance and potential power of the storm that seemingly burst out of nowhere among House Democrats. It showed the world that the Democratic caucus, now incorporating 40 new members of widely different backgrounds, ages and political perspectives had passed through 'forming,' the first stage of psychologist Bruce Tuckman's four stages of group development[41], and had entered the second stage, 'storming.' Tuckman's critical insight was that all four phases: 'forming, storming, norming,' and 'performing,' were necessary for every team to go through in order to grow, face up to challenges, tackle problems, find solutions, work together, and deliver results.' \u2022What MBA wrote this tripe? To call a political party a 'team' is a category error, pure and simple. And at some point in 2016, the Clinton campaign dragged the Norms Fairy out behind the barn and had Tailgunner Joe[42] stitch it up. So although performativity performing is still possible, it won't be along this simple-minded linear progression. 'Nevada Dems revamp caucuses after 2016 clashes' [Politico[43]]. 'Rather than assigning some pledged delegates during county or state conventions after the caucus, the party confirmed that it will allocate them on Caucus Day based on the caucus-level results. In 2016, Sanders supporters, angered over Hillary Clinton's delegate victory and alleged deceit in the caucus process, protested at the state party's convention, forcing the Paris Las Vegas hotel to shut down the event.' \u2022 Oddly, they'll still have chairs in the meeting rooms.Stats Watch Leading Indicators, February 2019: Rose modestly [Econoday[44]]. 'This index began to stall in the fourth quarter and the readings so far in the first quarter have been subdued, all pointing to generally flat conditions ahead for the economy which are in line with Federal Reserve projections, updated at yesterday's FOMC, for moderating rates of growth this year.' Jobless Claims, March 16, 2019: 'today's separate data on initial jobless claims are hinting at a bounce back from February's plunge in payroll growth' [Econoday[45]]. 'In contrast to February's abrupt drop in payroll growth in the employment report, jobless claims data have been comparatively stable even during January's government shutdown. And today's data point squarely to steady and strong demand for labor and should raise expectations for a significant rebound in March payroll growth. There are no special factors in today's report.' Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook Survey, March 2019: 'Arguably the most important reading of all in any report, even beyond whatever the headline may be, is new orders and they have been very flat the last two months in this report' [Econoday[46]]. 'Nevertheless, unfilled orders have continued to build New orders are the life blood of business and a lack thereof puts this report in the uncertain category and in line with other regional reports, including last week's Empire State, that have been pointing to uneven conditions so far this year for a factory sector, subject as it is to changing conditions in the global economy, that ended an otherwise strong 2018 in a clear slump.' Quarterly Services Survey, Q4 2018: 'Information sector revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 rose' [Econoday[47]]. UPDATE Finance: 'Wall Street's Latest Love Affair With Risky Repackaged Debt' [New York Times[48]]. 'Just as they did in much of 2007 and 2008, before the markets exploded in a crisis of epic proportions, investors in the debt market, which is even larger than the equity market, are feverishly chasing higher yields and are too eagerly buying up the risky securities that will deliver those yields without demanding the proper premium for the risks being taken. A decade ago, the high-yield investment du jour pushed by Wall Street was mortgage-backed securities[49] \u2014 home mortgages that had been packaged up and sold as 'safe' investments all over the world. Nowadays bankers and traders are pushing another form of supposedly 'safe' investment, the 'collateralized loan obligation[50],' or C.L.O.' \u2022 I'm not seeing that CLOs are levered, though. Readers? UPDATE Finance: 'Revolut Is Testing the Limits of Finance' [Bloomberg[51]]. 'Racing to build what he calls the Uber of financial services, Nikolay Storonsky believes in keeping his foot on the accelerator. Storonsky is getting a taste of the scrutiny that lies ahead as he tries to upend the world of banking with Revolut, his 3-1/2 year-old startup. The U.K.'s financial regulator is examining why the digital bank last summer temporarily turned off a system designed to automatically block suspicious transactions Storonsky has drawn analogies between Revolut and Uber Technologies Inc. and he's blogged admiringly of Airbnb Inc., both known for their whatever-it-takes ethos and their willingness to bend or ignore inconvenient regulations. A neon sign on one wall of Revolut's office exhorts employees to 'Get Shit Done!,' a reflection of Storonsky's belief that the future of retail finance is a winner-take-all race.' \u2022 What could go wrong? The Bezzle: 'Tesla accuses self-driving startup Zoox and former employees of trade secret theft' [The Verge[52]]. '[Scott Turner, Sydney Cooper, Christian Dement, and Craigh Emigh] allegedly made off with information related to what Tesla calls its 'WARP' system, a proprietary software platform the company built to collectively manage things like manufacturing, warehousing, inventory, distribution, and transportation. 'These materials and knowhow were developed by Tesla over many years, and at great expense,' the company's lawyers write. (WARP was described by multiple former employees to CNBC last year as 'seemingly never complete[53],' which made it hard to keep track of budgets.)' \u2022 Crime makes you stupid; these bozos stole crappy software (surely not unknown at Tesla)! UPDATE Tech: 'SK Innovation breaks ground on $1.67B battery plant, bringing 2,000 jobs to Georgia' [Atlanta Business Chronicle[54]]. 'SK Innovation and Georgia officials kicked off construction Tuesday of a massive factory that will supply batteries for electric vehicles in Jackson County, Georgia. It is the largest economic development deal in Georgia in more than decade ago, and will generate 2,000 jobs over the next few years. The company, part of a South Korean conglomerate known as SK Group, said the $1.67 billion factory will be built in two phases and should reach its full jobs potential by 2025.' Tech: 'A third of tech companies are in favour of breaking up Big Tech' [Verdict[55]]. 'Blind, which conducts polls to show the inside opinion of employees, put the issue to tech workers, asking them to respond to the question 'Should Amazon, Facebook and Google be broken up?' A total of 6,082 answered the survey question regarding breaking up Big Tech and although 63.94% of respondents answered no, a significant number of people, 36.06%, answered yes.' Tech: 'Facebook Stored Hundreds of Millions of User Passwords in Plain Text for Years' [Krebs on Security[56]]. 'Hundreds of millions of Facebook users had their account passwords stored in plain text and searchable by thousands of Facebook employees \u2014 in some cases going back to 2012, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Facebook is probing a series of security failures in which employees built applications that logged unencrypted password data for Facebook users and stored it in plain text on internal company servers.' \u2022 Again, crime makes you stupid. Tech: 'Google may rank sites for queries that don't appear on the page at all' [Unlike Kinds[57]]. 'We thought we understood how Google's reading between the lines worked, until recently we noticed that an article published on this site about how Uber's code texts don't keep your account safe[58] was being returned for the queries 2109085405 and 4843218317. These numbers never appeared in the article. Not even close.' \u2022 From the original paper[59] on the Google pagerank algorithm: '[T]he World Wide Web is hypertext and provides considerable auxiliary information on top of the text of the web pages, such as link structure and link text. In this paper, we take advantage of the link structure of the Web to produce a global 'importance' ranking of every web page. This ranking, called PageRank, helps search engines and users quickly make sense of the vast heterogeneity of the World Wide Web.' Read the whole post; it looks like whatever Google search is today, it's nothing like PageRank. Maybe that's why it sucks?

'The Walt Disney Co. has closed its $71.3 billion acquisition of large parts of 21st Century Fox, expanding its global reach and content portfolio ahead of the planned launch of its own video streaming service. Using fiscal-year 2017 data, Disney said in a regulatory filing that the new assets could quickly add about $19.3 billion in annual revenue and $1.6 billion in net income. In that fiscal year, Disney reported $55.1 billion in revenue and $9.4 billion in net income. Disney has promised $2 billion in cost savings from the Fox takeover, with some in the industry expecting between 4,000 and 10,000 layoffs.'

'Children supervised by a responsible adult would be able to hunt deer with a 'pistol or revolver' under a bill the Iowa House approved on March 20, mostly along party lines.

'his state of confusion isn't good because Modern Monetary Theory, once confined to blogs and a handful of colleges including the University of Missouri at Kansas City, suddenly matters. In the U.S., the left wing of the Democratic Party is citing MMT to make the case for massive federal government spending on a Green New Deal to wean the U.S. off fossil fuels and fund Medicare for All. It's virtually certain that MMT will be dragged into the debates of the 2020 presidential race. So the time is right for a semi-deep dive into Modern Monetary Theory\u2014what it is, where it comes from, its pros and its cons.' \u2022 I don't have time to evaluate this article; perhaps readers will. However, we should remember that MMT, as late as five years ago, was unknown to the mainstream.

Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Life's rich pageant in Politics today! -lambert Trade 'One Trump Victory: Companies Rethink China' [New York Times[1]]. 'Whatever deal Washington and Beijing reach over the trade war, President Trump has already scored a big victory: Companies are rethinking their reliance on China. The move, known as decoupling, is a major goal of those who believe the world has grown far too dependent on China as a manufacturing giant. </p><p>As Beijing builds up its military and extends its geopolitical influence, some officials fear that America's dependence on Chinese factories makes it strategically vulnerable. Now companies in a number of industries are reducing their exposure to China. GoPro, the mobile camera maker, and Universal Electronics, which makes sensors and remote controls, are shifting some work to Mexico. Hasbro is moving its toy making to the United States, Mexico, Vietnam and India. Aten International, a Taiwanese computer equipment company, brought work back to Taiwan. Danfoss, a Danish conglomerate, is changing the production of heating and hydraulic equipment to the United States.' \u2022 Hmm. Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune 2020* New candidate Biden (D) (1): Doubling down: Biden comes on stage and hugs IBEW President Lonnie Stephenson. \"I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie,\" Biden says, to uproarious applause from the (mostly male) crowd. \u2014 Nidhi Prakash (@nidhiprakash) April 5, 2019[2]UPDATE Buttigieg: 'Pete Buttigieg Governed South Bend Like a Republican' [Benjamin Studebaker[3]]. Pete Buttigieg may speak a lot of languages, but he wasn't that creative. His big idea was to threaten low income residents with fines if they didn't pretty up their homes. Those who couldn't afford the residential plastic surgery had their homes seized and bulldozed. He brags about this. He calls it '1,000 homes in 1,000 days'. South Bend became better looking by paying a blood price. Of course, once the city looks better, Buttigieg can claim to have 'revitalised' it, even though large numbers of residents remain mired in poverty. Those residents don't have much of a voice in the town, and their lives and interests are swept under the rug. He was re-elected by a large margin, just like many Republican mayors. In his second term, he got really interested in traffic, just like the Republican mayor in my hometown. Calling it 'Smart Streets', he widened sidewalks, added some trees, threw in some bike lanes, and-of course-built some roundabouts. Sanders housed more than a thousand people. Buttigieg bulldozed more than a thousand homes.' Gravel (D)(1): Ouch: 'GOP healthcare solution' is an oxymoron, like 'alone together' or 'Beto policy idea' \u2014 Mike Gravel (@MikeGravel) April 4, 2019[4]Gravel (D)(2): 'Going gaga for Gravel' [The Hill[5]]. 'Who else is going to say his campaign is about 'forcing centrists to confront the immorality of our imperial projects,' or that 'singing about 'unity' and 'love' as your overarching 'ideas' usually doesn't stop an international rising tide of fascism driven by economic deprivation and climate change'?. Did I mention that I love this guy? As of this writing, Gravel was sitting pretty in second place in Democracy For America's online poll[6]. What are you waiting for people? Vote and propel him to No. 1! Give him $1 so that he can get to the debate stage and tell Beto O'Rourke face-to-face that his words are meaningless drivel.' \u2022 DFA?! Sanders (D)(1): 'Congress invokes powers to challenge Trump on war in Yemen' [Associated Press[7]]. ' Rejecting a plank of President Donald Trump's foreign policy, the House on Thursday invoked never-before-used powers to demand that his administration withdraw support from the Saudi-led war in Yemen[8]. The Senate passed the same resolution[9] in March with bipartisan support [Two lawmakers] led the charge for the war powers resolution, Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.' \u2022 I'm trying to bring to mind another Democrat presidential candidate who drove the legislative process to try to stop a war (which rules out Gabbard, though her heart is definitely in the right place). Here's the Senate text[10]: Sanders is the sponsor. To their credit, Warren, Gillibrand, Klobuchar, and Harris are all co-sponsors (this being another sign of how Sanders was dragged the Democrats left, at least nominally). Sanders (D)(2): Bernie's taxes: My take on Bernie's tax returns: 1) He should probably release them, in theory 2) There is literally nothing they could hypothetically reveal that would make me not support him 3) Refusing to release them is making the right people mad and is therefore extremely funny \u2014 Carl Beijer (@CarlBeijer) April 5, 2019[11]* Swalwell (D)(1): 'Eric Swalwell Is Running for President on Gun Safety' [The Atlantic[12]]. 'The California congressman and frequent cable-news guest on all things related to President Donald Trump and Russia will announce his presidential plans in an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. But he won't be running on Russia, or on the continuing fallout from the Mueller report and the Barr letter. Swalwell will center his campaign on gun control.' \u2022 Swalwell is from California, so I'm not sure how Harris feels. Swalwell (D)(2): Unmentioned in the Atlantic article: Swalwell is a CIA Democrat: Wild how the biggest Russiagaters in Congress are also adoring CIA mouthpieces (poor baby, too) pic.twitter.com/6pVKpujp4u[13]; \u2014 Thomas! (@ThomasIsOnline) September 24, 2018[14]Trump (R): 'Trump got no bounce from Mueller. That leaves him a narrow path to re-election.' [NBC[15]]. 'The president's approval rating has been a flatline Maybe when [the Mueller report is released and] voters learn more, the numbers will move, in one direction or the other. Or maybe this is just the latest and loudest example of what we've seen over and over again during this presidency: a gigantic news development, followed by suggestions that a critical turning point in his public standing may be at hand, followed by . well, pretty much nothing. Is there a Democrat who can engage in months of direct combat with Trump and emerge with anything like the kind of popularity Barack Obama had in 2012 when a majority viewed him favorably?' \u2022 I guess we'll find out Warren (D)(1): 'Elizabeth Warren wants CEOs to go to jail when their companies behave badly' [Vox[16]].A summary of the legislation released by Warren's office explains that it would 'expand criminal liability to negligent executives of corporations with over $1 billion annual revenue' who:- Are found guilty, plead guilty, or enter into a deferred or non-prosecution agreement for any crime. - Are found liable or enter a settlement with any state or Federal regulator for the violation of any civil law if that violation affects the health, safety, finances, or personal data of 1% of the American population or 1% of the population of any state. - Are found liable or guilty of a second civil or criminal violation for a different activity while operating under a civil or criminal judgment of any court, a deferred prosecution or nonprosecution agreement, or settlement with any state or Federal agency.Executives found guilty of these violations could get up to a year in jail. And a second violation could mean up to three years.So now we have a way to get rid of the bad apples? Warren (D)(2): 'Elizabeth Warren Issues Her Strongest Indictment of the Filibuster Yet' [The Daily Beast[17]]. Warren: 'So let me be as clear as I can. When Democrats next have power, we should be bold and clear: We're done with two sets of rules\u2014one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats. And that means when Democrats have the White House again, if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama, and puts small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country, then we should get rid of the filibuster.' \u2022 As Obama and the Democrats should have done in 2009[18], for pity's sake. IA: 'UnitedHealthcare is pulling out of Iowa's private Medicaid management program' [Des Moines Register[19]]. 'UnitedHealthcare was paid about $2 billion[20] in federal and state money to manage Iowans' health care last fiscal year. It is the second Medicaid management company to bail out of Iowa since the state's controversial decision to privatize its Medicaid system. AmeriHealth Caritas left the state in 2017[21] after complaining that it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the project.' \u2022 That should put health care front and center in the Iowa primary, along with privatization. IA: 'Socialism, but in Iowa' [The Atlantic[22]]. '[Caroline Schoonover, co-chair of the Central Iowa DSA, and the other socialists I met in Iowa are not Upper West Siders from moneyed families, nor are they, for the most part, graduates of elite Ivy League schools. Instead, the people I spoke with see the DSA as a vehicle for changing their own immediate circumstances. They want to build a movement that transcends individual politicians, whose positions are malleable and whose tenure is temporary. And while most establishment Democrats would like to distance themselves from the label, the trajectory of America's newly surging socialist movement could ultimately shape the party's future. Schoonover's chapter, which has about 160 members, didn't exist before 2016\u2014none of Iowa's DSA groups did. All the members at the meeting had their own reasons for joining the DSA, but most of those reasons were rooted in personal financial struggle: They were drowning in an ocean of student debt, or straining to pay their rent or afford their insurance premiums.' And:But more important, they say, working on behalf of a single candidate will only distract from their efforts to organize tenants and build power in their communities. 'We don't talk about Bernie,' Schoonover explained. 'He's not a factor in our organizing at all.' Most of them would certainly prefer Sanders to other Democrats in the 2020 field, and individual members can volunteer for him on their own time, Schoonover said. 'But we're not a Bernie Sanders fan club just waiting for our chance to finally knock doors for him.'This is good reporting from the Atlantic, which will not surprise NC readers; see Water Cooler on Central Iowa DSA back in March[23]. (Note again, from Pittsburgh, how fast a DSA chapter can go sour. But one does wonder what the class composition of Pittsburgh was; Studebaker describes 'the clique,'[24] but not the membership.)RussiaGateHoly moley: The pro-Mueller ralliers in Times Square have distributed this songbook.

'I think that most capitalists don't know how to divide the economic pie well and most socialists don't know how to grow it well, yet we are now at a juncture in which either a) people of different ideological inclinations will work together to skillfully re-engineer the system so that the pie is both divided and grown well or b) we will have great conflict and some form of revolution that will hurt most everyone and will shrink the pie. I believe that all good things taken to an extreme can be self-destructive and that everything must evolve or die. This is now true for capitalism. In this report I show why I believe that capitalism is now not working for the majority of Americans, I diagnose why it is producing these inadequate results, and I offer some suggestions for what can be done to reform it.' \u2022Splits go all the way to the top; see, e.g., Philippe galit[28].

'For the most part, the successful members of Congress wake up early for some fundraising over breakfast, commute to work (while fundraising), meet with some lobbyists and constituents in their office, yuk it up with colleagues during votes on bills that rarely become laws, then it's off to happy hour for some quick fundraising before finally settling down with some of their closest donors for dinner, dessert and fundraising.' \u2022 It's all about the benjamins  'You elected them to write new laws.

Disguised as the work of lawmakers, these so-called 'model' bills get copied in one state Capitol after another, quietly advancing the agenda of the people who write them. A two-year investigation by USA TODAY, The Arizona Republic and the Center for Public Integrity reveals for the first time the extent to which special interests have infiltrated state legislatures using model legislation. USA TODAY and the Republic found at least 10,000 bills almost entirely copied from model legislation were introduced nationwide in the past eight years, and more than 2,100 of those bills were signed into law.' \u2022 This is excellent reporting!

The payroll breakdown is mixed and highlighted once again by professional ...siness services. But the strong takeaway from today's report is very positive.

'House Democrats Voted for a Natural Gas Future, and Nobody Noticed' [Walker Bragman, Paste[46]]. 'Ocasio-Cortez had been one of 224 House Democrats[47] to back a bill that, if passed, would allocate roughly $580 million in federal funding over two years to public and private energy development projects in Europe and Eurasia, including natural gas infrastructure. H.R. 1616 was introduced by Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-AL) early last month. Disguised as a measure to crack Russia's energy dominance in Europe and Eurasia, it passed the House easily on March 25 with a margin of 391-to-24 and no Democratic opposition\u2014though 10 Democrats did not vote, including six members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

Rachel is just the tip of the rotten iceberg. Take, for instance, Keith Olbermann. 'We are at war with Russia,' Olbermann gravely proclaims. The inauguration of Donald Trump, he prophesies, will mark 'the end of the United States as an independent country.' Anyone who rejects this analysis is a 'traitor' says Olbermann, and in league with 'Russian scum.' His recommendation is to thwart Trump via some harebrained Electoral College scheme where electors are intimidated into violating their duty to vote according to the election outcome in their respective states and districts. I covered this attempted coup at the time[56], which failed, but was supported by leading Democrats[57] ranging from Hillary Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri to Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe; as well as Michael Moore, Lawrence Lessig, Peter Beinart, DeRay McKesson, Paul Krugman, and Neera Tanden. Prominent liberals had been melodramatically whinging for months about how appalled they were by Trump's alleged propensity to violate 'norms,' but the next minute they turned around and demanded that all norms governing the centuries-old Electoral College process be thrown out the window.

Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Trade 'China and US reach milestone agreement on road to trade peace' [South China Morning Post[1]]. 'China and the United States have agreed to set up enforcement offices to monitor implementation of trade pledges, making a breakthrough that paves the way for ending their tariff war. The enforcement mechanism and the establishment of the offices have been major hurdles to an accord between the two nations, with China concerned that checks on its policies by US officials would be an infringement of sovereignty. But the agreement will also allow China to monitor US behaviour, a reciprocal concession which analysts said showed determination from both sides to reach a trade deal.' </p><p>'Incentivising Pro-Labour Reforms' (PDF) [Alice Evans, Center for International Development[2]]. From the abstract: 'This paper shows that countries may reduce labour repression if they perceive this as conducive to export growth. This paper traces what happened before, in the presence of, and then following the withdrawal of international economic incentives for pro-labour reforms in Vietnam and Bangladesh. The Government of Vietnam announced it would allow independent trade unions, in order to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and increase market access. Similarly, the Government of Bangladesh rescinded restrictions on unions, following global condemnation of Rana Plaza and fear of buyers leaving en masse. Both governments reduced labour repression to promote export growth. With high-level authorisation, Vietnamese and Bangladeshi activists and reformists became less fearful, and mobilised for substantive change. However, these economic incentives were short-lived: after Trump's election, the USA withdrew from TPP; buyers continued to source from Bangladesh, and squeezed prices (without requiring labour reforms). Both governments then amped up labour repression - notwithstanding private regulation, economic upgrading, industry growth, and mass strikes.'

This was already manifest to anyone who had closely followed the investigation \u2014 anyone, that is, who had taken note that no predicate crime was specified when Mueller was appointed (the special-counsel regulations require one), or anyone who had read the indictments Mueller filed, which demonstrated that Russia's operations predated Trump's entry into the 2016 campaign, that some of them were actually anti-Trump in nature, and that Russia (which is notoriously adept at espionage) neither needed nor sought American collaborators. 'There is no allegation,' observed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in announcing charges against Russian operatives brought by the special counsel he had appointed, 'that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity.' Never was such an allegation even hinted at against the president, nor against any of his associates, a handful of whom were charged either with crimes that had nothing to do with the 2016 campaign or with process crimes (mostly lying to investigators) that were not committed until after the campaign was over.' \u2022 On to Assange!

Over half of U.S. adults (58%) say race relations are generally bad, and while this share is highest among blacks, majorities of whites and Hispanics also say this. Overall, 53% of the public says race relations are getting worse, while 17% say they are getting better and 30% say they're staying the same.

Mark Jacobson, director of Stanford's Atmosphere/Energy Program: 'Rather than increasing costs, the GND reduces costs substantially. The upfront capital cost of a 100 percent wind-water-solar electric power generation system is about $9.5 trillion. However, this cost is spread out over many years and will pay itself off over time through electricity sales. Further, a wind-water-solar system uses half the energy as a fossil fuel system and also eliminates health and climate costs due to fossil fuels. As such, U.S. consumers will pay only $1 trillion per year in energy costs with the GND, whereas under a fossil fuel system, they will pay $2 trillion per year in energy costs and $600 billion per year in air pollution health costs, and will incur $3.3 trillion per year in global climate costs due to U.S. emissions, for a total economic cost of $5.9 trillion per year. Thus a wind-water-solar system costs society one-sixth that of a fossil fuel system.' 'The Science to Climate Action Network: A New Approach to Urgent Local Needs' [Weather Underground[37]].

Flooding is a textbook example of a risk that's often heightened by climate change, and one that can be both alleviated and exacerbated by actions at the local scale. In Hamburg, Iowa[39], for example, community members joined the U.S. Corps of Engineers in 2001 to hastily enhance a levee that was holding back the Missouri River during a massive flood.

That translates to a doubling of noise intensity every 10 years (decibels are calculated on a logarithmic scale). Sound travels differently through air from through water, making it hard to compare the two environments. But the blast of a seismic air gun used to map the sea floor for oil and gas can be as loud as a rocket launch or an underwater dynamite explosion; ship engines and oil drilling can reach the roar of a rock concert (see 'A sea of sound').

Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Here is the site[1]. I have changed to a logarithmic scale for US States and territories. New York's growth regresses from 1.02 down to 1.01. * * *See Vice, 'How to Read the Coronavirus Graphs[2]':Quantities that grow exponentially, when depicted on a linear scale, look like curves that bend sharply upward, with the curve getting constantly steeper. </p><p>On a log scale, exponentially growing values can be depicted with straight diagonal lines. That's the beauty of plotting things on log scales. Plots are meant to make things easy to understand, and we humans are much more adept at understanding linear, straight-line behavior. Log plots enable us to grasp exponential behavior by transferring the complexity of constantly steepening curves into the simplicity of an exponentially increasing scale. On a log scale, we want to constantly be making the line more and more horizontal. The general concept of 'flattening' is still a good one, but it's never going to curve down. And so what we should be looking, and hoping for is a trend toward horizontal.Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune 'They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.' -Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Prigord * * *2020Biden (D)(1): Who did this: Developments in allegations against Biden amplify efforts to question his behavior <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/OWXvnKzvvN\">https://t.co/OWXvnKzvvN</url>[3] \u2014 Post Politics (@postpolitics) April 28, 2020[4]'Developments in allegations against Biden amplify efforts to question his behavior' is galaxy-brained, challenging 'the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage' for obfuscatory supremacy. Biden (D)(2): 'The Biden Trap' [Rebecca Traister, New York Magazine[5]]. The deck: 'As the candidate faces credible assault allegations, his progressive female colleagues are being offered a poisoned chalice.' More: 'And part of what's sickeningly clear is that if Biden remains the Democratic nominee, whichever woman gets the nod to be his running mate will wind up drinking from a poisoned chalice. Because the promise to choose a woman ensures that whoever she is, she will be forced to answer \u2014 over and over again \u2014 for Biden's treatment of other women, including the serious allegations of assault leveled by Tara Reade. This double bind was already apparent this weekend, in advance of McHugh's reporting, when New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez confirmed once again that she would vote for Biden despite their sharp political differences.' \u2022 The poisoned chalice is one that liberal Democrat 'feminists' mixed for themselves and drank long ago. I mean, is Bill Clinton still a respected party elder, or not? UPDATE Biden (D)(3): 'Oppo dumps and behind-the-scenes lobbying: Biden's VP search heats up' [Politico[6]]. 'Biden, who has committed to picking a woman running mate, is expected to announce his vice presidential selection committee by May 1. But the selection itself may not come until July.' \u2022 Shameless joclkeying, and every single one of them throwing Tara Reade under the bus, too. UPDATE Biden (D)(4): 'Why Joe Biden needs to personally address Tara Reade's allegations' [Chris Cilizza, CNN[7]]. 'At the core of Biden's messaging in this campaign is the need to bring respect and dignity back into the White House and the country, to rid America off the cynicism and hypocrisy of Trump's presidency, to expunge the idea that the President doesn't have to follow the rules. Given both his pledge to do better than Trump \u2014 in every aspect of being president \u2014 and accusations of improper touching that have surfaced in the past, the allegations by Reade are not the sort of thing Biden can or should be allowed to deny via a senior female campaign staffer. Reade's allegation needs to be directly addressed by the candidate himself. And Biden needs to answer several questions including: a) Does he remember Reade at all? b) Did they ever interact? c) Had he ever heard of this allegation from her prior to a few weeks ago?' \u2022d) Did Biden discuss Reade witih Obama before 2008, 2016, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 before Obama staged his Night of the Long Knives for Biden in 2020? I'm guessing no. And Obama doesn't like people who make him look bad. UPDATE Biden (D)(5): Nice timing: Today I am announcing my endorsement of @JoeBiden[8] for President of the United States.  VP Biden is a deeply dedicated public servant with the ability to unite the American people. I am moved by his compassion and ability to connect with people on the most human level. \u2014 Pramila Jayapal (@PramilaJayapal) April 27, 2020[9]UPDATE Sanders (D)(1): 'New York Democrats cancel 2020 primary, kicking Bernie Sanders off the ballot' [The Week[10]]. 'Sanders suspended his 2020 run last month and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden, but still wanted his supporters to vote for him so his delegates could 'exert significant influence over the party platform and other functions' at the Democratic National Convention. But Doug Kellner, one of the two Democratic commissioners on the elections board in New York, concluded Sanders' suspension 'ended the real context for the primary election.' 'Joe Biden is the only candidate and therefore he is effectively the winner of the New York primary,' Kellner said, so holding the primary would be 'unnecessary and frivolous' during the coronavirus pandemic.' \u2022 Leaving aside that Cuomo is mailing ballots to all New York residents, it would be foolish to think that Kellner and the other commissioner, Spano, made this decision all on their own, based on 'rules' lol; the Cossacks work for the Czar. At the very least, they called Cuomo. And Cuomo gave either Biden or Obama a heads-up, or everybody knew the score already. (Cuomo could be nobbling Sanders in his own interest too, if he wants to run. It would be ludicrously arrogant of Cuomo to think he could run, but then Cuomo is ludicrously arrogant.) UPDATE Sanders (D)(2): 'New York Board of Elections strikes Sanders from ballot, cancels Democratic presidential primary' [CNBC[11]]. Jeff Weaver: 'No one asked New York to cancel the election. The DNC didn't request it. The Biden campaign didn't request it. And our campaign communicated that we wanted to remain on the ballot. Given that the primary is months away, the proper response must be to make the election safe \u2014 such as going to all vote by mail \u2014 rather than to eliminating people's right to vote completely.' \u2022 No one? Really? UPDATE Sanders (D)(3): 'New York Cancels Primary In Blow To Bernie Sanders' [Forbes[12]]. 'Earlier this month, after Sanders conceded the race to Biden, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a budget bill with a provision[13] allowing the state's Board of Elections to remove candidates who have suspended their campaigns from the ballot and, in effect, cancel the election.' \u2022 Who put that provision in the billl? 'No one'? Little elves? Trump (R)(1): 'Inside Trump's virtual 2020 campaign' [Axios[14]]. 'On a conference call on March 13, top Trump campaign officials decided they needed to move to an all-virtual campaign, according to two senior campaign officials. That decision affects more than 1,000 staff around the country, they said.. Carr had to move entirely to virtual in 24 hours because the campaign was heading into a 'national week of training.' The Trump campaign does a week of training volunteers each month and ends with a national 'day of action.' The campaign says it has signed up more than 275,000 new volunteers since the switch to all-virtual on March 13. A senior campaign official said this is significantly higher than normal.' \u2022 And:  this week the trump campaign released their organizing app which should frighten everyone.  clearly reading from the bernie 2020 playbook on how to do mass volunteer organizing. pic.twitter.com/ApRVFvrhGQ[15]; \u2014 Emily Isaac (@emily_isaac_) April 28, 2020[16]Ventura (G)(1): 'Jesse Ventura says he's 'testing the waters' for Green Party bid for president' [The Hill[17]]. 'Jesse Ventura, who served as Minnesota governor as a member of the Reform Party, said Monday that he is 'testing the waters' for a potential 2020 run for president on the Green Party ticket. In a pair of tweets, the former wrestling star, who has repeatedly floated a White House bid, said he endorses the Green Party's platform and had authorized a letter to the party signaling his interest in running for its presidential nomination. If he entered the race, Ventura would be one of several declared candidates for the Green Party's nomination. The hopeful currently leading the pack is Howie Hawkins, a New York trade unionist and activist who co-founded the Green Party and is already endorsed by the Socialist Party, another third party. 'If I do do it, Trump will not have a chance,' Ventura said in 2018. 'For one, Trump knows wrestling. He participated in two Wrestlemanias. He knows he can never out-talk a wrestler, and he knows I'm the greatest talker wrestling's ever had,' he said.' \u2022 Certainly something to consider.* * * RussiaGateUPDATE 'Steele Claims Clinton Lawyer Provided Tip about Trump Campaign Contacts with Russian Bank' [National Review[18]]. 'Christopher Steele admitted in a court hearing last month that his claims of secret communication between the 2016 Trump campaign and a Russian bank were based on a tip from a lawyer representing the DNC and Clinton campaign. Steele claimed in his infamous dossier that the founders of Alfa Bank had 'illicit' ties to Vladimir Putin and acted as undercover messaging channel between the Kremlin and the Trump Organization, but did not say where he had received the information. But under questioning from the lawyer of the bank owners, who sued him for defamation, Steele revealed that on July 29, 2016, he was told of the story by Perkins Coie lawyer and former DOJ official Michael Sussmann.' \u2022 Oh.  Realignment and LegitimacyCollapse of Federalism?  Regional compacts on #COVID19 (map is documented in the thread): April 27: Nevada &amp;#38; Colorado formally join Western States Pact, county health officials on the Illinois-Missouri border work together since their governors won't, and Massachusetts now also coordinating with Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire. 1/ pic.twitter.com/WrcosfLsS8[19]; \u2014 Alfred Twu (@alfred_twu) April 27, 2020[20]As usual, Trump is catalyzing an existing tendency, in this case centripetal forces in the Union's regions (although now on rereading, that's a stirred and not shaken metaphor). 'California's Closed, Texas Open and States Go Their Own Way' [Bloomberg[21]]. 'The proliferation of plans, with their byzantine phases and conditions varying across regions \u2014 and even within states \u2014 reinforced just how divided the country remains on how and when to reopen the economy. '50 flowers bloom' in absence of strong guidance from Trump.'  And regional approaches are not, prima facie insane. Would trying to force a Federal solution be pushing on a string? Super-weird: In California #SARSCov2[22] is an end-of-days apocalypse, but in Texas it's somewhat worse than the flu and life goes on. Must have to do with the Santa Ana winds or something. \u2014 Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) April 27, 2020[23]There aren't just cultural and political differences between TX and CA, but climate and population differences as well. (Successes like South Korea, Taiwan, and New Zealand are not continental nations; two are islands, one is a peninsula with a single neighbor.) UPDATE '#8216;Calexit' May Be A Long Way Off, But Balkanization Won't Be' [The American Conservative[24]]. 'Every American Governor thinks his or her state is special, but only California Governor Gavin Newsom regularly refers to his as a 'nation-state[25].'.. The California roadmap is the latest in a long line of policies practically and symbolically distancing the Golden State from the rest of the country. California has long been the only state granted the right to maintain its own auto emissions standards. Since 2017 it has prevented state employees from traveling on official business to other states that, in the evaluation of its Attorney General, maintain legal 'discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.' California is a self-declared 'sanctuary state' limiting the degree to which state and local law enforcement may cooperate with federal immigration officials. In 2019 it began covering certain illegal immigrants in its state Medicaid program, and this year created a state-based coronavirus relief fund specifically for residents who are in the country unlawfully. There is no doubt that California is both very peculiar and very large. Yet neither quality lends it the status of a nation, nor does it make California a state in the international legal sense of the term. Nonetheless one day it could become so, and the coronavirus pandemic is creating novel opportunities for California to travel down just such a path. The state already has the political infrastructure to begin entertaining independence.' \u2022 This is a very interesting article, with parallels to the SNP in the UK. I would be interested to kniow what readers in any or all of these three entitites think of this article. 'Cuomo says NY has been bailing out other states for decades' [The Hill[26]]. 'New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said Monday that New York has been 'bailing out' other states for years as he pushes the Trump administration and Congress for federal assistance for state and local governments amid the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo called it 'repugnant' to be discussing 'dollars and cents' contributed by states, but said a tally would show New York repeatedly sending more money to the federal government than it receives.' \u2022I'd like to see how that nets out, considering how we keep having to bail out New York's extractive financial industry. It's also worth noting that the national #COVID19 figures would look at lot better if Cuomo and DiBlasio between them hadn't butchered the job. As long as one is fomenting a 'house divided.'* * *'Schumer to introduce legislation preventing Trump from signing stimulus checks' [Politico[27]]. 'The so-called 'No PR Act' would prohibit the use of federal dollars toward any material that promotes the names or signatures of Trump or Vice President Mike Pence.' \u2022 Raw courage. I like that in a politician. Stats Watch At reader request, I added some business stats back in.

'Top ad firm outlines business sectors hit the most by the pandemic, and the ones that are faring better for now' [CNBC[29]]. 'Advertising holding company Omnicom saw shares up more than 3% on Tuesday morning after reporting its first quarter results. The company said sectors like travel, lodging and entertainment; energy and oil and gas; non-essential retail and automotive have been more immediately impacted by the pandemic and are already postponing or reducing marketing spend. Meanwhile, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, technology and telecommunications, financial services and consumer products have fared better so far, the company said. But it noted that demand for marketing services will likely decline as marketers cut costs short-term because of economic uncertainty.' 'How the Coronavirus Pandemic Has Affected Local Businesses Around the Country' [Yelp[30]]. 'The economic changes from the first quarter of 2020 were unlike anything we've ever seen. In a period of about 15 days as the nation reacted to the threat of the coronavirus pandemic, the economy transformed as much as it had in Yelp's prior 15 years of operation, combined. The first quarter of 2020 has been unlike any other: Businesses closed their doors nationwide, with closure rates abruptly increasing by 200% or more in metros and states around the country; consumer interest in all local businesses plummeted, by 50% or more in many categories, in a matter of a week or two As of April 19, more than 175,000 businesses have shut down - temporarily or permanently - with the Los Angeles metro area hit the hardest with the largest number of closed businesses since March 1, followed by New York and Chicago. Seattle and San Francisco have the highest rate of business closures, as a share of all businesses, among major metros, while Philadelphia and Miami have the lowest rate of business closures among major metros. Every type of business was affected. The businesses marked as closed include more than 48,000 shopping establishments, 30,000 restaurants, and 24,000 spas and other beauty businesses.' \u2022 That's a lot of demand for monopolies who can weather the storm to snap up.* * *Commodities: 'Oil Crisis Prompts Call to Bolster World's Top Carbon Market' [Bloomberg[31]]. 'The oil market collapse is opening a new debate in Europe about strengthening the carbon market, a key tool in the region's bid for climate neutrality. European Union energy ministers on Tuesday discussed security of supplies and the role of industry in a plan for economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson called on national governments to keep the Green Deal the centerpiece of the rescue packages. France [urged] bolstering the bloc's carbon market through measures including a floor price.' Big Ag: 'Avocados Are In, Pork Bellies Out in Era of Pandemic Eating' [Bloomberg[32]]. 'The pandemic has totally transformed the way the world eats. There is no trend, exactly, other than this: People want comfort. They also want to eat their way to stronger immune systems. They're stress baking, but they're also eating healthier than they would have at restaurants. Avocados are in. Pork belly out. Frozen pizzas and instant noodles are selling out. And these seemingly conflicting and converging buying patterns are upending agricultural markets, sending prices for avocados surging more than 60% from early March, while butter is tumbling because of the loss of restaurant demand.' Manufacturing: 'Boeing CEO says 'it will be years' until global aviation returns to pre-pandemic levels' [MarketWatch[33]]. 'Air traffic may not bounce back for two or three years, Boeing Co. BA-0.69% Chief Executive David Calhoun said, outlining the tough outlook for global aviation to the plane maker's shareholders on Monday. 'The health crisis is unlike anything we have ever experienced,' Mr. Calhoun said at the annual meeting. 'It will be years before this returns to pre-pandemic levels.' Mr. Calhoun laid out the coronavirus pandemic's toll on the industry: Global airline revenues set to drop by $314 billion this year. In the U.S., more than 2,800 planes idled. Passenger demand is down 95% from last year. 'We are in an unpredictable and fast-changing environment, and it is difficult to estimate when the situation will stabilize,' he added. 'But when it does, the commercial market will be smaller and our customers' needs will be different.'' The Bezzle: 'Teslas can now see and slow for traffic lights and stop signs' [The Verge[34]]. 'Tesla is rolling out a software update to some of its newest cars that will allow them to see and respond to traffic lights and stop signs, a feature that CEO Elon Musk has teased for years. Tesla also stresses in the software update release notes that the Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control feature is in 'beta,' and that it 'may be conservative and slowdown often at first.''

'For years, technologists have been talking about smarter cars packed with sensors, chips and supercomputers that can replace human drivers. That was enough to get investors excited about the future of automotive semiconductors. with a global recession on the way, you'd have to be Elon Musk to believe that the auto sector, and the chipmakers that supply them, are going to survive with only minor bruising.' Tech: 'Want to Find a Misinformed Public? Facebook's Already Done It' [The Markup[38]]. 'Facebook was allowing advertisers to profit from ads targeting people that the company believes are interested in 'pseudoscience.' According to Facebook's ad portal, the pseudoscience interest category contained more than 78 million people. This week, The Markup paid to advertise a post targeting people interested in pseudoscience, and the ad was approved by Facebook. We reached out to Facebook asking about the targeting category on Monday morning. After asking for multiple extensions to formulate a response, company spokesperson Devon Kearns emailed The Markup on Wednesday evening to say that Facebook had eliminated the pseudoscience interest category.' \u2022Makes you wonder what they replaced it with.  Concentration: 'Is the Coronavirus going to take down any big companies?' [Francine McKenna, The Dig[39]]. 'The fix is already in. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)] have already huddled with the Big 4 audit firms more than once to discuss, together, how to address the risk the coronavirus pandemic has on their opinions on the financial statements of almost all of the public companies listed on U.S. exchanges. I suspect the SEC and PCAOB have already given the stand down order \u2014 no going concern warnings\u2014 as they likely did in secret here in the U.S. during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, and as we found out that the the U.K government did.' Concentration: 'Tech giants are profiting \u2014 and getting more powerful \u2014 even as the global economy tanks' [WaPo[40]]. '[T]he global coronavirus pandemic is prompting a dramatic reversal of fortune for the tech giants. Amazon and Facebook are capitalizing on the fact that they are viewed as essential services for a public in lockdown, while Google and Apple are building tools that will enable state health departments to provide a critical public service, tracing the course of potential new covid-19 infections. The pace of the probes against these companies has slowed as regulators and lawyers are forced to work from home. And while the global economy faces potential unemployment and contraction not seen since the Great Depression, the tech giants \u2014 and a handful of medium-size tech firms \u2014 are already benefiting from new consumer habits initiated during the lockdowns that analysts believe will turn into longer-term shifts in how people shop, work and entertain themselves. The tech giants' deep pockets will enable them to withstand the coming global economic recession, a stark contrast to what industry insiders and analysts expect to be the biggest shake up of the tech landscape in years. As many start-ups collapse, tech giants will expand on the power they've accumulated using the playbook of the last decade: snapping up talent, buying or copying rivals, and eroding traditional industries.' Concentration: 'Sen. Josh Hawley calls for a criminal antitrust probe into Amazon' [The Verge[41]]. 'In his letter[42] to Attorney General William Barr, Hawley presses the Justice Department to open an investigation into Amazon's data tactics that were detailed in a report from The Wall Street Journal last week. In this report, the Journal outlined several instances in which Amazon employees peered into the sales data from independent sellers[43] in order to develop its own competing, private label products. 'These practices are alarming for America's small businesses even under ordinary circumstances,' Hawley wrote. 'But at a time when most small retail businesses must rely on Amazon because of coronavirus-related shutdowns, predatory data practices threaten these businesses' very existence.'' \u2022 Well, a sternly worded letter isn't impressive. Hold hearings! That said, Stoller would ask where the left is on this. And he would be correct. Mr. Market: 'Stock Markets That Never Fall Are Up to No Good' [Bloomberg[44]]. 'It's possible that stock market investors simply expect the economic recovery after the end of lockdowns to be swift and robust. But that's looking increasingly unlikely. The U.S. has failed to suppress the epidemic, and lifting lockdowns is unlikely to bring people out of their houses as long as the threat of the virus remains. Meanwhile, business closures, mass unemployment and the collapse of global trade will weaken the economy for years to come. A more disturbing possibility is that investors have decided that the U.S. government will prioritize preserving stock market valuations regardless of what happens to the rest of the economy.' \u2022 But-* * * Today's Fear &amp;#38; Greed Index: 43 Fear (previous close: 43 Fear) [CNN[45]].

Millions of patients postponed tests considered crucial for detecting early signs of disease, monitoring its progression and improving patient outcomes, according to Komodo, which has one of the nation's largest medical claims data bases and provided its new findings exclusively to Reuters.

Second, maybe this is a management problem, and the wages are too low? 'Who was Jack Tar?' [Aeon[60]]. 'Yet maritime history is not simply Nelson and Trafalgar. The common seamen, those who went aloft to set their ships on a course to victory, riches or discovery, are virtually anonymous. The simple name 'Jack Tar' serves as a label for the entire tribe. The age of sail has broad terms of definition, but a reasonable range is from 1740 to 1840. This was the century when Britain became the world's leading power. In this process, Jack - with numbers that peaked in the Napoleonic Wars at 147,000 naval hands and 115,000 in the mercantile sector - was an essential factor. He would have been the last to see it that way, but it is reasonable to suggest that the engine of progress up to the Industrial Revolution was the plain sailor. He was, simply, the most successful fighting man produced by his native land which, with its taste for booty, pugilism and foreign adventure is saying quite something. So profoundly did he believe in himself, and so deeply did he awe the enemy, that defeat was never contemplated and rarely experienced. His spirit earned him the respect, the admiration and, sometimes, even the love of his officers.' \u2022As fans of the Aubrey and Maturin saga know, viviid though the officer protagonists are. News of the Wired 'How Sailor Moon's Aesthetic Influenced the Worlds of Fashion and Beauty' [Teen Vogue[61]]. 'The series follows Usagi Tsukino, a clumsy 14-year-old who's bad at math and is terrified of monsters. She's also a reincarnated Sailor Senshi (or soldier), known as Sailor Moon, who's tasked with leading a group of other Sailor Senshi to fight the aforementioned terrifying monsters. Though she doesn't have the ideal skill set to battle evil, Usagi proves time and time again that, despite her fears, she will fight any foe, especially when her friends are in danger. She is an unlikely hero, but it's Usagi's vulnerabilities that make her so relatable to fans across the world; it's what made her relatable to me. Before I watched Sailor Moon, I had been taught that you had to be fearless to be a hero, but Usagi showed me that being scared isn't a flaw if you can be brave when it counts.' And: 'In addition to Sailor Moon's themes of love, friendship, and empowerment, the show is known for its fashion. Since it takes place in the '90s, there are plenty of pastels, overalls, high-waisted skirts, and denim-jacket ensembles that still look fashionable today, because the #90sanimeaesthetic is a real thing.' \u2022 It all seems quite benevolent. Surely there's a dark side? '26 words that don't translate into English: foreign vocab to take home from holiday' [South China Morning Post[62]]. 'The colloquial Hindi word rimjhim roughly translates as the sound of light rain or drizzle but also describes the sense of happiness, relief even, associated with the coming monsoon.

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Also semicolons, colons, and close arentheses. erhas it's all for the best all that unctuation simly makes one's sentences overly comlicated. Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune'2020 Democratic Presidential Nomination' [RealClearPolitics[1]] (RCP average of five polls). Biden (34.8% 38.3%) and Sanders (16.4% 17.7%) stabilize. Warren, Harris, Buttigieg et al. do Brownian motion, as of May 28.* * *2020Festival of Biden: Biden (D)(1): 'Joe Biden's campaign of limited exposure: How long can he keep it up?' [WaPo[2]]. 'But after a short burst of activity in the early primary states, his schedule the past two weeks or so has mostly involved fundraisers, which \u2014 while publicly announced and attended by a pool reporter \u2014 are far different from open campaign events. It's not clear how long Biden can continue to limit his public exposure in this way. Some Democratic strategists say Biden, 76, may be limiting his participation in freewheeling campaign sessions partly to play down the fact that he is older than the figure they may remember.' \u2022Or perhaps there's another reason  Biden (D)(2): 'Where's Joe? Biden taking it slow in early campaign days' [Agence France Presse[3]]. '[S]ince officially launching his White House bid in April, the veteran Democrat has made fewer than a dozen campaign stops, and his team has routinely offered a daily update to reporters: 'Joe Biden has no public events scheduled.'' \u2022And buried at the very bottom, the lead, which is or ought to be: 'Biden held a 10-year-old girl by the shoulders at the teachers' town hall after she asked him a question and he told her: 'I bet you're as bright as you're good looking.'' \u2022 More on that- Biden (D)(3): Biden takes a very personal, hands-on approach: In a somewhat odd moment at tonight#39;s AFT town hall, Biden tells a 10-year-old girl, 'I'll bet you're as bright as you are good-looking.quot; He takes her over to the assembled reporters, then stands behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders while he#39;s talking. - Felicia Sonmez (@feliciasonmez) May 28, 2019[4]If the people in the back are Biden staffers, they look like they're ready to whack him with a rolled-up newspaper:Lambert here: Again, Biden's handiness was oppo. And if #MeToo were a principled tendency among liberal Democrats \u2014 just hear me out \u2014 instead of purely instrumental, 'any stick to beat a dog,' we would have expected that oppo to be disqualifying, as it was for Gary Hart. Yet Biden putting his hands on a young girl again looks \u2014 so far \u2014 like throwing gasoline on a damp squib. Now, if there were a feral, low road-type Democrat out there running, what they'd be having their surrogates say is that after Biden knew his handsiness was an issue, and after he'd issued a non-apology apology for it, he went right out and did the same thing again.  That speaks to character. So such a hypothetical Democrat would say, although perhaps in more palatable words, that just goes to show that [genuflects] Obama's Vice President is lazy, stupid, and doesn't learn.* But that's not happening, is it? It's not happening \u2014 at least as of this writing \u2014 because, IMNSHO, neither the Democrat nomenklatura nor their assets in the press can accept that Biden is damaged goods, and goods that were shoddy to begin with. (I mean, you saw above how AFP buried the lede. So far, the only story I can find on this is from [cough, spew] Brietbart[5].) NOTE * Then again, never interrupt your enemy when they are in the process of making a mistake. Nothing wrong with a little masterful inactivity. Buttigieg (D)(1): 'Pete Buttigieg was Facebook's 287th user. Now he says the company has too much power' [Mercury-News[6]]. 'But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, [Buttigieg] hasn't endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting 'a spectrum' of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies.' \u2022Of course not. And read on for the most Mayo Pete quote ever: ''What they've done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,' marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart* home company Nest and an investor who's been to the city multiple times at the mayor's invitation. 'You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you're in San Francisco.'' \u2022Wowsers. I bet you can even get a soy latt! NOTE * There's that word  De Blasio (D)(1): 'De Blasio Among Gloria Steinem's Top Choices For President' [Patch[7]]. ''Mayor de Blasio is among my top four choices for president and the only male human being who is on that list,' Steinem said Tuesday at a news conference where she endorsed de Blasio's proposal to require businesses to give employees at least two weeks of paid personal time[8]. Steinem didn't say who is competing with de Blasio for her backing.' \u2022So there are maies running who are not human? O'Rourke (D)(1): 'Can Beto Bounce Back?' [The New Yorker[9]]. 'He vowed to visit all two hundred and fifty-four counties in Texas, and he did, usually driving himself. 'We went to places so red you could see them glowing from outer space,' he says. 'Places that went ninety-seven per cent for Trump. Nobody had bothered to visit those people before. I learned so much. If you want to serve people, you gotta listen to them.' He live-streamed his travels on Facebook. He never hired a pollster or a political adviser. He refused donations from political-action committees and corporations. And the campaign gained traction. Volunteers started liking, sharing, leafletting, knocking on doors.' \u2022Because O'Rourke had a team of 2016 Sanders operatives working for him, that's why. O'Rourke (D)(2): 'Democrat O'Rourke unveils 'community-based' immigration plan' [Reuters[10]]. 'Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke proposed a new immigration plan on Wednesday that will allow churches and local communities to sponsor immigrants to the United States in becoming American citizens. O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman from the Texas border city of El Paso, said the plan would also give citizenship to 11 million undocumented immigrants living in American faster than previous plans, which have all failed to get through Congress.' \u2022 At first blush, not such a bad idea. Sanders (D)(1): 'Legislative Package Introduced to Encourage Employee-Owned Companies' [Bernie Sanders[11]]. 'Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), along with Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) introduced two pieces of legislation to help workers around the country form employee-owned businesses. The WORK Act - modeled on the success of the Vermont Employee Ownership Center - would provide more than $45 million in funding to states to establish and expand employee ownership centers, which provide training and technical support for programs promoting employee ownership. The bill is also co-sponsored by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and was introduced in the House by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.). The second bill would create a U.S. Employee Ownership Bank to provide $500 million in low-interest rate loans and other financial assistance to help workers purchase businesses through an employee stock ownership plan or a worker-owned cooperative.' \u2022Note the Warren campaign: A 'plan' is not the same thing as legislation. Sanders (D)(2): 'Democrats worry Bernie Sanders could play spoiler' [The Hill[12]]. 'The aide said that when it comes to Sanders, there is a concern among Biden supporters that 'this guy is going to play spoiler again.'' \u2022 I don't have time to dig out the laudatory Clinton campaign quotes about how hard Sanders worked for them in 2016 (or this year's quotes trashing him for using a private plane to make the scheduie they set). And apparently one loyalty oath to the DNC and another to Indivisible isn't enough for these people, so it's not clear would would be enough. And isn't it just a little early for the Biden folks to be picking out the drapes for the Oval Office?

'Trump was elected in 2016 with just 8% of the black vote and 28% of the Hispanic vote, per Reuters. Though it's worth noting that he performed better among these groups than Mitt Romney did in 2012.' \u2022Pretty amazing, when you think about it.

That's where we are now - we try to work out what it means that almost everyone has a phone or a smartphone But this also means that now we go back to the beginning: I'm not updating my smartphone model anymore.

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

All finished.  By Lambert Strether of Corrente[1]. Trade 'Trump trade adviser says he has no knowledge of iPhone tariff exception' [The Hill[2]]. 'President Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro says that he doesn't have any knowledge about conversations between Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook on allegedly exempting the iPhone from future U.S. tariffs. Navarro said he had no information about the deal, signaling that Trump could have made the agreement with Apple without consulting his top trade advisers. </p><p>'With respect to Tim Cook and exceptions, I have no knowledge or comment about that,' Navarro said. Apple's iPhones are assembled in China from parts manufactured in China, the U.S., and other countries, a process that could bring the tech giant into the forefront of the Trump administration's escalating trade actions against Beijing as well as China's retaliatory measures.' 'The Apple iPhone shows that Trump is misreading trade deficits and what they mean' [CNBC[3]]. '$70 billion of the U.S. trade deficit with China is from shipments of cellphones. But that $70 billion is not an accurate measure of the value China added to the cellphones it shipped to the U.S. That's because the accounting used in the 'official' trade statistics hasn't kept up with the growth of global supply chains, which source parts and raw materials from multiple countries to make a single product. 'About two-thirds of world trade now is involved in value chains that cross borders during the production process,' said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the John L. Thornton China Center, in a blog post. Each country that adds a link in the chain also adds a little value to the final product. But those intermediate contributions are rolled up into the final export value that tallied when the product reaches its final destination. As a result, much of that $70 billion U.S.-China cellphone trade deficit really comes from other U.S. trade partners, such as South Korea, Japan and Singapore.' Yes, to be fair, we didn't deindustrialize the heartland only for China's benefit.  'Time for a trade war to clear the air?' [Claude Barfield, American Enterprise Institute[4]]. 'As Politico argues, on China, Trump has decided to 'go big or go home[5].' In turn, China accused the US of blackmail[6] and vowed to respond in kind with both quantitative and qualitative responses. At this point, the battle clearly transcends economic issues and has become a test of political will on both sides. As an aside, the Trump administration is going big across the world on trade. Analysts have concluded that the Trump administration has now declared war on nations from which the US obtains more than two-thirds of its imports[7] \u2014 $600 billion from Mexico and Canada, more than $500 billion from China, and $450 billion from the European Union Last week, Megan Greene of The Financial Times pulled together results from a number of models[8] predicting the impact on the world economy and some individual countries from Trump's projected trade actions. Most found 'an almost imperceptible shift in gross domestic product growth in the US, China and global economies.' Similar effects are forecast regarding the potential collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Although Mexico would suffer great losses, the US and Canada would barely notice changes in their growth patterns. On the Chinese side, there is the calculation, openly touted by Chinese officials, that their authoritarian regime has greater discipline and leeway to withstand US economic attacks. With both sides dug in, it may well be that only a trade war will settle the matter \u2014 and prove (or not) each side's governing assumptions.' If ever a situation cried out for soft power, it's this one  'Trump Tariffs Slam Canada, EU\u2014Not China' [Council on Foreign Relations[9]]. 'As we show in the graphic below, Canada is by far the hardest-hit by the tariffs, with over $12 billion of annual exports targeted. The EU is second, at just under $8 billion. China, a far more grievous transgressor of trade rules and norms, is way back there at under $3.5 billion.' Hmm; see above. Nevertheless, I don't see why we don't pivot from war with China to war with Canada; we're gonna need that water for Vegas, so why not go get it now?

Andrew Free (@ImmCivilRights) June 19, 2018[12]Expect more of the Cassandra role-playing  UPDATE 'Eric Holder May Be Considering a Presidential Run. But Has His Time Passed?' [The Appeal[13]]. Yes. This article is better than its headline: 'According to a dataset made public by legal historian Jed Shugerman, who is writing a book on the rise of the prosecutor politician, our political class is saturated with crusading DAs. From 2007-17 in 38 states, his research shows that 38 percent of state attorneys general, 19 percent of governors, and 10 percent of U.S. senators have prosecutorial career backgrounds. The big presence of prosecutors in our politics goes a long way in explaining why our government has been so ready to see our collective problems (and even some non-problems) as criminal justice issues, always requiring the response of more police, prisons, and criminal law statutes. Have we reached peak prosecutor politician? It does seem like the bloom might be off the rose. Take Senator Kamala Harris' please!2018 'Trump Policies Abroad Will Hurt at Home' [Charles Cook, Cook Political Report[14]]. 'It's hard these days to meet with governmental and business leaders from around the world and not be struck by their growing feelings of anxiety, impatience, and resentment toward the United States. So why is a political analyst who specializes in U.S. politics and elections writing about this? Because we know that midterm elections are referenda on the incumbent president. Everything that a president does is important and potentially decisive in a pivotal midterm election, one with the House teetering on a knife's edge, majority status in the Senate likely to be decided by a fairly small number of votes in a half-dozen states, and the GOP having more exposure in terms of governorships and state legislative seats than either party has faced in many years. Indeed, as my friend, fellow political analyst Rhodes Cook (no relation) points out, Republicans hold more offices from top to bottom than they have since the 1920's. So the risk in November for Republicans is enormous, and yet they seem to be sprinting along in a distinctly uncareful way \u2014 both at home and abroad.' Weirdly [er.] conservative post. Oh for the days of John McCloy[15]! 'Wave elections (1918-2016)' [Ballotpedia[16]]. 'In this paper, we examine the results of the 50 election cycles that occurred between 1918 and 2016\u2014spanning from President Woodrow Wilson's (D) second midterm in 1918 to Trump's first presidential election in 2016. We define wave elections as the 20 percent of elections in that period resulting in the greatest seat swings against the president's party. We apply this definition to four different election groups: U.S. Senate, U.S. House, governorships and state legislatures. Applying this definition to the 2018 midterms yields specific numbers of seats that Republicans would need to lose in each group of elections for the term wave election to apply. Republicans would need to lose 48 U.S. House seats, seven U.S. Senate seats, seven gubernatorial seats, and 494 state legislative seats for each group of elections to qualify historically as a wave against the president's party in November 2018.' I guess we'll see! 'Latino voter expert: Trump has no support to lose' [McClatchy[17]]. 'Exit polls from the 2016 election showed Trump taking roughly a third of the Hispanic vote nationwide. Republican and Democratic strategists estimate Trump's actual support was closer to the high teens, citing election eve polls and precinct level analysis.' Translating: The headline doesn't match the body, and we don't have any hard numbers. We do, however, have opinions from experts partisan strategists.

Thread      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/ms5bmhqdvX\">https://t.co/ms5bmhqdvX</url>[24] \u2014 DSA-LSC (@dsa_lsc) June 20, 2018[25]UPDATE Lambert here: Since it's not my role to wave pom poms, but to keep a cool head (and a cool heart) let me contextualize both Ocasio-Cortez's visit and the DSA direct actions in terms of electoral politics. I'll do that by asking this question: 'For liberal Democrats, what does victory in the #KeepFamiliesTogether campaign look like?' (Let's remember at the outset this moral panic is driven by the same combination of political actors and media venues \u2014 'Maddow wept' \u2014 who generated the Russia! Russia! Russia! panic, which allows us to simplify matters by factoring out considerations of morality, empathy, thematerial conditions of children everywhere, and so forth, at least in the political class, and not necessarily the good-hearted people[26] at street level.) 1. First and foremost, victory looks like victory. Liberal Democrats need one badly. (See Jill Abramson below.) 2. Victory looks like victory in the midterms for Latinx-heavy districts in California. 3. Victory looks like victory for mobilizing citizens on issues vertically by identity, rather than horizontally by class. (In other words, it reinforces the worst tendencies[27] of the 'coalition of the ascendant' ideology[28] that dominates the current Democrat Party.) 4. Victory looks like victory for activism that is neither consistent nor universal[29]. After some thought, I would add 'systematic,' by which I mean considering material conditions taken over time. In this instance, that would mean- 5. Victory looks like the erasure of liberal Democrats' own role in creating today's immigration system (see the Tweetstorm beginning 'I shook President Obama's hand' above). 6. Victory looks like creaming off left leadership and re-incorporating it into the liberal Democrat project at the national level. Wait and see! 7. Victory looks like liberal Democrats regaining moral standing, so they can virtue signal from a position of strength. You will notice that the DSA brakelight project is consistent, universal, and systematic. Making sure people do not get ground up in neoliberal law enforcement for profit schemes is consistent with DSA's larger project. Ditto universal: Although black people, as targets, are most vulnerable, anyone can gain a concrete material benefit (fixed brakelights). And ditto systematic: America has a long, long history of this sort of scheme, which, albeit in a small way, DSA attempts to heal and reverse. The #KeepFamiliesTogether project is none of those things. It is not consistent; measure it against deaths of despair (see under Neoliberal Epidemics below). It is not universal (being only about children at the border, and not, say, about children in Flint, who also suffer in place under a regime structured by the state for profit). It is not systematic, again because of the erasure of liberal Democrats' role in creating the problem in the first place. (This is especially important for critiques that use fascism as a frame). In short, whatever else it may be and whatever other benefits it may being, with #KeepFamiliesTogether liberal Democrats have served up a poisoned chalice for DSA, the IWW, and the left generally. It was a stroke of true genius that they have used the real suffering of real children to do this. Kudos!

(I need to do real research on the correction industry and privatization in this context, but this sure smells bad. 'Trump says he'll be 'signing something' on detained children' [Associated Press[33]]. 'Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has drafted an executive action for President Donald Trump that would direct her department to keep families together after they are detained crossing the border illegally. She was at the White House where Trump told reporters he would be 'signing something' shortly. The effort to end what has become a major crisis for the Trump administration was outlined by two people familiar with Nielsen's thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the effort before its official announcement. It's unclear exactly what the president might be supporting, but he said he would be signing something 'in a little while.'' That's quite a climbdown. 'The forced separation of families is Trump's 'Katrina moment'' [Jill Abramson, Guardian[34]]. ' 2,000 migrant minors' While tens of thousands die 'of despair' in the flyover states. Can we, as alert reader MyLessThanPrimeBeef requests, have some consistency and universality here? (Nevertheless an excellent explication, however performative, of the electoral aspects of the moral panic.) UPDATE 'How Democrats can shut down the Senate' [Vox[35]]. In essence, quorum calls.

The Bezzle: 'SEC documents detail scores of fraud allegations against Coinbase' [Mashable[45]]. 'In 134 pages of complaints filed to the SEC and the California Department of Business Oversight obtained by Mashable following a five-month FOIA process, a picture emerges not of a responsible actor in the cryptocurrency space opening the market to new investors, but rather a company overwhelmed by and underprepared for its own success. A recurring theme in the SEC complaint files Mashable obtained is the seeming disappearance of a would-be trader's money, and what is portrayed as an aggressive nonchalance on the part of Coinbase in response to the loss.' 'Aggressive nonchalance' is good  The Bezzle: 'With More Self-Driving Tech, Is Tesla Ruining What's Best About the Model S?' [Bloomberg[46]]. The Model S is actually fun to drive. (I wouldn't know.) So turning it into a robot car seems paradoxical. 'The juxtaposition of all those cars raised a conundrum I kept chewing over as I drove through New York. Tesla's sales strategy\u2014and its current pricing structure\u2014is aimed squarely at attracting everyone besides people who love the act of driving: commuters, tech-nerds, first-adopters, wealthy Californians keeping up\u2014anyone who might be the opposites of all you dear stick-shift diehards and track-fiends. Yet the Model S P100D still delivers an authentic, and powerful, driving experience sure to pump adrenaline through the veins of even the most discerning driver. The Tesla Model S is a true drivers' car\u2014for drivers who appreciate nice things. But as Tesla continues to add layers of autonomous and self-driving faculties to its products, it threatens to dull and eventually remove that thrill of being a driver\u2014exactly what I've always found the car's most pleasurable surprise. Is the comfort of technology taking care of things for you worth giving up the fun of an actual experience?' '[W]ho appreciate nice things.' Best euphemism for the 10% on up that I've heard yet!  The Bezzle: 'Why Are There So Damn Many Ubers?' [Villlage Voice[47]]. '[T]here's the answer to how Uber got onto New York's very regulated streets: It piggybacked onto an existing regulatory framework, presenting itself as an add-on to the service already offered by licensed livery car companies. Indeed, without livery cars to serve as the thin edge of the wedge, Uber couldn't have launched at all.'

'The social media giant in a 225-page document responding to a set of 2,000 questions by the US Senate Committee on Judiciary admitted that it collects information from and about computers, phones, and connected devices, including mouse, that users use with its various services and that it combines this information to give users a personalised content. Facebook said that it tracks mouse movements to help its algorithm distinguish between humans and bots. Tracking mouse movements also helps the social media giant, which has been under fire for its data privacy practices, to also determine if the window is foregrounded or backgrounded.'

'Dr. Atul Gawande will lead the Boston-based Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase healthcare venture, the companies announced Wednesday.

He is also the executive director of Ariadne Labs, a staff writer for The New Yorker and a best-selling author who is widely recognized for his contributions to the healthcare industry.' Gawande is, of course, a single payer opponent; see here[50] and here. 'Surgeon Atul Gawande selected as CEO of new health care company from Amazon, partners' [Stat[51]]. 'Not much has been revealed about the new health care enterprise from the three corporate giants; in the release Wednesday, it doesn't even have a name. But in his note to friends, Gawande said that 'this new health care organization represents one of the most promising opportunities to accelerate improvement of US health care delivery. The work will be difficult and take time, but it must be done.'' Hmm. It seems to me that quite a good deal has been revealed, no?  The 420 'Canada legalises recreational cannabis use' [BBC[52]]. 'Canada's parliament has passed a law legalising the recreational use of marijuana nationwide Canadians will be able to buy and consume cannabis legally as early as this September.

On 'emotional labor, 'a term first coined by sociologist Arlie Hochschild, it's the work we do to regulate our emotions to create 'a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace.' Simply put, it is the effort that goes into expressing something we don't genuinely feel. It can go both ways - expressing positivity we don't feel or suppressing our negative emotions.' This is an excellent and thought-provoking article \u2014 no, FOSTA-SESTA[55] won't solve the problem in the paradigmatic case \u2014 although it ends with a series of tips about what to do at the personal level. For example: 'Rather than refuting specific, personal allegations, [Ruth Hargrove, a former trial lawyer based in California,] simply sends back a one-line email saying she disagrees. 'Not rising to things is huge,' she says. 'It's a disinclination to engage in the emotional battle that someone else wants you to engage in. I keep in sight the real work that needs to be done.'' 'New Study on Rising Suicide Rates Suggests Capitalism Is Quite Literally Killing Us' [GritPost[56]]. The CDC study (see NC here[57]). With handy map:'The fact that more than half of these suicides were not attributed to any mental illness in a majority of states for at least one year of the period the CDC studied is remarkable, and begs the question of what other factors led to thousands of Americans taking their own lives. CDC researchers discovered that, outside of problems with intimate partners*, the prime causes of suicide for Americans with no known mental illnesses were primarily financial in nature.' Oddly, or not, there's no moral panic about these thousands of deaths whatever. And yet the uneven distribution of casualties on the map would suggest there's something systematic at play NOTE * Not sure how that's separated from finance, which often affects relationships.  Class Warfare UPDATE 'Trump says it'd be a 'great idea' if workers go on 'really long strike' at Washington Post' [FOX[58]]. It would be even better if the tech workers who run The Cloud did. 'In a world of digital nomads, we will all be made homeless' [Guardian[59]]. On WeWork and and 'co-working'* spaces: 'It is telling that this blurring of work and leisure, and the fading-out of any meaningful notion of home, is reflected at every level of the tech industry - from shared houses that double as start-up 'incubators' (see the hit HBO comedy Silicon Valley), through the co-working and co-living spaces springing up in urban China, to the factories in the same country where workers churning out iPhones sleep in dormitories. The erosion of any barrier between grafting and downtime is reflected in big tech's innate insistence that we are 'on' at all times - checking our feeds, sending emails, messaging colleagues. You see the same things even more clearly among rising numbers of networked homeworkers - translators, CV writers, IT contractors, data inputters - whose lives are often a very modern mixture of supposed flexibility, and day-to-day insecurity. Marx and Engels said that the bourgeoisie could not exist 'without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society'; Tony Blair told us that the world of globalisation has 'no custom or practice', and gives rewards only to those 'swift to adapt, slow to complain, open, willing and able to change'. And here, perhaps, is the ultimate proof. After a couple of centuries during which capitalism has recurrently tried to kill the inconvenient human need for domestic spaces where people can escape economic demands (witness such inventions as workers' hostels and old-fashioned company towns), that same tendency is being newly dressed up as a matter of aspiration and personal freedom.' NOTE * As with the 'sharing economy,' where's the 'co-'? Presumably all the workers are invoiced separately in these 21st Century rooming houses.  'Conflict and the Senses: A Review of The Smell of Battle, the Taste of Siege' [Southern Spaces[60]]. 'Sensory history is an exciting new approach to writing history. It offers a fresh take on past perceptions. Sensing between the lines of written sources, the sensory historian recasts history as sense-making activity, not merely a litany of dates and deeds. Mark M. Smith is the doyen of sensory history in the US Smith begins by evoking the antebellum sensorium offered in an 1852 essay, 'The Cultivation of the Senses,' published in Harper's New Monthly Magazine that portrayed the senses as shapers of character and agents of civilization, provided they were exercised properly: '[the] eye should not be injured by resting on a vulgar confusion of colors, or clumsy, ill-proportioned forms; the ear should not be falsified by discordant sounds[1], and harsh, unloving voices; the nose should not be a receptacle for impure odors; each sense should be preserved in its purity'. This preoccupation with sensory order and decorum was particularly intense in a city such as Charleston, South Carolina, built on slavery, where every social relation exhibited gradations of command and obedience. Smith's [The Smell of Battle, the Taste of Siege: A Sensory History of the Civil War is structured around five events, each analyzed through a different sensory modality, while at the same time noting shifts in the salience of certain sensations as the event unfolded. The effect is captivating, and generative of many insights into, for example, military tactics, survival strategies, and commemorative practices.' NOTE * Like coffles This review is from 2017, but it's obviously germane beyond the world of civil war buffs[61], and I just put it on my summer reading list. For example, what does an Amazon warehouse smell like? Or, readers, your own workplace? News of The Wired 'Hot or Not History' [Lapham's Quarterly[62]]. 'In the centuries since the advent of the printing press, there have surely been myriad instances in which names like Ulysses S. Grant, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, Julius Caesar, and William Henry Harrison were printed in considerable proximity to one another, and those, in turn, printed within striking distance of names like Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Anton Chekhov, and Johannes Brahms. It is only in the present and recent past, however, that one might find all those names closely juxtaposed in a roster with a title like 'Sexiest Guys We Studied in AP History Class, dot Tumblr dot com.'' I think this is great, I remember when the Internet used to be great, and I wish the [family blogging] monopolies and their [family blogging] algos would go away so the Internet could be great again. 'Language is more abstract than you think, or, why aren't languages more iconic?' [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B[63]]. 'Why isn't language more iconic? Iconicity\u2014a resemblance between the form of words and their meanings\u2014can be immensely useful in language learning and communication. Languages could be much more iconic than they currently are. So why aren't they? We suggest that one reason is that iconicity is inimical to abstraction because iconic forms are too connected to specific contexts and sensory depictions. Form-meaning arbitrariness may allow language to better convey abstract meanings.' Which leads directly to the proliferation of the ubiquitous emoji (not emoticon[64]), and the question of whether they are dumbing us down or worse. What is emoji for emoji?

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Trade 'For G-7, Trump's racism and misogyny are ok, but his trade policies are intolerable' [Eyes on Trade[2]]. 'Most G-7 leaders have worked to build warm relationships with Trump, despite his xenophobia, racism, misogyny, climate denialism, warmongering and corrupt business self-dealing. But apparently, taking on the trade status quo was a bridge too far. That is a bitter irony, given that the trade and financial policies that the G-7 has relentlessly promoted created the political context that helped to make Trump president. Decades of U.S. presidents from both parties and their G-7 counterparts have pushed international economic policies that have created expansive new rights and powers for multinational corporations and hurt working people.' </p><p>'Lawmakers, industry groups and corporations spent months and millions of dollars trying to sway President Donald Trump away from imposing tariffs on China and igniting a trade war between the world's two largest economies. But for Trump and those closest to him, it was always going to end this way' [Politico[3]]. ''I always believed he was deadly serious about China from the very beginning,' said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and outside White House adviser, recalling his time with Trump during the campaign. 'I'm not at all surprised that we've come to this point. I am a little surprised that China hasn't been more conciliatory. But I think Trump can't back down, he just can't.

S. soybean exports surged in the second quarter and the value of the exports nearly doubled from April to May, the WSJ's Paul Kiernan reports, in a sign of how global trade is shifting in the face of tit-for-tat sanctions between the U.S. and China. Many experts believe the export rally reflects efforts by buyers to get their crops ahead of China's retaliatory tariffs on soybeans. Recent data suggests China was already bulking up buying from Brazil this spring, and U.S. farmers say they are starting to feel the pain from a downturn in prices' [Wall Street Journal[4]].

'Of the 18 competitive and potentially competitive Senate races, those categorized in The Cook Political Report as Toss Up, Leaning, or Likely Democratic or Republican (so not Solid Democrat or Republican), just three are being fought in states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Most of the Senate battleground states are those with disproportionately rural and small-town populations, many in states that Donald Trump carried by massive margins. Conversely, the battle for the House runs primarily through suburban districts of a distinctly middle- and upper-middle-class variety. Roughly half of all competitive Republican House seats are in districts won by Clinton; even many of the Southern contests are in districts with plenty of transplants or a distinctly non-Dixiecrat flavor.'

'Currently, the U.S. has 1.39 billion pounds of cheese in storage, according to the Department of Agriculture and that equates to roughly 4 pounds of cheese for every American. Why so much? There are two main factors. Cheese is piling up due to a dwindling demand for milk, yet farmers are on target to produce a whopping 218.7 billion pounds of milk by December. On top of that, cheese, butter and milk powder store better than fluid milk, resulting in a surplus of cheddar and Swiss. Extra cheese means lower prices, which spells trouble for farmers. The current price is at $15.36 per 100 pounds, which is a dollar below the average for 2017.' \u2022This being American cheese, I think we should say 'cheddar-like product.'

The expansion in output could cause prices of lithium carbonate to plunge to US$10,000 a tonne, just over half the current average price in Asia so far this year, the bank said In the case of cobalt, supply will exceed demand by 652 tonnes this year, and that will widen to 20,842 tonnes next year, Wood Mackenzie forecasts.

Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

As of July 25: Biden up at 29.3% (28.6), Sanders flat at 15.0% (15.0%), Warren down at 14.5% (15.0%), Buttigieg flat at 5.0% (5.0%), Harris down 11.8% (12.2%), others Brownian motion. Harris reminds me of Clinton, in that her numbers are like a hot air balloon, which sinks unless air is pumped into it.* * * 2020Biden (D)(1): 'Two longtime Biden African American supporters in S. Carolina defect to Tim Ryan' [NBC[3]]. 'Fletcher Smith and Brandon Brown, who played senior roles in Biden's last presidential campaign in 2008, attended a meeting Biden held last month with a small group of African-American leaders in Columbia and both told NBC News that he's neglected some relationships in the state.' \u2022Tim Ryan? Gabbard (D)(1): 'Tulsi Gabbard sues Google over censorship claims' [The Hill[4]]. 'In a federal complaint filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Gabbard alleged Google censored her presidential campaign when it suspended their advertising account for several hours last month. 'In the hours following the 1st debate, while millions of Americans searched for info about Tulsi, Google suspended her search ad account w/o explanation,' the campaign said. 'For hours, as millions of Americans searched Google for information about Tulsi, and as Tulsi was trying, through Google, to speak to them, her Google Ads account was arbitrarily and forcibly taken offline,' it reads. 'Throughout this period, the Campaign worked frantically to gather more information about the suspension. In response, the Campaign got opacity and an inconsistent series of answers from Google,' it states.'\u2022 Like everybody else who tries to contract Google. Google's response: Blame the algos, as usual: 'We have automated systems that flag unusual activity on all advertiser accounts.' Come on. The brain geniuses at Google can't figure out that searches for a Presidential candidate are likely to spike after a debate? Gabbard did well in that debate; it's unconscionable the Google throttled her. Sanders (D)(1): I congratulate the millions of people in Puerto Rico who came together to demand the resignation of Governor Rossell\u00f3.

'Warren made the wealth tax[11] the centerpiece of her campaign. It's part of a fusillade of proposals that are more aggressive, far-reaching\u2014and expensive\u2014than any previous Democratic front-runner would have dared venture: break up big tech companies[12] like Google[13] and Facebook[14]; abolish private health insurance and give everyone Medicare[15]; start a $2 trillion industrial policy built on 'economic patriotism[16]' to boost exports; crack down on private equity's 'Wall Street looting[17]'; overhaul corporate governance by putting workers on boards[18]; eliminate the filibuster; cancel student loan debt[19]; and establish free public college and universal child care[20]. Together, Warren's platform amounts to a giant leap in Democratic ambition\u2014some would say radicalism\u2014that dwarfs the steady but safe achievements of the Clinton and Obama eras.' \u2022 Fair's fair. That's an impressive list of policy proposals. Though I don't know if I'd classify ObamaCare as either 'steady' or 'safe.' * * *'Democratic super PAC launches 'hyper-local' ads targeting Trump supporters in rural America' [McClatchy[21]]. 'American Bridge officials describe their effort as one that will forgo conventional TV and digital ads and instead fixate on what they identify as 'hyper-local' effects of Trump's policies in each targeted rural area. The campaign will focus on featuring rural voters who feel burned by the White House and are willing to speak on camera about it. Their stories, rather than just polling data, will drive the media strategy, the officials said. American Bridge has traditionally been in charge of Democrats' national opposition-research efforts, providing damaging footage and information about Republican candidates up and down the ballot. Running a large paid-media campaign like this, officials there acknowledge, is a different effort than they're used to.' \u2022American Bridge is David Brock, so there must be some sleazy, horrid angle to this. 'The 2020 Congressional Elections: A Very Early Forecast' [Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball[22]]. 'In the House, we are in an era with limited ticket-splitting and a weak incumbency advantage. Additionally, the overall House map has a Republican lean: Republicans could win the House back by defeating fewer than two-thirds of the 31 Democrats who hold seats that Trump carried in 2016 (and only three Republicans hold seats that Hillary Clinton carried). The confluence of these factors could allow Republicans to overperform the projection in this model, particularly if Trump is reelected. While the model predicts a good chance of a Democratic majority in the Senate in 2021, that prediction should be taken with considerable caution considering the margin of error of the model and the fact that only a handful of Republican seats that are up next year are in Democratic-leaning or swing states.'Puerto RicoAgainst stupidity the Gods themselves contend in vain: Hi David, I worked in Florida for @BarackObama[23] in 2012.

[New York Magazine[27]]. 'Decades after Polly Murray kept her diary of symptoms, the spirit of advocacy associated with Lyme disease endures. But while Murray's efforts were ultimately vindicated by medical science, a new fight \u2014 for the recognition of something known as 'chronic Lyme,' which can encompass a vast range of symptoms and need not be linked to any tick bite \u2014 has grown into a phenomenon often untethered from scientific method or peer review. The chronic-Lyme community has a new agenda, one that was visible at last fall's Global Lyme Alliance Gala in New York, where supporters gathered at Cipriani heard a speech from Real Housewife of Beverly Hills Yolanda Hadid.'

'Independent forensic investigations demonstrated two years ago that the DNC emails were not hacked over the Internet, but had been copied onto an external storage device \u2014 probably a thumb drive. Additional work over recent months has yielded more evidence that the intrusion into the DNC computers was a copy, not a hack, and that it took place on May 23 and 25, 2016. The DNC almost certainly knew what had happened \u2014 not only that someone with physical access to DNC computers had copied thousands of emails, but also which ones they had copied, and thus how prejudicial to the Clinton campaign they would be when they saw the light of day.' \u2022IIRC, the Mueller 'investigation' never had access to the DNC servers, and thus all forensics remain a matter of at best conjecture (including those of DNC vendor CrowdStrike, upon whom Mueller relied.

But again, this encouragingly serious. 'Green candidate's entry pushes Maine toward ranked-choice U.S. Senate race in 2020' [Bangor Daily News[34] (OregonCharles)]. 'A Green candidate from Waldo County is expected to announce his 2020 candidacy for U.S. Senate this week, increasing the likelihood that the nationally targeted race for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins will be decided by ranked-choice voting. if three or more candidates qualify for the ballot, the race will be decided by Maine's first-in-the-nation statewide system of ranked-choice voting. It's unclear if Gibson will be able to get on the ballot in 2020. The Maine Green party dates back to 1984, making it the oldest one in the U.S., but it has receded during this decade and hasn't nominated a candidate for statewide office since Pat LaMarche in the 2006 gubernatorial race.'  Stats Watch GDP, Q2(a) 2019: 'If there's one strength that is most important for the economy, it's personal consumption expenditures which along with government spending held up second-quarter GDP to a 2.1 percent annual rate that beats Econoday's consensus by 2 tenths. Beating Econoday's consensus by 4 tenths is inflation-adjusted consumer spending which came in at a very hot 4.3 percent pace. This is directly tied to the strength of the labor market. Government purchases, here tied to heavy government spending, grew at a 5.0 percent pace. Consumer spending contributed 2.85 percentage points to the quarter's growth while government purchases contributed 0.85 points' [Econoday[35]]. 'Though the dip in nonresidential investment does fit with the Fed's main concern which is weakness in business investment, this report doesn't speak to any urgency for new monetary stimulus.' The Bezzle: 'Atlanta pauses scooter permits after deaths' [NBC[36]]. 'Atlanta's mayor put a pause on the city's issuance of permits for smartphone-based electric scooter rentals Thursday following two recent deaths. Like many U.S. cities, Atlanta is trying to figure out how to deal with the sudden appearance of startups that offer dockless, electric scooters that are rentable via smartphones.' \u2022'Sudden appearance' = regulatory arbitrage. The Bezzle: 'McKinsey Advised Johnson ...hnson on Increasing Opioid Sales' [New York Times[37]]. 'One lawsuit stated that McKinsey advised a pharmaceutical company to 'get more patients on higher doses of opioids' and study techniques 'for keeping patients on opioids longer.' And in a civil trial that wrapped up last week, Oklahoma joined two other states \u2014 Massachusetts and New Jersey \u2014 in showing that McKinsey offered advice to a drug company on how to increase opioid sales at a time when abuse of its pain medicine was widespread. Although McKinsey is not a defendant, Oklahoma used McKinsey consulting records to help build its case.' \u2022 Have I run this clip from Michael Clayton before? It's about a large law firm, but it might as well be about McKinsey:[embedded content]How do they sleep nights? The Bezzle: 'Tesla Loses a Founder, and a Piece of Its Soul' [Industry Week[38]]. 'On Wednesday, as Tesla announced that it had delivered 95,356 cars in its most recent quarter and another net loss, it also revealed that [J.B.] Straubel will cede his CTO position and step away from the daily grind to become an adviser to the company. For longtime Tesla watchers, it's an astonishing change. Straubel, 43, represents, alongside Elon Musk, the soul of the automaker\u2014a true believer in electric cars and how they could reshape the world. [S]traubel very much was the Woz to Musk's Jobs and so many of the great parts of Tesla emanated from the spirit of that kid playing with batteries in his backyard.' \u2022 The author was Musk's biographer, which no doubt accounts for his curious notion that Tesla has a soul.

'Scientists who study the issue say one of the clearest findings so far on climate change and state security is the former's role in increasing the risk of domestic conflict. 'There's a lot of evidence that internal stability of societies is strongly coupled to the climate,' says Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy and director of the Global Policy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. He and other researchers have been looking at historical events to see if climate factors have increased the risk of conflict, and used their findings to extrapolate what might happen as global warming intensifies. One of Hsiang's studies found, for instance, that the risk of civil conflict in African countries has risen 11 percent since 1980 because of the warming climate How climate might influence international conflicts is not as clear. ' \u2022 So that's good news. I was thinking we'd need the oil for the Pentagon. I guess we'll just need it for the cops and the National Guard. 'Water Shortages, Murder, and Chaos: The Grim Future of Heat Waves' [Vice[42]]. 'Compare that to India's heat wave and drought earlier this summer, during which police had to guard water deliveries from rioters. A water tanker driver was beaten up, one man stabbed six people, and a 33-year-old named D Anand Babu died after being attacked with logs and 'hacked with deadly weapons.' He'd reportedly confronted an older man and his three sons for taking large amounts of water from a public tap. That heat-related brutality seems shocking, but climate change could make it more common. A violence researcher contacted by VICE, Iowa State University's Andreas Miles-Novelo, suggests that the difference between the outcomes of each heat wave comes down to the U.S. being in a temperate climate and having more abundant natural resources. He warns that as rising global temperatures make extreme events and conditions more common, not even America's vast environmental privilege will make its citizens immune from violence.' 'In the US, wells being drilled ever deeper as groundwater vanishes' [Ars Technica[43]]. '[C]urrent levels of groundwater use are not sustainable: resources are being steadily depleted as groundwater use outpaces natural replenishment.. Not only is the US one of the world's largest food exporters (with a great deal of that food reliant on groundwater), but similar dynamics will be at play in other countries that rely on depleting groundwater, including China and India.' 'News Feature: Do hosts and their microbes evolve as a unit?' [PNAS[44]]. '[O]ne theory of evolution proposes that hosts and their resident microbes function as an evolutionary unit. This unit, dubbed the holobiont, carries what some have termed a hologenome, meaning the genetic information encoded by both a host and its microbes. The hologenome theory suggests that evolutionary pressure acts on holobionts, not hosts or microbes alone, and so the two should be considered a single unit of selection. Studies of fish, wasps, corals, and several other animals provide evidence to support the provocative idea that creatures and their microbial inhabitants are linked as holobionts through evolutionary time.' \u2022Rather like debtors and creditors? Games '65% of online gamers face threats, stalking, other 'severe harassment'' [CNET[45]]. 'Online gaming[46] may be popular and fun, but it's not without pitfalls. More than 70% of online gamers have experienced some form of harassment[47], according to a survey released Thursday from the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Technology and Society. And 65% of players said they've experienced 'severe harassment,' including physical threats, stalking and sustained harassment. Among online gamers who experience harassment[48], 53% reported being targeted based on their race, religion, ability, gender, sexual orientation or ethnicity, according to the ADL. Nearly 30% also report being doxed, which means having their contact or other personal information published online.' \u2022 What do our gamer readers think of this? 'The happiness of the otaku: Daydreaming to well-being' [Japan Times[49]]. 'Otaku now is mostly taken to mean people with an obsessive interest in something, particularly manga and anime. The nickname seems to have come about because of a feeling that such people are socially withdrawn and never progress beyond calling other people by super-formal pronouns. And while there has been some reclaiming of the name, there is still a negative connotation attached to it. Yoshinori Sugiura and Tomoko Sugiura of Hiroshima University surveyed 800 adults and scored them for their consumption of 'otaku contents' \u2014 that is, the amount of time they spent watching anime or playing video games, their sense of well being and their tendency to daydream. Sure enough, the survey indicated that among avid consumers of otaku contents or highly mindful people, a higher frequency of daydreaming was related to higher feelings of well-being. The pattern wasn't seen in people not consuming large amounts of anime or games, or in people who do not practice mindfulness.'  Health Care 'How 'Medicare Extra' gets to universal coverage without single-payer' [Vox[50]]. 'Like Medicare-for-all \u2014 and unlike Obamacare \u2014 it's universal, it uses Medicare's pricing power to hold down costs, and it rebuilds the entire health system around public insurance. But like Obamacare, it's designed to minimize middle-class tax increases while stepping gingerly around people's fear of change and mistrust of the government. And so, unlike Sen. Bernie Sanders's Medicare-for-all bill,[51] it holds on to much of the employer-based private insurance market and includes means-tested premiums and cost sharing for all but the poorest Americans.' \u2022 If only venues like Vox hadn't worked so hard, along with conservatives, to maximize 'people's fear of change and mistrust of the government.'Black Injustice Tipping Point 'Hundreds of black deaths in 1919 are being remembered' [Associated Press[52]]. 'America in the summer of 1919 ran red with blood from racial violence, and yet today, 100 years later, not many people know it even happened. It flowed in small towns like Elaine, Arkansas, in medium-size places such as Annapolis, Maryland, and Syracuse, New York, and in big cities like Washington and Chicago. Hundreds of African American men, women and children were burned alive, shot, hanged or beaten to death by white mobs. 'The people who were the icons of the civil rights movement were raised by the people who survived Red Summer,' said Saje Mathieu, a history professor at the University of Minnesota.' \u2022 Well, as for 'distrust,' there was the whole slavery thing. The story also mentions the Chicago Defender[53], which sadly just went all digital this year. Read the whole thing. ''Ready to explode': How a black teen's drifting raft triggered a deadly week of riots 100 years ago in Chicago' [Chicago Tribune[54]]. '[Juanita Mitchell] \u2014 one of the last living eyewitnesses to Chicago's most violent racial conflict that began on July 27, 1919 \u2014 still recalls her uncle Cecil's signal that white men armed with guns had crossed Wentworth Avenue, the racial dividing line, and entered their neighborhood.' \u2022 An episode of the Red Summer. This too is worth reading in full.  Guillotine Watch 'Amtrak will launch nonstop service between Washington, D.C. and New York' [WaPo[55]].

'Photographers, Instagrammers: Stop Being So D*mn Selfish and Disrespectful' [PetaPixel[56]]. From the lavender fields of Provence: 'These weren't people wanting to enjoy the view - or even capture the scenery to share and enjoy well into the future with friends. These are people so obsessed with their own sense of self-importance for the sake of a few instant 'likes' on their social media profile that they find it perfectly acceptable to trespass, steal, disrespect the workers and their land - all in the name of 'influencing' Slowly, an hour before sunset, a tractor and cherry-picker made its way towards 'the tree' at the end of the rows. The tree that everyone had been focused on, the tree that 'made the shot'. Not to harvest, but to unveiltheir sign. A PLEA, to those who were trampling their hard work, produce and land.' 'Did it have the desired effect? No, of course not.' \u2022 Sigh. Don't be like infuencers. Class WarfareI was looking for an appropriate song to share my emotions about Brexit, and came up with this:[embedded content]but I also encountered this wonderful article on the Ramones from Rolling Stone- 'The Curse of the Ramones' [Rolling Stone]. On the music: 'When Tommy joined the band as drummer - as the story goes, none of the drummers they auditioned could play without bombast and flourishes - the Ramones' sound came together. 'I wanted to lock in with the guitar,' he told Mojo in 2011. 'Most people assume that the bass and drums lock in together But I locked in with Johnny, and Dee Dee's bass was the underpinning of it all.' The effect was primitive but also avant-garde: harmonic ideas stacked on a rapid-fi re momentum. 'We used block chording as a melodic device, and the harmonics resulting from the distortion of the amplifiers created countermelodies,' Tommy told Timothy White in Rolling Stone. 'We used the wall of sound as a melodic rather than a riff form; it was like a song within a song, created by a block of chords droning.'' \u2022 But read the article for the life stories of each of the Ramones; it's quite likely that if they had been born into the opioid epidemic, they would have been caught up in it and not survived. So everything's going according to plan! News of the Wired 'The Strange Similarity of Neuron and Galaxy Networks' [Nautilus[57]]. '[W]e\u2014an astrophysicist and a neuroscientist\u2014joined forces to quantitatively compare the complexity of galaxy networks and neuronal networks. Not only are the complexities of the brain and cosmic web actually similar, but so are their structures. The universe may be self-similar across scales that differ in size by a factor of a billion billion billion. Is the apparent similarity [between images of the cosmic web and the brain] just the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns in random data (apophenia)? Remarkably enough, the answer seems to be no: Statistical analysis shows these systems do indeed present quantitative similarities. Researchers regularly use a technique called power spectrum analysis to study the large-scale distribution of galaxies. The power spectrum of an image measures the strength of structural fluctuations belonging to a specific spatial scale. In other words, it tells us how many high-frequency and low-frequency notes make the peculiar spatial melody of each image. A stunning message emerges from the power spectrum graph in Figure 2 (below): The relative distribution of fluctuations in the two networks is remarkably similar, over several orders of magnitude.' \u2022Word of the day: Isomorphism.

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Here is the site[2]. Back to our top five problem states: Florida, California, Texas, Georgia, and Arizona, with New York for comparison:Not quite ready to call that peak for the five problem states. Those curves are all starting to look like a plateau. </p><p>'Coronavirus hotspots ease, but officials warn normal is a long way off' [The Hill[3]]. 'In interviews with state health officials this week, most said they remain concerned that the drop in new cases may be a plateau at an unacceptably high level of transmission, rather than a sustained decline. In many places, evidence suggests the most vulnerable populations \u2014 older people and those with underlying conditions \u2014 are doing a far better job protecting themselves than are younger, healthy people. Many states have closed bars or limited alcohol service after dark to discourage social gatherings, after several bars and parties became epicenters of major clusters. The vast majority of transmission, however, is still happening in communities, and especially in households where one family member might get several others sick.' This chart includes new cases and positivity. Positivity is concerning. In terms of undercounting as measured by positivity (higher is bad), the order from worst to best would be AZ, FL, GA, TX, CA, at 7.46%, is still too high by WHO standards (they want 5%). So all the states are making progress in testing, especially Arizona (20.2%) but all have a way to go. LA: 'LA Mayor Urges 'Extreme Caution' (Men Especially) To Fight COVID-19 Spread' [LAist[4] (anon in so cal)]. 'Garcetti said L.A. County's transmission rate is down to 0.92, which is slightly less than last week when it was 0.94. 'This represents that what you're doing is having an impact,' he said. sHe did acknolwedge the highest death count since the start of the pandemic happened within the last 24 hours \u2014 91 deaths in the county \u2014 but attributed that to a reporting backlog. Of those deaths, 30 were in the city of L.A. The mayor also pointed out an interesting data point \u2014 men in L.A. County are much more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (2/3 of confirmed cases are men and 1/3 are women).' \u2022 That last figure is odd. Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune 'They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.' -Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Prigord The electoral map. July 17: Georgia, Ohio, ME-2 move from Leans Republican to Toss-up. Continued yikes. On July 7, the tossup were 86. Only July 17, they were 56. Now they are 91. This puts Biden at 278, i.e. over 270. July 28: Still no changes.So, taking the consensus as a given, 270 (total) - 204 (Trump's) = 66. Trump must win 66 from the states in play: AZ (11), FL (29), MI (16), NC (15), PA (20), and WI (10) plus 1 to win not tie = 102. 102 - 66 = 36. So if Trump wins FL, MI, NC, and PA (29 + 16 + 15 + 20 = 80), he wins. That's a heavy lift. I think I've got the math right this time! 2020Biden (D)(1): 'Biden, Bernie forces clash during convention meeting: [Politico[5]]. 'A Democratic Party meeting that leaders hoped would project unity weeks ahead of the national convention instead broke out into a behind-the-scenes feud over corporate money in politics.. The spat began when Brent Welder, a Sanders appointee on the convention's rules committee, proposed a resolution to change the party charter to refuse all corporate PAC dollars and limit corporate lobbyists from serving on the DNC for several years. A Biden appointee called for it to be tabled, which some Sanders appointees said caught them off guard. 'Tabling until when?' asked Welder. 'Generally, until someone makes a successful motion to take it off the table,' replied former Rep. Barney Frank, the co-chair of the meeting. 'After the committee expires, if no one has moved to take it off the table successfully, then it dies with the committee.' 'Wow, that doesn't make any sense at all,' said Welder. Jillian Johnson, a Sanders appointee on the committee, said other Sanders supporters urged that the proposal be brought to a vote in the closed-door breakout room by changing the background images on their screens to reflect their support. She said some Biden appointees chastised progressives over it. 'You're acting like children,' someone said, and, 'You were going to lose anyway, so get over it,' she said. 'And then the host just closed the meeting so we couldn't see each other anymore.'' \u2022 Frank is right on the procedure, and right on the merits, if you want Big Donors to run the Democrat Party (and eliminate self-dealing by DNC members who are also campaign strategists). But holy moley, Sanders people, buy a copy of Robert's Rules! Trump (R)(1): 'Trump's Unfitness For Office' [Rod Dreher, The American Conservative[6]]. 'Trump had a phenomenal opportunity, and though he certainly faced hostile and clever enemies (as all presidents do), he blew that opportunity by governing badly. If he were only a tiny bit of the hard man his enemies think he is, wokeness would not be saturating US Attorneys offices in the Department of Justice. It's so depressing. I have never been as concerned as I am now about Democratic Party rule, because they've never been so radical. But I also haven't lost so much confidence in a Republican presidency since the end of the George W. Bush administration. Please spare me the shopworn 'at least he fights' excuse. If he fights, then he fights like a barroom drunk swinging wildly and ineffectively. As MBD points out, he hasn't accomplished much. Trump performs the role of a fighting president. His presidency is like professional wrestling: it only looks like combat.' \u2022Dreher certainly has an odd concept of 'radical.' Worth a read for the bill of particulars. UPDATE Trump (R)(2): 'Trump campaign temporarily halts ad spending for review of messaging strategy' [CNN[7]]. 'President Donald Trump's campaign has canceled a series of advertisement buys over the next few days as they review their messaging strategy, a senior campaign official told CNN. The decision comes after the campaign demoted former campaign manager Brad Parscale and elevated current campaign manager Bill Stepien. The move to promote Stepien and demote Parscale took place on July 15, a little more than two weeks ago. 'With the leadership change in the campaign, there's understandably a review and fine-tuning of the campaign's strategy. We'll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing,' a senior campaign official told CNN.' \u2022'Exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing' makes by brain hurt. I expect Biden will need to prove he's no such thing, so expect more reactionary, suburban Republican-friendly nonsense. UPDATE Trump (R)(3): 'Meme group joins with Lincoln Project in new campaign against Trump' [The Hill[8]]. 'The group Meme 2020 is partnering with The Lincoln Project, a prominent Republican group opposing President Trump's reelection, with a new campaign targeting young voters through popular Instagram accounts. Meme 2020 made its first foray into politics earlier this year with a push backing Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign, but its latest project, which launched this week, is instead focusing on a broader voter mobilization effort. 'Meme 2020 is laser focussed on building out this new medium that has been largely undeveloped in political advertising,' said Ryan Patrick Kelley, chief of staff of Meme 2020.' \u2022 Except for the Trump campaign * * *UPDATE 'Without Medicare for All, This Isn't 'the Boldest Democratic Platform in American History'' [The Nation[9]]. 'he Democratic National Committee's platform committee approved a draft of the party's 2020 agenda this week and committee cochair Denis McDonough promptly described[10] it as the 'boldest Democratic platform in American history.' It's not\u2014unless your definition of 'bold' includes a tepid health care stance that rejects the single-payer Medicare for All agenda that enjoys overwhelming support from Americans in this Covid-19 moment. The proposed platform[11] also pulls its punches on a host of other issues, from marijuana legalization, an end to qualified immunity for police officers, the placing of conditions on aid to Israel[12], a federal jobs guarantee, and a comprehensive approach to developing and implementing a Green New Deal. Sanders delegates from Nevada have called on convention delegates to sign a petition[13] that concludes with a 'pledge to vote against any platform that does not include a plank supporting universal, single-payer Medicare for All.' Progressive Democrats of America[14], RootsAction.org[15], and other groups are circulating the petition and, according to Jeff Cohen of RootsAction, it had been signed by 700 delegates as of Tuesday afternoon.' \u2022 Good. I don't even know what to say about a party that can't take this sensible step, that has worked so well for so many other countries. 'Fueled By Suburbs, Democrats Are Poised For Gains In Key States, Analysis Finds' [NPR[16]]. 'A new report from the centrist Democratic group Third Way, shared first with NPR, finds that Democrats are on track to win the suburbs in five of six key states they lost in the 2016 presidential election.' \u2022Oh. UPDATE 'Democrats' Anxieties Aren't About the Polls' [Charles Cook, Cook Political Report[17]]. 'So other than still suffering from PTSD following Election Night 2016, why are top Democratic strategists so worried? Well, they're fretting over whether polling places will be open, whether a shortage of polling workers due to the pandemic\u2014particularly in large urban areas\u2014could depress their vote. They worry about postal-sorting facilities being closed down due to the coronavirus, which would make it hard to get ballots out to people and back in time to be counted (some states require ballots to be postmarked by a certain date, or received by a certain time). They worry about vote counters being overwhelmed in states where there is little history of mail-in voting. Then they worry about voter-suppression efforts by some Republican state and local election figures. I recently had a conversation with one very senior Democratic strategist. Probably 90 percent of the conversation was about all of the things that worried him, and virtually all of it had to do with the administration of this election and all of the things that could go wrong. Simply put, whether legitimately or out of paranoia, they are less worried about President Trump winning this election than about other factors allowing it to slip out of their hands. When I first heard some of this talk several months ago, I tended to discount it, but whether any of these fears manifest themselves in any meaningful way or not, it is what keeps Democrats awake at night.' \u2022 Imagine the timeline if Democrats had supported hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public after the 2000 debacle. Now we have a system that's broken because both parties want the capacity to steal elections. They made their bed.  UPDATE House districts at the state level (UserFriendly). Red is Republican, Blue is Democrat. (That darkish maroon is 'Uncontested Republican.' There are rather a lot of them.) The map is interactive[18], but here's a screen dump: Health CareAbout that 'empathy' thing: I did get the satisfaction of seeing the so many angry people go after Neera, that she hit the mute button for her first time on twitter. (not agreeing with their language but I am not their sensor, and I definitely understand their anger and outrage) pic.twitter.com/m4Uor7rVDA[19] \u2014 Scott Desnoyers (@scottdesno) July 29, 2020[20] Obama LegacyUPDATE The video is closed captioned, so you don't have to turn your sound up: Barack and Michelle Obama suggest young people don't vote because they're selfish and 'know more about the cereal they're eating' than how government works. This podcast is the smuggest thing I've ever heard. pic.twitter .com/TNL6sXqTEu[21]; \u2014 george w. bush legacy consultant (@BernieWatchdog) July 29, 2020[22]I don't know why there isn't a degree for smugness, because if the Obama's don't have one, they should. Personally, I think any young person who's gotten a collection letter from a student loan agency, or anybody who's been pursued to pay tens of thousands of dollars in surprise billing, knows more about governement as practiced in these United States today than the Obama's ever did or ever will. Realignment and Legitimacy'A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn't pretty' [Boston Globe[23]]. 'On the second Friday in June, a group of political operatives, former government and military officials, and academics quietly convened online for what became a disturbing exercise in the fragility of American democracy. The group, which included Democrats and Republicans, gathered to game out possible results of the November election, grappling with questions that seem less far-fetched by the day: What if President Trump refuses to concede a loss, as he publicly hinted recently he might do? How far could he go to preserve his power? And what if Democrats refuse to give in? 'All of our scenarios ended in both street-level violence and political impasse,' said Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown law professor and former Defense Department official who co-organized the group known as the Transition Integrity Project. She described what they found in bleak terms: 'The law is essentially it's almost helpless against a president who's willing to ignore it.' Using a role-playing game that is a fixture of military and national security planning, the group envisioned a dark 11 weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day, one in which Trump and his Republican allies used every apparatus of government \u2014 the Postal Service, state lawmakers, the Justice Department, federal agents, and the military \u2014 to hold onto power, and Democrats took to the courts and the streets to try to stop it.' \u2022As if Democrats ever conceded their loss in 2016! (On Rosa Brooks[24]: '[Rosa Brooks of New America and Tom Wright of the Brookings Institution, both.. rejected the very idea of ending America's existing wars. They argued that the U.S . troops in Iraq and Syria are really 'counter-terrorism operations' rather than 'wars.' Brooks even uttered the word identifying her as a member of the national security elite in good standing by calling for a 'robust' policy.) The other way of reading this article, which doesn't include quite so much good faith from the Rosa Brook's of this world, is that the national security establishment will be heavily involved in picking 2016's winner (unless there's a landslide, of course). It has also occurred to me that the protests (as opposed to the riots) are a splendid training ground for Women's March and Indivisible types to 'take to the streets.' Rather like 2000's bourgeois riot[25] in 2000, but at scale. UPDATE The Great Assimilation\u2122: President George W. Bush just delivered a truly special speech. He deserved the standing ovation he received. \u2014 Jonathan Capehart (@CapehartJ) July 30, 2020[26]I can't even. UPDATE 'The U.S . election is getting ugly - and investors are getting nervous' [Reuters[27]]. 'Investors are increasingly preparing for the risk of a contested U.S. presidential election come the fall, worried that an ugly political situation will create volatility across markets An election without a clear winner the following day would likely weigh on the benchmark S&amp;#38;P 500, which is up nearly 45% since its March lows and hovering near record highs. The S&amp;#38;P 500 fell 1.8% the morning after the disputed Nov. 7, 2000 election between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush, and fell 5% by the end of the week, according to data from Capital Economics.' \u2022I remember the cries for 'closure' in 2000, not just from Republicans, and no doubt Mr. Market will issue similar cries in a disputed election.Stats Watch At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect[28] click-throughs; they're a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.* * *Real Estate: 'The looming peak season is prompting a rush on warehousing. Retailers are already moving to find more space for goods. as they overhaul distribution networks before an expected crush of online orders this fall' [Wall Street Journal[29]]. 'On-demand warehousing provider Flexe Inc. says demand for temporary warehouse space 'is way up' heading into a holiday season that's wrapped in uncertainty because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many retailers are betting that the big e-commerce surge of under coronavirus lockdowns will continue, however, and are shifting inventory to set up speedier delivery of online purchases.' \u2022 I dunno. If people can't gather round the Christmas tree, what happens to retail? Shipping: 'The new chief executive of United Parcel Service is being cautious on capacity while taking an aggressive stance on pricing. CEO Carol Tom told an earnings conference call that the package giant has the capabilities in place to handle projected peak-season volumes and even turned down an offer from Boeing for three 747 freighters' [Wall Street Journal[30]]. 'Ms. Tom says UPS will focus instead on becoming 'better, not bigger.' That means focusing on improving margins in a tumultuous market that has seen huge volumes of packages flood its delivery network, significantly raising costs. Residential deliveries soared 65% last quarter but profit margins narrowed sharply, a sign of how UPS and its retail customers are still adjusting to the consumer pivot.' \u2022 Ouch, Boeing. And UPS is becoming 'better not bigger' at the same time we're crippling the Post Office? How does that work? Tech: 'Winning Irish Stock Lets You See Who Sleeps Through Your Call' [Bloomberg[31]]. ' Rather than traveling to a single location or dialing into a call, participants strap on a headset or access an app to be virtually placed in the same room. VRE's Engage platform allows non-verbal communications via its avatars, which mirror participants' movements, from shaking hands to drawing on a white-board, and body language. It's also trickier to simply tune out by switching off the camera during a video call. 'There's a reason why people go to classrooms, because you see who's paying attention, you can really interact with people, you can get that eye-contact,' Chief Executive Officer David Whelan said in an interview earlier this month. Using its technology, 'if one of the students falls asleep, you'll see their avatar will fall asleep, they'll slouch over the desk.'' \u2022 Unless the avatars are hacked, of course. For which there would obviously be a market. Supply Chain: 'Pharmaceutical companies are already moving to build the supply chains that would be needed to rapidly get a coronavirus vaccine to billions of people around the world. The enormous behind-the-scenes effort includes lining up the raw materials, factory capacity and special handling equipment needed to make and ship vaccines and it comes even as the potential drugs themselves remain under research and development' [Wall Street Journal[32]]. 'The magnitude and speed of the effort creates room for lapses that could cost invaluable doses of a product that the world hopes can push back a virus that has killed over 661,000, including more than 150,000 in the U.S. Pharmaceutical companies say the scale of the effort is unparalleled in recent memory, far surpassing the annual distribution of flu vaccines. Some operators raise questions over transport capacity, but companies and governments are trying to get the capabilities set up.' Mr. Market: 'Big Tech Earnings Surge During Pandemic While Economy Slumps' [Bloomberg[33]]. 'The largest U.S. technology companies are thriving in a pandemic that has increased dependence on their products and services, while hammering much of the rest of the economy. Quarterly results from Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. on Thursday show the industry is capitalizing on the crisis as locked-down consumers use tech gadgets and the internet for entertainment, social connection, shopping, learning and work. Together, the four companies reported revenue of $206 billion and net income of $29 billion in the three months ending in late June.

'The U.S. Agriculture Department has identified more than a dozen plant species ranging from morning glories to mustard in bags of unsolicited seeds arriving in the mailboxes of thousands of Americans, mostly postmarked from China. The packages have also been reported in Canada, where Ontario's Central Region Provincial Police posted a warning on Facebook Wednesday against 'foreign seeds in the mail from China or Taiwan.'' \u2022 Have any NC readers gotten any of these seeds? 'Plant of the Month: Peony' [JSTOR[36]]. 'While today we think of peonies as beautiful ornamental flowers, for much of their history they were viewed as an important medicinal plant. Writings discovered in an imperial Han tomb confirm that peony root (called 'danpi') was used to treat blood stasis nearly 2,000 years ago in China. In traditional Chinese medicine, the common Chinese garden peony (Paeonia lactiflora) was used to treat high blood pressure, inflammation, and gynecological ailments, including hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles. In the ancient Greco-Roman world, peony, often in combination with mistletoe, was prescribed not only to induce menstrual flow but also to treat seizures and epilepsy. The Roman physician Galen recommended peony root tied around the necks of children as an effective remedy for 'the falling sickness,' a common premodern phrase for epilepsy. Throughout the Middle Ages, peony continued to be used for seizures and epilepsy, either worn around the neck as a talisman or prescribed by physicians. This prescription persisted into sixteenth-century Europe.' 'Why Are Plants Green? To Reduce the Noise in Photosynthesis' [Quanta[37]]. 'From large trees in the Amazon jungle to houseplants to seaweed in the ocean, green is the color that reigns over the plant kingdom. Why green, and not blue or magenta or gray? The simple answer is that although plants absorb almost all the photons in the red and blue regions of the light spectrum, they absorb only about 90% of the green photons. If they absorbed more, they would look black to our eyes. Plants are green because the small amount of light they reflect is that color. But that seems unsatisfyingly wasteful because most of the energy that the sun radiates is in the green part of the spectrum. When pressed to explain further, biologists have sometimes suggested that the green light might be too powerful for plants to use without harm, but the reason why hasn't been clear. Even after decades of molecular research on the light-harvesting machinery in plants, scientists could not establish a detailed rationale for plants' color. Recently, however, in the pages of Science, scientists finally provided a more complete answer. They built a model to explain why the photosynthetic machinery of plants wastes green light. What they did not expect was that their model would also explain the colors of other photosynthetic forms of life too. Their findings point to an evolutionary principle governing light-harvesting organisms that might apply throughout the universe. They also offer a lesson that \u2014 at least sometimes \u2014 evolution cares less about making biological systems efficient than about keeping them stable It might be highly efficient to specialize in collecting just the peak energy in green light, but that would be detrimental for plants because, when the sunlight flickered, the noise from the input signal would fluctuate too wildly for the complex to regulate the energy flow.' \u2022 Plants are so smart. I don't like flickering sunlight either.Health Care 'Scared That Covid-19 Immunity Won't Last? Don't Be' [New York Times[38]]. 'a finding that naturally occurring antibodies in some Covid-19 patients are fading doesn't actually mean very much for the likely efficacy of vaccines under development. Science, in this case, can be more effective than nature. The human immune system has evolved to serve two functions: expediency and precision. Hence, we have two types of immunity[39]: innate immunity, which jumps into action within hours, sometimes just minutes, of an infection; and adaptive immunity, which develops over days and weeks. That antibodies decrease once an infection recedes isn't a sign that they are failing: It's a normal step in the usual course of an immune response. Nor does a waning antibody count mean waning immunity: The memory B cells that first produced those antibodies are still around, and standing ready to churn out new batches of antibodies on demand.' \u2022 So, even if the bloodstream isn't full of antibodies, the body retains the recipes for them. That is extremely cool.  'Virus testing turnaround times reveal wide disparity' [Associated Press[40]]. 'As coronavirus cases surge in hard-hit Florida, so do the turnaround times for test results. The reasons are many: Often it has to do with lab staffing, backlog, or equipment shortages. Some tests are done in house, while others are sent to overloaded labs out of state. Health experts say test results that come back after two or three days are nearly worthless, because by then the window for tracing the person's contacts to prevent additional infections has essentially closed. But there is one place in Central Florida where a group of people are being tested and getting results within a day: the NBA. Basketball players, team staff, news media and anyone else inside the 'bubble' at the practice compound at Walt Disney World are tested daily \u2014 and get their results within 15-18 hours on average. This rankles some in Central Florida, who wonder why local, state and federal leaders can't coordinate large-scale, organized testing, but the NBA can.' \u2022 'Tis a puzzlement! 'The Paradox of Medical Costs During the Pandemic' [EconoFact[41]]. 'As COVID-19 began to rapidly spread in the United States, many experts suggested that medical costs would rise substantially[42] due to the pandemic. They projected high costs from long and expensive hospitalizations for those seriously affected by the virus, especially in hot-spots throughout the country. Paradoxically, however, medical costs seem to have gone down substantially \u2014 at least in the short term. This is because non-COVID expenditures have dropped sharply. Patients have not obtained non-emergency care, ranging from screening and immunization to chronic care visits and surgery. Some of this care will be delivered later, but some will never be made up. Even as communities decrease pandemic-related restrictions, patients may remain reluctant to obtain non-urgent medical care. Such a drop in medical expenditures is extremely rare: total U.S. health expenditures per capita have increased every year since at least 1970[43], including during the recession of 2008-9.' \u2022 So much for hospital capital expenditures. 'Child vaccinations plummet during COVID-19 pandemic, worrying Michigan health officials' [Free Press[44]]. 'Fewer Michigan children got vaccinations while the state was in throes of coronavirus-related shutdowns, leaving health officials worried about the spread of preventable diseases like measles, whooping cough and influenza. Vaccinations have increased since they took a precipitous drop this spring, but numbers are still down significantly compared to 2018 and 2019, according to the state health department. In June 2020, dosages of vaccines administered through federal or state funding dropped 10% compared to an average combining June 2018 and June 2019, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. That's an improvement over May's 44% decrease and April's 64% decrease compared to the prior two years.' \u2022Yikes.

'Building An Inclusive Post-Pandemic American Workforce' [The American Conservative[61]]. 'll eyes are on the declining number of unemployed. The May and June jobs reports chronicle the reabsorption of 5.3 million who lost their jobs in the COVID-19 pandemic. Twelve million jobs to go to reach pre-pandemic employment. Yet prior to the pandemic, there were 18 million Americans missing from the economy. These persons were neither employed nor seeking employment\u2014nor retirees, students or in-home caregivers\u2014and therefore were excluded from the Bureau of Labor Statistics count of the workforce. In order that America emerge from the pandemic stronger than before, a concerted initiative by federal and state governments to move them back into the economy\u2014using existing resources\u2014must begin now. These are people struggling with disabilities such as physical handicaps and mental illness; substance abuse disorders; health complaints; criminal histories; and vocational deficits. They are, however, human beings endowed with unique and significant potential; they deserve our attention for several reasons. Research on the social determinants of health finds that employment has a very strong correlation[62] with positive health outcomes. To exist as a non-participant in the economy is thus an invitation to dire health outcomes including premature death.' \u2022 'Social determinants of health' in TAC.

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

The data is the Johns Hopkins CSSE data. Here is the site . Back to our top five problem states: Florida, California, Texas, Georgia, and Arizona, with New York for comparison:       Not quite ready to call that peak for the five problem states. Those curves are all starting to look like a plateau.    \u201cCoronavirus hotspots ease, but officials warn normal is a long way off\u201d [ The Hill ]. \u201cIn interviews with state health officials this week, most said they remain concerned that the drop in new cases may be a plateau at an unacceptably high level of transmission, rather than a sustained decline\u2026. In many places, evidence suggests the most vulnerable populations \u2014 older people and those with underlying conditions \u2014 are doing a far better job protecting themselves than are younger, healthy people\u2026. Many states have closed bars or limited alcohol service after dark to discourage social gatherings, after several bars and parties became epicenters of major clusters. The vast majority of transmission, however, is still happening in communities, and especially in households where one family member might get several others sick.\u201d    This chart includes new cases and positivity. Positivity is concerning. In terms of undercounting as measured by positivity (higher is bad), the order from worst to best would be AZ, FL, GA, TX, CA, at 7.46%, is still too high by WHO standards (they want 5%). So all the states are making progress in testing, especially Arizona (20.2%) but all have a way to go.    LA: \u201cLA Mayor Urges \u2018Extreme Caution\u2019 (Men Especially) To Fight COVID-19 Spread\u201d [ LAist (anon in so cal)]. \u201cGarcetti said L.A. County\u2019s transmission rate is down to 0.92, which is slightly less than last week when it was 0.94. \u201cThis represents that what you\u2019re doing is having an impact,\u201d he said. sHe did acknolwedge the highest death count since the start of the pandemic happened within the last 24 hours \u2014 91 deaths in the county \u2014 but attributed that to a reporting backlog. Of those deaths, 30 were in the city of L.A. The mayor also pointed out an interesting data point \u2014 men in L.A. County are much more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (2/3 of confirmed cases are men and 1/3 are women).\u201d \u2022 That last figure is odd.    Politics    \u201cBut what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?\u201d \u2013James Madison, Federalist 51    \u201cThey had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.\u201d \u2013Frank Herbert, Dune    \u201cThey had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.\u201d \u2013Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord    The electoral map. July 17: Georgia, Ohio, ME-2 move from Leans Republican to Toss-up. Continued yikes. On July 7, the tossup were 86. Only July 17, they were 56. Now they are 91. This puts Biden at 278, i.e. over 270. July 28: Still no changes.    So, taking the consensus as a given, 270 (total) \u2013 204 (Trump\u2019s) = 66. Trump must win 66 from the states in play: AZ (11), FL (29), MI (16), NC (15), PA (20), and WI (10) plus 1 to win not tie = 102. 102 \u2013 66 = 36. So if Trump wins FL, MI, NC, and PA (29 + 16 + 15 + 20 = 80), he wins. That\u2019s a heavy lift. I think I\u2019ve got the math right this time!    2020     Biden (D)(1): \u201cBiden, Bernie forces clash during convention meeting: [ Politico ]. \u201cA Democratic Party meeting that leaders hoped would project unity weeks ahead of the national convention instead broke out into a behind-the-scenes feud over corporate money in politics\u2026.. The spat began when Brent Welder, a Sanders appointee on the convention\u2019s rules committee, proposed a resolution to change the party charter to refuse all corporate PAC dollars and limit corporate lobbyists from serving on the DNC for several years. A Biden appointee called for it to be tabled, which some Sanders appointees said caught them off guard. \u2018Tabling until when?\u2019 asked Welder. \u2018Generally, until someone makes a successful motion to take it off the table,\u201d replied former Rep. Barney Frank, the co-chair of the meeting. \u2018After the committee expires, if no one has moved to take it off the table successfully, then it dies with the committee.\u2019 \u2018Wow, that doesn\u2019t make any sense at all,\u2019 said Welder. Jillian Johnson, a Sanders appointee on the committee, said other Sanders supporters urged that the proposal be brought to a vote in the closed-door breakout room by changing the background images on their screens to reflect their support. She said some Biden appointees chastised progressives over it. \u2018You\u2019re acting like children,\u2019 someone said, and, \u2018You were going to lose anyway, so get over it,\u201d she said. \u2018And then the host just closed the meeting so we couldn\u2019t see each other anymore.'\u201d \u2022 Frank is right on the procedure, and right on the merits, if you want Big Donors to run the Democrat Party (and eliminate self-dealing by DNC members who are also campaign strategists). But holy moley, Sanders people, buy a copy of Robert\u2019s Rules!    Trump (R)(1): \u201cTrump\u2019s Unfitness For Office\u201d [Rod Dreher, The American Conservative ]. \u201cTrump had a phenomenal opportunity, and though he certainly faced hostile and clever enemies (as all presidents do), he blew that opportunity by governing badly. If he were only a tiny bit of the hard man his enemies think he is, wokeness would not be saturating US Attorneys offices in the Department of Justice\u2026. It\u2019s so depressing. I have never been as concerned as I am now about Democratic Party rule, because they\u2019ve never been so radical. But I also haven\u2019t lost so much confidence in a Republican presidency since the end of the George W. Bush administration. Please spare me the shopworn \u2018at least he fights\u2019 excuse. If he fights, then he fights like a barroom drunk swinging wildly and ineffectively. As MBD points out, he hasn\u2019t accomplished much. Trump performs the role of a fighting president. His presidency is like professional wrestling: it only looks like combat.\u201d \u2022 Dreher certainly has an odd concept of \u201cradical.\u201d Worth a read for the bill of particulars.    UPDATE Trump (R)(2): \u201cTrump campaign temporarily halts ad spending for review of messaging strategy\u201d [ CNN ]. \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has canceled a series of advertisement buys over the next few days as they review their messaging strategy, a senior campaign official told CNN. The decision comes after the campaign demoted former campaign manager Brad Parscale and elevated current campaign manager Bill Stepien. The move to promote Stepien and demote Parscale took place on July 15, a little more than two weeks ago.    \u201cWith the leadership change in the campaign, there\u2019s understandably a review and fine-tuning of the campaign\u2019s strategy. We\u2019ll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing,\u201d a senior campaign official told CNN.\u201d \u2022 \u201cExposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing\u201d makes by brain hurt.

Meme 2020 made its first foray into politics earlier this year with a push backing Michael Bloomberg\u2019s presidential campaign, but its latest project, which launched this week, is instead focusing on a broader voter mobilization effort. \u2018Meme 2020 is laser focussed on building out this new medium that has been largely undeveloped in political advertising,\u2019 said Ryan Patrick Kelley, chief of staff of Meme 2020.\u201d \u2022 Except for the Trump campaign\u2026   * * *   UPDATE \u201cWithout Medicare for All, This Isn\u2019t \u2018the Boldest Democratic Platform in American History'\u201d [ The Nation ]. \u201che Democratic National Committee\u2019s platform committee approved a draft of the party\u2019s 2020 agenda this week and committee cochair Denis McDonough promptly described it as the \u2018boldest Democratic platform in American history.\u2019 It\u2019s not\u2014unless your definition of \u2018bold\u2019 includes a tepid health care stance that rejects the single-payer Medicare for All agenda that enjoys overwhelming support from Americans in this Covid-19 moment. The proposed platform also pulls its punches on a host of other issues, from marijuana legalization, an end to qualified immunity for police officers, the placing of conditions on aid to Israel , a federal jobs guarantee, and a comprehensive approach to developing and implementing a Green New Deal\u2026. Sanders delegates from Nevada have called on convention delegates to sign a petition that concludes with a \u2018pledge to vote against any platform that does not include a plank supporting universal, single-payer Medicare for All.\u2019 Progressive Democrats of America , RootsAction.org , and other groups are circulating the petition and, according to Jeff Cohen of RootsAction, it had been signed by 700 delegates as of Tuesday afternoon.\u201d \u2022 Good.

UPDATE \u201cDemocrats\u2019 Anxieties Aren\u2019t About the Polls\u201d [Charles Cook, Cook Political Report ]. \u201cSo other than still suffering from PTSD following Election Night 2016, why are top Democratic strategists so worried? Well, they\u2019re fretting over whether polling places will be open, whether a shortage of polling workers due to the pandemic\u2014particularly in large urban areas\u2014could depress their vote. They worry about postal-sorting facilities being closed down due to the coronavirus, which would make it hard to get ballots out to people and back in time to be counted (some states require ballots to be postmarked by a certain date, or received by a certain time). They worry about vote counters being overwhelmed in states where there is little history of mail-in voting. Then they worry about voter-suppression efforts by some Republican state and local election figures. I recently had a conversation with one very senior Democratic strategist. Probably 90 percent of the conversation was about all of the things that worried him, and virtually all of it had to do with the administration of this election and all of the things that could go wrong. Simply put, whether legitimately or out of paranoia, they are less worried about President Trump winning this election than about other factors allowing it to slip out of their hands. When I first heard some of this talk several months ago, I tended to discount it, but whether any of these fears manifest themselves in any meaningful way or not, it is what keeps Democrats awake at night.\u201d \u2022 Imagine the timeline if Democrats had supported hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public after the 2000 debacle. Now we have a system that\u2019s broken because both parties want the capacity to steal elections. They made their bed\u2026.    UPDATE House districts at the state level (UserFriendly).

Realignment and Legitimacy     \u201cA bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn\u2019t pretty\u201d [ Boston Globe ]. \u201cOn the second Friday in June, a group of political operatives, former government and military officials, and academics quietly convened online for what became a disturbing exercise in the fragility of American democracy. The group, which included Democrats and Republicans, gathered to game out possible results of the November election, grappling with questions that seem less far-fetched by the day: What if President Trump refuses to concede a loss, as he publicly hinted recently he might do? How far could he go to preserve his power? And what if Democrats refuse to give in? \u2018All of our scenarios ended in both street-level violence and political impasse,\u201d said Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown law professor and former Defense Department official who co-organized the group known as the Transition Integrity Project. She described what they found in bleak terms: \u201cThe law is essentially \u2026 it\u2019s almost helpless against a president who\u2019s willing to ignore it.\u2019 \u2026 Using a role-playing game that is a fixture of military and national security planning, the group envisioned a dark 11 weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day, one in which Trump and his Republican allies used every apparatus of government \u2014 the Postal Service, state lawmakers, the Justice Department, federal agents, and the military \u2014 to hold onto power, and Democrats took to the courts and the streets to try to stop it.\u201d \u2022 As if Democrats ever conceded their loss in 2016! (On Rosa Brooks : \u201c[Rosa Brooks of New America and Tom Wright of the Brookings Institution, both.. rejected the very idea of ending America\u2019s existing wars. They argued that the U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria are really \u2018counter-terrorism operations\u2019 rather than \u2018wars.\u2019 Brooks even uttered the word identifying her as a member of the national security elite in good standing by calling for a \u2018robust\u2019 policy.) The other way of reading this article, which doesn\u2019t include quite so much good faith from the Rosa Brook\u2019s of this world, is that the national security establishment will be heavily involved in picking 2016\u2019s winner (unless there\u2019s a landslide, of course). It has also occurred to me that the protests (as opposed to the riots) are a splendid training ground for Women\u2019s March and Indivisible types to \u201ctake to the streets.\u201d Rather like 2000\u2019s bourgeois riot in 2000, but at scale.

Writings discovered in an imperial Han tomb confirm that peony root (called \u201cdanpi\u201d) was used to treat blood stasis nearly 2,000 years ago in China. In traditional Chinese medicine, the common Chinese garden peony (Paeonia lactiflora) was used to treat high blood pressure, inflammation, and gynecological ailments, including hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles. In the ancient Greco-Roman world, peony, often in combination with mistletoe, was prescribed not only to induce menstrual flow but also to treat seizures and epilepsy. The Roman physician Galen recommended peony root tied around the necks of children as an effective remedy for \u201cthe falling sickness,\u201d a common premodern phrase for epilepsy. Throughout the Middle Ages, peony continued to be used for seizures and epilepsy, either worn around the neck as a talisman or prescribed by physicians. This prescription persisted into sixteenth-century Europe.\u201d    \u201cWhy Are Plants Green? To Reduce the Noise in Photosynthesis\u201d [ Quanta ]. \u201cFrom large trees in the Amazon jungle to houseplants to seaweed in the ocean, green is the color that reigns over the plant kingdom. Why green, and not blue or magenta or gray? The simple answer is that although plants absorb almost all the photons in the red and blue regions of the light spectrum, they absorb only about 90% of the green photons. If they absorbed more, they would look black to our eyes. Plants are green because the small amount of light they reflect is that color. But that seems unsatisfyingly wasteful because most of the energy that the sun radiates is in the green part of the spectrum. When pressed to explain further, biologists have sometimes suggested that the green light might be too powerful for plants to use without harm, but the reason why hasn\u2019t been clear. Even after decades of molecular research on the light-harvesting machinery in plants, scientists could not establish a detailed rationale for plants\u2019 color. Recently, however, in the pages of Science, scientists finally provided a more complete answer. They built a model to explain why the photosynthetic machinery of plants wastes green light. What they did not expect was that their model would also explain the colors of other photosynthetic forms of life too. Their findings point to an evolutionary principle governing light-harvesting organisms that might apply throughout the universe. They also offer a lesson that \u2014 at least sometimes \u2014 evolution cares less about making biological systems efficient than about keeping them stable \u2026 It might be highly efficient to specialize in collecting just the peak energy in green light, but that would be detrimental for plants because, when the sunlight flickered, the noise from the input signal would fluctuate too wildly for the complex to regulate the energy flow.\u201d \u2022 Plants are so smart. I don\u2019t like flickering sunlight either.    Health Care    \u201cScared That Covid-19 Immunity Won\u2019t Last? Don\u2019t Be\u201d [ New York Times ]. \u201ca finding that naturally occurring antibodies in some Covid-19 patients are fading doesn\u2019t actually mean very much for the likely efficacy of vaccines under development. Science, in this case, can be more effective than nature. The human immune system has evolved to serve two functions: expediency and precision. Hence, we have two types of immunity : innate immunity, which jumps into action within hours, sometimes just minutes, of an infection; and adaptive immunity, which develops over days and weeks\u2026. That antibodies decrease once an infection recedes isn\u2019t a sign that they are failing: It\u2019s a normal step in the usual course of an immune response. Nor does a waning antibody count mean waning immunity: The memory B cells that first produced those antibodies are still around, and standing ready to churn out new batches of antibodies on demand.\u201d \u2022 So, even if the bloodstream isn\u2019t full of antibodies, the body retains the recipes for them. That is extremely cool.    \u201cVirus testing turnaround times reveal wide disparity\u201d [ Associated Press ]. \u201cAs coronavirus cases surge in hard-hit Florida, so do the turnaround times for test results. The reasons are many: Often it has to do with lab staffing, backlog, or equipment shortages. Some tests are done in house, while others are sent to overloaded labs out of state. Health experts say test results that come back after two or three days are nearly worthless, because by then the window for tracing the person\u2019s contacts to prevent additional infections has essentially closed. But there is one place in Central Florida where a group of people are being tested and getting results within a day: the NBA. Basketball players, team staff, news media and anyone else inside the \u201cbubble\u201d at the practice compound at Walt Disney World are tested daily \u2014 and get their results within 15-18 hours on average. This rankles some in Central Florida, who wonder why local, state and federal leaders can\u2019t coordinate large-scale, organized testing, but the NBA can.\u201d \u2022 \u2018Tis a puzzlement!    \u201cThe Paradox of Medical Costs During the Pandemic\u201d [ EconoFact ]. \u201cAs COVID-19 began to rapidly spread in the United States, many experts suggested that medical costs would rise substantially due to the pandemic. They projected high costs from long and expensive hospitalizations for those seriously affected by the virus, especially in hot-spots throughout the country. Paradoxically, however, medical costs seem to have gone down substantially \u2014 at least in the short term. This is because non-COVID expenditures have dropped sharply. Patients have not obtained non-emergency care, ranging from screening and immunization to chronic care visits and surgery. Some of this care will be delivered later, but some will never be made up. Even as communities decrease pandemic-related restrictions, patients may remain reluctant to obtain non-urgent medical care. Such a drop in medical expenditures is extremely rare: total U.S. health expenditures per capita have increased every year since at least 1970 , including during the recession of 2008-9.\u201d \u2022 So much for hospital capital expenditures.    \u201cChild vaccinations plummet during COVID-19 pandemic, worrying Michigan health officials\u201d [ Free Press ]. \u201cFewer Michigan children got vaccinations while the state was in throes of coronavirus-related shutdowns, leaving health officials worried about the spread of preventable diseases like measles, whooping cough and influenza. Vaccinations have increased since they took a precipitous drop this spring, but numbers are still down significantly compared to 2018 and 2019, according to the state health department. In June 2020, dosages of vaccines administered through federal or state funding dropped 10% compared to an average combining June 2018 and June 2019, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. That\u2019s an improvement over May\u2019s 44% decrease and April\u2019s 64% decrease compared to the prior two years.\u201d \u2022 Yikes.

The May and June jobs reports chronicle the reabsorption of 5.3 million who lost their jobs in the COVID-19 pandemic. Twelve million jobs to go to reach pre-pandemic employment. Yet prior to the pandemic, there were 18 million Americans missing from the economy. These persons were neither employed nor seeking employment\u2014nor retirees, students or in-home caregivers\u2014and therefore were excluded from the Bureau of Labor Statistics count of the workforce.

They are, however, human beings endowed with unique and significant potential; they deserve our attention for several reasons.

I\u2019ve been saying masks should be fashion items since I first posted on them. So even though I don\u2019t have a team, this sounds like a very good idea!   * * *   Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, with (a) links, and even better (b) sources I should curate regularly, (c) how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal, and (d) to find out how to send me images of plants. Vegetables are fine! Fungi and coral are deemed to be honorary plants! If you want your handle to appear as a credit, please place it at the start of your mail in parentheses: (thus). Otherwise, I will anonymize by using your initials. See the previous Water Cooler (with plant) here . Today\u2019s plant (periol):       periol writes: \u201cStill barely getting settled, so I haven\u2019t really had a chance to take photos of the plants in place before we moved in, but here is a photo of some baby grapes (not sure what variety) being fertilized by one of the many bees that lives on the property with us. The grape leaves are under attack from tiny insects, but there are nearly ripe bunches of fruit elsewhere on the vine.\u201d   * * *   Readers : Water Cooler is a standalone entity not covered by the annual NC fundraiser. So if you see a link you especially like, or an item you wouldn\u2019t see anywhere else, please do not hesitate to express your appreciation in tangible form. Remember, a tip jar is for tipping! Regular positive feedback both makes me feel good and lets me know I\u2019m on the right track with coverage . When I get no donations for five or ten days I get worried. More tangibly, a constant trickle of donations helps me with expenses, and I factor in that trickle when setting fundraising goals:    Here is the screen that will appear, which I have helpfully annotated.       If you hate PayPal, you can email me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, and I will give you directions on how to send a check. Thank you!    This entry was posted in Water Cooler on July 31, 2020 by Lambert Strether .   About Lambert Strether   Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (\u201cBecause markets\u201d). I don\u2019t much care about the \u201cism\u201d that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don\u2019t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess \u201cdeaths from despair,\u201d as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton\u2019s wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let\u2019s call such voices \u201cthe left.\u201d Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn\u2019t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I\u2019ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The data is the Johns Hopkins CSSE data. Here is the site . Back to our top five problem states: Florida, California, Texas, Georgia, and Arizona, with New York for comparison:       Not quite ready to call that peak for the five problem states. Those curves are all starting to look like a plateau.    \u201cCoronavirus hotspots ease, but officials warn normal is a long way off\u201d [ The Hill ]. \u201cIn interviews with state health officials this week, most said they remain concerned that the drop in new cases may be a plateau at an unacceptably high level of transmission, rather than a sustained decline\u2026. In many places, evidence suggests the most vulnerable populations \u2014 older people and those with underlying conditions \u2014 are doing a far better job protecting themselves than are younger, healthy people\u2026. Many states have closed bars or limited alcohol service after dark to discourage social gatherings, after several bars and parties became epicenters of major clusters. The vast majority of transmission, however, is still happening in communities, and especially in households where one family member might get several others sick.\u201d    This chart includes new cases and positivity. Positivity is concerning. In terms of undercounting as measured by positivity (higher is bad), the order from worst to best would be AZ, FL, GA, TX, CA, at 7.46%, is still too high by WHO standards (they want 5%). So all the states are making progress in testing, especially Arizona (20.2%) but all have a way to go.    LA: \u201cLA Mayor Urges \u2018Extreme Caution\u2019 (Men Especially) To Fight COVID-19 Spread\u201d [ LAist (anon in so cal)]. \u201cGarcetti said L.A. County\u2019s transmission rate is down to 0.92, which is slightly less than last week when it was 0.94. \u201cThis represents that what you\u2019re doing is having an impact,\u201d he said. sHe did acknolwedge the highest death count since the start of the pandemic happened within the last 24 hours \u2014 91 deaths in the county \u2014 but attributed that to a reporting backlog. Of those deaths, 30 were in the city of L.A. The mayor also pointed out an interesting data point \u2014 men in L.A. County are much more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (2/3 of confirmed cases are men and 1/3 are women).\u201d \u2022 That last figure is odd.    Politics    \u201cBut what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?\u201d \u2013James Madison, Federalist 51    \u201cThey had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.\u201d \u2013Frank Herbert, Dune    \u201cThey had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.\u201d \u2013Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord    The electoral map. July 17: Georgia, Ohio, ME-2 move from Leans Republican to Toss-up. Continued yikes. On July 7, the tossup were 86. Only July 17, they were 56. Now they are 91. This puts Biden at 278, i.e. over 270. July 28: Still no changes.    So, taking the consensus as a given, 270 (total) \u2013 204 (Trump\u2019s) = 66. Trump must win 66 from the states in play: AZ (11), FL (29), MI (16), NC (15), PA (20), and WI (10) plus 1 to win not tie = 102. 102 \u2013 66 = 36. So if Trump wins FL, MI, NC, and PA (29 + 16 + 15 + 20 = 80), he wins. That\u2019s a heavy lift. I think I\u2019ve got the math right this time!    2020     Biden (D)(1): \u201cBiden, Bernie forces clash during convention meeting: [ Politico ]. \u201cA Democratic Party meeting that leaders hoped would project unity weeks ahead of the national convention instead broke out into a behind-the-scenes feud over corporate money in politics\u2026.. The spat began when Brent Welder, a Sanders appointee on the convention\u2019s rules committee, proposed a resolution to change the party charter to refuse all corporate PAC dollars and limit corporate lobbyists from serving on the DNC for several years. A Biden appointee called for it to be tabled, which some Sanders appointees said caught them off guard. \u2018Tabling until when?\u2019 asked Welder. \u2018Generally, until someone makes a successful motion to take it off the table,\u201d replied former Rep. Barney Frank, the co-chair of the meeting. \u2018After the committee expires, if no one has moved to take it off the table successfully, then it dies with the committee.\u2019 \u2018Wow, that doesn\u2019t make any sense at all,\u2019 said Welder. Jillian Johnson, a Sanders appointee on the committee, said other Sanders supporters urged that the proposal be brought to a vote in the closed-door breakout room by changing the background images on their screens to reflect their support. She said some Biden appointees chastised progressives over it. \u2018You\u2019re acting like children,\u2019 someone said, and, \u2018You were going to lose anyway, so get over it,\u201d she said. \u2018And then the host just closed the meeting so we couldn\u2019t see each other anymore.'\u201d \u2022 Frank is right on the procedure, and right on the merits, if you want Big Donors to run the Democrat Party (and eliminate self-dealing by DNC members who are also campaign strategists). But holy moley, Sanders people, buy a copy of Robert\u2019s Rules!    Trump (R)(1): \u201cTrump\u2019s Unfitness For Office\u201d [Rod Dreher, The American Conservative ]. \u201cTrump had a phenomenal opportunity, and though he certainly faced hostile and clever enemies (as all presidents do), he blew that opportunity by governing badly. If he were only a tiny bit of the hard man his enemies think he is, wokeness would not be saturating US Attorneys offices in the Department of Justice\u2026. It\u2019s so depressing. I have never been as concerned as I am now about Democratic Party rule, because they\u2019ve never been so radical. But I also haven\u2019t lost so much confidence in a Republican presidency since the end of the George W. Bush administration. Please spare me the shopworn \u2018at least he fights\u2019 excuse. If he fights, then he fights like a barroom drunk swinging wildly and ineffectively. As MBD points out, he hasn\u2019t accomplished much. Trump performs the role of a fighting president. His presidency is like professional wrestling: it only looks like combat.\u201d \u2022 Dreher certainly has an odd concept of \u201cradical.\u201d Worth a read for the bill of particulars.     Health Care     About that \u201cempathy\u201d thing:      I did get the satisfaction of seeing the so many angry people go after Neera, that she hit the mute button for her first time on twitter. (not agreeing with their language but I am not their sensor, and I definitely understand their anger and outrage) pic.twitter.com/m4Uor7rVDA    \u2014 Scott Desnoyers (@scottdesno) July 29, 2020      Realignment and Legitimacy     \u201cA bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn\u2019t pretty\u201d [ Boston Globe ]. \u201cOn the second Friday in June, a group of political operatives, former government and military officials, and academics quietly convened online for what became a disturbing exercise in the fragility of American democracy. The group, which included Democrats and Republicans, gathered to game out possible results of the November election, grappling with questions that seem less far-fetched by the day: What if President Trump refuses to concede a loss, as he publicly hinted recently he might do? How far could he go to preserve his power? And what if Democrats refuse to give in? \u2018All of our scenarios ended in both street-level violence and political impasse,\u201d said Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown law professor and former Defense Department official who co-organized the group known as the Transition Integrity Project. She described what they found in bleak terms: \u201cThe law is essentially \u2026 it\u2019s almost helpless against a president who\u2019s willing to ignore it.\u2019 \u2026 Using a role-playing game that is a fixture of military and national security planning, the group envisioned a dark 11 weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day, one in which Trump and his Republican allies used every apparatus of government \u2014 the Postal Service, state lawmakers, the Justice Department, federal agents, and the military \u2014 to hold onto power, and Democrats took to the courts and the streets to try to stop it.\u201d \u2022 As if Democrats ever conceded their loss in 2016! (On Rosa Brooks : \u201c[Rosa Brooks of New America and Tom Wright of the Brookings Institution, both.. rejected the very idea of ending America\u2019s existing wars. They argued that the U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria are really \u2018counter-terrorism operations\u2019 rather than \u2018wars.\u2019 Brooks even uttered the word identifying her as a member of the national security elite in good standing by calling for a \u2018robust\u2019 policy.) The other way of reading this article, which doesn\u2019t include quite so much good faith from the Rosa Brook\u2019s of this world, is that the national security establishment will be heavily involved in picking 2016\u2019s winner (unless there\u2019s a landslide, of course). It has also occurred to me that the protests (as opposed to the riots) are a splendid training ground for Women\u2019s March and Indivisible types to \u201ctake to the streets.\u201d Rather like 2000\u2019s bourgeois riot in 2000, but at scale.     Stats Watch    At reader request, I added some business stats back in. Please give Econintersect click-throughs; they\u2019re a good, old-school blog that covers more than stats. If anybody knows of other aggregators, please contact me at the email address below.   * * *   Real Estate: \u201cThe looming peak season is prompting a rush on warehousing. Retailers are already moving to find more space for goods\u2026. as they overhaul distribution networks before an expected crush of online orders this fall\u201d [ Wall Street Journal ]. \u201cOn-demand warehousing provider Flexe Inc. says demand for temporary warehouse space \u2018is way up\u2019 heading into a holiday season that\u2019s wrapped in uncertainty because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many retailers are betting that the big e-commerce surge of under coronavirus lockdowns will continue, however, and are shifting inventory to set up speedier delivery of online purchases.\u201d \u2022 I dunno. If people can\u2019t gather round the Christmas tree, what happens to retail?    Shipping: \u201cThe new chief executive of United Parcel Service is being cautious on capacity while taking an aggressive stance on pricing. CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 told an earnings conference call that the package giant has the capabilities in place to handle projected peak-season volumes\u2026 and even turned down an offer from Boeing for three 747 freighters\u201d [ Wall Street Journal ]. \u201cMs. Tom\u00e9 says UPS will focus instead on becoming \u2018better, not bigger.\u2019 That means focusing on improving margins in a tumultuous market that has seen huge volumes of packages flood its delivery network, significantly raising costs. Residential deliveries soared 65% last quarter but profit margins narrowed sharply, a sign of how UPS and its retail customers are still adjusting to the consumer pivot.\u201d \u2022 Ouch, Boeing. And UPS is becoming \u201cbetter not bigger\u201d at the same time we\u2019re crippling the Post Office? How does that work?    Tech: \u201cWinning Irish Stock Lets You See Who Sleeps Through Your Call\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. \u201d Rather than traveling to a single location or dialing into a call, participants strap on a headset or access an app to be virtually placed in the same room. VRE\u2019s Engage platform allows non-verbal communications via its avatars, which mirror participants\u2019 movements, from shaking hands to drawing on a white-board, and body language. It\u2019s also trickier to simply tune out by switching off the camera during a video call. \u2018There\u2019s a reason why people go to classrooms, because you see who\u2019s paying attention, you can really interact with people, you can get that eye-contact,\u2019 Chief Executive Officer David Whelan said in an interview earlier this month. Using its technology, \u2018if one of the students falls asleep, you\u2019ll see their avatar will fall asleep, they\u2019ll slouch over the desk.'\u201d \u2022 Unless the avatars are hacked, of course. For which there would obviously be a market.    Supply Chain: \u201cPharmaceutical companies are already moving to build the supply chains that would be needed to rapidly get a coronavirus vaccine to billions of people around the world. The enormous behind-the-scenes effort includes lining up the raw materials, factory capacity and special handling equipment needed to make and ship vaccines\u2026 and it comes even as the potential drugs themselves remain under research and development\u201d [ Wall Street Journal ]. \u201cThe magnitude and speed of the effort creates room for lapses that could cost invaluable doses of a product that the world hopes can push back a virus that has killed over 661,000, including more than 150,000 in the U.S. Pharmaceutical companies say the scale of the effort is unparalleled in recent memory, far surpassing the annual distribution of flu vaccines. Some operators raise questions over transport capacity, but companies and governments are trying to get the capabilities set up.\u201d    Mr. Market: \u201cBig Tech Earnings Surge During Pandemic While Economy Slumps\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. \u201cThe largest U.S. technology companies are thriving in a pandemic that has increased dependence on their products and services, while hammering much of the rest of the economy. Quarterly results from Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. on Thursday show the industry is capitalizing on the crisis as locked-down consumers use tech gadgets and the internet for entertainment, social connection, shopping, learning and work. Together, the four companies reported revenue of $206 billion and net income of $29 billion in the three months ending in late June. \u2018Right now, it\u2019s big tech\u2019s world and everyone else is paying rent ,\u2019 said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. \u2018They are consumer staples now and this crisis has bought their growth forward by about two years.'\u201d   * * *   Today\u2019s Fear &amp; Greed Index: 63 Greed (previous close: 62 Greed) [ CNN ].

The Biosphere    \u201cMorning glories and mustard: U.S. investigates unsolicited seed mystery\u201d [ Reuters ]. \u201cThe U.S. Agriculture Department has identified more than a dozen plant species ranging from morning glories to mustard in bags of unsolicited seeds arriving in the mailboxes of thousands of Americans, mostly postmarked from China\u2026. The packages have also been reported in Canada, where Ontario\u2019s Central Region Provincial Police posted a warning on Facebook Wednesday against \u2018foreign seeds in the mail from China or Taiwan.'\u201d \u2022 Have any NC readers gotten any of these seeds?    \u201cPlant of the Month: Peony\u201d [ JSTOR ]. \u201cWhile today we think of peonies as beautiful ornamental flowers, for much of their history they were viewed as an important medicinal plant. Writings discovered in an imperial Han tomb confirm that peony root (called \u201cdanpi\u201d) was used to treat blood stasis nearly 2,000 years ago in China. In traditional Chinese medicine, the common Chinese garden peony (Paeonia lactiflora) was used to treat high blood pressure, inflammation, and gynecological ailments, including hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles. In the ancient Greco-Roman world, peony, often in combination with mistletoe, was prescribed not only to induce menstrual flow but also to treat seizures and epilepsy. The Roman physician Galen recommended peony root tied around the necks of children as an effective remedy for \u201cthe falling sickness,\u201d a common premodern phrase for epilepsy. Throughout the Middle Ages, peony continued to be used for seizures and epilepsy, either worn around the neck as a talisman or prescribed by physicians. This prescription persisted into sixteenth-century Europe.\u201d    \u201cWhy Are Plants Green? To Reduce the Noise in Photosynthesis\u201d [ Quanta ]. \u201cFrom large trees in the Amazon jungle to houseplants to seaweed in the ocean, green is the color that reigns over the plant kingdom. Why green, and not blue or magenta or gray? The simple answer is that although plants absorb almost all the photons in the red and blue regions of the light spectrum, they absorb only about 90% of the green photons. If they absorbed more, they would look black to our eyes. Plants are green because the small amount of light they reflect is that color. But that seems unsatisfyingly wasteful because most of the energy that the sun radiates is in the green part of the spectrum. When pressed to explain further, biologists have sometimes suggested that the green light might be too powerful for plants to use without harm, but the reason why hasn\u2019t been clear. Even after decades of molecular research on the light-harvesting machinery in plants, scientists could not establish a detailed rationale for plants\u2019 color. Recently, however, in the pages of Science, scientists finally provided a more complete answer. They built a model to explain why the photosynthetic machinery of plants wastes green light. What they did not expect was that their model would also explain the colors of other photosynthetic forms of life too. Their findings point to an evolutionary principle governing light-harvesting organisms that might apply throughout the universe. They also offer a lesson that \u2014 at least sometimes \u2014 evolution cares less about making biological systems efficient than about keeping them stable \u2026 It might be highly efficient to specialize in collecting just the peak energy in green light, but that would be detrimental for plants because, when the sunlight flickered, the noise from the input signal would fluctuate too wildly for the complex to regulate the energy flow.\u201d \u2022 Plants are so smart. I don\u2019t like flickering sunlight either.    Health Care    \u201cScared That Covid-19 Immunity Won\u2019t Last? Don\u2019t Be\u201d [ New York Times ]. \u201ca finding that naturally occurring antibodies in some Covid-19 patients are fading doesn\u2019t actually mean very much for the likely efficacy of vaccines under development. Science, in this case, can be more effective than nature. The human immune system has evolved to serve two functions: expediency and precision. Hence, we have two types of immunity : innate immunity, which jumps into action within hours, sometimes just minutes, of an infection; and adaptive immunity, which develops over days and weeks\u2026. That antibodies decrease once an infection recedes isn\u2019t a sign that they are failing: It\u2019s a normal step in the usual course of an immune response. Nor does a waning antibody count mean waning immunity: The memory B cells that first produced those antibodies are still around, and standing ready to churn out new batches of antibodies on demand.\u201d \u2022 So, even if the bloodstream isn\u2019t full of antibodies, the body retains the recipes for them. That is extremely cool.    \u201cVirus testing turnaround times reveal wide disparity\u201d [ Associated Press ]. \u201cAs coronavirus cases surge in hard-hit Florida, so do the turnaround times for test results. The reasons are many: Often it has to do with lab staffing, backlog, or equipment shortages. Some tests are done in house, while others are sent to overloaded labs out of state. Health experts say test results that come back after two or three days are nearly worthless, because by then the window for tracing the person\u2019s contacts to prevent additional infections has essentially closed. But there is one place in Central Florida where a group of people are being tested and getting results within a day: the NBA. Basketball players, team staff, news media and anyone else inside the \u201cbubble\u201d at the practice compound at Walt Disney World are tested daily \u2014 and get their results within 15-18 hours on average. This rankles some in Central Florida, who wonder why local, state and federal leaders can\u2019t coordinate large-scale, organized testing, but the NBA can.\u201d \u2022 \u2018Tis a puzzlement!    \u201cThe Paradox of Medical Costs During the Pandemic\u201d [ EconoFact ]. \u201cAs COVID-19 began to rapidly spread in the United States, many experts suggested that medical costs would rise substantially due to the pandemic. They projected high costs from long and expensive hospitalizations for those seriously affected by the virus, especially in hot-spots throughout the country. Paradoxically, however, medical costs seem to have gone down substantially \u2014 at least in the short term. This is because non-COVID expenditures have dropped sharply. Patients have not obtained non-emergency care, ranging from screening and immunization to chronic care visits and surgery. Some of this care will be delivered later, but some will never be made up. Even as communities decrease pandemic-related restrictions, patients may remain reluctant to obtain non-urgent medical care. Such a drop in medical expenditures is extremely rare: total U.S. health expenditures per capita have increased every year since at least 1970 , including during the recession of 2008-9.\u201d \u2022 So much for hospital capital expenditures.    \u201cChild vaccinations plummet during COVID-19 pandemic, worrying Michigan health officials\u201d [ Free Press ]. \u201cFewer Michigan children got vaccinations while the state was in throes of coronavirus-related shutdowns, leaving health officials worried about the spread of preventable diseases like measles, whooping cough and influenza. Vaccinations have increased since they took a precipitous drop this spring, but numbers are still down significantly compared to 2018 and 2019, according to the state health department. In June 2020, dosages of vaccines administered through federal or state funding dropped 10% compared to an average combining June 2018 and June 2019, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. That\u2019s an improvement over May\u2019s 44% decrease and April\u2019s 64% decrease compared to the prior two years.\u201d \u2022 Yikes.    Guillotine Watch    Not just imprison:      George R.R.

The May and June jobs reports chronicle the reabsorption of 5.3 million who lost their jobs in the COVID-19 pandemic. Twelve million jobs to go to reach pre-pandemic employment. Yet prior to the pandemic, there were 18 million Americans missing from the economy. These persons were neither employed nor seeking employment\u2014nor retirees, students or in-home caregivers\u2014and therefore were excluded from the Bureau of Labor Statistics count of the workforce. In order that America emerge from the pandemic stronger than before, a concerted initiative by federal and state governments to move them back into the economy\u2014using existing resources\u2014must begin now. These are people struggling with disabilities such as physical handicaps and mental illness; substance abuse disorders; health complaints; criminal histories; and vocational deficits. They are, however, human beings endowed with unique and significant potential; they deserve our attention for several reasons. Research on the social determinants of health finds that employment has a very strong correlation with positive health outcomes. To exist as a non-participant in the economy is thus an invitation to dire health outcomes including premature death.\u201d \u2022 \u201cSocial determinants of health\u201d in TAC.

I\u2019ve also been frustrated at how much individualism as a character trait in the US seems to have taken center stage with regard to masking, when there is tons of evidence that Americans are actually quite good at working together as a team and showing support for one another, for instance in the world of sports. Just one example: more than 700,000 people came out in the middle of winter to see the Seahawks Superbowl victory parade back in 2014; that year the city of Seattle clocked in with a population of 670,925. In any case, I started a kickstarter to raise funds for stickers in team colors that say \u201cMY MASK PROTECTS YOU/ YOUR MASK PROTECTS ME\u201d \u2013 the link is here , I\u2019d be thrilled if you shared it.

This entry was posted in Water Cooler on July 31, 2020 by Lambert Strether .   About Lambert Strether   Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (\u201cBecause markets\u201d). I don\u2019t much care about the \u201cism\u201d that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don\u2019t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess \u201cdeaths from despair,\u201d as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton\u2019s wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let\u2019s call such voices \u201cthe left.\u201d Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn\u2019t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I\u2019ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

'What to expect: Under the plan, China would impose tariffs - between 5 percent and 25 percent - on nearly all of the $130 billion in goods imported from the United States. China's Ministry of Finance said Friday the new tariffs would target more than 5,200 types of U.S. goods, including energy exports like biodiesel and liquefied natural gas and more U.S. agricultural goods like lamb and honey.' </p><p>\u2022 That 'country's dignity' at [a] language is dangerous; if we posit that the statement is the outcome of factional splits in the Chinese government, then 'dignity' is, as it were, the highest common denominator, not the lowest; like the 'blackmail' rhetoric, it's a bell that's hard to unring. It would have been perfectly possible to issue a tough statement using only points [b] 'free trade' and [c] 'common interests.' Of course, I'm not a China watcher, nothing near it, so reader corrections/expansions are welcome. I could, after all, just be projecting an interpretation into boilerplate. Politics 2018'How Trump's Trade Policies Could Impact Governors' Races' [Governing[3]]. 'So far, there are only scattered signs that Democratic candidates are using trade as a wedge issue, or that Republican candidates are aggressively distancing themselves from Trump to side with their constituents' economic interests. Trade offers a rare opportunity for Democrats to make a play for two categories of voters that have swung heavily toward Republicans in recent elections: rural Americans and blue-collar workers.' \u2022 Do they have college degrees? Turnout is everything, or was in the last Democrat wave in 2006: The last time there was a Democratic midterm wave was 2006. Luckily, we have voter files with vote history records from 2006. What do they say? - Patrick Ruffini (@PatrickRuffini) August 6, 2018[4]A wave which was, sadly, squandered (at least as far as voters were concerned) Senate: 'Senate Observations: Placing 2018 in the Context of Upper Chamber Elections Since 1913' [Sabato's Crystal Ball[5]]. 'In 2018, the Democratic caucus is defending 26 of the 36 seats (72%) that will contested this cycle, the most for any party in the post-World War II period. That figure includes the Alabama special election in 2017 as a seat for the GOP to defend, which it remarkably failed to do. Democrats are defending more seats than any non-presidential party in previous midterm elections. Of those seats, just over half (14) are in states that leaned toward the Democrats in the 2016 presidential election while 12 are in states that leaned toward the GOP in 2016, including 10 in states that Trump carried. While Republicans are favored to retain control of the chamber, and possibly gain seats in the process, Democrats do have a chance of winning a slim majority this November. To win 51 or 52 seats, Democrats would have to hold most or all of those 10 seats in Trump-won states while also adding one or two other seats in states the president carried \u2014 Arizona and Tennessee \u2014 while also winning the lone Clinton-won state the GOP is defending this cycle \u2014 Nevada.' \u2022 Stranger things have happened. As in 2016! TX Senate: 'O'Rourke Puts Race into Lean Republican Column' [Cook Political Report[6]]. 'Of the eight general election polls aggregated on RealClearPolitics, six showed Cruz at between 47 percent and 51 percent. In those same six polls, O'Rourke was between 39 percent and 43 percent. While O'Rourke has room to grow, Cruz is consistently closer to and in some cases at or above 50 percent. In a state as Republican as Texas, those last few points that O'Rourke needs to hit 50 percent are going to be very hard (and very expensive) to get. There are some observers who believe that there simply aren't enough Democratic and Democratic-leaning independents voters to push O'Rourke across the line. Suffice it to say that O'Rourke has made incredible progress in a pretty red state, at least when it comes to running for statewide office. The race moves to Lean Republican. Whether it ever gets to Toss Up remains to be seen.'New Cold War'Ex-FBI agent: Trump got elected, thanks to Russia' [Yahoo News[7]]. \u2022One thing to remember about RussiaRussiaRussia \u2014 R3? \u2014 is that it's very profitable to be a talking head.

'Living in the Age of the Big Lie' [Stephen Gold, Industry Week[14]]. Gold is President and Chief Executive Officer, Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation (MAPI):All this has created the potential for an American cultural crisis of distrust, authoritatively captured in two recently published analyses. In 'Truth Decay,' [cute! -lambert] the RAND Corporation lays the blame for the deteriorating role of facts and data in public life on four primary causes:1. The rise of social media 2. An overtaxed educational system that cannot keep up with changes in the 'information ecosystem' 3. Political and social polarization 4. And\u2014perhaps due to all of these factors\u2014the increasing tendency of individuals to create their own subjective social reality, otherwise known as 'cognitive bias.''The Death of Truth' by Pulitzer-Prize winning book critic Michiko Kakutani explores the waning of integrity in American society, particularly since the 2016 elections. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's observation that 'everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts,' is more timely than ever, Kakutani says: 'polarization has grown so extreme that voters have a hard time even agreeing on the same facts.' And no wonder: Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news through social media\u2014a platform that has been overwhelmed by trolls and bots, and which uses algorithms to decide what each of us gets to see. Executives ignore the cultural shift away from honesty at their peril.Social media has its own problems, gawd knows \u2014 break them up and outlaw the algos, and they'd be a lot more like the public utilities they should really be \u2014 but it's amazing how vague hand-wringing pieces like this ignore at least four seismic events since 2000, all of which involve perceived legitimacy and the nature of truth: (1) Bush v. Gore, (2) Iraq WMDs, (3) Obama's 'hope and change' campaign, followed by (4) the crash, the bailouts, the free passes for bankers, and a brutal recession. The official narrative and its maintainers didn't lose credibility because of trolls and bots, who might be regarded as opportunistic infections overwhelming an already weakened immnune system.

Employment: 'July Diffusion Indexes' [Calculated Risk[18]]. 'The BLS diffusion index for total private employment was at 64.0 in July, down from 67.4 in June. For manufacturing, the diffusion index was at 65.1, down from 67.8 in June. Note: Any reading above 60 is very good. Think of this as a measure of how widespread job gains are across industries. The further from 50 (above or below), the more widespread the job losses or gains reported by the BLS.' The lead: 'The U.S. experiment with dockless bike and scooter sharing is at a crossroads, with operators and cities struggling to find a balance between governments' need to regulate the services without stifling the companies' ability to make money.' \u2022Scratch out 'dockless bike and scooter sharing' and write in 'kidney sales' and you've got 'permissionless innovation' in a nutshell. Just because some squillionaires decided to toss their loose cash at some firm, does that imply that the firm should even exist? Why? Commodities: 'U.S. coal shipments reach lowest levels in years' [Kallanish Energy[19]]. 'The 661 million short tons (MMst) of coal consumed in the electric power sector in 2017 was the lowest amount of coal consumed in 35 years. Last year also was the fourth consecutive year U.S. coal consumption and coal shipments by all transport modes declined. The real delivered cost of coal has fallen nearly $8 per ton (16%) since 2008, with most of the reduction attributable to declining commodity costs. Over that same period, overall coal transportation costs have fallen by 4%, as declines in truck (down 9%) and river barge (down 39%) costs more than offset a 3% increase in rail shipping costs.' Commodities: 'Your Chicken's Salmonella Problem Is Worse Than You Think' [Mother Jones[20]]. 'As of June 30, 2018, according to the [US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service's (FSIS)] latest report, 35 percent of the nation's 154 large chicken-slaughter facilities\u2014which churn out the vast majority of the drumsticks, thighs, and breasts shrink-wrapped on supermarket meat counters\u2014failed to meet the inspection service's standard for chicken parts testing that took place over the previous 64 weeks.. If knowing that US supermarket chicken quite often carries salmonella isn't chilling enough, consider this: In a recent analysis of Food and Drug Administration data, the Environmental Working Group found that 'over the last five years of available data, on average, 1 in 5 strains of salmonella found on grocery store chicken were resistant to amoxicillin, a type of penicillin.' In short, it's getting harder for doctors to treat infections from this common pathogen.' \u2022 Sounds like the Tories are going to have to do some fancy footwork to import chicken from the US[21] after they're cut off from the EU Commodities: 'A heat wave sweeping across Europe and Asia is setting fire to global wheat prices. The hot temperatures are slashing forecasts for this year's harvest. and could provide some relief to North American farmers just as Chinese tariffs are sapping demand for soybeans and other crops. The price of Paris-traded milling wheat has jumped 33% this year, leading to more expensive animal feed in some regions and the likelihood of higher bread prices. The first decline in global wheat stockpiles since 2013 would come after years of over-supply and leave the U.S. positioned to increase its export share of the global market' [Wall Street Journal[22]]. 'So far, most agricultural analysts say this wheat-stunting summer is an aberration. But the prospect of global warming has led some observers to predict an eventual shakeup for farming in parts of the world.' \u2022 Not sure how you hedge the Jackpot, though no doubt the smart money is thinking hard about it. Shipping: 'Logistics Payrolls Surging Ahead of Fall Shipping Season' [Wall Street Journal[23]]. 'Overall wages rose 2.7% in July year-over-year, but the transportation and warehousing sector has seen wages grow only a 1.9%.' \u2022 And these clowns are still whinging that they can't find workers! (The headline is payrolls in the aggregate, not the same thing as your paycheck!) Supply Chain: 'One of most fiercely independent automotive manufacturers is proving no match for the rapid advance of technology in car-making supply chains. Honda Motor Co. is shopping among suppliers for the rapidly advancing systems that are part of new generations of automobiles, pointing to a radical culture change at the company' [Wall Street Journal[24]]. 'The shift is a sign of how new technologies from engines to autonomous driving systems are altering global manufacturing supply chains, pushing car companies toward suppliers tightly focused on developing sophisticated components. That is raising hackles among some at Honda who complain that the company's engineers are patching together others' technology rather than building it themselves. But car makers are under stress from the huge investments needed to develop new technologies, leaving them to lean on megasuppliers to keep down costs and keep up with the market.' \u2022 Like aircraft. The Bezzle: 'Dockless bike, scooter firms clash with U.S. cities over regulations' [WaPo[25]]. 'Dockless bike systems began to pop up in the United States a year ago, growing exponentially in part thanks to the millions of dollars that investors such as Uber and Google have put into companies such as Lime, Jump Bikes and Bird. The Bezzle: 'The Messy Business of Selling Meal Kits' [Wall Street Journal[26]]. 'Meal kits may make cooking easier, but getting a box of pre-portioned ingredients and instructions to a customer's door is one of the most complicated logistics riddles in the food business. Companies have poured millions of dollars into solving such questions as how to stack fish and fennel in boxes. They're also investing in systems to reroute shipments during snowstorms and algorithms to predict what customers want to eat during the summer months. Some meal kits are starting to stabilize financially. HelloFresh hopes to break even companywide by year's end, and Blue Apron is looking to do the same next year. Chicago-based Home Chef said it had two profitable quarters last year, and expects to have a full-year of profitability by the end of 2018.' The Bezzle: 'Maybe They Could Invent Houses' [Eschaton[27]]. \u2022 After having invented the bodega, the bus Tech: 'Boston-area startups are on pace to overtake NYC venture totals' [Tech Crunch[28]].

Venture investment in the Boston metro area hit $5.2 billion so far this year, on track to be the highest annual total in years [W}e'd be remiss not to give biotech the lion's share of the credit. So far this year, biotech and healthcare have led the New England dealmaking surge, accounting for the majority of invested capital. Once again, local investors are not surprised.' \u2022Elevator pitch: 'Genetic apps.' Tech: 'Facebook removes Infowars pages, following Apple and Spotify' [MarketWatch[29]]. 'Facebook suspended Alex Jones in July for violating its policies and said at the time that his pages were close to becoming 'unpublished.' The company said Monday that its latest actions weren't in response to fake-news concerns but that it continues to work with fact-checkers to examine the veracity of content posted to its platform.' \u2022 What could go wrong? The Fed: 'Trump v. Fed' [Money and Banking[30]]. 'Last month, interrupting decades of presidential self-restraint, President Trump openly criticized the Federal Reserve. Given the President's penchant for dismissing valuable institutions, it is hard to be surprised. Perhaps more surprising is the high quality of his appointments to the Board of Governors. Against that background, the limited financial market reaction to the President's comments suggests that investors are reasonably focused on the selection of qualified academics and individuals with valuable policy and business experience, rather than a few early-morning words of reproof. Nevertheless, the President's comments are seriously disturbing and\u2014were they to become routine\u2014risk undermining the significant benefits that Federal Reserve independence brings.'

Sarah Jeong (2): 'Shenzhen Tech Girl Naomi Wu: My experience with Sarah Jeong, Jason Koebler, and Vice Magazine' [Naomi Wu, Medium[36]]. \u2022 A complicated ad passionate post, but I do like the part where Jeong tweets that Chinese culture 'is not that far off from Korean culture.' Because, ya know, all Asian cultures are alike. That's what they're teaching at Harvard these days? The 420 'How a Pair of Kentucky Pols Are About to Legalize Hemp' [Politico[37]]. \u2022Stealing an issue from liberal Democrats Our Famously Free Press 'The Press Doesn't Cause Wars\u2014Presidents Do' [The Atlantic[38]] \u2022One of a ginormous steaming load of revisionist and defensive articles prompted by Trump's tweet that the press can 'causes War.' Anyone who was present for the build up to the Iraq War knows that Trump's claim is true; in fact, the 'media critique' that began then was prompted by the Iraq WMDs scam, in which the press \u2014 *** cough *** Judy Miller ***cough*** \u2014 was not merely compliant or complicitous, but active and vociferous, especially in shunning and shaming skeptics. Of course, everybody who was wrong about Iraq was wrong in the right way, so they all still have jobs (David Frum, Bush speechwriter and Hero of the Resistance, at the Atlantic, among hundreds of others). So revisionist history is very easy for them to write. Black Injustice Tipping Point 'Smith College president offers 'deepest apology' after police called on black student eating lunch' [Boston Globe[39]]. 'Smith College plans to bring in a third-party investigator to 'conduct a thorough review' after an employee this week called campus police on a black student who was eating her lunch in a common area at the Northampton school, officials say.' \u2022On the bright side, the black student didn't get whacked. Class Warfare 'The New Class-Blindness' [Law and Political Economy[40]]. 'It is true that class-based discrimination does not trigger heightened scrutiny under equal protection in the way that race-based and sex-based discrimination do. Some judges\u2014even some Supreme Court Justices\u2014have begun to argue that it is constitutionally impermissible for courts to take class into account under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fifth Circuit reached this conclusion a few years ago in the Whole Woman's Health case, in which it asserted that judges could consider only obstacles created by 'the law itself' when determining whether a law unduly burdens the right to abortion\u2014a category that excluded obstacles such as lack of transportation, childcare, days off from work, and money for overnight stays. When Whole Woman's Health reached the Supreme Court, some of the Justices (in dissent) expressed support for this approach.' 'Vermont's Striking Nurses Want A Raise for Nonunion Workers Too' [Labor Notes[41]]. 'Yet when 1,800 nurses and technical staff struck for better wages July 12-13 at the state's second-largest employer, the University of Vermont Medical Center, the people of Burlington came out in force to back them up. 'We had policemen and firefighters and UPS drivers pulling over and shaking our hands' on the picket line, said neurology nurse Maggie Belensz. 'We had pizza places dropping off dozens of pizzas, giving out free ice cream.' And when a thousand people marched from the hospital through Burlington's downtown, 'we had standing ovations from people eating their dinners,' she said. 'It was a moving experience.' One reason for such wide support: these hospital workers aren't just demanding a raise themselves. They're also calling for a $15 minimum wage for their nonunion co-workers, such as those who answer the phones, mop the floors, cook the food, and help patients to the bathroom.' 'What Are Capitalists Thinking?' [Michael Tomaskey, New York Times[42]]. 'I write today with some friendly advice for the capitalist class about said socialists. You want fewer socialists? Easy. Stop creating them. I understand completely why it's happening. Given what's been going on in this country, it couldn't not have happened. And if you're a capitalist, you'd better try to understand it, too \u2014 and do something to address the very legitimate grievances that propelled it.' \u2022 Finally, reality begins to penetrate the thickened craniums of the better sort of liberal 'In 2008, America Stopped Believing in the American Dream' [Frank Rich, New York Magazine[43]]. (The 'American Dream' being one of the official narratives.) 'It's not hard to pinpoint the dawn of this deep gloom: It arrived in September 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers kicked off the Great Recession that proved to be a more lasting existential threat to America than the terrorist attack of seven Septembers earlier. The shadow it would cast is so dark that a decade later, even our current run of ostensible prosperity and peace does not mitigate the one conviction that still unites all Americans: Everything in the country is broken. Not just Washington, which failed to prevent the financial catastrophe and has done little to protect us from the next, but also race relations, health care, education, institutional religion, law enforcement, the physical infrastructure, the news media, the bedrock virtues of civility and community. Nearly everything has turned to crap, it seems.' \u2022 Ditto 'How to keep young people from fleeing small towns for big cities' [The Week[44]]. 'Communities also must change the way they train young people. One important thing Carr and Kefalas uncovered in their book about brain drain is that many communities have brought this problem on themselves. 'Fueling the out-migration is a regional filtering system pushing some young people to stay and others to go,' they write. 'Teachers, parents, and other influential adults cherry-pick the young people destined to leave and ignore the ones most likely to stay or return. Civic leaders may lament the rural youth exodus and the accompanying brain drain, but they fail to see how their own actions have helped create the problem.' \u2022 Education is the key. 'On average for the year-ended this May, 58.5 percent of the job gains were in counties that backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to an Associated Press analysis of monthly government jobs data by county. Despite an otherwise robust national economy, the analysis shows that a striking number of Trump counties are losing jobs. The AP found that 35.4 percent of Trump counties have shed jobs in the past year, compared with just 19.2 percent of Clinton counties' [Associated Press[45]]. \u2022It's bad out here in the colonies News of The Wired ''Spectacular' ancient public library discovered in Germany' [Guardian[46] (SO)]. 'The remains of the oldest public library in Germany. have been discovered in the middle of Cologne. It is not clear how many scrolls the library would have held, but it would have been 'quite huge - maybe 20,000', said Schmitz. The building would have been slightly smaller than the famed library at Ephesus, which was built in 117 AD.' \u2022I wonder what happened to the scrolls? The article doesn't say 'Freeing the Web from the Browser' [ReinterpretCast[47]]. '[A]ll link-based navigation on the Web today is constrained to the connections made by document authors. Think about that for a second. Billions across the globe rely on the Web to enhance their intellectual capabilities on a daily basis, building understanding through its rich mesh of connections. Yet when they open their Web browsers, these people are presented not with navigation opportunities carefully selected to aid them in finding the information they are looking for, but rather by the connections that the authors happened to make in crafting their documents. While you might find these works eventually by following link after link, such a search is arduous and comes with no guarantees. Your success depends heavily on what popular authors happen to link to. The degree to which this constrains the Web is hard to overstate.

Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

The exports dropped another 20% in the first six months of this year. The pain is rippling through agricultural supply chains. One forecast says tariffs could cost the sector as many as 71,000 jobs over the next two years' [Wall Street Journal[1]]. (Apparently, China's swine fever epidemic has not cut demand for soy[2].) Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?'</p><p> -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune'2020 Democratic Presidential Nomination' [RealClearPolitics[3]] (average of five polls). As of August 5: Biden fluctuates to 32.3% (32.2), Sanders continues climb to 16.7% (16.5%), Warren flat at 14.0% (14.0%), Buttigieg flat at 5.5% (5.5%), Harris down at 10.2% (10.3%), Beto separating himself from the bottom feeders, interestingly. Others Brownian motion. So, I think we can conclude that Sanders won both debates.* * * 2020Harris (D)(1): 'While Democrats get crazier, Gabbard hits Harris criticism right on the nose' [Glenn Reynolds, USA Today[4]]. 'But the really serious point to come out is this: If you're shocked and appalled by Harris's conduct, don't try to comfort yourself by thinking it's unusual (or by blaming Russia.) As Clark Neily writes, 'The real significance of Gabbard's critique, however, lies not in the proposition that Harris was a particularly unprofessional or malign prosecutor, but rather in the fact that she seems to have been a rather ordinary prosecutor who simply did her job the way most prosecutors do. And if that makes a former-prosecutor-turned-presidential-candidate look like a monster, then perhaps that says more about prosecutors in general than it does about Kamala Harris in particular.'' \u2022 Glenn Reynolds makes sense. It's a funny old world. Sanders (D)(1): Sanders calls his shot not only the effect of trade deals on workers, but on the two-party system. In 2000. The whole video is worth a listen, since the Tweet doesn't quote all of it. In the year 2000, Congress voted to grant China upgraded trade status, helping it become world's most powerful dictatorship. Bernie Sanders voted against. He stood next to Pelosi at Dem presser and blasted Bill Clinton. \"Let me tell you where he got his money,\" Sanders intoned. pic.twitter.com/JzBZ3UiXka[5] \u2014 Zaid Jilani (@ZaidJilani) August 7, 2019[6]No wonder they hate him.  Williamson (D)(1): 'Meet the Marianniacs' [Elle[7]]. 'Marianne fans are a surprisingly diverse group of people who discovered her in different ways, and were ultimately drawn in by her unconventional way of discussing politics, and specifically her emphasis on love.' \u2022 Cory Booker tried that, too.* * *'Few candidates have loyal small-dollar donor bases' [WaPo[8]]. \u2022 Few, but not none:Turns out small donor money isn't all that fungible. 'Shadow of Dark Money Grows as 2020 Groups Shun Donor Disclosure' [Bloomberg[9]]. 'Democratic and Republican groups raising tens of millions of dollars for the 2020 elections increasingly are keeping their funding sources secret, a trend that watchdog groups warn allows high-dollar donors to gain influence with candidates without risking exposure. Priorities USA, which collected almost $200 million to help Hillary Clinton in 2016, says it wants to spend that much or more to help the next Democratic nominee defeat President Donald Trump. This time, however, Priorities is being funded mostly by undisclosed donations.' \u2022 What could go wrong? 'Are the Democrats divided? No \u2014 they're poised to win big if they don't screw it up' [Bill Curry, Salon[10]]. 'Everyone wants to see Warren and Sanders face off against Biden because the real dividing line is between the middle class and the donor class. Warren and Sanders never attack Obama, Biden or each other and they won't do it in September. What they will do is compare their ideas and campaigns to his. The facts will be fierce, but the delivery will be civil. It'll be Biden's toughest test. Progressives want to take a new path, but I've yet to meet a 'Never Bidener.' The stakes are too high. To defeat Trump, Democrats need to answer his racism with a message of both racial justice and social conciliation, and answer his corruption with a message of economic justice and political reform. So long as their candidates don't make a fetish of their small differences, they'll get there.' \u2022White House counsellor to Clinton. Not seeing a whole lot about 'economic justice and political reform' from establishment Democrats. Of course, if they hadn't spent three years yammering about Russia, they might have had time to come up with something. 'Left/right labels don't help - we must build a fusion coalition to defeat Trumpism' [Reverend William Barber, Guardian[11]]. '[P]ollsters and campaign advisers consistently present candidates with data to suggest that the left/right framework the media uses to talk about public issues makes sense to most people. While that data may be a true representation of responses to surveys, people can only respond to the questions they are asked. The sad reality for far too long has been that no one is asking about the plight of poor and low-wealth people in America. It is no accident that the people who never hear their names or issues taken seriously in public life do not turn out for elections. To accept the left/right framework is to refuse the moral framing that has galvanized people of all races throughout US history in the struggles for abolition, labor rights, women's rights and civil rights. If candidates want to make a moral case for their policy proposals, they should disaggregate the impact of those policies by race, class and region and show how the vast majority of Americans would benefit from them. They should be clear about how Trump targets his rhetoric and policies at immigrants and people of color, but those policies hurt poor white people as well.' \u2022I think that ship has sailed.El Paso and Dayton ShootingsReaders, thanks very much for your insightful comments (and links) on the 'cracking tower' metaphor for shootings. It does seem to me that the United States is exceptionally good at manufacturing at least one refined product: Mass shooters (white male). It also seems evident to me that the El Paso shooter is the most refined product of said cracking tower, which, if it is still in operation, will produce more. But this is also not an easy topic to write on, not least because we're in another moral panic about it, so we can hardly hear ourselves think. The usual tropes deployed are insufficient: Video games, mental heatlh, even 'gun control,' though bullet rationing might have a chance. The cacophony of 'Nazis,' 'fascism,' 'white supremacy,' 'white nationalism,' and 'racism' doesn't yield clarity either; those are all different things! (Not to deny our country's own role in originating or signal boosting them all). In particular, the tendency of liberal Democrat strategists to deploy cries of racism (now) or sexism (2016) or racism and sexism (2008) for short-term political gain \u2014 often after erasing a candidate's practice of same \u2014 is really distorting and verges on virtue signaling. (One might characterize the Republicans as the party of bad principles, and the Democrats as the party of motivated reasoning.) So I will continue to think on this topic, and continue to evolve this section (although I may need to change the title). -lambert P.S. Thanks again for your comments and links on this topic yesterday. More like this, please. 'What Experts Know About People Who Commit Mass Shootings' [New York Times[12]]. 'Can one mass shooting inspire another? Yes Are video games to blame for mass shootings? The results of studies attempting to clarify the relationship between violent video games and aggression have been mixed, with experts deeply divided on the findings. How strong is the link between mental illness and mass shootings? Tenuous, at best. Would drugging or confining people showing 'red flags' prevent massacres? No one knows for certain.' \u2022 This is pretty thin gruel. 'Dayton shooter may be antifa's first mass killer' [NY Post[13]]. \u2022 I dunno. It's the shooters pr0n rock band that gets me. I see the El Paso shooter, who \u2014 assuming the provenance proves out \u2014 wrote a manifesto as being ideologically serious in a way that the Dayton shooter, who was just a mess by all accounts, was not. (We should also think back to the Orlando shootings, where literally everything about the initial stories was wrong). And speaking of pr0n- 'Photos from Dayton and El Paso illustrate the grim routine of mass shootings' [WaPo[14]]. \u2022 If I see one more photo of beautiful young people holding candles Honestly, it's like some weird kind of pr0n. I don't equate viewing digital images of people mourning as actually mourning.  Where 'we' are: Panic in Times Square After Motorcycle Is Mistaken for Gunshots <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/F5qsndMPfD\">https://t.co/F5qsndMPfD</url>[15] \u2014 Dan Froomkin (@froomkin) August 7, 2019[16]Somehow, I can't help thinking that a panicked populace is not conducive to sound democratic decision-making RussiaGate'Finally Time for DNC Email Evidence' [Patrick Lawrence, Consortium News[17] (Furzy Mouse)]. '[T]he report on Russian interference completed in the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller made clear that the special counsel's office did not undertake a credible investigation of the charge that Russian intelligence hacked the DNC's mail servers. Mueller failed to call numerous key witnesses, among them Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and publisher, and Bill Binney, formerly a technical director at the National Security Agency and one of several technical experts in the VIPS group. He also failed to pursue alternative theories in the email-theft case; a duty of any investigator in Mueller's position. Only the willfully blind can accept these irregularities as legitimate conduct. Remarkably enough, Mueller's investigation appears to have conducted no forensic tests of its own to verify allegations of a Russian hacking operation. It relied instead on the patently faulty findings of Crowdstrike, the disreputable cyber-security firm that was working for the DNC by mid-2016. Critically, the special counsel also appears to have neglected to consult the NSA for evidence pertaining to the DNC incident. Had the intrusion been a hack conducted over the internet, by Russians or anyone else, the agency would have a fully detailed digital record of the operation and the means to trace the intervention to its perpetrators. Why, it is perfectly logical to ask, was such a record not cited prominently in the Mueller report?' \u2022 'Here in the West' [Pamela Anderson[18]]. 'Here in the West, there has been a lot of finger-pointing at Russia in the past years, as if in a desperate attempt to revive the 'good old times' of the Cold War, when all evil could be so conveniently projected on the Soviet Union. As if a forced re-animation of the old enemy could somehow absolve the West of the increasingly obvious need for critical self-introspection and democratic reform in the face of its own accelerating political decline.' \u2022 2018 Post MortemNo: .@ChelseaClinton[19] and I are thrilled to announce \"The Book of Gutsy Women,\" out October 1st.

Perhaps it's their stand on open borders. 'Twitter says it won't verify new candidates until they win their primaries' [The Hill[24]]. \u2022 Swell. More incumbent protection. That should certainly help Twitter with regulatory issues! 'Inslee Is Doing Very Well in the Power Primary' [Mike the Mad Biologist[25]]. The conclusion: 'Democrats in 2021 will need to make people's lives better in meaningful ways. If not, we will have a repeat of 2010 in 2022, since next time we won't get Trump, we'll get someone smarter and more disciplined. As bad as Trump is, President Tom Cotton would be far worse.' \u2022 Yep. 2020 is their last shot. Biden/Harris all the way! They call it historical materialism: The political continuum hypothesis states that there exist historical precedents besides Nixon and Hitler. It is widely believed outside the United States, in countries Americans have never heard of \u2014 Pinboard (@Pinboard) August 7, 2019[26] Stats Watch JOLTS, June 2019 (yesterday): 'Moderation in labor demand is this year's theme of the JOLTS report' [Econoday[27]]. 'Quits, which are tracked by Federal Reserve officials for indications of worker mobility and related wage pressure, remain flat This report hints at easing capacity pressure in the labor market and will likely be welcome by Fed officials who, with last month's rate cut, are adding new stimulus to the economy.' MBA Mortgage Applications, week of August 2, 2019: 'A big drop in mortgage rates \u2014 the result of last week's rate cut by the Federal Reserve \u2014 triggered a surge of refinancing applications' [Econoday[28]].  Shipping: 'Slots in heavy-duty truck production lines are opening up but few fleet operators are getting in line. Orders for Class 8 trucks fell last month to their lowest level since 2010' [Wall Street Journal[29]]. 'A factory backlog for Class 8 trucks that exceeded 300,000 orders late last year is down by more than a third, and research group FTR expects production to decline 22% next year. The good news for manufacturers is that cancellations have remained relatively light. That could change if weakness in the broader industrial sector gets worse and trucking companies decide to park their current fleet plans.' The Bezzle: 'A pioneer in the meal-kit market is losing its sizzle. Blue Apron Holdings Inc. narrowed its quarterly loss but is still losing customers and a turnaround could involve a lot more logistics for a business already laden with complicated fulfillment' [Wall Street Journal[30]]. 'New Chief Executive Linda Kozlowski says Blue Apron's plan to boost revenue and customer growth this year will include serving more households and offering greater menu choices, including flexibility to tailor the options. Perhaps more challenging, analysts say the overall market is already saturated and likely smaller than companies had hoped.' Tech: 'Trump Wants to Make It Basically Impossible to Sue for Algorithmic Discrimination' [Vice[31]]. 'The new rule takes aim at a 2015 Supreme Court ruling, which decided that consumers could combat housing discriminatory business practices by making 'disparate-impact claims' under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. In a disparate-impact claim, if you find out that a business practice had a disproportionate effect on certain groups of people, then you can hold that business liable\u2014even if it was an unintended consequence.. HUD's new rule would throw all that out the window by introducing huge loopholes to shield businesses from liability when their algorithms are accused of bias. As Reveal News[32] reported, 'A hypothetical bank that rejected every loan application filed by African Americans and approved every one filed by white people, for example, would need to prove only that race or a proxy for it was not used directly in constructing its computer model.' But there is substantial evidence to show that racial bias is fundamentally baked into the way that these algorithms and their data sets are constructed, even if they don't specifically take race into account[33].' \u2022 Code is law  Tech: 'Amazon Is Coaching Cops on How to Obtain Surveillance Footage Without a Warrant' [Vice[34]]. 'When police partner with Ring, Amazon's home surveillance camera company, they get access to the 'Law Enforcement Neighborhood Portal,' an interactive map that allows officers to request footage directly from camera owners. Police don't need a warrant to request this footage, but they do need permission from camera owners. Emails and documents obtained by Motherboard reveal that people aren't always willing to provide police with their Ring camera footage. However, Ring works with law enforcement and gives them advice on how to persuade people to give them footage. Emails obtained from police department in Maywood, NJ\u2014and emails from the police department of Bloomfield, NJ, which were also posted by Wired\u2014show that Ring coaches police on how to obtain footage. The company provides cops with templates for requesting footage Ring suggests cops post often on Neighbors, Ring's free 'neighborhood watch' app, where Ring camera owners have the option of sharing their camera footage.' \u2022It's a little tough to rank Big. Tech companies for evil right now, but surely Amazon gets a boost for this. Tech: 'Jeff Bezos feels a tap on the shoulder. Ahem, Mr Amazon, care to explain how Capital One's AWS S3 buckets got hacked?' [The Register[35]]. 'After last week's revelations that a hacker stole the personal details of 106 million Capital One credit card applicants from its Amazon-hosted cloud storage, a US Senator has demanded Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explain what exactly what went wrong. The sensitive information was siphoned[36] from Capital One's Amazon Web Services S3 buckets by a former AWS engineer, who was arrested and charged[37] at the end of July. Wyden is particularly concerned that other companies that store their data in the AWS cloud may have been hit in the same way by the suspected Capital One thief, Seattle-based software engineer Paige Thompson. He cited reports that Ford, the University of Michigan, the Ohio Department of Transportation, and others may have suffered similar losses of information at the hands of Thompson, and that this may point to a systemic weakness in Amazon's security.' \u2022 Uh oh. Keeping my data on my hard disk, thank you very much. Tech: 'FCC Plans to Redo Flawed Broadband Maps' [Inside Sources[38]]. 'Accurate broadband maps would help under [-served] areas get internet access, and they could also be used to hold telecom companies T-Mobile and Sprint accountable for their pledge to build out 5G[39] to cover 85 percent of rural Americans in three years and 99 percent of all Americans in six years once they complete their merger. (The combined company will face financial penalties if they don't meet these conditions.) According to the FCC's Report and Order for the Digital Opportunity Data Collection, the FCC will require all internet service providers (ISPs) 'to submit granular data maps of the areas where they have broadband-capable networks and make service available.' Previously, ISPs submitted census block data, which means even if they only served one person within a census tract or county, they counted that entire tract or county has having internet access.' \u2022 Wow.  Tech: 'More on Backdooring (or Not) WhatsApp' [Schneier on Security[40]]. 'Yesterday, I blogged about[41] a Facebook plan to backdoor WhatsApp by adding client-side scanning and filtering. It seems that I was wrong, and there are no such plans.' \u2022 A retraction, which speaks well of Schneier. Tech: 'Hacked Equifax Customer Receives 10,000 Stolen Social Security Numbers As Share Of Class Action Settlement' [The Onion[42]]. \u2022 News In Photos, so the headline is the joke. Manufacturing: 'Boeing Holds Workshops With China Carriers to Bring 737 Max Back' [Industry Week[43]]. 'Boeing invited pilots and engineers from China Southern Airlines Co. to a gathering in Guangzhou on Monday, according to an emailed statement from Boeing. More such workshops will be held with Air China Ltd., China Eastern Airlines Corp., Xiamen Airlines Co. and Hainan Airlines Holding Co. in their respective hubs this week. The gatherings are among the latest steps Boeing is taking to bring the plane back, though the exact timing remains unclear. Boeing is redesigning the plane's flight-control system and is still aiming to present a final software package to regulators by September, though the timeline could slip, a person familiar with the plans has said. China Southern and Air China are among Chinese carriers seeking compensation from the U.S. manufacturer for order delays and losses caused by the grounding of the 737 Max in the wake of two deadly crashes.' Transportation: 'Self-Driving Trucks Are Ready to Do Business in Texas' [WIRED[44]]. 'The truck developers come for the weather: It can get chilly in Texas, but the state doesn't get the months of snow, which can bedevil automated vehicle sensor technology.' \u2022 So, when the headline says 'in Texas,' it really does mean 'in Texas.' Transportation: 'How Much Traffic Do Uber and Lyft Cause?' [CityLab[45]]. 'Today the ride-hailing giants released a joint analysis[46] showing that their vehicles are responsible for significant portions of [vehicle-miles traveled (VMT)] in six major urban centers Now, the Fehr and Peers memo indicates that [transportation network companies (TNCs)] accounted for nearly twice the VMT in San Francisco than the SFCTA had estimated, said Gregory Erhardt, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Kentucky who has researched Uber and Lyft's effects on public transit ridership. That means the services are likely delaying commuters more, too On average, between the six cities, just 54 to 62 percent of the vehicle miles traveled by Lyfts and Ubers were with a rider in tow. A third of these miles involve drivers slogging around in between passengers ('deadheading,' in taxi-driver argot); 9 to 10 percent are drivers on their way to a pickup.'  Transportation: 'Swiss Post Suspends Drone Delivery Service After Second Crash' [IEEE Spectrum[47]]. 'For about a year, Swiss Post[48] and Matternet[49] have been collaborating on a drone delivery service in three different cities in Switzerland, with drones ferrying lab samples between hospitals far faster and more efficiently than is possible with conventional ground transportation. The service had made about 3,000 successful flights as of last January, but a January 25th crash[50] into Lake Zurich put things on hold until April[51]. A second crash in May caused Swiss Post to suspend the service indefinitely, and a recently released interim report[52] published by the Swiss Safety Investigation Board provides some detail on what happened\u2014and a reminder that for all the delivery drone[53] hype, there are some basic problems that are still not totally solved.' \u2022 In this case, parachutes that deploy 'if something goes wrong.' More: 'We have no idea exactly how safe Amazon's drones[54] are, or Google's drones[55] are. Even Zipline[56], which has been flying drones dozens of times per day for years[57], is still working to make their drones safer. What we do know is that crashes can (and do) happen, and the Swiss Post incidents are further evidence that we'll need a much better understanding of where all of the risk is if we want drones flying regularly over populated areas.'  Concentration: 'Australia Strips Google/Facebook to Their Underwear' [Matt Stoller, Big[58]]. 'The [Australian Competition ...nsumer Commission (ACCC)]'s most important contribution to the debate is to say, unvarnished, that Google and Facebook have exceptional amounts of market power and the incentive to use it to manipulate and exploit publishers, businesses, and users. Over the past fifteen years, Google and Facebook have become, as Sims put it in his press conference, 'essential gateways for consumers and businesses.' The consequences of this shift are the killing of the free press and the mass manipulation of users.' \u2022Most NC readers already know that, but Stoller's post is well worth a read for the wealth of detail and clarity of exposition.  Mr. Market: 'Carry On Like Nothing Really Matters. Until It Does' [John Authers, Bloomberg[59]]. 'It's no secret that yields on sovereign bonds around the world remain stunningly and historically low. And that, in turn, means a revival in the 'carry trade.' Carry trading is best known from its incarnation in the foreign-exchange market. It involves borrowing in a currency where interest rates are low and parking that money in a currency with higher rates, pocketing the difference, or 'carry.' Ideally, you get paid for doing nothing In practice, any increase in volatility or perceived risk \u2014 which can be nicely proxied by the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX \u2014 spells doom for the carry trade.' \u2022 Uh oh.

'Aug. 5, 2025: In a televised address to the nation, U.S. President Gavin Newsom announced that he had given Brazil a one-week ultimatum to cease destructive deforestation activities in the Amazon rainforest. If Brazil did not comply, the president warned, he would order a naval blockade of Brazilian ports and airstrikes against critical Brazilian infrastructure. The president's decision came in the aftermath of a new United Nations report cataloging the catastrophic global effects of continued rainforest destruction, which warned of a critical 'tipping point' that, if reached, would trigger a rapid acceleration of global warming. Although China has stated that it would veto any U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force against Brazil, the president said that a large 'coalition of concerned states' was prepared to support U.S. action. At the same time, Newsom said the United States and other countries were willing to negotiate a compensation package to mitigate the costs to Brazil for protecting the rainforest, but only if it first ceased its current efforts to accelerate development.' \u2022 Ulp.

'Crawford Lake is one of ten sites around the globe that researchers are studying as potential markers for the start of the Anthropocene, an as-yet-unofficial designation that is being considered for inclusion in the geological time scale. The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), a committee of 34 researchers formed by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) in 2009, is leading the work, with the aim of crafting a proposal to formally recognize the Anthropocene. This new epoch would mark a clear departure from the Holocene, which started with the close of the last ice age. To define a new epoch, the researchers need to find a representative marker in the rock record that identifies the point at which human activity exploded to such a massive scale that it left an indelible signature on the globe. Given how much people have done to the planet, there are many potential markers. 'Scientifically, in terms of evidence, we're spoiled for choice, but we have to pin it down,' says Jan Zalasiewicz, a palaeobiologist at the University of Leicester, UK, and chair of the AWG. In the end, it will be the rocks that have the final say.' \u2022 In more ways than one. 'A mission to Mars could cause learning impairment and anxiety, study says' [CNN[63]]. 'On a long-term spaceflight mission to Mars, astronauts will be continuously exposed to low-dose radiation in deep space. A new study found that this exposure can cause impairments in the brains of mice, resulting in learning and memory issues as well as anxiety Based on their findings, the researchers believe that one out of five astronauts on a deep space mission would likely experienced anxiety. One in three would be more likely to deal with memory issues. And all of them may struggle when it comes to making decisions, which would be crucial on a mission to Mars where communications with the Earth are delayed by up to 20 minutes.' \u2022 Surely there is a science fiction story with this premise, though I can't remember one. Certainly lots of potential for dark comedy  'This tiny insect could be delivering toxic pesticides to honey bees and other beneficial bugs' [Science[64]]. 'According to a new study, neonicotinoids can kill beneficial insects such as honey bees, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps by contaminating honeydew, a sugar-rich liquid excreted by certain insects. The study suggests honeydew could be another way beneficial insects are exposed to deadly insecticides. This can devastate more insects across the food web than nectar contaminated with insecticides could, the team says, because honeydew is more abundant, especially in agricultural fields neonicotinoids still account for more than 20% of the world's insecticide market.'

'In the game, the player uses tools and skills that McGregor and his editorial team need in their day-to-day investigations and reports. With image verification being an example of one of the most difficult challenges, the game will ask players to assess whether a viral image is accurate or not by using software to spot areas of the image that have been edited. 'It's the basics and 101 of journalism - teaching people to be sceptical and what tools to use to crack the conspiracy, like searching court records or sting operations on a more extreme level,' he explained.' \u2022It sounds like the stories and games are fictional. I don't see why they couldn't be real.

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

A Footwear Company Seeks a Third Option' [New York Times[1]]. ''It's hard to imagine shoes and clothing coming back to the United States just because they are so labor intensive,' said Chad P. Bown, an international trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. 'What matters is wage costs. It's just cheaper to make those things in other places.' </p><p>Even if tariffs succeed in forcing production back to the United States, Mr. Bown added, human beings are unlikely to secure the jobs. 'The companies will figure out how to do the work with robots and technology,' he said.' \u2022 Automakers haven't figured out how to make cars this way. Can shoemakers? 'The trade war is quiet. Smart money sees a chance to take risks' [CNN[2]]. 'After months of repeated escalation, the United States and China look no closer to hammering out a meaningful trade deal. But for now, at least, tensions look to be easing, not escalating. For investors, that provides an opening. On Wednesday, Beijing said it had waived import tariffs on more than a dozen US goods \u2014 the first such exemptions since the trade fight began. They'll kick in on September 17, as US and Chinese officials prepare to resume face-to-face talks in Washington.' \u2022Mr. Market appears to agree, having flipped from Fear to Greed. Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, DuneAlert reader dk (not to be confused with DK) is in the process of developing the following interactive chart: And here is (are) the latest poll(s) as of 9/11/2019, 12:00 PM EDT:Morning Consult, the behemoth, weighs in. Biden up (32.39%), Warren (15.39%) and Sanders (20.03%) have exchanged the lead again, with Sanders stretching it out (if you accept an average of all polls with no 'secret sauce' for poll selection).

There is an opportunity, in other words, for Sanders or any other labor-friendly politician to give even more teeth to the right to strike, to dramatize exploitation through conflict and confrontation and to give labor the tools it needs to forge a path to a better world for people without the privileges of wealth or the power of capital.'\u2022I don't know what's come over the Times. First, Sidney Ember writes something on Sanders that isn't a hit piece; now this. Sanders (D)(2): 'Why you shouldn't count out Bernie Sanders' [CNN[6]]. 'I'm not sure what chance Sanders has of winning the nomination, but the national and early state polling suggest Sanders shouldn't be tossed aside as an afterthought. He remains a key player in this Democratic race. Sanders is at 15% nationally in an average of debate qualifying polls over the last month. That may not seem like a lot, but it's actually very close to Warren's 18% average. Sanders actually runs slightly ahead of Warren in a number of polls, including one released by ABC News/Washington Post this past weekend, in which Sanders was at 19% and Warren was at 18%. Importantly, Sanders isn't dropping. His 15% in national polls is what he's averaged basically all year with the exception of a post-announcement bump in March. Sanders is not like California Sen. Kamala Harris, who started in the single digits, rose after she announced, dropped, rose again after the first debate and then dropped a second time. Having 15% support is key because it means he's at the threshold to receive delegates in primary contests.' \u2022Dunno where this Warren at 18%, Sanders at 15% stuff comes from  Sanford (R)(1): 'Who's running Mark Sanford's presidential campaign? So far, it's Mark Sanford' [The State[7]]. 'The former South Carolina governor and congressman is banking on his own intuition to secure victories in primary states where he is eligible to compete, staffing his operation with a 'band of volunteers' with no expertise in his political history or experience running national campaigns. Further, Sanford says at this point he has no urgency to hire more seasoned political veterans to guide him. 'It would call into question the seriousness of his bid,' said Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball \u2014 a prominent national political forecasting newsletter run out of the University of Virginia.'

Warren (D)(1): 'Elizabeth Warren is everything Hillary Clinton pretended to be' [Ryan Cooper, The Week[10]]. From April, still germane: 'As a presidential candidate, Warren's policy proposals are actually threatening to American oligarchs, and she evinces every intention of carrying them out as president. She wants to bust up corporate monopolies and oligopolies[11], and sharply regulate[12] abusive tech platforms. She correctly wants to get rid of the filibuster, and has a decent proposal[13] for guaranteed child care. She wants stiff tax hikes on the ultra-rich \u2014 a wealth tax[14] on fortunes over $50 million, a larger one on those over $1 billion, and a 7-percent tax[15] on corporate profits over $100 million. (In 2018, at least 60 Fortune 500 companies[16] paid zero tax or even got a refund on tens of billions in profits, including titans like Amazon, IBM, Netflix, and Activision Blizzard.) Where Clinton mainly valued the appearance of being a policy wonk (remember the lavish articles[17] about how she had rooms full of policy experts?), Warren is a genuine obsessive \u2014 and more importantly, values policy in terms of being able to improve the lives of the broad population, not just demonstrate her own competence. Currently Warren is bumping along somewhere around fifth place[18] in most polls for the 2020 nomination, with about 6 percent support, which is surprising. If you liked how Clinton sounded in 2016, Warren is the woman for you.' \u2022And now Warren is not fifth, but third, essentially because of the case Cooper makes here (for those who find it persuasive). Remember, there are voters for whom 'a woman in the White House before I die' is paramount.The Debates'Here's What You Need to Know About the 2020 Democratic Primary Debates' [Elle[19]]. 'The third debate will be hosted by ABC News in partnership with Univision on September 12 in Houston, Texas, from 8 to 11 P.M. The debate will take place at Texas Southern University, a public historically black university. The moderators will be George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, Linsey Davis, and Jorge Ramos. [Candidates who will appear are]: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Julin Castro, and Andrew Yang. Notable people who didn't qualify, but you've seen on the debate stage before, include Tulsi Gabbard, Marianne Williamson, Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock, Bill de Blasio, John Delaney, and Tim Ryan. This third debate is especially important considering it will be the first time all of the major 2020 candidates will appear on one debate stage at the same time.'  'They Meet at Last: Biden-Warren Matchup Is Main Event in Debate' [New York Times[20]]. 'It's a highly anticipated matchup between the early front-runner, Mr. Biden, and a liberal standard-bearer, Ms. Warren, who has steadily climbed in the polls to challenge him. Mr. Biden is eager to stress his experience. And his advisers and allies suggested in interviews that, whether obliquely or overtly, he is prepared to seize on one of Ms. Warren's perceived strengths \u2014 her extensive and boldly progressive policy plans \u2014 and use that to accentuate his own record of liberal achievements despite the sometimes-challenging political realities in Washington.' \u2022 The focus is on a contest between the candidate who leads, and the candidate who is third.

'Surescripts, a company that manages electronic prescriptions, said this week that it is ceasing its relationship with ReMy Health over a patient data dispute. That move has serious repercussions for Amazon-owned PillPack, which had a deal with ReMy that allowed it to access patient medication history collected by Surescripts. Now, PillPack officially has no clear way to access that data automatically and has to call the patient or their doctor. That's a highly manual process that might lead to errors.' \u2022Errors like people getting sick, or dying. But sure, let's run our pharmaceutical industry like cable fighting over a franchise. The Bezzle: 'Uber Undone' [The Baffler[24]]. 'Kalanick, who Waymo considers to be something of an unindicted co-conspirator, is the name at the center of the cork board, to whom all the strings of Uber's sprawling improprieties and disasters can be traced. He urged Uber to ignore local taxi commission rules, presided over the creation of a software designed to fool city regulators, rejected any meaningful financial oversight, and built a corporate culture that became globally renowned for its callous treatment of its workers. Silicon Valley began this decade as the bleeding edge of the American economy, where new technologies were said to be building a better future for the whole planet. By its end, the American tech industry will be largely viewed as the labor-destroying, profit-hungry behemoth that it truly is. While Facebook's inadvertent election-rigging and Google's near-monopoly on digital advertising might draw more attention as the culprits behind that pendulum swing, it is Uber's Randian capitalism that most transparently lays bare Silicon Valley villainy. And even from outside the C-suite, from which he was ejected in 2017, Kalanick remains its smug, unapologetic face.' \u2022 'Unindicted co-conspirator.' Great idea for a T-shirt.

For now, there is little hard data, but veterans in programs like the one in Manchester insist that it helps them focus, relax and become more productive. The programs are part of a small but growing effort by Veterans Affairs and veteran groups to promote the training of soldiers in farming and other agricultural careers.. Similar stories have been heard from beekeeping programs from Brockton, Massachusetts, to Reno, Nevada. Those running the programs said there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that beekeeping is making a difference for those who spend time managing hives and harvesting honey. Beekeeping gives them a sense of purpose, helps them relax and allows them to block out dark thoughts, they said.' \u2022Honeybees respond well to calm, I think. 'Want More Energy and Less Climate Change? Plant Trees' [The American Conservative[28]]. '[T]rees are central to any plausible plan for reducing greenhouse gases. [In the] words of the U.S. Forest Service, 'Forest ecosystems are the largest terrestrial carbon sink on earth and their management has been recognized as a relatively cost-effective strategy for offsetting greenhouse gas emissions. So if we wish to rally as many people as possible to the cause of sequestering CO2, we should wish to plant as many trees as possible.' \u2022You can also plant trees, either as a guerilla aborists, or on land (if you have it). Tomatoes, that is annuals, are the gateway drug for gardening, but if you've just started gardening, plant trees at once, because that way (with nut trees, say) you'll have trees in five years. Don't be like me, and figure out that you need to think about the canopy after five years of thinking only of beds. Then you won't have trees until ten years!

And in thickets of young alder and willow \u2014 a 24/7 beaver cafe \u2014 multiple dams, built in a side channel of this reborn river.

Created in the making of their dams, too, is a boost for salmon: These pools are perfect spots for juvenile salmon to rest and feed. The intertwined lives of beaver and salmon emerging here is one more sign that the ecosystem-scale restoration of the Elwha, with the world's largest-ever dam removal project, begun in 2011 and completed in 2014, is taking hold.'

(review) [Thomas Frank, New York Times[31]]. Reviewing Daniel Markovits' The Meritocracy Trap: 'in other ways Markovits doesn't go nearly far enough. When he squares off against the meritocratic elite, he keeps pulling his punches, assuring us that its members' educational credentials really are excellent, that their skills are real and that they work extremely hard. At times he even seems to lament the psychic toll that all that work takes on our white-collar professionals, as though one might simply persuade them to give up their system of privileges. A more resolute critique would zero in on the fraud and folly and hubris that always seem to accompany the deeds of the best and the brightest. A fuller account of the last real-estate bubble and the global financial crisis would have been helpful here; or the story of the Wall Street bailouts, when one set of high-achieving professionals simply forgave the sins of another; or a comprehensive discussion of the 2016 presidential election, when the Democratic team of geniuses managed to lose to the most unpopular presidential candidate of all time. we have this book, which forcefully interrupts the comfortable bath of self-flattery in which our well-graduated professionals pass their hours.' \u2022 Like I said, I don't know what's come over the Times; they took Thomas Frank off the black list?! 'California church leaders charged with forced labor of homeless, US attorney says' [CNN[32]].

'Trump pushing for major crackdown on homeless camps in California, with aides discussing moving residents to government-backed facilities' [MSN[33]]. 'Administration officials have discussed using the federal government to get homeless people off the streets of Los Angeles and other cities and into new government-backed facilities, according to two officials briefed on the planning. But it is unclear how they could accomplish this and what legal authority they would use. It is also unclear whether the state's Democratic politicians would cooperate with Trump, who has sought to embarrass them over the homelessness crisis with repeated attacks on their competency. Among the ideas under consideration are razing existing tent camps for the homeless, creating new temporary facilities and refurbishing existing government facilities, two other officials said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the planning hasn't been publicly revealed. The changes would attempt to give the federal government a larger role in supervising housing and health care for residents. The talks are fluid and concrete plans had not been reached.' \u2022 California is a one-party state controlled by Democrats. And they gave Trump the opening.

The most attractive feature of Bridgefy is that it works without the internet, instead relying on Bluetooth to create a mesh network. Bridgefy's co-founder and CEO, Jorge Rios, told Forbes last week that the app is usually downloaded for mass events when there's a chance that the internet will be spotty. This could mean a large sports game or a big concert or a mass pro-democracy movement.' \u2022Hmm. 'Robert Frank's Curious Perspective' (R.I.P. Robert Frank) [The Smithsonian[37]]. Of Frank's frame-shattering[38] The Americans: 'Motorcycles and racial divisions are among the motifs that help to unify The Americans, along with jukeboxes, crosses, televisions, luncheonettes, cowboy hats, fedoras, cigars, highways, the old and the young, lonely offices, huge automobiles, run-down parks, blowhard politicians and American flags. Frank observed all of these things during years of cross-country wanderings, funded partly by the Guggenheim Foundation. He had stated on his 1955 grant application that the project would be driven by 'what one naturalized American finds to see in the United States that signifies the kind of civilization born here and spreading elsewhere.' Frank, who celebrates his 84th birthday this year and who long ago moved on to making films, videos and images that combine photographs with text, arrived on these shores in 1947 in search of artistic freedom. Trained as a photographer in Switzerland, he once said he knew after World War II that his future lay elsewhere: Switzerland 'was too closed, too small for me.' Europeans who venture to America often focus their cameras on the gulf between our ideals and a grimmer reality, between rich and poor, black and white. Although such differences were all too visible in '50s America, Frank did not take cheap shots at his adopted land. He never acted the shocked foreigner or wide-eyed innocent. Instead, his complicated feelings about the country were expressed so obliquely that the book remains as open to interpretation today as when it first appeared 50 years ago. Published in Paris in 1958 and New York the following year, it was denounced by many critics at the time as a sneak attack on Americans' general view of themselves as happy and harmonious. But as the book's downbeat style has been absorbed and widely imitated over the years, Frank's detractors have retreated.' \u2022This is not one of the famous photographs, but it's a favorite of mine:The West!       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://forge.medium.com/a-radical-guide-to-spending-less-time-on-your-phone-a5419b1538ee\">https://forge.medium.com/a-radical-guide-to-spending-less-time-on-your-phone-a5419b1538ee</url>;* * *Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, with (a) links, and even better (b) sources I should curate regularly, (c) how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal, and (d) to find out how to send me images of plants.

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?'</p><p> -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, Dune * * *2020Alert reader dk (not to be confused with DK) is in the process of developing the following interactive chart. Here is (are) the latest Dem Primary Polling as of 10/1/2019, 1:00 PM EDT:More wild swings: Biden and Warren up, Sanders down. And here are the poll results:I think dk has started a really neat project, and in the near future we'll seek your feedback (within reason) for the tool 'live.' UPDATE 2019-09-24: These screens are from a revised version that now includes Undecided-Refused, which is in grey. UPDATE 2019-08-30: Now the polls aggregated (all available) are shown at the bottom of the poll. We also give more detail about each poll than RCP, and allow candidates to be selected or deselected. That's three reasons what dk is doing beats RCP, and if we can make the individual polls selectable/highlightable, that will be four reasons. With more to come, grid willing.* * *Biden (D)(1): 'Biden's trip to China with son Hunter in 2013 comes under new scrutiny' [NBC[5]]. 'In 2013, I was one of four reporters who traveled aboard Air Force Two with Biden and his son to China, a visit that was sandwiched between stops in Japan and South Korea.. What wasn't known then was that as he accompanied his father to China, Hunter Biden was forming a Chinese private equity fund that associates said at the time was planning to raise big money, including from China. Hunter Biden has acknowledged meeting with Jonathan Li, a Chinese banker and his partner in the fund during the trip, although his spokesman says it was a social visit.' Sanders (D)(1): 'Sanders has heart stent procedure after chest discomfort' [Politico[6]]. ''Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days,' senior adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement Wednesday. 'We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.'' \u2022Like everyone else in America, I searched: 'When do you need a heart stent?' [Harvard Medical School[7]]; 'After Your Angioplasty ...enting Procedure' [Seconds Count[8]]; 'Stent: Why and How They Are Used' [HealthLine[9]]. \u2022There's a certain lack of redundancy in the Sanders movement at the top levels, which could prove unfortunate. Sanders (D)(2): 'When You See The Word 'Stent' \u2014 Remember Medicare for All' [David Sirota, Bern Notice[10] (Nippersmom)]. 'This campaign's motto is 'Not Me, Us' \u2014 and because we are always on message for the 99%, we are encouraging media outlets that are reporting on stents to note that stents are a perfect example of why the United States needs to join the rest of the world and pass Bernie's Medicare for All legislation. An October 2018[11] study published in Health Affairs found that stents \u2014 which are very common[12] \u2014 cost up to six times more in the United States than in other industrialized countries with government-sponsored health care systems. The study[13] found that one set of stents cost $670 in the United States 'but only $120 and $130 in Germany and the U.K., respectively.' Another form of stent 'remained about $1,000 more expensive in the U.S. than Germany.' Why the price differential? In part, because America's dysfunctional health care system involves a complex web of payers \u2014 rather than a single-payer Medicare for All system that can negotiate better prices.' \u2022 Normally, I rarely source to campaign sites, but this shows a disciplined campaign. Sanders (D)(3): Nice timing, Steve: 'Maybe @BernieSanders[14] shouldn't exist,' says Blackstone's Schwarzman in response to @alansmurray[15] asking him to defend billionaires, which Sanders says should NOT exist pic.twitter.com/YG5tHoSz3K[16]; \u2014 Cristina Alesci (@CristinaAlesci) October 2, 2019[17]The decor is everything. Sanders (D)(4): 'Killer Mike Still Believes Bernie Sanders Can Start a Revolution' [The New Yorker[18]]. '[Michael Render, better known by his stage name, Killer Mike] had come to Greensboro to stump for Sanders again. He and the senator have stayed in touch, he said\u2014Sanders appears in Render's iPhone contacts as The OG. 'He texts pretty cool. You wouldn't know you're talking to a seventy-something-year-old dude,' Render said. Recently, he and Sanders had messaged about reparations. Sanders had been opposed to the idea, but, in April, he announced that he would sign a bill funding research into the subject. 'I educated him on that,' Render said.' \u2022 There's 'The OG' again! Oh, and 'Still.' Nice spin, New Yorker. Trump (R)(1): 'Trump campaign, RNC say they raised record-breaking $125 million in Q3' [Axios[19]]. 'Former President Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised approximately $70 million for his re-election campaign in 2011's third quarter. 'Trump is going to have more resources to deploy earlier and more aggressively than any candidate in history,' Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Obama, tweeted in response to the news on Tuesday.' Warren (D)(1): 'Warren gets 'dramatic shift' in support from black voters' [Politico[20]]. 'A Quinnipiac University national poll[21] last week showed Warren winning 19 percent of the African-American vote \u2014 a nine-point jump over the poll's August results. In the latest Morning Consult[22] poll, released Wednesday, she's up by five percentage points with black voters since August Those advances have played a role in her surging overall numbers, which have seen Warren expand her lead over the African-American candidates in the primary \u2014 Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker \u2014 and even overtake Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders in some state and national polls.' \u2022 Hmm. Warren (D)(2): 'Silicon Valley donors starting to back Elizabeth Warren despite her pledge to break up Big Tech' [CNBC[23]]. 'Sen. Elizabeth Warren has vowed to break up big technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon if she becomes president. Even so, a growing contingent of Democratic donors in Silicon Valley, where many of these behemoth tech companies are located, are looking to support Warren's 2020 campaign.' \u2022 'Even so.' And: 'Meanwhile, Warren has sworn off taking part in big-money events in the primary and has vowed to not be swayed by wealthy business leaders.' \u2022 Oh. Warren (D)(3): 'Saagar Enjeti calls Warren's credibility into question' [The Hill]. \u2022Enjeti is from the Daily Caller, so cum grano salis. Here's a new one: 'This weekend a clip resurfaced of Warren claiming that her parents had to elope because she was part Cherokee, her mother was part Cherokee, and part Delaware.' \u2022 Haven't seen the clip go by, and I'd want to authenticate it \u2014 but think of this as a preview of one possible future 2020.* * *'Why the Differences Between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders Matter' [Jacobin[24]]. 'Bernie is uniquely positioned to help us do so. Every time he opens his mouth, he clarifies who the enemy is \u2014 the billionaire class, the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, fossil fuel companies, Wall Street, the military-industrial complex \u2014 and names capitalism as the problem to boot.. More than any other figure in recent history can be said to have done so, Bernie is expanding our horizons. Rather than policies or plans alone, he is calling on social movements to overturn the entire state of affairs. For all her progressive policy ideas, Elizabeth Warren isn't. If we're serious about changing the world, that difference matters.' Impeachment'The Hazards of 'Normalizing' Impeachment' [The American Conservative[25]]. 'I must confess I am torn on impeachment. Not the 'whistleblower report' or the House Democrats' looming inquiry into President Donald Trump, that is, but on the question of whether impeachment should become a routine form of White Housecleaning or remain, as impeached former President Bill Clinton often said of abortion, 'safe, legal and rare.' Impeachment, James Madison wrote, is an 'indispensable' tool 'for defending the community against the incapacity, negligence, or perfidy of the Chief Magistrate.' Aside from elections themselves, it is really the primary one the Founders gave us to rein the president. With Justice Department guidelines now recommending against the indictment of an incumbent president for any reason, it is arguably the only one Alexander Hamilton warned concerning impeachment in Federalist 65, 'There will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.' It's hard to imagine the partisan weaponization of impeachment enhancing the power's effectiveness or legitimacy.' \u2022 Yep. 'Dems, media aim to squash Barr's probe of Russia collusion hoax' [New York Post[26]]. 'There are two known Department of Justice inquiries. One is a forthcoming inspector general report on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Congressional sources say the report is expected to be thorough and may include criminal referrals. The investigation led by US Attorney John Durham, who reports to Barr, is more comprehensive. According to a Justice Department spokesperson, 'Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries.'' \u2022 No leaks from either investigation, oddly. 'Trump Attacked the Women of Color Who Led the Push for Impeachment. Then CNN Erased Them.' [The Intercept[27]]. 'Then there's the other narrative, one in which the media has selected different heroes of the burgeoning impeachment effort \u2014 without including the leftist women of color. According to a weekend CNN feature, credit for the impeachment effort should instead go to four freshmen members of Congress \u2014 all of them white women with backgrounds in national security work.

'This Is the Moment Rachel Maddow Has Been Waiting For' [New York Times[29]]. 'Recently, I went to dinner at the home of Rebecca Kee, a preschool principal in San Francisco who turned to Maddow in her depression and confusion over the 2016 election. I brought a bottle of ros, and she poured it into glasses decorated with charms that featured Russia-investigation figures on one side and characters from 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' on the other. I sipped from the Hope Hicks/Beverly Crusher glass, and we watched Maddow's show over veggie enchiladas. Last year, Kee had a Maddow-themed birthday party, at which her friends and her two young sons put on big black glasses and slicked their hair to the side. Also in attendance was a life-size cardboard cutout of Maddow, which is now in storage so as not to startle guests.. After Rebecca Kee bought her Maddow cardboard cutout, she got a Robert Mueller one, too. For a time she would sit him in her front window, posing him near speech bubbles that she wrote herself. But after the real Mueller filed his report and failed to step into the role she had imagined for him, she tucked him away in the closet with Maddow. Now her car is decorated with Elizabeth Warren bumper stickers.' \u2022 Alrighty then. Stats Watch ADP Employment Report, September 2019: 'ADP estimates that private payrolls in September will rise a respectable 135,000 which matches Econoday's consensus for Friday's results. This would indicate monthly acceleration in private payrolls' [Econoday[30]]. 'Yet relative to ADP's sample, which has been running hotter than actual payrolls and whose estimate for August rose a revised 157,000, a 135,000 rise would mark slowing. ADP's data are often hard to read and in any case are not always an accurate gauge for actual employment change as reported by the government, yet today's 135,000 level, apart from any comparisons, offers confirmation that labor market conditions in September did remain solid.' \u2022 Mr. Market must be skittish. Retail: 'Amazon Inc. is taking another big step into brick-and-mortar business in a bid to get closer to consumers. The e-commerce giant is advancing a plan to open a chain of U.S. grocery stores with early outposts in Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia with many proposed locations outside urban cores and catering to middle-income consumers' [Wall Street Journal]. 'That's a different approach than Amazon took with its Whole Foods Market acquisition but it fits with the company's growing effort to extend its online identity into the physical world.' \u2022 So if I have this right, Amazon destroyed existing bricks and mortar with e-commerce (and regulatory arbitrage), and now It's going into the bricks and mortar business? Except, no doubt, with a lot more surveillance and a lot more crapification.  Shipping: 'UPS gains FAA permission for drone deliveries with few restrictions' [Los Angeles Times[31]]. 'The Federal Aviation Administration gave the courier permission to use delivery drones at hospital, university and corporate campuses with few restrictions, for example, letting operators fly the aircraft at night and over people. Current regulations prohibit drone flights after dark, above people, beyond the remote pilot's line of sight and at weights heavier than 55 pounds. 'We believe now there are hundreds of campuses across the United States where we're going to be able to offer this solution,' UPS Chief Transformation Officer Scott Price said in an interview.

The Bezzle: ''At What Point Does Malfeasance Become Fraud?': NYU Biz-School Professor Scott Galloway on WeWork' [New York Magazine[32]]. Very good. One nugget: 'The interesting thing is whether or not these individual locations are special-purpose entities, meaning they can break the leases by declaring bankruptcy across multiple special-purpose entities. In other words, they may have employed what hotels do: If the Four Seasons New York goes out of business, it's its own corporation. It just goes out of business. It just declares bankruptcy and gives the building back to the bank, but it's not guaranteed by the headquarters in Toronto. Some of the reporting I've seen is that they have special-purpose entities so they can potentially close a bunch of their properties.' The Bezzle: 'Zimbabwe's central bank has shut down the use of mobile money for cash transactions' [Quartz[33]]. 'in Zimbabwe, cash-in and cash-out has just been killed off by the government, because authorities have concluded the functions are being abused. Zimbabwean mobile money agents, mostly with the dominant EcoCash platform, have been capitalizing on cash shortages in Zimbabwe to buy cash for re-sale to mobile wallet holders at a premium of up to 50%. This means that when trying to access funds in your mobile wallet through the agents, one would only get about 50% of their balance.'

Important on the Precautionary Principle: 'It is clear that geoengineering promoted in a context of a capitalist regime of maximum accumulation would be ruled out completely by a strong Precautionary Principle based on each of the criteria listed above. There is a near certainty of extreme damage to the human species as a whole arising from all of the major geoengineering proposals. If the onus were placed on status quo proponents of capitalist geoengineering to demonstrate that great harm to the planet as a place of human habitation would not be inflicted, such proposals would fail the test. Since the alternative of not burning fossil fuels and promoting alternative forms of energy is entirely feasible, while planetary geoengineering carries with it immense added dangers for the earth system as a whole, such a technofix as a primary means of checking global warming would be excluded by that criterion, too. Finally, geoengineering under the present economic and social system invariably involves some entity from the power structure\u2014a single multi-billionaire, a corporation, a government, or an international organization\u2014implementing such action ostensibly on behalf of humanity as a whole, while leaving most affected parties worldwide out of the decision-making process, with hundreds of millions of people, perhaps billions of people, paying the environmental costs, often with their lives. In short, geoengineering, particularly if subordinated to the capital accumulation process, violates the most sacred version of the Precautionary Principle, dating back to antiquity: First Do No Harm.' \u2022 If you like your whiskey neat, there's the Monthly Review.

Together, these banks commitments[45] \u2014 alongside a federal judge's block[46] on the Trump administration's plans to expand family detention this weekend, new policy initiatives such as California[47] ending all contracts with private prisons, and Democratic primary candidates[48] publicly raising the idea of a federal ban on for-profit incarceration \u2014 lead many to speculate a threat to the survival of the private prison industry all together.

Here is the issue: At the heart of this dispute lies the concept of 'layoff protection,' an important part of Local 2's contract\u2014and one the SEIU would like to see disappear. Currently, if there are layoffs, the SEIU is obligated to find Local 2 members with at least five years of service another job within the organization. Their position can be eliminated, in other words, but the people cannot. Outside of the union world, this provision is sometimes derided as a 'job for life,' a relic of over-entitlement in the workplace. But the reality is that for those working at SEIU, layoff protection is more a basic survival staple than a luxury. That's because, unlike in standard private sector jobs, the SEIU has a convention every four years, which inevitably results in new plans, new campaigns, and a reorganization of the union's goals. 'As a result of that, like clockwork, you can count on massive layoffs,' says David Hoskins, an SEIU research analyst who serves as the chief shop steward for Local 2. 'This provision is rooted in that history, and is a way to ensure that people are not just tossed aside.' Without layoff protections, the idea of building a full career at SEIU headquarters is hopeless. Perhaps the SEIU leadership doesn't want staffers to build a career? (And I also wonder what the SEIU thinks about a Jobs Guarantee.) 'An Unpopular Article' [Craig Murray[51]]. Inspired by BoJo's leg-squeezing: 'The initiation of more intimate physical contact is the most critical point in the complex courtship rituals of developed human societies. To insist that verbal agreement must always be sought before a move to kiss or an exploratory caress of a leg or a shoulder, is a fundamental change in culture which I am not at all sure is desirable. The essential qualifier is of course that, if the other person either verbally or by action does not welcome the tentative first move, then the initiator must desist immediately. It is my own belief that sex-negative feminism seeks quite deliberately to invalidate perfectly normal heterosexual courtship and that the chattering classes have far too readily adopted this, in the interests of identity politics. To deny the existence of non-verbal communication, and make an issue of non-violent initiation of contact outside an erogenous zone, is to me not legitimate. I would also refer you to . the extraordinary difference in the treatment in these matters by the media and political classes purveying identity politics of those within the neo-liberal 'centrist' consensus, like Bill Clinton and Brendan Cox, and those outside it, like Boris Johnson, Alex Salmond or Julian Assange.

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Readers, thank you very much for your comments yesterday, many very funny, when, on Veterans Day, I mistakenly posted a Water Cooler template instead of an actual Water Cooler. I had thought I pushed not only the title, but the scheduled posting date, up one day. Oopsie!</p><p> -lambert Trade 'A 14.1% decline in loaded container imports into the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in October is the starkest sign yet of the roller-coaster ride underway at shipping docks, as a rush to import goods ahead of new tariffs gives way to a pre-holiday slowdown while retailers burn off stockpiled inventories. The figures from Southern California were among the first on shipping volumes following a new round of U.S. tariffs on China-made goods in September that brought consumer products into the trade battle' [Wall Street Journal[1]]. 'Trade data group Panjiva estimates overall seaborne imports into the U.S. fell 8.9% in October, and that consumer products from China took the biggest hit. Experts expect volumes to pick up again this month before diving again, although talks toward a possible interim U.S.-China trade agreement may change shipping decisions.' Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, DuneHere is a second counter for the Iowa Caucus, which is obviously just around the corner: * * *2020Alert reader dk (not to be confused with DK) is in the process of developing the following interactive chart. Here is (are) the latest Dem Primary Polling as of 11/11/2019, 12:00 PM EST:The Biden juggernaut rolls on, but Sanders pulls ahead of Warren. Here, the latest national results, as of 11/12/2019, 12:00 PM EST:Quinnipiac has released a new NH poll. As of 11/12/2019, 12:00 PM EST:The results, as of 11/12/2019, 12:00 PM EST:Sure enough, Gabbard got a pop after Clinton smeared her. Looks like Clinton is the Russian asset! I think dk has started a really neat project, and in the near future we'll seek your feedback (within reason) for the tool 'live.'* * *Biden (D)(1): 'What is going on in New Hampshire?' [Jennifer Rubin, WaPo[2]]. 'the latest Quinnipiac poll tells us two things. First, the race is very fluid and most voters are undecided. Second, former vice president Joe Biden's political death may have been exaggerated \u2014 or entirely premature. The poll is also instructive in figuring out the candidates' base of support. Biden, we know, has been leading in electability and among older voters. That is still the case, where he draws 31 percent in both categories. However, he has expanded his support from moderate/conservative voters and now is in a four-way tie among self-described 'somewhat liberal' voters. Interestingly, Buttigieg is in a statistical tie with Warren on electability and is in first place when it comes to being a good leader. In other words, voters are not simply changing 'favorites'; they are reevaluating what they think about the candidates' strengths.' Bloomberg (D)(1): 'Why Bloomberg won't be the Democratic nominee' [WaPo[3]]. 'If Bloomberg were to succeed in becoming the nominee, he possibly would have done so over the objections of African American voters. Come November 2020, those voters could do what they have consistently done when they feel ignored or taken advantage of: They could stay home. Thus, the candidate who jumped into the race because he was not satisfied that the current crop of candidates could beat Trump could be the candidate who gets him reelected.'  UPDATE Bloomberg (D)(2): 'Excitement over Bloomberg's trial balloon should concern Democrats' [The Hill][4]. \u2022 That's the headline. The body provides no evidence of 'excitement' whatever. Who's excited? Warren (D)(1): 'Bonderman Backs Warren Over Trump Despite Private Equity Attacks' [Bloomberg[5]]. 'David Bonderman, the billionaire co-founder of TPG Capital, said the existing slate of candidates would do better than Donald Trump, and said he would pick the Massachusetts senator over the president While Bonderman, 76, said Warren is smart, he doesn't think she'd be able to push through many of her proposals. The problem with the candidate, he says, is 'she can't count.' 'I believe in capitalism,' said Bonderman, who has a net worth of $4.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. 'Like with everything else, it gets overwhelmed. The tax policies are all wrong. The social policies are all wrong. It's hard to do something about it.'' \u2022Slaves of some defunct economist. UPDATE Sanders (D)(1): 'The country's largest nurses' union will back Bernie Sanders in 2020' [Axios[6]]. 'National Nurses United, the country's biggest nurses' union, will endorse Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential race this week, the New York Times reports. It's significant that the group chose to back Sanders and his 'Medicare for All' plan despite the fact that he's facing a progressive challenger in Elizabeth Warren on the issue.' UPDATE Warren (D)(2): 'Elizabeth Warren's Head Tax Is Indefensible' [Matt Bruenig, Jacobin[7]]. 'As I noted[8], Warren's head tax is very regressive and far inferior to the usual income- and payroll-tax proposals. More recently, the Tax Policy Center's Howard Gleckman[9] and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' Jared Bernstein[10] have made the exact same point. As part of the response to this undeniable point, it appears that Warren's team, e.g., Simon Johnson[11], has been pushing out arguments that conflate Warren's temporary maintenance-of-effort (MOE) payment with the permanent head tax that she transitions into. This conflation has been at the root of similar arguments made by Mike Konczal and Jordan Weissman, among others.' \u2022Read for the detail, but I don't like this shape-shifting.* * *'Which Democratic Candidates Are National Security Employees Opening Their Wallets for?' [Foreign Policy[12]]. \u2022 The article aggregrates the troops with the State Department and the TLAs, which is demented. Sanders leads in military contributions. Buttigieg leads with State, DOJ, and DHS (though Sanders is close). 'Democrats on edge as Iowa points to chaotic race' [The Hill[13]]. 'More than half of likely caucusgoers in Iowa haven't made a final decision on who to support. All of the top-tier candidates have reason to believe they could be the one to win the Iowa caucuses and get the subsequent jolt of momentum that could carry them to the nomination. 'Historically, when two or more people are vying for the nomination, the leader will change in the final weeks before the caucuses,' said Des Moines Register pollster Ann Selzer, whose surveys and methods are viewed as the gold standard in the Hawkeye State.'Impeachment'Do Trump impeachment hearings need boffo ratings, 'must-see TV' buzz to succeed?' [Will Bunch, Inquirer[14]]. \u2022 Skipping the analysis of this inquiry, this rings very true to me:I grew up a child of Watergate \u2014 dashing home from summer camp at age 14 to watch the drama of 1973\u2032s whistleblower, John Dean, and the homespun wisdom of Senate committee chair Sam Ervin of North Carolina \u2014 and it's only in hindsight that one really understands that the scandal by which all scandals are judged may also have been a once-in-a-lifetime catch of lightning in a bottle. The case against Richard Nixon and his men around campaign dirty tricks and an elaborate cover-up of lies and hush money was a damning one, but Nixon's foes also lucked out in the riveting way the story unfolded, drip by drip, over two years of what Slate nailed by dubbing it 'a slow burn.' [Unlike Mueller, a damp squib.] The top writers in the room at today's TV hits like Succession or Watchmen would struggle to invent the plot twists that marked each season of Watergate. And it played out in the last decade before cable, where there was nothing else on TV, and when millions of the viewers were still persuadable. That Watergate America where the news was pounded out on typewriters and broadcast over rabbit- era antennas is a hazy memory. Whatever facts are uttered Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill will be remixed and recast on Twitter, Facebook, Fox News and MSNBC to become the legend of our warring political tribes by the time we go to bed Wednesday night. It pains me to write that.  This current enquiry, at least insofar as the cases made and the principal players if not the stakes, strikes me as fundamentally frivolous. There is no Sam Ervin, nor James Baker, either. 'Scoop: GOP outlines theory of impeachment defense in memo to members' [Axios[15]]. 'Republicans on the three House committees conducting the Trump-Ukraine investigation have settled on 'four key pieces of evidence' that they claim will undermine Democrats' arguments for why the president should be impeached, according to a staff memo circulated to committee members Monday night.' \u2022 They are:The July 25 call summary \u2014 the best evidence of the conversation \u2014 shows no conditionality or evidence of pressure; President Zelensky and President Trump have both said there was no pressure on the call; The Ukrainian government was not aware of a hold on U.S. security assistance at the time of the July 25 call; and President Trump met with President Zelensky and U.S. security assistance flowed to Ukraine in September 2019 \u2014 both of which occurred without Ukraine investigating President Trump's political rivals.' Read the full article for the Democrat responses. Here is a link to the full memo[16]. Beneath all the detail, this passage stands out for me: Democrats want to impeach President Trump because unelected and anonymous bureaucrats disagreed with the President's decisions and were discomforted by his telephone conversation with President Zelensky. The Democrat impeachment narrative flips our system of government on its head. The federal bureaucracy works for the President. The President works for the American people. And President Trump is doing what Americans elected him to do. On its face, this is just wrong. Federal civil servants take an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to the President in its own person. (As opposed to political appointee, who in addition serve at the pleasure of the President). There's a name for that idea, and its not pretty. Nevertheless, this gives the right perspective on the power struggle. RussiaGate was, and UkraineGate is, a struggle over policy. Liberal Democrats seem to have this odd, West Wing-style fantasy view that the national security and intelligence communities are autonomous, professionalized services performed autonomously, and that it is the President's duty to defer to them, and not the other way round. Needless to say, this is hardly what the Framers had in mind when they wrote of 'energy in the executive.' [17]We might also remind ourselves that 'The Blob' is responsible for at twenty years of grotesque policy debacles for which they have never been called to account. Making sure that never happens is, too, part of the power struggle.

Over the years, landowners buried them, filling in wetlands so they had more land for planting crops and other needs, or let ponds fade away with neglect. In the wetlands of eastern England, a motley team of farmers, university researchers and conservationists is digging into the region's barley and wheat fields to turn back the clock. They seek out patches of muddy earth that hint at lost ponds lurking beneath Using chain saws, an excavator and plenty of sweat, the team takes just a few hours to resurrect one dying pond near Hindolveston, a thousand-year-old village not far from the North Sea. They fell trees and shrubs, then start digging until reaching their goal: an ancient pond bottom that once supported insects, aquatic plants and the birds and animals that fed on them. 'As soon as they get water and light, they just spring to life,' says Nick Anema, a farmer in nearby Dereham who has restored seven ponds on his property. 'You've got frogs and toads and newts, all the insects like mayflies, dragonflies, damselflies. You can't really beat a pond.'' 'The Toxic Bubble of Technical Debt Threatening America' [The Atlantic[34]]. 'A kind of toxic debt is embedded in much of the infrastructure that America built during the 20th century. For decades, corporate executives, as well as city, county, state, and federal officials, not to mention voters, have decided against doing the routine maintenance and deeper upgrades to ensure that electrical systems, roads, bridges, dams, and other infrastructure can function properly under a range of conditions. Kicking the can down the road like this is often seen as the profit-maximizing or politically expedient option. But it's really borrowing against the future, without putting that debt on the books Almost everywhere you look in the built environment, toxic technical-debt bubbles are growing and growing and growing. This is true of privately maintained systems such as PG... and publicly maintained systems such as that of Chicago's Department of Water Management. It's extremely true of roads: Soon, perhaps 50 percent of Bay Area roads will be in some state of disrepair, not to mention the deeper work that must occur to secure the roadbeds, not just the asphalt on top. Then there are the sewers and the wastewater plants. Stormwater drains. Levees. And just regular old drinking water.' 'At least 1,680 dams across the US pose potential risk' [Associated Press[35]]. 'A review of federal data and reports obtained under state open records laws identified 1,688 high-hazard dams rated in poor or unsatisfactory condition as of last year in 44 states and Puerto Rico. The actual number is almost certainly higher: Some states declined to provide condition ratings for their dams, claiming exemptions to public record requests. Others simply haven't rated all their dams due to lack of funding, staffing or authority to do so. [U]nlike much other infrastructure, most U.S. dams are privately owned. That makes it difficult for regulators to require improvements from operators who are unable or unwilling to pay the steep costs.'

Across the world, antibiotic use is likely to be higher in hospitals. Half of patients in U.S. hospitals and a third in European hospitals take antibiotics. You can think of the hospital sewage system 'as a pipe where an entire bacterial ecosystem is growing on the walls,' says [Willem van Schaik, a specialist in microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom]. 'These ecosystems will be optimized to grow in the conditions of the sewage that's flowing through those systems.

'While our goal is to document history and spread information, nothing is more important than ensuring that our fellow students feel safe \u2014 and in situations like this, that they are benefitting from our coverage rather than being actively harmed by it.' \u2022 Oh? The students at the Medill School of Journalism who publish The Daily Northwestern have an odd idea of what journalism means. (Here is a Tweet storm from the Editor[38] which, while gracefully phrased and seemingly conciliatory, does not seem to me to address the central issue. 'Harvard Student Groups Condemn The Crimson's Coverage of Abolish ICE Rally' [The Crimson[39]]. 'The petition \u2014 started by student-led immigration advocacy group Act on a Dream earlier this month \u2014 criticizes The Crimson for requesting comment from an ICE spokesperson for its Sept. 13 article, 'Harvard Affiliates Rally for Abolish ICE Movement.' The article covers a Sept. 12 protest hosted by Act on a Dream and quotes several students' criticisms of ICE, including calls for its dissolution. The article notes that ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'In this political climate, a request for comment is virtually the same as tipping [ICE] off, regardless of how they are contacted,' the petition reads.' \u2022 As I understant it, the Crimson, unlike the Daily, did not cave.

The policy could create something akin to Medicaid for all. It would be 50 separate programs, jointly funded by the state and the federal government, with local officials making decisions about whom to cover, how much to pay doctors, and what benefits to cover. What he envisions is similar to Canada's progression toward universal coverage. It began with a single province, Saskatchewan, which started hospital insurance in 1947. Other provinces followed, and within two decades, the entire country had government-provided health coverage.' \u2022If the states handle #MedicareForAll, funding would be cut in the first downturn. That's why the currency issuer, the Federal Government should handle it. Also, I'm not sure that the Canadian path is the right one. First, two decades is a long time.

These men were not aberrations: they were following an example set from the very top and running through the industry and through fandom, to the great detriment of many of the people who came to science fiction for safety and sanctuary and community. It's not a coincidence that one of the first organized manifestations of white nationalism as a cultural phenomenon within fandom was in the form of a hijacking of the Hugo nominations process. While fandom came together to firmly repudiate its white nationalist wing, those people weren't (all) entryists who showed up to stir up trouble in someone else's community. The call (to hijack the Hugo Award) was coming from inside the house: these guys had been around forever, and we'd let them get away with it, in the name of 'tolerance' even as these guys were chasing women, queer people, and racialized people out of the field.

'Liberal calls for 'gun control' as a panacea conveniently circumvent the deep roots these atrocities have in our history and society. Furthermore, the reformist, institutional solutions advocated by these liberals, committed to the capitalist and imperialist systems which motivate mass shootings, will inevitably have racist and oppressive consequences. 'Gun control' entails giving the state a monopoly on weapons, whose foot soldiers (the police) are armed, racist, and militarized. Additionally, it invites the state to further regulate the people psychologically, inferably ushering in an Orwellian surveillance program in the form of 'background checks' based on the false belief that an individual's mental health, and not a macro social illness, is to blame for mass shootings. Additionally, it doesn't take a psychic medium to predict who will be the primary target of this desired crackdown on guns: black and brown Americans, the threatened populations who need the weapons most. These groups will surely be the most persecuted given general racial disparities in policing and imprisonment; 'gun control' will expand the racist carceral state which liberals played a critical role in building in the first place .'

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Trade 'Falling impeachment support raises pressure for Democrats on trade' [The Hill[1]]. 'The drop in support for impeachment in the polls is increasing pressure on Democrats to strike a deal on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Polling on impeachment has found that a majority of respondents support the process, but support has dropped from key groups of independents as public hearings got underway. An Emerson poll in November found 43 percent of voters overall supporting impeachment compared with 45 percent opposed. That represented a 6-point swing from the pollster's survey in October. </p><p>If that trend continues as the inquiry heads to the House Judiciary Committee this week, Democrats could become more mindful of notching a major bipartisan accomplishment.' 'U.S., China Move Closer to Trade Deal Despite Harsh Rhetoric' [Bloomberg[2]]. 'The U.S. and China are moving closer to agreeing on the amount of tariffs that would be rolled back in a phase-one trade deal despite tensions over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, people familiar with the talks said. The people, who asked not to be identified, said that U.S. President Donald Trump's comments Tuesday downplaying the urgency of a deal shouldn't be understood to mean the talks were stalling, as he was speaking off the cuff. Recent U.S. legislation seeking to sanction Chinese officials over human-rights issues in Hong Kong and Xinjiang are unlikely to impact the talks, one person familiar with Beijing's thinking said. U.S. negotiators expect a phase-one deal with China to be completed before American tariffs are set to rise on Dec. 15, the people said. Outstanding issues in the talks include how to guarantee China's purchases of U.S. agricultural goods and exactly which duties to roll back, they added.' 'French exporters from the vineyards of Champagne to Chanel workshops are looking at their supply chains as a tariff dispute between the U.S. and France flares up. The magnitude of the proposed 100% tariffs on $2.4 billion in exports threatens to bite a luxury-goods industry that seemed relatively insulated from trade tensions' [Wall Street Journal[3]]. 'The dispute is rooted in questions over taxation of digital services from big tech companies Shifting their specialized production would be hard for many of the brands. Still, conglomerate LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has three U.S. workshops and others outside France that could take on production to avoid the levies.' \u2022 See 'President Trump and Bernard Arnault of LVMH to Open New Louis Vuitton Factory in Texas[4].' 'Forget the paper trail \u2014 blockchain set to shake up trade finance' [Financial Times[5]]. 'On average, a cross-border transaction requires the exchange of 36 documents and 240 copies, says Kerstin Braun, president of Stenn Group, which provides trade finance. By 2050, experts suggest blockchain could provide a digital record of transactions. This would streamline the paper trail and improve transparency between parties, allowing the introduction of practices such as 'dynamic factoring', where interest rates change as goods approach their final destination.' \u2022And then we could speculate on dynamic factoring! Anyhow, 2050? Politics 'But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?' -James Madison, Federalist 51 'They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.' -Frank Herbert, DuneHere is a second counter for the Iowa Caucus, which is obviously just around the corner: * * *2020Alert reader dk (not to be confused with DK) is in the process of developing the following interactive chart.  Here is (are) the latest Dem Primary Polling as of 12/4/2019, 12:00 PM EST. Biden leads, Sanders strong second, Warren five points back (!), Buttigeig trailing. The tiny YouGov poll follows big fat Morning Consult. This pattern seems temporarily stable. On to the next debate, and Iowa:Here is the latest, as of 12/4/2019, 12:00 PM EST:Changes: Harris out, Bloomberg in. Also, we can now show events (e.g., debate #3). UPDATE I think we have to track the polls because so much of the horse-race coverage is generated by them; and at least with these charts we're insulating ourselves against getting excited about any one poll. That said, we should remember that the polling in 2016, as it turned out, was more about narrative than about sampling, and that this year is, if anything, even more so. In fact, one is entitled to ask, with the latest Buttigieg boomlet (bubble? (bezzle?)) which came first: The narrative, or the poll? One hears of push polling, to be sure, but not of collective push polling by herding pollsters. We should also worry about state polls with very small sample sizes and big gaps in coverage. And that's before we get to the issues with cellphones (as well as whether voters in very small, very early states game their answers). So we are indeed following a horse-race, but the horses don't stay in their lanes, some of the horses are not in it to win but to interfere with the others, the track is very muddy, and the mud has splattered our binoculars, such that it's very hard to see what's going on from the stands. Also, the track owners are crooked and the stewards are on the take. Everything's fine. I think dk has started a really neat project, and in the near future we'll seek your feedback (within reason) for the tool 'live.'* * *Biden (D)(1): 'Biden says Buttigieg 'stole' his healthcare plan' [Reuters[6]] \u2022 Two rats fighting over the same stale slice of pizza.  Biden (D)(2): Classy: Per Biden pool, one of the event co-hosts for the Manhattan fundraiser Biden attended at the home of a prominent art dealer joked 'Don't touch the Rothko!'  Except I imagine it was probably not a joke because it was a real Rothko. \u2014 Lissandra Villa (@LissandraVilla) December 4, 2019[7]I'm not much of a Rothko fan, but even I wouldn't want Biden's latest gaffe to be putting an elbow through a large and expensive painting. UPDATE Bloomberg (D)(1): ' In Appeal to Hard Left, Bloomberg Praises Chinese Communism' [Eric Levitz, New York Magazine[8]]. The editor who wrote that headline needs to be spoken to. The 'hard left'? Who, exactly? Bob Avakian? Wu mao tankies? Levitz himself: 'it is remarkable how much the patron saint of neoliberal paternalism's views on China overlap with those of 'tankie' Twitter. It's hard to imagine that a figure like Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could have argued that Xi is not a dictator \u2014 and that the Chinese Communist Party is accountable to majoritarian opinion \u2014 without suffering broad bipartisan condemnation. Yet Bloomberg's remarks in September prompted few calumnious columns on the authoritarianism of the anti-populist center[9]. Which is unfortunate, since the U.S. business community's interests in Beijing make this political tendency a genuine threat[10] Donald Trump has tried to paint his Democratic opponents as cosseted coastal elites who are in bed with China, exert undue influence over the mainstream media, and want to tell working-class Americans how to live[11] [and die. -lambert]. If Democrats somehow nominate Bloomberg, Trump's ideal foil will be made of money instead of straw[12].'  Buttigieg (D)(1): 'What's Really Behind Pete Buttigieg's Lack Of Support Among Black Voters?' [FiveThirtyEight[13]]. \u2022This looks to me like a long list of rationalizations for Buttigieg's black support, which in my view boil down to (a) charitably, a tin ear for black concerns and worldview, and (b) bad and/or painful policy in the South Bend with the police, housing, and now desegration. 'These people all talk to each other,' you know. As for example: So I quote tweeted a video of Mayor Pete making a Birther joke in 2018. One of the defenses was that the video was taken out of context but here is a video of him making a different Birther joke for giggles in 2017.  Here's the full video (joke @ 31:05)<url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/y4ySrTqPB4\">https://t.co/y4ySrTqPB4</url>[14] \u2014 Zerlina Maxwell (@ZerlinaMaxwell) December 3, 2019[15]Buttigieg (D)(2): 'Pete Buttigieg's Willful Illusion' [New York Magazine[16]]. 'During a campaign stop in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Buttigieg admitted to Reverend William Barber that he'd underestimated how badly segregated schools still were in South Bend. 'I have to confess that I was slow to realize \u2014 I worked for years under the illusion that our schools in my city were integrated,' Buttigieg said. 'Because they had to be, because of a court order.'. For Buttigieg, knowing that segregation was still a problem wasn't just a matter of easily-ascertainable testimony provided in local newspapers and by any black parent whose child attended a local school. It was the subject of one of the city's longest-running civil-rights mandates, and thus an odd thing for its mayor to be unaware of, even if the schools weren't under his immediate purview. [A]s he spins his proclaimed ignorance into a self-deprecating campaign-trail story about personal growth, he's mystified the issue further by locating the problem far afield \u2014 in segregation patterns in the surrounding county; in desegregation processes he didn't realize were ongoing, despite their decades of continuous implementation.' \u2022 For years! (Does anybody know if the road to the South Bend airport passes through an obviously segregated neighborhood?) Sanders (D)(1): 'The case for Bernie Sanders' [Ryan Cooper, The Week[17]]. 'This brings me finally to theories of change. Either Sanders' or Warren's full agenda would be non-starters in the current Congress, and probably not much more likely after 2020 if current trends hold. Sanders argues that he can upturn the political landscape by activating the enormous population of disaffected non-voters, who are disproportionately non-white, young, and less educated, both to elect new representatives and senators and pressure existing ones. (And sure enough, his base of support is more rooted in these groups[18] than any other candidate.) This is the formula he followed as mayor of Burlington, which was a smashing success[19], though at an obviously far smaller scale. To be sure, this is a pretty optimistic idea. But it's also the only strategy even proposed that would change the political system fast enough to deal with the multiple crises bedeviling the United States \u2014 above all climate change.'  Sanders (D)(2): Good crowd at Morehouse: [embedded content] It's an hour long. No doubt other campaigns are mining it for oppo as we speak. Warren (D)(1): 'Some Elizabeth Warren backers urge the 'plans' candidate to get more personal' [Boston Globe[20]]. 'As her standing in the polls slipped, Warren took the unusual step of shaking things up this week. At two campaign events in Iowa, she chopped her policy-dense stump speech by more than half and answered four times as many questions from voters than usual, allowing for more unplanned moments of levity and emotion.' And:Warren supporters in Iowa were delighted by a more personal exchange that unfolded Sunday in a windowless gymnasium in Marion, when a young voter with tears in her eyes asked Warren if there was a time when she was not accepted by someone she looked up to. Warren, who generally launches into her answers with an expression of joy ('Oh, that's fabulous!') and a policy prescription, gripped the microphone and paused to steady herself. 'My mother and I had very different views of how to build a future. She wanted me to marry well and I really tried and it just didn't work out,' Warren said, her voice seeming to [(!!)] break as she described calling her mother to tell her about her divorce in 1978. 'I heard the disappointment in her voice, I knew how she felt about it, but I also know it was the right thing to do,' Warren said. Then Warren and the voter embraced. As the video went viral, Warren's supporters hoped it signaled a new willingness by the candidate to move away from dense policy in favor of more humanizing exchanges that could help her with her next challenge: Getting more voters to like her enough to vote for her, even if they do not always agree with her. Lots to ponder here. First, note the lack of agency in 'the video went viral.' Warren personally tweeted it out! Second, Sanders embraces people on the trail too, generally after they've told some horror story about our horrific health care system. Emotion and policy are not in contradiction, as this article implies. Third, 'likeability.' Come on, man. Fourth, this is Warren's home town paper. Are we looking at staff panic, or jitters? (Again, how on earth could a competent staff have allowed Warren to tweet out her deeply sincere video personally, instead of having it spontaneously appear from a supporter? Is their online presence that weak?) UPDATE Yang (D)(1): 'Andrew Yang's Staff Pulls Him Back From Spraying Whipped Cream Into Mouths of Kneeling Supporters' [Rolling Stone[21]]. \u2022Oh.* * *'Democrats value diversity, but the presidential field is increasingly white' [Los Angeles Times[22]]. ''No matter your candidate, you have to recognize that going from the most diverse field ever in January to a potentially all-white debate stage in December is catastrophic,' said Leah Greenberg, co-founder of Indivisible, a Democratic activist group. 'The implicit racism and sexism of 'electability' is deeply damaging to democracy.'' \u2022 Well This seems to be the line taken by the Harris campaign. To me, it looks like the Clintonites in Harris's campaign refusing to take responsibility for a loss. As usual.Realignment and Legitimacy'The Old Jewish World: From Leftists to Neocons toBernie Sanders' [Yasha Levine, Immigrants as a Weapon[23]]. 'Thinking back to my time [in liberal Bay Area circles] through the 1990s, I now realize that the general vibe of the Jewish-American community was very aggressively PMC \u2014 full of mildly apologetic Zionism, liberal interventionism, progressive neoliberalism. Everyone was either a corporate lawyer, a doctor, or worked in finance. As a fresh-off-the-Boeing immigrant with no historical roots here, I had no clue that another type of Jewish culture had existed in America not that long ago \u2014 a culture that actually fought power rather than accept establishment and big business dogma. I can't recall this history being taught in my Sherith Israel Jewish Sunday school classes. Or maybe it was taught but quickly and superficially, because it never lodged in my memory. And, anyway, why would my school focus on this history? For a totally integrated neoliberal Jewish community, that old Jewish leftwing world must have seemed quaint and kinda embarrassing \u2014 an anachronism that had no relevance to an America that had just triumphed over communism and socialism Actuallywhile writing this I just now realized there is another big echo of this failed leftwing Jewish world: Bernie Sanders. Guess that's why PMC Jewish-Americans hate him so much.' \u2022 Hah. 'Stacey Abrams Hires Palast Investigations Team for Massive Federal Suit to Restore Voting Rights' [Greg Palast[24]]. 'Stacey Abrams' non-profit Fair Fight has retained the Palast Investigations team experts to provide court testimony, based on our six years of investigation, in Fair Fight's federal law suit to overturn Georgia's massive, racially biased purge of voters.' \u2022 Good move by Abrams.

Shipping: 'The maritime world's big new clean-air deadline is arriving with clouds on the horizon. Authorities in Greece want the rule requiring a steep cutback in sulfur emissions to be pushed back [T]he opposition is significant because Greece is the world's biggest ship-owning nation, and because it raises doubts about the industry's ability to meet other ambitious targets in coming years' [Wall Street Journal[29]]. 'Shipping companies have taken different paths to cut sulfur emissions, with some opting for exhaust-cleaning scrubbers and others banking on new, more expensive fuel. Pushing back enforcement will leave carriers that acted to meet the deadline shouldering the cost burden and suggest that future goals could be more malleable.' \u2022 Ugh. Shipping: 'Swift confirms driver leader instructed truckers to drive in inclement weather' [Freight Waves[30]]. 'Some truck drivers for Swift Transportation, a unit of Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE: KNX), said they received messages via their onboard computer messaging systems around 7 a.m. Dec. 2 instructing them to chain up and drive in inclement weather to get their loads delivered on time.  Big Ag: 'Poor Potato Crops Could Lead to a North American French Fry Shortage' [Smithsonian[31]]. 'The trouble started in October, when cold and wet conditions left potato growing regions covered in frost. Farmers in Alberta and Ohio were able to salvage and store some of their crops, but farmers in other areas, like Manitoba, North Dakota and Minnesota, had no choice but to give up on their beleaguered potatoes. Back in November, the United States Department of Agriculture predicted[32] that production outputs from the country's top nine potato producing states will fall 6.1 percent in 2019. Crops were down three percent in the autumn season alone, which, according to the United Potato Growers of Canada[33], 'is one of the lowest crops on record.'' The Bezzle: 'Den Automation raised millions to 'reinvent' the light switch. Now it's lights out for startup' [The Register[34]]. 'Den Automation, the once-promising UK smart home startup that raised nearly 4.5m via equity crowdfunding and boasted former Amstrad chief Bob Watkins as CEO, has agreed to go into liquidation Den Automation was founded in 2014 by Yasser Khattak, a 17-year-old wunderkind from Maidstone, Kent, who came up with the idea for the business while studying for his A Levels. Khattak subsequently dropped out to focus on the business full time. The concept behind Den Automation was simple. It built 'smart' light switches and wall sockets that were visually indistinguishable from their 'dumb' equivalents and could be installed by a layman, rather than a trained electrician. Part of the problem is that hardware is well hard. Bringing any kind of physical product to market is difficult, as manufacturers have to wrestle with supply chain and certification issue. Den Automation was no exception. As the product neared its promised release date, it was beset with repeated delays. One delay, which added more than eight weeks to the company's delivery schedule, was to address a flaw that could potentially result in a fire hazard.' \u2022 Oops. But wait, there's more: 'After six uneventful months, things started to go sour. On 5 October, the company's servers were switched off without warning. This rendered all previously sold switches and sockets useless.' \u2022 The machine stops[35].* * *Today's Fear ...eed Index: 67 Greed (previous close: 63 Extreme Greed) [CNN[36]].

Bit of a rebound (toward Greed).The Biosphere 'The Hidden History of American Anti-Car Protests' [City Lab[37]]. 'But all over America in the 1950s and 1960s, residents, particularly women, organized demonstrations against car traffic\u2014and their street protests often closely resembled the Dutch Stop de kindermoord protests that would come in the 1970s. They demanded slower driving, usually seeking stop signs, streetlights, or crossing guards. Some demanded pedestrian over- or underpasses. Most such demonstrations were in dense residential districts of large cities, but many occurred in small cities, suburbs, and towns. Though white women predominated in many or most such demonstrations, black and Hispanic people organized some and participated in many. Men participated too, though generally as a small minority of the total. The decline of the protests signaled the now-preferred path to traffic safety: parental chauffeuring and the abandonment of children's independent mobility. Many demonstrations\u2014particularly the biggest ones\u2014were triggered by the injury or death of a child.' \u2022 So, all those bikes in the Netherlands. Came from U.S. protests!  'The impact of high ambient temperatures on delivery timing and gestational lengths' [Nature[38]]. 'Evidence suggests that heat exposure increases delivery risk for pregnant women. Acceleration of childbirth leads to shorter gestation, which has been linked to later health and cognitive outcomes. Evidence suggests that heat exposure increases delivery risk for pregnant women.

Montana state Rep. Kathy Kelker (D) and Sen. Jen Gross (D) acknowledged in interviews that editorials they published separately about the single-payer health proposal included language provided by John MacDonald, a lobbyist and consultant in the state who disclosed in private emails that he worked for an unnamed client. Gross said MacDonald contacted her on behalf of the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a multimillion-dollar industry group founded in 2018 and funded by hospitals, private insurers, drug companies and other private health-care firms.' \u2022The vile, loathesome, and lethal Partnership for America's Health Care Future[40] is run, let us remember, by Lauren Crawford Shaver, says Politico: a former Obama health official who is now the Partnership's executive director and runs its day-to-day operations  Oddly, or not, Politico omits Shaver's work[41] both the 2008 and 2016 Clinton campaigns. Never, ever. One might almost think liberal Democrats are why we can't have nice things.  The Carceral State 'With Prison Staff Shortage, Oklahoma Looks to Hire Teenagers as Guards' [Oklahoma Watch[42]]. 'Teenagers, fresh out of high school, could be hired to guard and oversee hardened criminals in Oklahoma's chronically overcrowded and understaffed prisons. In a little-noticed action, the Oklahoma Board of Corrections passed a set of legislative requests earlier this month that include allowing prisons to hire corrections officials as young as 18. Currently the minimum age is 20. The Department of Correction has struggled for years to attract and retain workers for the job, which now starts with a salary of just under $33,000 a year.' \u2022 Let it never be said there are no jobs! The 420 'Feds clarify it's OK for banks to serve hemp companies; guidance could ease transactions for hundreds of Nevada hemp growers' [Nevada Independent[43]]. 'Federal regulators say banks should treat authorized hemp businesses the same as other legal companies, drawing cheers from Nevada cultivators who have faced strict scrutiny in their financial transactions because hemp's close cousin, marijuana, remains illegal at the federal level. Hemp is a variety of the cannabis plant used to create everything from textiles and paper to dietary supplements and CBD oil, but that unlike marijuana used as a drug, doesn't contain enough of the psychoactive substance THC to get a person high. It was legalized through the federal government's 2018 Farm Bill, but banks encountering hemp customers have continued to follow the protocols they use for marijuana companies, including reporting their activity to the federal government through suspicious activity reports (SARs) even if state law makes marijuana legal.' \u2022Hemp not being the same as marijuana. So modified rapture. Thanksgiving Post Mortem They get letters: So last week for Thanksgiving I ran a headline saying 'Turducken Is Performative,' paraphrasing @kimseverson[44]. Over the weekend I got an email from JUDITH BUTLER pic.twitter.com/hgt9AYvM3y[45]; \u2014 Spencer BokatLindell (@bokatlindell) December 2, 2019[46]'Performative' has indeed come to mean ersatz, contra Butler, because politically empowered professional symbol manipulators have indeed confused words and deeds ('shifting the Overton Window'?).Groves of Academe 'The Growing Partisan Divide in Views of Higher Education' [Pew Research Center[47]]. 'A new Pew Research Center survey finds that only half of American adults think colleges and universities are having a positive effect on the way things are going in the country these days. About four-in-ten (38%) say they are having a negative impact - up from 26% in 2012. The share of Americans saying colleges and universities have a negative effect has increased by 12 percentage points since 2012. The increase in negative views has come almost entirely from Republicans and independents who lean Republican.' Class Warfare 'Modern Slavery' [Council on Foreign Relations[48]]. 'Slavery, long banned and universally condemned, persists in many corners of the world, victimizing tens of millions of people.' \u2022 Lots of good data here, including definitions of various kinds of slavery (e.g., bonded labor), but presented in a horrid mobile- and swipe-friendly format that is very hard to read on a productivity tool, like a laptop or desktop. News of the Wired 'Towards a comparative science of emotion: Affect and consciousness in humans and animals' [Science Direct[49]]. 'In posing questions about conscious affect in animals, much (though not all) work starts with the human case, where understanding is facilitated by subjects' emotional reports (as well as the informal introspection the researcher employs in interpreting such reports). The human models are then used to identify candidate criteria for conscious emotion, which can be applied to observations of brain, behaviour, and physiology in different animal species.' \u2022 That's the best nugget I can find in this review of the literature.  'A Genetic Model of the Connectome' [Neuron[50]]. From the abstract: 'The connectomes of organisms of the same species show remarkable architectural and often local wiring similarity, raising the question: where and how is neuronal connectivity encoded?' \u2022Beyond the first sentence, I get a little lost, but word of the day: Connectome. 'Trailblazing Star Trek Writer D.C. Fontana Dies at 80: 'She Was a Pioneer'' [MSN[51]]. 'Not only was Fontana responsible for creating much of Star Trek canon, she also 'helped blaze a trail for female writers in sci-fi television,' the official website said in its obituary. 'Fontana's credits to Star Trek cannot be understated, both as a writer of great stories and as a trailblazer for other women.'' \u2022 Lots of good detail here. 'The Dead ...mpany Edition' [Why is this interesting?[52]]. 'John Mayer, he of the voluminous Instagram comments, has been sharing the stage with a unit comprised of three of the original members of the Grateful Dead (Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart), as well as a handful of other sidemen What's fascinating about this particular incarnation of the Dead is that after any number of attempts to fill Jerry Garcia's shoes, this one is sticking. From Furthur to the Other Ones, and Phil Lesh and Friends to the Fare Thee Well Shows in Chicago with Trey Anastasio, the other post-Garcia line-ups paid service to the music but did not inhabit it as this current grouping does. The root of the Grateful Dead has always been an all-hands on deck allegiance to the great God of improvisation, and Mayer's managed to become the straw that stirs the drink in this latter-day configuration. Mayer's blues idiom is one of the reasons the band sounds fresh, as the other stand-ins for Garcia came from a rock and roll background where Mayer, for all of his flaws, is steeped in the blues, like original vocalist McKernan. Something about it works particularly well with the band's signature blend of psychedelia, country, and improvisation breathes new life into each song in ways both surprising and uniquely satisfying By recreating the psychic improvisational synergy of the earliest Dead shows with this line-up, the love affair between audience and band has been rekindled and while there are criticisms that the band is slow, their ability to dive into the layered architectural nature of the music is at this point revered.' \u2022As a former Deadhead, I am here for the focus on improvisation, while questioning whether any unit without Phil Lesh can be called an 'incarnation of the Dead.'* * *Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, with (a) links, and even better (b) sources I should curate regularly, (c) how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal, and (d) to find out how to send me images of plants.

About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Of course, this was not its intention. The roster was compiled at the request of the UN Human Rights Council. This is a body in which countries whose idea of human rights is gender-neutral torture and equal-opportunity ballot-rigging get together and pass reams of vexatious resolutions against Israel.The BDS movement's economic warfare against the Jewish state has had little success but that's not the point: a UN body is tacitly legitimizing its agenda and even doing the research for it. </p><p>What OHCHR's list is about is the UN's institutional hostility towards Israel and support for \"de-judaizing\" Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria.Jerusalem is Israel's capital; before that it was the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. However hard the UN strives to erase the Jewish character of the city, its historical record isn't going anywhere. When Israel captured Judea and Samaria in 1967, they did so not from any state called Palestine (no such state has ever existed), but from Jordan, whose annexation was almost universally unrecognized - it was an illegal occupation - and prior to this these lands had been part of Mandatory Palestine.Mandatory Palestine was created by the League of Nations to \"secure the establishment of the Jewish national home.\" The Israelis have many innovations to their name, but perhaps their greatest feat is being the first nation-state in history to \"illegally occupy\" their own territory.The people the UN harms when it works to isolate and delegitimize Israel are the Palestinians. It tells them that their long, painful campaign of national self-harm is just and holds out false hope that it will one day triumph. It won't.The priority of anyone who professes to be pro-Palestinian should be convincing the Palestinians to recognize that Israel is here to stay and, on that basis, finally accept offers of peace and statehood. The Australian Editorial: A Brazen Anti-Semitic \"Blacklist\"[2] The UN Human Rights Council's \"blacklist\" of 112 international and local companies operating in the territories is a shameful attempt to strike a blow against the Middle East's only functioning democracy and upholder of the rule of law and religious freedom. No wonder Australia/Israel ...wish Affairs Council executive director Colin Rubenstein described publication of the blacklist as \"a witch-hunt that reminds us of Nazi-era boycotts of the Jewish people.\" There is no precedent for any UN body taking similar action over a disputed territory, and no basis in international law for it to do so.As Dr. Rubenstein pointed out, it is not in breach of international law for the 112 companies to operate in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. \"They are legitimate businesses providing goods and services...they are not breaking any international laws.\" Australia must waste no opportunity to condemn and counter the council's brazen hypocrisy and the sinister witch-hunt it has embarked on. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jpost.com/HttpHandlers/ShowImage.ashx?id=383253...98...28\">https://www.jpost.com/HttpHandlers/ShowImage.ashx?id=383253...98...28</url> Against (Honest Discussions of) Anti-Semitism[3] Last October, protesters from the anti-Israel group, Students for Justice in Palestine, disrupted a panel on anti-Semitism hosted by Bard's Hannah Arendt Center. The disruptors thought it appropriate to single out an all-Jewish panel focused on hatred of Jews to vent their spleen at Israel. According to Batya Ungar Sargon of the Forward, who served on the panel, the protesters were even applauded by some of the invited conference attendees. These 'vaunted intellectuals, flown in from across the country to discuss racism, were commending a display of racism against Jews.'Racism against Jews? Perish the thought, replied distinguished defenders of the protest. These students weren't saying that the Jews, alone among peoples, should be hounded when they discuss threats to their safety. No, they were there mainly to protest the distinguished scholar of Yiddish literature and Jewish history, Ruth Wisse, who is, after all, some kind of conservative. Moreover, Wisse had made an imprecise remark about the exploitation of Palestinian suffering decades ago, and that, her critics maintain, suffices as evidence of anti-Palestinian racism. Finally, Wisse's talk on the panel focused on left-wing anti-Semitism, so why shouldn't Students for Justice in Palestine protest? Case closed. spies of no country adYes, as Ungar-Sargon reported, one of the protesters said that the Israel issue is inextricably bound to the question of anti-Semitism\u2014that is, the protest could properly have taken place against any panel on anti-Semitism. Of course, the pro-Palestinian left doesn't just go around targeting anti-Semitism panels. Don't be ridiculous!Not so. Last Thursday, Deborah Lipstadt, gave a talk on anti-Semitism at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. Lipstadt, a distinguished scholar of modern Jewish history and author of the 2019 book, Antisemitism: Here and Now, is not a conservative. Even the unjust haven't gotten around to accusing her of anti-Palestinian racism, except insofar as they consider all Zionists racists. And Lipstadt, though she attends to left-wing anti-Semitism, doesn't single it out. She is perhaps best known for combatting right-wing Holocaust deniers.So the left\u2014to be fair, just a few\u2014turned up to protest.JCPA: The Only Way to Fight Anti-Semitism Is through Policy Action, Not with Lip Service[4] Anti-Semitism turns dangerous when it becomes the organizing principle of a society, which occurred during the last century under Nazism and Communism. Anti-Semitism was a basic domineering system of thought for both, binding together the cultural and social mosaics by catering to the general mood of their populaces. Anti-Semitism becomes dangerous when it not only solidifies the theoretical foundations of a political system but also paves a political path.This is why today's anti-Semitism, with its increase in murderous attacks and all kinds of despicable expressions, has become politically significant. Its constant bias against the Jewish People (and thereby Zionism), Israel's existence, self-defense, policies, as well as Israel's image, has progressively intersected with institutions of the current systems of power. It has entered into the mindset of many on the Right and the Left, who live under the same roof of 'intersectionality,' i.e., those feeling oppressed by myriad sources and who harbor social frustration in diverse forms. The blame attributed to the Jewish people and, therefore, to Zionism is tied to the social disapproval of the latter, like the indispensable tail of a kite high in the wind. Moreover, the continuous promotion of widespread institutional anti-Semitism, particularly at the EU and UN, has given it political credibility.For example, the debate about ethnic differences, gender, culture, etc., are all commingled. A feminist or a university professor, or a member of the LGBT community, a Hollywood director, or a member of a child-defending NGO, attacks Israel for reasons that can vary from pink-washing, women oppressed by the occupation, dead Palestinian children, White Supremacy, to neo-colonialism. There are infinite themes available. This commingling of poisonous biases not only animates but also strengthens such thinking. In this manner, the fuming claimant becomes a harmonious part of the current, pacifist, or anti-nationalist systems of thought. Along with the typical anti-Semitic stereotypes, the State of Israel is repeatedly represented as warmongering, colonial, and racist in nature; therefore, Judaism, which generated Israel, is responsible for this distorted Weltanschauung (world view). The circle of anti-Semitism closes in on the simple idea that Judaism includes the entire Jewish people.Today, the most important institutions postulate this line of thinking even if not explicitly. The parents of contemporary anti-Semitism, together with universities, publishing houses, and movie companies, are the same who appear in conferences, institutions, synagogues, and even in Israel to proclaim their campaigns against anti-Semitism. Meanwhile, not a single significant institution such as the EU or the UN, which, under the pretense of humanitarian or international authorities, promotes an agenda disapproving of Israel and thereby the Jewish people.Why Young Europeans Can't Understand Israeli Settlers[5] A core values conflict Without necessarily trying to broadcast it, the Jewish state is a Biblical throwback and an ethnic-nationalist state \u2014 and therefore stands for Bible and God, nationalism and family, self-determination and self-defense. Even the majority of the Israeli left espouses most of these core values.Europe, on the other hand, is post-God, post-nationalism, post-family, and post-Holocaust \u2014 and is therefore understandably at odds with the very concept of Israel.Moreover, Europe is not just Europe. It is a mindset that can be found across the ocean in places like The New York Times, and on many American college campuses. For them, the Bible is no rationale at all, nationalism is repugnant, and Israel is the aggressor, not the victim.The enemies of Israel seek to exploit and enhance this Euro-mindset by creating an atmosphere where the pillars of Israel are further undermined. According to their teachings, Israel cannot base its claims on an ancient book, Israeli nationalism is nothing but repressive colonialism, and claims of the Holocaust are grossly exaggerated \u2014 recognizable rhetoric to young Europeans.Is dialogue possible? Many Israelis and Israel proponents have identified some of these landmines and have tried to create language to bridge the gaps. Therefore the Jewish state's image has gone through 'nation-branding' cycles where Israel has been recast as the startup nation, gay capital of the Middle East and bikini-clad night-life destination. But these do little to mask Israel's Biblical and nationalistic character, and neither do they succeed in undoing the damage caused by the exploiters of the post-God, post-national Euro-mindset.Sadly, the intellectual gaps between today's Europe and Israel are unbridgeable \u2014 and there is not much to do about it. However, as the adage goes, a conservative is just a liberal who has been mugged. While Europe's winds are to the left today, they are liable to swing back to the right in the future. Such is the case with the United Kingdom's Brexit for example, or the resurgent nationalism of Eastern Europe.Unlike Europe's current whim, Israel's nationalism, Biblical heritage and yearning for self-defense are age-old truths that will eventually overcome the intellectual vicissitudes of today. That is what I told my young German journalist guests. Did they like hearing it? Not exactly. But at least they got a straight answer and were no longer dumbfounded as to why they can't understand why Jews fight to live in Judea.Questions Lawmakers Should Ask CMEP Leader Mae Cannon[6] Founded in 1984, Churches for Middle East Peace (CMEP) is a lobby organization supported by approximately 30 churches and church-related organizations in the United States.The organization, which works to influence Congress, the White House, and the State Department regarding American foreign policy in the Middle East, sends alerts to its supporters who in turn are asked to contact government officials about their concerns.The churches that support CMEP, particularly mainline Protestant churches, sometimes broadcast these alerts to their members. In its messaging about the Arab-Israeli conflict, CMEP mainlytargets Israel and the U.S. with criticism and demands while remaining largely silent about the misdeeds of the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip.With its one-sided testimony about the conflict, CMEP has served as a de facto replacement for the PLO's diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. that was shut down by the Trump Administration in 2018. CMEP and the Palestinian Authority are on the same page when it comes to condemning the Trump Administration's Peace to Prosperity Peace plan put forth in late January. When CMEP's executive director Rev. Mae Cannon, Ph.D, issued a statement condemning the plan, the Palestinian Authority posted it on its website.During a recent conference call organized by the Global Immersion Project, another so-called 'peace' organization, Cannon said that her organization would call on its supporters to declare that they are opposed to the Trump peace plan. On its website, CMEP declared that the 'inevitable result' of the plan 'will be more human rights abuses, trauma, and violence.' With statements like this, CMEP is giving the Palestinian Authority the cover it needs to refuse to negotiate a final settlement, something it has failed to do in good faith for years.It's a strange thing to see from an organization led by a 'peace' activist who declared in 2018, 'Throwing mud at peace negotiations does not bring peace closer. It just adds yet more burdens to negotiate for peace, and more pretext for those opposed to peace.'Who is throwing mud now?Does Churches for Middle East Peace Leader Really Want Peace?[7] Earlier this month, Mae Cannon, executive director of Churches for Middle East Peace (CMEP), an anti-Israel propaganda organization supported by mainline Protestant churches in the United States, told supporters that sometime in the next few days, her organization was going to issue an 'action alert.'The alert would tell CMEP supporters to express their opposition to the 'Peace to Prosperity' proposal put forth by the Trump administration on January 28, 2020. Cannon made this declaration during a February 5, 2020 podcast organized by Jer Swigart from the Global Immersion Project, another so-called 'peace' organization \u2014 which, like CMEP, brings activists to the Holy Land, who then agitate against Israel when they get home, all under the guise of peace.'This is a critical moment for the church in terms of the way we respond to this moment in world history,' Cannon said during the podcast. 'I've been crying a lot about this deal.'Prior to the podcast, Cannon issued a statement condemning the Trump plan because it suggested that a number of villages south of Haifa become part of the future Palestinian state. Israeli Arabs, who have regularly complained about their minority status in Israel, have made it perfectly clear that they do not wish to become part of the Arab majority in a state run by the Palestinian Authority. Cannon declared that the proposal to shift these villages to the Palestinian state is 'meant to maximize the amount of land under Israeli control while minimizing the number of Palestinians living on the land.'With her condemnation of the proposal to transfer the 'triangle' villages into the future state of Palestine, Cannon implicitly acknowledged something she doesn't want to admit publicly \u2014 no one in their right mind would want to live in a future state of Palestine, because the people who would likely govern the country are corrupt, violent, authoritarian, and inept. But this hasn't stopped CMEP and so many other Christian 'peacemakers' from carrying water for unaccountable Palestinian elites, who use anti-Israel sentiment to distract rank-and-file Palestinians from their thieving ways.In her cri de coeur, which was posted on the Palestinian Authority's website, Cannon declared, 'The plan presented by President Trump and further fleshed out by Prime Minister Netanyahu is nothing less than a recipe for endless oppression and injustice.'Jewish leader fundraises for candidate who said 'Israeli lobby' controls GOP[8] Norm Coleman, the chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition and a former senator from Minnesota, is fundraising for a candidate for Senate in the state who once said the GOP is 'controlled' by the 'Israeli lobby.'Coleman will host a February 27 fund-raiser for Jason Lewis in Washington. Lewis, a congressman from Minnesota from 2017-2019, hopes to win the GOP primary to face off against incumbent Democratic Senator Tina Smith.CNN's KFile last year uncovered audio from a talk radio show Lewis hosted in 2013 in which he discussed the opposition among some in the pro-Israel community to former president Barack Obama's nominee for defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, a former GOP senator from Nebraska who once referred disparagingly to the 'Israel lobby.'Lewis on the radio show alleged that dual Israeli-American citizens in Congress and in government influenced Israel policy. He named John Bolton, then a former UN ambassador, among them, although Bolton is neither a citizen of Israel or Jewish.'They do have, they do control of the Republican Party right now,' Lewis said. 'The Republican Party is essentially a neo-conservative party that believes in unending support for Israel. A blind loyalty towards Israel is the linchpin of being a good Republican. And when you get those sort of dual loyalties, what happens if it's not in America's best interest?'Lewis also referred to a 'very strong American Jewish lobby' to explain US support for Israel but said he does not see that 'as a negative.' Bernie Articulates Nightmare Middle East Vision: US Must Support Hamas, Tehran[9] Below, I've enclosed a transcript of Senator Bernie Sanders' February 18 appearance on CNN's Presidential Town Hall. It is a fine example of leftist thinking about reality in the Middle East that is so mired in the 1970s it would take a force as big as Yoko Ono, perhaps, to break it up. Point by point, Sanders reveals his deep ignorance about a region which has undergone breathtaking changes over the past decade - but said changes, alas, have made no impression on Bernie's consciousness. And then there's Bernie's old lefty line about the Jewish State's involvement in all this that goes: It all began when Israel retaliated. It's a classic.Oh, and he makes it all glide good into the oven on a thick shortening agent he calls 'as somebody who is Jewish.'We know you're Jewish, Bernie, we just don't know why God did it to us.So, here are the full quotes, courtesy of People for Bernie, in response about a question from the child of Israeli yordim regarding US-Israel relations under the Sanders Administration. Bernie said:'To be for the Israeli people and to be for peace in the Middle East does not mean that we have to support rightwing racist governments that currently exist in Israel.'This is a repeated argument by Sanders, which is yet to be challenged: should the US withhold its support from governments it deems rightwing and racist? Is that the President Sanders doctrine? Would the Sanders administration revoke its 10-year, $38 billion military aid contract with Israel, signed by the last Democrat in the White House, whom so many of us believed was anti-Israel?Of course, it can't be done, because that particular aid package is anchored in Congressional legislation, which would take a majority in both houses to dismantle. But Bernie, right off the bat, announces his intent to go to war against the Israeli government, should it be led, once again, by PM Benjamin Netanyahu or someone like him.Good to know. The use of the term 'The Israeli people' is a well known formula to avoid using the more obvious 'The Jewish people', which Bernie clearly rejects, as he insists on universalizing his Jewish identity and denies any notion of collective solidarity with Jews as Jews as 'racist'.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/Ju8aXCU8jV\">https://t.co/Ju8aXCU8jV</url>[10] \u2014 Dr. Einat Wilf (@EinatWilf) February 19, 2020[11] Labour Party expels councillor who said 'Jewish leaders are worse than Nazis' after brief suspension[12] The Labour Party has expelled a councillor who said that 'Jewish leaders are worse than Nazis' after suspending him last month.Andy Kay, who has also referenced 'Zionists' attempts to influence our political processes' and added for good measure that those supposed efforts were 'racist', had been serving as a cabinet member for finance and governance on Darwen Council in Lancashire.Cllr Kay also wrote that 'Jewish leaders are worse than Nazis' in 2014 in a post on Facebook that was reportedly 'liked' by Kate Hollern MP, who went on to become a Labour MP and Private Parliamentary Secretary to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. She subsequently apologised.In 2018, Cllr Kay also shared an article on social media describing Labour's antisemitism crisis as a 'blatant attempt to undermine Corbyn's leadership', adding the remark about Zionists. In the comments section of that post in a discussion about the International Definition of Antisemitism, Cllr Kay also said: 'I was taught that Judaism was/is a religion, not a nation. In fact one of the tenets of Judaism prohibits the nation state but I suppose that also depends on which wing of the fantasy you believe.'Three days later, Cllr Kay reportedly shared an article that claimed that the Definition was 'designed by Israeli propagandists to aid their many mass lobby attempts' and referenced the 'largely-mythical antisemitism 'crisis' in the Labour Party,' which was described as 'one of the few tools left to ailing and desperate establishment hacks wanting to smear Corbyn and maintain UK support for Israel.'TalkRADIO fined 75,000 over George Galloway's lack of partiality in discussion of Labour antisemitism, days after the former MP spread false story of murder of Arab child[13] The radio channel, TalkRADIO, has been fined 75,000 for breaching rules on impartiality in three programmes hosted by the controversial former MP, George Galloway. Two of the programmes concerned antisemitism in the Labour Party.In assessing the breaches, Ofcom concluded that the programmes, one of which covered the poisoning of Yulia and Sergei Skripal, had 'failed to preserve due impartiality on a matter of major political controversy or a major matter of current public policy'. Ofcom observed that 'alternative viewpoints were only reflected to an extremely limited extent over the course of these programmes, each of which was three hours in duration'.Ofcom further noted that 'it was also the case that the limited viewpoints featured in the programmes which did not align with Mr Galloway's were treated in a very different way to those that did.' For example, in the programmes on antisemitism, Mr Galloway apparently described one listener who expressed a dissenting view as 'gutless coward', 'ignorant moron', and 'cowardly'. 'These statements had the effect of dismissing and denigrating listeners who held views that did not reflect Mr Galloway's,' Ofcom explained, 'and constituted a clear difference in the treatment of such views.'Ofcom found the breaches to be both serious and repeated, because the same set of rules were breached on three separate occasions over five months, and in two of the occasions in respect of the same topic.The fine comes after Mr Galloway again courted controversy by falsely suggesting that 'illegal Israeli settlers' had murdered an Arab child who was in fact tragically drowned by rainwater. At least one other broadcaster echoed the accusation. So this happened. I am sure @GeorgeGalloway[14] will love us sharing it!       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/t7tcAaqBxf\">https://t.co/t7tcAaqBxf</url>[15] cc: @TheUriGeller[16] \u2014 (((David Lange))) (@Israellycool) February 19, 2020[17] 'Palestinian' Instructor at NYU Leads Goons in Wreaking $100K Damage in NYC Subway System[18] New York City's subway system is licking its wounds and repairing some $100,000 worth of damage after a self-styled 'Palestinian' adjunct instructor from New York University led an anarchist group on a rampage through the train stations last month.The group 'Decolonize This Place' led by Amin Husain wrecked turnstiles, spray-painted messages such as 'F**k Cops,' and in general made it impossible for commuters to catch their ride home.Husain is one of the co-founders of the anarchist group, according to a report published in the New York Post.The 44-year-old NYU adjunct instructor proudly claims to be from 'Palestine,' according to the New York Post. Husain reportedly exhorted people in a Jan. 31 post on social media to 'f\u2014k sh\u2014t up,' and ultimately caused $100,000 worth of damage in city property. Thirteen arrests were also made.Husain is also a founding member of NYC Solidarity with Palestine, a group that describes itself as 'seeking to broaden the work being done on Palestine by opening up more expansive spaces of resistances.'According to the NYU website, Husain is a 'New York-based artist and organizer who works combines research, aesthetics, and action.' He is on the faculty of the university's Center for Experimental Humanities. You can't make this stuff up.

Accuses Him Of 'Mutual Assistance Arrangement With Donald Trump'[21] On Monday, billionaire leftist George Soros, seemingly panicked that President Trump might be reelected, attacked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, demanding that they be removed from their posts because Zuckerberg will not capitulate to leftists' calls for censoring or banning political ads.Writing in Financial Times, Soros accused Zuckerberg of having a 'mutual assistance arrangement' with Trump that will 'help him get re-elected.' His open letter, in which he referred to an article in Financial Times on Sunday penned by Zuckerberg, stated:Mark Zuckerberg should stop obfuscating the facts by piously arguing for government regulation ('We need more regulation of Big Tech', February 17). Mr. Zuckerberg appears to be engaged in some kind of mutual assistance arrangement with Donald Trump that will help him to get re-elected.Facebook does not need to wait for government regulations to stop accepting any political advertising in 2020 until after the elections on November 4. If there is any doubt whether an ad is political, it should err on the side of caution and refuse to publish. It is unlikely that Facebook will follow this course. Therefore, I repeat my proposal, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg should be removed from control of Facebook. (It goes without saying that I support government regulation of social media platforms.)Zuckerberg had written that he wanted to wait for regulation because he wanted a fair set of rules for everyone across the board, opining:We believe advertising is more transparent on Facebook than television, print or other online services. We publish details about political and issue ads \u2014 including who paid for them, how much was spent, and how many people were reached \u2014 in our ads library. But who decides what counts as political advertising in a democracy? If a non-profit runs an ad about immigration during an election, is it political? Who should decide \u2014 private companies, or governments?Another theme is openness. I'm glad the EU is looking at making data sharing easier, because it enables people to build things that are valuable for society. International agencies use Facebook's Data for Good program to figure out which communities need help after natural disasters, and governments use our publicly available population density maps for vaccination campaigns. Of course, you should always be able to transfer your data between services.Chaser: pic.twitter.com/VpVymSWqvY[22] \u2014 Thomas Stern (@shmarxism) February 19, 2020[23] Private Eye imagines pre-67 Palestinian sovereignty[24] An article in the latest issue of Private Eye critical of the Palestinian Authority also manages to take a brief, and entirely dishonest, swipe at Israel.The writer's claim that the new US peace plan grants Palestinians 'half the land' they had 'before the 1967 occupation' is a lie, due to the simple fact that, prior to the 1967 war, Jordan controlled the West Bank and Egypt controlled Gaza. (Before that, of course, the land was controlled by the British - and before that, the Ottomans.)Much like the maps recently being paraded by Palestinian leaders purporting to show how much of 'Palestine' their leaders have been willing to compromise, Private Eye has peddled a historical fiction, obfuscating the simple fact that there has never been - at any time in history - a sovereign Palestinian state.Indeed, PA self-rule in areas A (military and administrative) and B (administrative) in the West Bank granted by Israel since the 90s, has been the only time Palestinians have ever enjoyed real political autonomy. Further, the US plan would actually greatly increase the amount of land they control, not decrease it.We've complained to editors about this gross distortion.

'It is because of its power to adapt and deceive,' concludes director Andrew Goldberg.His new film 'Viral: Antisemitism in Four Mutations' adopts a comparative approach. It canvases the globe and examines antisemitism among the far-right fringe in America, the far-right government in Hungary, the far-left in the United Kingdom and Islamic radicals in France. 'Of its mutations, this is the story of four. It could have been 4,000,' Goldberg told The Algemeiner.The film sets out to interview antisemites, victims, politicians and commentators, among others. Goldberg was spurred a few years ago to begin making a film about antisemitism after learning about the defacement of two cemeteries in the US. 'This is a conversation that I thought we needed to have,' he said.The film opens with audio of the 911 calls in Pittsburgh during the shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in 2018. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who survived the massacre, later said, 'Many are surprised it took so long before there was a shooting at a synagogue. I think it was inevitable that something like this was going to happen.'In the film, former President Bill Clinton spoke of the promotion of racism, religious bigotry and paranoia: 'If you do it long enough, you'll pick up someone eventually crazy enough to do what was done in Pittsburgh.'The film interviews a man who conducts defense training in Pittsburgh's Jewish community.There is one scene where a local rabbi shows a prayer book where a bullet cut through the name of God. Chelsea to host antisemitism conference with Chief Rabbi, prominent politicians and leading Israeli newspaper[30] Chelsea football club intends to host a conference on antisemitism in conjunction with The Jerusalem Post newspaper, which will feature Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis and the Israeli ambassador.Other proposed speakers at the March event, which will also cover bilateral ties between the UK and Israel, include the former Labour MP Lord Mann, who now serves as the Government's independent advisor on antisemitism, as well as the parliamentary chair of Conservative Friends of Israel and senior Israeli politicians. The captain of Israel's national women's football team is also due to feature.The event is due to take place at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium, and is part of the club's 'Say No To Antisemitism' campaign, which was launched in January 2018.The club's chairman said that the event could 'further highlight the importance to tackle the rise of antisemitism we have seen across the world.'In January, Chelsea unveiled a mural dedicated to footballers who were interned in concentration camps, to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. The club has also adopted the International Definition of Antisemitism.At the unveiling of the mural, Lord Mann told football clubs to enhance their efforts to tackle antisemitism and racism in stadiums, warning that 'I have a voice and it will get more brutal if they don't.'

In the US, where advanced medical facilities are available, the survival rate stands at about 18%. In order to increase the chance of survival, a big difference can be made by how early cancer is uncovered.Body Vision technology involves minimally invasive bronchoscope navigation of the affected organ instead of the current approach of 'watchful waiting' that a lesion in the lung will disappear. The watchful waiting approach is often used today to avoid the risk of an invasive alternative: surgical or CT-guided biopsy procedures for diagnostics.The Ramat Hasharon-based company's CEO, Dorian Averbuch, has a background in mechanical engineering, but he has been working in the field of pulmonology for the past 20 years, as he explained to The Jerusalem Post.Israeli defense firm Elbit wins $670 million contract with Asia-Pacific country[34] Israeli defense firm Elbit Systems said Tuesday that it had won a contract worth some $670 million to supply defense products to an unnamed country in the Asia-Pacific region.The deal will be carried out over a 25-month period.'This significant contract award is a testament to the trust that customers place with our solutions and to the leading position we hold in the market,' Elbit CEO Bezhalel Machlis said in a statement.Elbit has disclosed over $1 billion in contracts since the start of 2020.The company has made several deals in the region in recent months.On February 10 Elbit said it had secured $136 million in contracts to provide Asia-Pacific customers with airborne laser defense systems over a four-year period.The Direct Infra-Red Counter Measure systems will equip Airbus and Boeing aircraft to counter heat-seeking ground-to-air missiles.

Insight Partners Backs Israel-Linked Cybersecurity Company SentinalOne in $200 Million Investment[35] The investment spree of New York-based venture capital and private equity firm Insight Partners continues. Insight has recently led a $200 million investment in Israel-linked cybersecurity company SentinelOne, incorporated as Sentinel Labs, one person familiar with the matter told Calcalist Tuesday.This is not Insight's first investment in the company. In June 2019, Insight led a $120 million round in the company, which brought its then-funding to $230 million. Back in June, SentinelOne did not disclose its valuation for the round, but co-founder and CEO Tomer Weingarten told Calcalist in an interview that it was nearing $1 billion. Now, this new round has given the company an estimated valuation of $1.1 billion, the person familiar with the matter said.The goal of the current investment is to support the expansion of SentinalOne's activity, with a focus on mergers and acquisitions, the person said. In a June 2019 interview, Weingarten said that the company sees itself on the side of the buyers and not as a target for acquisition. 'We are currently actively searching for companies that can expand our technological offering,' he said.According to the person, the current round is estimated to be the company's final one before attempting to go public, most likely in 2021.Founded in 2013 by Weingarten and Almog Cohen, SentinelOne develops artificial intelligence technology for identifying abnormal behavior in enterprise networks. Unlike veteran cybersecurity companies, SentinelOne's technology provides a comprehensive endpoint solution. The company employs 500 people in its offices in Tel Aviv, San Francisco, Oregon, Singapore, and Tokyo, and reports some 3,500 global customers.Other investors in SentinalOne include Sound Ventures, Samsung Venture Investment, NextEquity, Third Point Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Data Collective, UpWest Ventures, and Tiger Global.The Hawaiian Warrior Who Trains IDF Special Forces[36] Nadav Tzadok Yair is a small Hawaiian man with a fascinating life story, Mako reported on Friday. Born on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, he had been trained in the local martial art of Kapu Kuialua - double shot - since the age of nine. This tribal version of warfare, which shaped centuries of local wars between the various groups on the islands, shaped his life and destiny. In his quiet home in Kfar Tapuach, he shared his unique journey into the Jewish faith and in training IDF Special Forces - among them Blue and White politician Gabi Ashkenazi, who told reporters that Yair, 'is an expert in jungle warfare, night operations, sneak attacks and survival.' 'The IDF owns him a lot for what he taught us,' he added.Yair used to be a staunch advocate for Hawaiian independence from the US - like Bympy Kanahele and the late Internet sensation, singer Israel Kamakawiwo'ole - and was bitter over how peaceful dialog with US authorities became the mainstream choice for native people around him. Trained in warfare, he claimed to have killed 18 people before meeting an Israeli couple who was visiting the islands. They told him about Israel and he followed the sun there, embraced the Jewish faith, changed his name and became the father of six children, five boys and one girl - all of whom have Hawaiian names along their Hebrew ones.

Instagram struggled to cope with the photos being republished by others, and two days on, YouTube was still featuring images of Devins' body in search results. Business Insider identified five videos that used a photo of the crime in the thumbnail. </p><p>Together, they have racked up more than 200,000 views. A spokesperson for YouTube did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook said it was \"taking every measure to remove this content from our platforms.\" Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] Two days after the killing of an Instagram star with thousands of followers shocked the internet, YouTube has failed to remove multiple videos featuring images of her mutilated body from the platform. Bianca Devins, 17, was killed in the early hours of Sunday morning in the city of Utica, New York. Police have charged Brandon Clark, 21, with killing Devins. The incident made headlines around the world after Clark posted photos of Devins' body on his Instagram profile. Business Insider has seen the images and police have verified their authenticity. They were removed from Clark's Instagram Stories by Monday morning and some hours later, his account and his Facebook profile were deleted. But this was not before other Instagram users republished the photos.

Instagram is reportedly getting a handle on the spread of the pictures[4], while users have also assisted in scrubbing them from the social network by flooding key hashtags with images of pink clouds.[5] Instagram has also shut down accounts impersonating Clark, it said, and blocked the hashtag #yesjuliet, which was his Instagram handle.YouTube features images of Devins' body in search resultsLittle has been said about YouTube, however, where videos containing the images remained on Wednesday, two days after the story went viral.Business Insider conducted incognito YouTube searches for \"Bianca Devins\" on Tuesday and Wednesday, and found five videos featuring images of Devins' body within the top search results. Four of the videos featured the photos in the thumbnail, but not within the content of the video \u2014 a tactic that could be used to increase engagement. Together, they racked up more than 181,000 views. The fifth video features a teenage boy commenting on Devins' death. An image of the crime is contained in the thumbnail and it also flashes up on screen during the video. It has more than 60,000 views and features a warning that it may be \"inappropriate\" for some users. Some of the videos were removed after Business Insider flagged them to YouTube. A YouTube spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. It brings into sharp focus YouTube and Facebook-owned Instagram's continued failure to rid their platforms of harmful content. They have made repeated promises to improve their moderation processes, but frailties in their systems were exposed after a video of the New Zealand mosque massacre went viral in March. A Facebook spokesman said: \"Our thoughts go out to those affected by this tragic event. We are taking every measure to remove this content from our platforms. Our goal is to take action as soon as possible \u2014 there is always room for improvement. We don't want people seeing content that violates our policies.\"Devins' mother calls for a message of loveIn a new statement released to the press on Wednesday, Devins' mother said she was devastated by her daughter's death. She added that she wanted to spread Devins' message of love. \"While I could not be there to protect her from this violent end, I will now be her voice and spread the message of 'love, not violence'. Let us all pledge to share Bianca's amazing spirit to make this world a better place,\" she said.See Also: Everyone from Drake to the Jonas Brothers is posting photos where they look old \u2014 these

Good Monday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   And it is Monday February 5th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.  The bears have gone global it is an ugly start to the week for  the markets this morning we are looking at the market near the lows of the  morning, what we had been down almost 300 earlier Dow Industrials expected  to be down 250 points right out of the gate this morning.  Inflation fears  have taken a hold, interest rates moving higher, worries at a booming  economy will lead to inflation and higher rates Friday marks the biggest  one day decline for the Dow since the Brexit vote back in June of 2016, it  was down 265 points on Friday ending of the lows of recession with a 2-1/2  percent sell-off.  The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ weaker down two percent, overseas  investors took a queue from the U.S.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we have got a sell-off there as well FT 100 down 1- 1/3 percent, the CAC Quarante down 1-1/2 percent and the DAX Index down  almost one percent.  Economic data also coming out in Europe this morning  as is the case in China, we have the (INAUDIBLE) survey overnight and that  was one help to the markets in China that's why the Shanghai composite was  up overnight by three quarters of a percent but the rest of the markets in  Asia down and down sharply.  Nikkei Average in Japan hard as hit down 2-1/2  percent.  Passing the torch the Janet Yellen era has come to a close as Jay  Powell prepares for first day as Chairman of the Federal Reserve today.   The challenges that lie ahead for Powell as he takes the rein at the  Federal Reserve plus Yellen's parting shot for Wells Fargo look at this,  the Fed taking unprecedented action by slapping sanctions against the bank.   I will talk with the President and CEO of Wells Fargo this morning, Tim  Sloan will join me to react to this new strict, rare rules coming from the  Fed on Wells Fargo.  And then a Super Bowl stunner, the Eagles soaring past  the Patriots to take their first ever title.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Philadelphia Eagles, the long drought is over.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Philadelphia erupted in celebration after the victory,  thousands of fans taking to the streets in rivalry and in true Philly  fashion, got a little rowdy as well live.  We're taking it live with the  highlights from the big game, coming up and the highly anticipated halftime  show as well.  All those stories coming up this Monday morning and join me  to break it all down Fox Business Network, it's Dagen McDowell and Connell  McShane, along the Pollster and President of Manslansky and Partners, Lee  Carter.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of happening this morning.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh yes, see all these  markets fair.  So we're down 250 or so it would be interesting today.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was just -- a while I was looking down it was because I  was actually doing research on the markets and with a new Federal Reserve  Chief coming in to office that you've seen market declines when Volcker  took off as when Greenspan took off as when Bernanke as -- and even a  slight decline when Janet Yellen took office and so it's the unknown of  what is this person going to do in terms of monetary policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some people want to see as they call it like a whole vomiting  out I mean they want to see the markets sell off a lot.  I knew some  conversation this morning on trading desks (INAUDIBLE) I hope it doesn't  open down a fraction, I hope it doesn't -- you know improve by the close.   I want to see a cleanout like we saw on Friday, what do you think?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that they would rather wash out rapidly than just kind  of be this long drawn-out decline in the markets but we have gotten used to  virtually no volatility last week in the last week the Dow dropped one  percent two times, two moves of at least one percent.  We only had 10 one  percent moves in all of 2017.  So it's really incredible to low volatility  environment that we've all gotten used to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, no wonder trading has been under such pressure for the  major banks, right?  Coming up this morning, I'll talk exclusively to CEO  and President of Wells Fargo, Tim Sloan, my special guest to get reaction  to the new Federal Reserve penalties on the bank.  Basically putting a  limitation as to how big this company can get and how much growth they can  actually generate.  So timothy Sloan will react to that coming up, that  news from the fed announced 6:15 p.m. Eastern on Friday night.  </p><p>Also joining the conversation this morning Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe  one of only three members in Congress to have seen the underlying data and  the underlying content of that FISA memo and the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\"  Stuart Varney weighing in as well, you don't want to miss a moment of it.   We got a big hour coming up and kick it off right here with the top story.   President trump headed to Ohio today, he's expected to promote the tax  reform overhaul at a plant in Cincinnati while a budget battle rages on a  Capitol Hill and senators aim a to end the impasse with a dreamers bill,  Blake Burman covering the story at the White House right now with the very  latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you as well.  The president at the White House, the treasury department  they say this is the month February when workers will start to see more in  their paychecks because of the new tax bill so to that end The President  will hit the road today to continue this aggressive sales push.  Keep in  mind it's still been 47 days since they passed this in the law but he will  once again tout this new measure Cincinnati Ohio visit a manufacturer  there.  The President over the weekend tweeting out wondering why the  economy has not gotten more attention saying in the tweet, ''Great jobs  numbers and finally after many years rising wages and nobody even talks  about that.''  Meantime part of the talk here in Washington is the need to  get a spending bill passed by Thursday, it does not appear as if congress  has the stomach again forget another shutdown.  So one of the questions  remains what might happen with an immigration deal?  One of the  spokespersons over here at the White House Hogan Gidley saying over the  weekend that there should be a compromise.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  It is rationale and  reasonable, it's 70 percent issue to fix DACA, it's a 70 percent issue for  the American people to get border security and chain migration.  So there  is no reason we should not come to a deal.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Later today Senator John McCain a Republican of course and Chris  Coons his Democratic colleague will introduce some new legislation that  would include protection for Dreamers also with some measures Maria along  the border.  This now falls well short of what President Trump has been  calling for -- so we will see if this receives some sort of frosty support  or really a lack of support from conservatives here in Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We are going to watch that, I think they're being - - he is putting the Democrats in a box offering them three times what they  actually wanted for the Dreamers Blake.  And if they say no to this, you  have to question if they actually want a deal.  </p><p>BURMAN:  And that is part of the line now from Republicans all across  Washington is they say look it is three times what President Obama had gave  or had offered during his administration.  So why would you walk away from  protecting some 1.8 million people and The President has said he put this  out there to see if Democrats really want a deal or not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  All right.  We will keep following that, Blake.   Thank you so much.  Joining me right now is the Chairman of the House  Homeland Security Cybersecurity Committee, Member of the House Judiciary  and Ethics Committee, it's Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas.   Congressman, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, (R) TEXAS:  You bet.  Hi Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to get to the FISA memo because I know that you are only  one of three members that actually have seen the underlying data but let me  just kick off where we just ended with Blake, would you support a bill that  offers a path to citizenship for the Dreamers without funding for a border  wall.  </p><p>RATCLIFFE:  Well, I think if we get as Republicans, if we get border  security, if we get an end to chain-migration, if we end diversity lottery,  we've got to give something in return and so some sort of whether it's  citizenship or some sort of renewable legal status to some percentage of  the Dreamer population, I think Republicans would be on border with that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so you think that the Republicans will be on border even if  it doesn't include actual funding specifically for the wall?  Because isn't  that what The President said -- </p><p>RATCLIFFE:  No, no.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is -- OK.  Yes.  I didn't think so .</p><p>RATCLIFFE:  It absolutely -- so in the past the mistake that we have made  is people talk about authorizing a wall, we need appropriation we need a  trust fund of money set aside to make sure that the wall is going to be  built.  It can't be checks is in the mail, so I think Republicans would  demand that.  But to the earlier point I don't think at the end of the day  the Democrats want a deal on this they don't want the Donald Trump to solve  the immigration problem in the country that would be the worst thing for  Democrats.  So I think it's going to be hard -- it's going to be hard to at  the end of the day for Democrats ultimately to do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is what I am saying I feel like they're in a box  case because The President just offering much more than they initially  wanted. If they say no now then to you have to question if they actually  just want to resist everything this president offers.  </p><p>RATCLIFFE:  Absolutely.  I mean that has been the strategy for 15 months,  it has been resist and obstruct and so, you know, I expect that strategy to  continue and again they do not want Donald Trump to be successful the  economy is booming without the help of any Democrats on tax reform.  They  certainly don't want Donald Trump to solve the immigration problem and have  Latino voters say maybe we should vote Republican from now on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Congressman, let me move to this market selling that we  are seeing -- we are seeing renewed pressure this morning after suffering  the biggest declines in more than a year on Friday even though the backdrop  to the economy seems pretty good with the 200,000 jobs created in the month  of January, the Atlanta Fed talking about 5.4 percent economic growth and  of course wages growing at the fastest pace and more than 8-1/2 years 2.9  percent move that we saw in the jobs' report.  Your take on how worried we  should be about what is taking place in public markets.  </p><p>RATCLIFFE:  Well, I think folks are a little bit skittish frankly about  some of the other things that are happening in Washington with respect to  for instance investigations into the Department of Justice and FBI.  You  know, the market dropped on Friday coincided with the release of this memo.   People's fate and trust in the justice system being shaken can have an  impact on the market.  But the good news Maria is the tax cut and jobs  bill, you know, cutting the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent,  that's a jet fuel in the long term that's going to keep this economy  humming.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me get to the memo and what you've learned, Congressman,  because you are one of only a handful three in fact, Congressman, or three  members of the GOP who have seen the underlying data and content below this  FISA memo.  What's most important that we need to focus on in the memo and  what -- and from all this content that you've actually viewed?  </p><p>RATCLIFFE:  Well, from my perspective is the fact that there was not full  disclosure to the FISA court.  And again, the FISA court is one where the  government gets to present its cases by itself.  And so, when we give the  government strong surveillance, tools, law enforcement tools, especially  when those are used against American citizens, it comes with an obligation  for there to be full disclosure.  And the fact that the FISA court here  with respect to the initial application and each of the renewals was not  advised that the central piece of evidence upon which the warrant was  granted, the Steele dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign and  was put together by an avowed anti-Trump person who was bent on making sure  that he would not get elected president.  Those are facts that the FISA  judge should have known before allowing a warrant to be issued against a  Trump campaign associate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, they didn't tell the FISA judge that the Democrats and  Hillary Clinton campaign paid for what was largely the evidence that they  were using to get the FISA warrant in the first place but they didn't do  that once, right?  They did that a total of four times which is really  stunning to me.  Did they keep using the same FISA evidence, did they keep  using that dossier as evidence for four times or was there new information  to allow them to go back and renew it because they renewed it three times,  correct?  </p><p>RATCLIFFE:  They renewed it three times, right.  And each time the FISA  application gets thicker, so I reviewed all four of the FISA -- or the  applications and all three of the renewals and essentially it's -- it is  four phonebooks worth of information that was submitted and it grew each  time because one of the things that they had to do was to tell the court  that as a result of the warrant and information that they were getting that   the investigation was proceeding that they were essentially fruits of the  warrant there and so that's why more information was involved.  But at the  same time I think that's troubling because in the instance of Carter Page,  I think the additional information clearly showed that he was not in a  position to influence Trump administration officials with respect to  Russian policy, and so I think not just the initial application based on  the Steele dossier but each of the renewals was in question because of the  lack of information to support it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what does this tell us about special counsel?  What does  this tell us about this investigation that's ongoing looking at President  Trump?  And his coordination or lack of with Russians?  </p><p>RATCLIFFE: Well remember, the charge to Special Counsel Mueller to look  into Russian interference in the election.  Including any links to the  Trump campaign or administration.  So what it tells us is Carter Page is  not a link to any Trump-Russia collusion.  Doesn't mean that Bob Mueller  can't continue to look at other individuals, folks like George Papadopoulos  and others, so that's why this does not end the Mueller Special Counsel  probe but I do think what it shows is that there still is no eggs in Trump- Russia collusion basket.  The basket that Democrats have been counting on  for so long and there's still no evidence of that.  And I think, Maria, you  and I have talked about this before.  Washington is a town that can't keep  a secret for 10 minutes, much less for better part of two years and if  there was evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, Adam Schiff would be holding  a press conference about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he would have leaked it already.  Let me ask you this real  quick.  What should we be looking for going forward?  I know that there are  more text and more memos to come, correct?  </p><p>RATCLIFFE: More texts.  There's going to be more interviews, the  intelligence investigation is continuing bringing, so they're bringing in  more folks.  The investigation that I'm doing with the Judiciary Committee  and Oversight and government reform, we're proceeding.  We just got to keep  our foot on the gas here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be -- we will be watching that, Congressman.  Thank you  so much, Congressman Ratcliffe.  We'll see you soon.</p><p>RATCLIFFE: You bet.  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New developments this morning in yesterday's  deadly Amtrak crash, the train traveling on the wrong track when it slammed  into a freight train.  Lauren Simonetti with the details.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Yes.  Maria, Federal  investigators are trying to figure out why a switch was in the wrong  position which sent the Amtrak train on a collision course with the CSX  train South Carolina.  The Amtrak train was traveling between New York and  Miami when it hit the CSX train.  The Amtrak conductor and engineer were  both killed, more than 100 others injured.  </p><p>Well, health insurance company Anthem announcing contributions to 401(k)  retirement plans for over 58,000 employees and to recent retirees in  response to new tax code, the company will give them $1,000 dollars each.   Anthem joining the growing list of 317 companies now to offer employees  better wages or bonuses as they become financially flexible.  Thanks to  changes in the tax code.  Let's take a look shares then from up 50 percent  in the past year.</p><p>Well, in technology, Broadcom sweetening its offer for Qualcomm.  The  company increasing its offer for the chipmaker to $121 billion in increased  pressure on Qualcomm which rejected the first offer which was at 105  billion.  If this is successful, the deal would be biggest ever in  technology.  Let's show you shares of Broadcom, they are up $2.00 in the  premarket.  Qualcomm shares down about $1.47.</p><p>Another story we're following, oh, actually, I'm going to end it there,  Maria and send it back to you because I think you want to talk about the  big game last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to check, I mean, the Eagles soared last  night, Lauren.  Thank you.  Pass the Patriots, their first Super Bowl  victory ever.  Cheryl Casone was there to watch it all happen in  Minneapolis.  She's got more right now in that huge win for the Eagles.   Cheryl, good morning to you.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria, from U.S.  Bank Stadium here in Minneapolis.  It was an incredible game behind me last  night as of course you saw the Eagles beat the Patriots.  The underdog, the  Cinderella story if you will, the Philadelphia Eagles, it was all about  Nick Foles last night, that incredible trick play that he pulled.  He  throws it over to Trey Burton, Trey Burton throws it back to him.   Incredible score right there.  And then the good story was the other  quarterback and that was of course, Tom Brady, the Patriots that basically  the Hail Mary that wasn't from Tom Brady.  He's so famous for making that  happen and he didn't.  Patriots lose into the Eagles.  The fans in  Philadelphia going crazy overnight.  The Party was on a little out of  control (INAUDIBLE) one fan had to say about the big win.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Way overdue.  We got it.  Eagles.</p><p>CASONE:  Overdue is right.  Of course, the other big story here was all of  those players that yes, stood for the national anthem and of course that  national was sung by Pink who is fighting the flu.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  That's how we kicked off the game and of course with Pink who was  amazing, of course, patriotic and inspiring then you get after the first  two quarters of the halftime show Justin Timberlake did not disappoint, he  of course did this entire thing solo we thought Janet Jackson may show up,  that was the rumor, she didn't.  But I got to tell you, his tribute to  Prince, Maria, one for the books.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Oh, it was incredible, Maria.  I know that you've interviewed   Prince in the past and I got to tell you, it was a fabulous night.  The  hometown hero, of course, is Prince.  It was a great game, Indiana,  Indianapolis, Maria.  Back to you.  . BARTIROMO:  Cheryl, you look cold, we are -- we are sending you our hugs  and warmth.  See you soon.  Cheryl Casone there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The truth about tech.  A group of Silicon Valley  insiders including early employees of Facebook and Google now say that they  are fighting back against what they actually created.  According to The New  York Times, the new center for humane technology is finding an anti-tech  addiction lobbying effort and adds about the effects of social media on  young mind.  Joining us right now Jeremy Ring, entrepreneur of former  Florida State Senator and author of We Were Yahoo!  From internet pioneer  to the trillion-dollar loss of Google and Facebook.  Good to see you.   Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>JEREMY RING, AUTHOR, WE WERE YOU!:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you are one of the very first Yahoo! Employees.  Tell me  about how things have changed and how you see what has happened in Silicon  Valley. </p><p>RING:  Well, when it started with Yahoo!, I mean, we were the biggest in  the world.  At the time we were bigger than Disney, News Corp and Viacom  combined in terms of value.  Now we're probably the only people on planet  earth talking about Yahoo! today.  So you can tell about how far -- how far  it fell.  The book and story really is about missed opportunities.  We're  talking about you just mentioned Google and Facebook.  Imagine where were  Google and Facebook don't even exist.  Yahoo! turned down buying Google one  -- for $1 million.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RING:  And that in time again it turned it down for buying it for close to  six billion and then it turned down buying Facebook for 1.1 billion.  Those  two companies are worth of combined $1.2 trillion today.  They control our  lives as this new group is asserting.  And yet, Google would not exist  today and Facebook would -- best be a shelf of itself.  Had Yahoo! not  miscalculated.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  It all happened kind of quick -- I mean, I don't -- it doesn't  seem though but it all did happen fairly quick.  I remember thinking I was  cool because I had a Gmail address like when they used to send out the  invites sitting back then, this is a while ago but it does make you think  about, you know, what's next in all of this if you -- if you are the  behemoth today, if you're the Facebook or whatever you (INAUDIBLE) be  careful because somebody else could always come up and do the same to you I  guess, right?  </p><p>RING:  Yes.  We used to call -- in our early days we always say, don't get  Netscape.  Remember Netscape, Microsoft came in and ate Netscape quickly,  then Google came in and ate Microsoft and Microsoft kind of came back.   Obviously Apple at one-point was near bankrupt and no -- they would have  sold to anybody at the time and they came back.  If you're not careful,  there's a lot of threats out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, are you saying though, for Facebook or even a Google to  avoid the fate of Yahoo!, you need a genius like Steve Jobs because Steve  Jobs envisioned a -- basically envisioned a world with technology devices  recreated, changed our lives and reinvented Apple.  How do Facebook and  Google prevent suffering the same fate of Yahoo!?  </p><p>RING:  Well, it seems they've been preventing through acquisition.  And  looking to the future, I mean, obviously Google's acquisition of YouTube  was significant, and then Facebook went and bought Instagram and -- but  beyond that they look into future.  You know, Facebook was Artificial  Intelligence (INAUDIBLE) drones, driverless cars, healthcare that they  announced last week.  So they are -- they are saying  what is -- what do I  need to do next and even if it doesn't make money any time in the near  future, they seem to be over, so I feel pretty good that they will be  around whether that's good or not, I -- they seem to be much brighter than  Yahoo! was.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have a problem with the addiction on young people.  </p><p>RING:  Terrible problem with addiction.  I mean, Facebook has their -- I  guess is a year older, messenger kids app six year olds.  And you spend 15  minutes a day I saw Facebook and I see you on Facebook (INAUDIBLE) to  services nine hours a day looking at screens and entertainment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But isn't that a parent issue?  I mean, shouldn't the parents  be doing that?  You can't blame Yahoo!  Can you?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RING:  Oh, you got it.  You -- look, if we could -- as a former elected  official, if would legislate parenting, the world would be a whole better.   So, don't get me wrong.  I'm not going to push back at all on something  that should be absolutely about parenting.  But, you know, the companies  also -- it's addictive.  They create -- they know how to create, you know,  an addictive environment as well. So, it's all society.  And by the way,  adults are just as addictive as kids.  We keep talking but this is a  societal problem, it's not just a kids' problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.  Jeremy, good to see you.</p><p>RING:  Thank  you so much. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Jeremy Ring joining us there.</p><p>RING:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  The Federal Reserve's new penalties against Wells  Fargo after the fake account scandal.  The CEO and president, Tim Sloan  will join me.  We will exclusively on that consent decree from the Fed  against Wells Fargo.  As we take a break, take a look at futures this  morning.  We are expecting a sharp sell-off at the start of trading this  morning.  We are off of the lows, nonetheless down 175 points on concerns  about the booming economy.  We're carefully driving up interest rates and  inflation.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, February 5th.  Your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Global markets are  under pressure again, inflation fears have taken hold.  Dow Industrials  expected to be down 150 points right out of the gate this morning.  This is  off of the lows of the morning.  Earlier we had looked at a decline of  close to 300 points on the Dow.  Markets of course extending Friday's big  slide, the Dow was down 665 points on Friday.  The worst one-day decline  since the Brexit vote back in June of 2016.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500  also down roughly two percent apiece.  Investors overseas taking a queue  from the move in Europe this morning, declines across the board.  But the  FT-100 and the CAC Quarante down better than one percent and the DAX Index  almost one percent.  In Asia overnight, a sharp sell-off there as well.  </p><p>We did have some positive economic data out of China and the Shanghai  Composite was up three quarters of a percent.  But the other majors in Asia  down across the board with Japan, worst performer down 2-1/2 percent on the  Nikkei Average, the worse-day decline there since the U.S. Presidential  Election in Japan.  Only the Shanghai Composite posting a gain overnight.   Investing -- investors are also focused on earnings, Bristol-Myers, Squibb  reporting better-than-expected profit in revenue, the stock is up four  percent.  Bucking the down trend, the pharmaceutical giant also meeting a  goal for a late-stage cancer study, the stock is up as you can see there.   Chaos in Philadelphia after the Eagles stunned the Patriots in the Super  Bowl.  Eagles quarterback Nick Foles praising the team's effort and fans  after being named Super Bowl MVP.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NICK FOLES, PHILADELPHIA EAGLES QUARTERBACK:  We dreamed about this moment,  there's plenty of kids watching this game right now dreaming about this  moment someday will be here and to be here with my daughter and my wife, my  family, my teammates, this city, we're very blessed.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sweet music to Apple there.  The company streaming service set  to overtake Spotify subscribers.  All of that coming up this morning and we  got a lot on tap this morning with this market sell-off.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  It could be one of those -- could be a lot worse than it is right  now, and kind of just watching it tick by tick and we were to your point  earlier we were down 300 and you got the sense that things were going to  get a little bit sloppy and now, we don't get ahead of ourselves, so maybe  good sign to see a little bit stability before the opening bell after what  we saw on Friday I think, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's see about that.  The worry is interest rates as you've  been pointing out, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And it was that 2.9 percent increase in average hourly  earnings year-over-year that really sparked it on Friday.  You had already  seen the 10-year yield moving upwards and the higher these longer term  rates go now it raise the question with Jay Powell taking over from Janet  Yellen as the head of the Federal Reserve ,could the Fed then have to play  catch-up and do more than people are expecting and I was pointing out at  the top of the hour that you have seen market declines when new Federal  Reserve chiefs take over.  Remember, Alan Greenspan took over in August  1987 and then you had the market crash roughly two months later.  So that  was a little bit unexpected but again it's the unknown of how somebody  would act as much as people are sure that Jay Powell will be just like  Janet Yellen.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Just quick thing, you mentioned the reintroduction of volatility  earlier that we're not used to this and markets are a little volatile  again, that's the VIX which measures fear, of course the fear gage,  whatever you want to call it at it -- at its highest level since the day  after the election.  So, it's a pretty good gain, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, as you said earlier.  There's been no volatility  whatsoever.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And assets particularly stocks that look overvalued to  many people, there was a report out about a week ago that we cited on this  very show, do you look at the median price to earnings ratio of all the  stocks on the New York Stock ExchangeNASDAQ in the American Stock  Exchange, that is at an all-time high.  </p><p>CARTER:  And let's look also that there is a lot of people saying that we  need a correction, so hopefully this will come out fast and then we can  move on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, this is all on the face of good economic  strength.  </p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The backdrop, you're talking about wages up 2.9 percent over  the last year, you're talking about growth in terms of three percent.   Expectations now for the first quarter up 5.4 percent.  </p><p>CARTER:  And usually that's what you would expect the President will be  talking about, but he has taken credit for so much of the (INAUDIBLE) the  so-called Trump bump.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FOLES:  Stock markets not going to speak today in Cincinnati. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You try to get credit for it on the way up then you're going to  own it on the way down, Mr. President.  One other thing that -- about the  10-year yield since the financial crisis, every time you've seen yields get  to this level on the 10-year, people have moved in and seen it as a buying  opportunity to fixed income investors, that's one of the central questions.   Jeff Gun like the famous bond investor gave an interview of \"THE WEEKEND\"  and he said he doesn't even think three percent is at that level, he's not  sure people will in and start buying treasuries even at a three percent  yield.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He also made a prediction about the first quarter.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nominal GDP growth of seven percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Seven percent. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Dagen mentioned that earlier, I was like, could you push like the  country?  I was like --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was talking about China.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right. </p><p>FOLES:  That the U.S. I love too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, there's a lot of stimulus, you know, accommodative Federal  Reserve even with interest rate increases and this tax reform package being  a big, big tailwind for the markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We keep seeing companies --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or economy rather.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  For the economy and that -- and that's exactly what  happened.  But you wonder why it is that what's so unnerving just for three  percent, I mean, I recognize as rates go higher that stock investors have a  -- have a decision to make, do I want to stay in a safety of treasuries or  do I want to take some risk in the stock but three percent, Connell?  </p><p>MCSHANE:  No.  I know.  Historically it's so low and I think part of this  is that we haven't had a conversation.  When is the last time there was  like a serious conversation of country about inflation, you know, being a  real issue.  I mean, it's got to be -- 10 years ago or whatever it may be,  people are actually talking about inflation as an economic issue that we  all had to deal with.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We were talking about inflation of stock -- of home prices  during the -- during the housing bubble but we weren't talking about  inflation.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Right.  We're just not used to it, so we're thrown off by that  conversation again but to Maria's point, you know, three percent on a 10- year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think it's also the great unknown of the Federal Reserve not  only of raising short-term interest rates but trying to unwind a four  trillion balance sheet and it also goes to the issue of the supply of  treasuries both on the short end but also the longer end with these -- with  the tax cuts until they begin to somewhat pay for themselves that's going  to be a problem for the bond market</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're are going to talk -- I'm sorry, pardon me, Dagen.  We're  going to talk with the CEO of Wells Fargo coming up, Tim Sloan.  But we  want to show you what's going on in market first because now big technology  is also taking a beating coming after the market had that worst week in two  years, last week.  Joining us now to weigh in is the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  Stu, good morning to you.  </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  You  mentioned big tech and I, you know, like you, I follow very, very closely.   I'm noticing the premarket this morning, Apple is below 160, Microsoft has  threatened to go below 90, Facebook is below 190, Amazon is close to  dropping below 1400.  So, there's a lot of pressure on them but I want to  pick up on your conversation just a couple seconds ago.  How many times,  Maria, have we said that future profits are the bedrock of today's stock  prices?  I mean, we say it all the time and I think that's accurate,  profitability of American corporations dictates their stock price.  But if  we're looking at significant increases in profits down the road because of  tax reform and for whatever reason a growing economy, why would the market  tank right now?  And surely that extra profitability down the road would  limit today's losses or this week's losses or last week's losses.  I would  have thought that the expectation of profit will narrow the loss that we're  now in.  That's my point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think you make a good point because we are talking  about what, 23 percent earnings growth in 2018, Stu.  These are really good  numbers.  And I'm really -- Dagen just talk about Jeff Gundlach, very high  profile, mutual fund manager who's talking about seven percent nominal  growth.  Seven percent in the first quarter, Stu.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Well, I heard the Atlanta Fed talk five percent growth which is a  knockout, seven percent is truly stunning but in that environment of growth  and profitability I think the loss will be limited, that's my point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  Backdrop is pretty strong.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Those profits are worthless though, Stuart if interest  rates are a lot higher, that's the issue playgrounds the stock market.  </p><p>VAUSE:  I take your point, but again, I think the loss will be limited but  far for me to predict the stock market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, I'm looking forward to joining you in the next hour.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.  Good stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I will see you soon.  Stu, thanks so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\"  begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  We're going to talk with the CEO  and President of Wells Fargo in an exclusive interview right after this  short break.  .  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The shackles on Wells Fargo,  the Federal  Reserve has slapped Wells Fargo with an unprecedented punishment for years  of misconduct including the creation of millions fake user accounts.  The  punishment imposed on Janet Yellen's last day as chiarman of the Fed will  restrict growth at Wells to under $2 trillion in assets.  Pressure the  removal of four Wells Fargo board members and require the submission of  detailed plans to remedy Wells Fargo's wrongdoing.  Joining me right now in  an exclusive interview is Wells Fargo and company CEO and President, Tim  Sloan.  Tim, thanks very much for joining us this morning.  We appreciate  your time.  </p><p>TIM SLOAN, CEO, WELLS FARGO:  Oh, you're welcome, Maria.  It's great to see  you and be with your viewers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Your reaction to what the Fed instituted on Friday?  </p><p>SLOAN:  Sure.  Maria, there is no doubt it was a disappointment.  But I  think the important point is that we've been making fundamental changes at  Wells Fargo since I became CEO about 16 months ago.  We've addressed  leadership concerns, we've made fundamental changes in terms of how we're  organized, we've invested billions of dollars in improving risk management  practices.  We have addressed any concerns that customers have including  remediating customers who were impacted by the retail sales practices  issue.  And so, that the issue is that the Fed called out in order, our  items that we are in midst of correcting anyway, and we have been for  months.  And in fact, in the order itself, the Fed highlighted the changes  that the board has made as well as the changes that management has made to  -- make Wells Fargo a better company and address these issues. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and you have announced a lot of the changes that you have  been putting in place, over the last year, but given the fact that your  asset size is dependent on the positive growth and if your growing deposits  by what 4.6 percent a year or so.  This consent order is going to force to  you shrink your business, right?  I mean, (INAUDIBLE) forced you to shrink  some businesses in order to keep your assets flat so where do the -- which  areas are you going to shrink?</p><p>SLOAN:  Well, first and foremost, Maria, Wells Fargo is absolutely open for  business.  We can operate our company, serve our customers, with the $2- trillion balance sheet that you referred to.  There are some areas, where  we've outgrown our balance sheet because there have been opportunities  created from some of our competitors.  We will be reducing some non- operational deposits, we'll reduce some short-term investments, we'll  reduce some deposits that we get from other banks, but overall, the order  allows to us operate the company in a make-sense way so that we can  continue to grow loans, Maria, as you know, we're the largest lender in  this country, and being able to provide credit to our customers is not only  critical for them but critical for economic growth, and then we'll continue  to be able to take deposits from most of our customers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this morning, we're seeing a lot of your analysts react  on Wall Street, everybody is downgrading the stocks, several downgrades on  Wells Fargo shares, and obviously, the stock is down two percent right now,  Tim.  I mean, isn't it true as one analyst write, the operating leverage  story is now delayed.  The fact that now you are getting a restriction to  growth just at the same time that we're actually seeing growth expand in  the U.S.  You're not going to be able to take advantage of that broader  growth because you've got a restriction on growth.</p><p>SLOAN:  No, Maria, I would push back on that.  Again, Wells Fargo is open  for business, we will be able to grow loans we will be able to grow  deposits and serve our customers.  It restricts our balance sheet growth  but it doesn't restrict our ability to serve almost all of our consumers,  that's what I communicated to our team on Friday and I'll re-communicate  that to them again today.  I want them out there serving our customers and  being part of the continued economic growth of this country. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure, of course, but I'm just saying that it's unlikely that  you can take full advantage of the economic growth story that is at your --  at your request fingertips here, even though you have got a risk you have  terrific cash flow, significant excess capital position.  You've got a risk  here because you've got to limit growth, do you think this punishment was  too severe?</p><p>SLOAN:  You know, Maria, let me get back to your last question and then  I'll answer that one.  We were very clear on our call with our analyst  investors on Friday that we think that net income after tax impact of the  restriction of balance sheet growth this year will be $300 million to $400d  million.  We expect to have this cap lifted because, again, all the  activities that the Fed would like us to improve on are the same ones that  we like to improve on, and we believe that, well, it's likely that the  asset cap could get lifted by the end of the year.  So, we think the  earnings impact is primarily focused now.  </p><p>Again, to get back to your point about taking part in economic growth, you  know, since the beginning of the year, we've seen an increase in our loan  pipelines, and our expectations is that we'll be able to take a part in  that economic growth.  Again, there's no restriction on growing loans. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SLOAN:  There's no restriction on providing credit, there's no restrictions  on growing retail deposits, and so, we'll continue to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, will -- so will you have to shrink the trading and  financial -- and the financial franchise to make room for more loans?</p><p>SLOAN:  Maria, we have access liquidity at the company -- what we talked  about on Friday, and provided a fair amount of detail in the deck that we  provided to investors and analysts is that the three areas that will be  focused on, making sure that we manage appropriately to get -- to stay  below the cap; are one, non-operational deposits; two, deposits that we  received from some financial institutions; and three, our short-term  investments.  That will allow us ample room to be able to grow, loans,  serve customers, and grow deposits.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, you said that this is obviously going to start being in  the rear-view mirror at some point.  You said perhaps at the end of the  year.  What gives you that indication that this is going to be no longer a  problem by year-end?</p><p>SLOAN:  Well, again, it's my hope that that's -- and my expectation that  that will be the case.  And I say that for two reasons, Maria.  First, in  the order is very specific -- there's a very specific timeframe by which  we're going to provide two different plans, to the Fed, the Federal  Reserve, will review those plans, we'll bring a third party in to make sure  that all the changes that we have been making and will make have been  implemented and adopted within the company.  That -- the next report by the  third party is due by the end of September.  And my expectation is that  we'll meet and exceed the expectations of the Fed.  And again, I think it's  reasonable to assume that the cap could be lifted by year-end. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the cap could be lifted by year-end.  Let me ask you this,  have you done work in terms of replacing these four board members?  You've  already said that you put plans in place in terms of new board members, and  you've made those announcements publicly.  What else -- what other changes  are on the horizon in terms of these board members?</p><p>SLOAN:  Yes, Maria, it's a really good question and observation.  I think  that the reporting related to these board members was mischaracterized.   And, in fact, I know the Fed has been out speaking with the media to  correct any mischaracterization that occurred on Friday.  Our board has  been making fundamental changes in terms of its governance, in terms of its  oversight and refreshing board members over the last year.  We've brought  on six incredibly talented new board members since in the last year.  We  also brought in Mary Joe White, the former chair of SEC to assist in our  board review and governance.  So, we've made a lot of fundamental changes  and we'll continue to listen to our shareholders as well as other  stakeholders in terms of other changes that the board needs to make.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, we've been talking largely about the broader  environment for financials, given the fact that interest rates are starting  to go up, and net interest margins you expect to be -- to be a positive  rather than a headwind going forward.  Also, the backdrop of economic  growth, and a rollback in regulations.  But it seems, Tim, that Wells Fargo  is not going to be able to really participate in a lot of the positives  happenings for the broader averages and the broader banking sector because  of these restrictions.  So, I ask you again, do you see this as too strict?   I mean, isn't this handicapping you?</p><p>SLOAN:  Maria, there's no question that it's a disappointment.  But, again,  just to politely push back, Wells Fargo is open for business.  We have  260,000 of the best team members in the industry that serve our customers  every day.  We will participate in the economic growth of the country,  we'll participate and be a part of the economic growth of our customers.   We're the largest mortgage lender in this country, we're the largest  agricultural lender, we're the largest small business lender.  We just did  a survey of our small businesses along with Gallup, and they're as  optimistic as they've been in over a decade, so we'll be able to  participate in the growth.  It's just that we're going to do that in a way  that we maintain a level of as of 12:31 of our balance sheet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the Federal Reserve is basically saying we're not  changing this decree until we absolutely see evidence of change in terms of  mentality at the bank and the change in terms of consumer protection.  So,  what specifically are you going to go back to the Federal Reserve to say,  here's what we've changed, and we're ready for this decree to be lifted,  whether it's at the end of this year or next year or whenever it is, you  are going to have to provide evidence that, in fact, there are changes,  what is that evidence that you see presenting?</p><p>SLOAN:  Oh, sure.  I mean, Maria, let's be specific about the order.  The  order asks for two plans, one, to see continued improvements in government  oversight at the board level.  That's easy to do because we've already been  on that journey as I just mentioned.  In terms of change -- or the plan  that management is going to provide, they want to see our focus on a  compliance plan and an operational plan.  We've been well on our way for  months, if not, more than a year, in terms of improvements in both  compliance and operational risk management.  So, it's not as if we're  starting from a standing start, we've been working on all these areas now  for the last few months if not the last year.  And so, that's why I am  confident we'll be able to meet and exceed the Fed's expectations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you expected to sell divisions to pair back on certain  divisions like the trading business given the fact that you are needing to  stay under this cap of $1.95 trillion in assets, Tim?</p><p>SLOAN:  No, not at all.  There's -- there are no requirements in the -- in  the consent order for any asset divestitures.  Now having said that, we've  been on a journey over the last couple of years to make sure that we've got  the right businesses serving our customers.  And so, we sold our crop  insurance business a year ago.  We sold our shareholder services business,  in fact, we just announced that last week, we sold our commercial insurance  brokers business.  And so, there have been a number of businesses that  we've decided are better in the hands of others, and we can return more --  it allows us to return more capital to our shareholders.  That's an ongoing  review at Wells Fargo that has nothing to do with this consent order.  And  we have no plans to exit any of our investment banking or trading  activities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, Tim, you need to gain back the trust of Wells  Fargo clients, we know that, and the Federal Reserve is calling this and  that is quote, widespread consumer abuses and compliance break down.  How  did we get here, Tim?  How did that happen?</p><p>SLOAN:  Well, Maria, I think it's important to note that there's nothing  new in the order.  And so, it's bad comment --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's widespread consumer abuses, compliance breakdowns.   All I'm asking is how did you get here?  What do you think as you look  back?  And I know that you came in, they put you in charge to fix this  situation, but how did this happen, a widespread consumer abuse and  compliance breakdown?</p><p>SLOAN:  Maria, you're absolutely right.  We've been making fundamental  changes since I became CEO in October of 2016.  There's no question that we  made some mistakes, we've taken responsibility for that in terms of our  retail banking business.  What have we done to change that?  We ended the  retail banking incentive plan.  We've got a new plan in place, it's working  extremely well.  Customers appreciate the change.  The reaction from  customers today and a retail banking business measured by customer loyalty  and customer service has been -- has really been increasing, again, I  think, in order there is nothing new that the Fed found.  They were talking  about history.  We agreed that we made mistakes, we're fixing those  mistakes or we fixed them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But today, the market is reacting to the impact on your  business.  The fact that the rest of the industry is going to be growing,  taking advantage of increasing growth numbers in the economy and you will  be limited in terms of doing that.  That's what all the analysts and the  market is reacting to today.  Tim, your stock is now down eight percent. </p><p>SLOAN:  Maria, again, right, Wells Fargo is open for business.  We will be  able to continue to grow loans.  We're -- again, we're the largest lender  in the country and we're going to continue to be able to grow deposits for  almost all of customers.  We just need to be able to do that under a  balance sheet cap.  Many of our competitors over the last few years have  shrunk their balance sheets and still been able to grow.  And we expect to  be able to serve our customers.  Again, we're open for business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think -- you think that further focus on compliance and  on customers obviously widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdown  as how the Fed said it, you think you will be able to grow going forward  and really focus on that loan business as a result, even though you've got  these limitations to grow with the asset size?</p><p>SLOAN:  Absolutely.  But, Maria, that doesn't take away from the fact that  we are focused on improving risk management at Wells Fargo.  We believe and  we've demonstrated that we can do both at the same time.  You've seen the  progress over the last year that we've been able to make.  You and I have  talked about it on a few occasions.  And again, I'm confident in our team,  I'm confident in our business model and I'm confident we're going to be  able to serve our customers even with the asset cap limitation that we  have. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  This is really a rare decree by the Fed, Tim, were you  surprised?</p><p>SLOAN:  Well, I was disappointed, for certain.  I mean, the Fed had been  public about the fact that they've been looking at how to resolve their  concerns about Wells Fargo.  This is the resolution of those concerns,  there's no disagreement between ourselves and the Fed in terms of what we  need to do to improve; we will make those improvements in risk management;  we have been making those improvements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.  In 17 months you have.  Tim, good to see you, thanks  very much for joining us this morning.  Tim Sloan there.</p><p>SLOAN:  Thank you, Maria.  It's a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sending right over to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" and Stuart.  Stu, over  to you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday February 5th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. The bears have gone global it is an ugly start to the week for the markets this morning we are looking at the market near the lows of the morning, what we had been down almost 300 earlier Dow Industrials expected to be down 250 points right out of the gate this morning. Inflation fears have taken a hold, interest rates moving higher, worries at a booming economy will lead to inflation and higher rates Friday marks the biggest one day decline for the Dow since the Brexit vote back in June of 2016, it was down 265 points on Friday ending of the lows of recession with a 2-1/2 percent sell-off. The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ weaker down two percent, overseas investors took a queue from the U.S.</p><p>In Europe this morning, we have got a sell-off there as well FT 100 down 1- 1/3 percent, the CAC Quarante down 1-1/2 percent and the DAX Index down almost one percent. Economic data also coming out in Europe this morning as is the case in China, we have the (INAUDIBLE) survey overnight and that was one help to the markets in China that's why the Shanghai composite was up overnight by three quarters of a percent but the rest of the markets in Asia down and down sharply. Nikkei Average in Japan hard as hit down 2-1/2 percent. Passing the torch the Janet Yellen era has come to a close as Jay Powell prepares for first day as Chairman of the Federal Reserve today. The challenges that lie ahead for Powell as he takes the rein at the Federal Reserve plus Yellen's parting shot for Wells Fargo look at this, the Fed taking unprecedented action by slapping sanctions against the bank. I will talk with the President and CEO of Wells Fargo this morning, Tim Sloan will join me to react to this new strict, rare rules coming from the Fed on Wells Fargo. And then a Super Bowl stunner, the Eagles soaring past the Patriots to take their first ever title.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Philadelphia Eagles, the long drought is over.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Philadelphia erupted in celebration after the victory, thousands of fans taking to the streets in rivalry and in true Philly fashion, got a little rowdy as well live. We're taking it live with the highlights from the big game, coming up and the highly anticipated halftime show as well. All those stories coming up this Monday morning and join me to break it all down Fox Business Network, it's Dagen McDowell and Connell McShane, along the Pollster and President of Manslansky and Partners, Lee Carter. Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of happening this morning.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh yes, see all these markets fair. So we're down 250 or so it would be interesting today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I was just -- a while I was looking down it was because I was actually doing research on the markets and with a new Federal Reserve Chief coming in to office that you've seen market declines when Volcker took off as when Greenspan took off as when Bernanke as -- and even a slight decline when Janet Yellen took office and so it's the unknown of what is this person going to do in terms of monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some people want to see as they call it like a whole vomiting out I mean they want to see the markets sell off a lot. I knew some conversation this morning on trading desks (INAUDIBLE) I hope it doesn't open down a fraction, I hope it doesn't -- you know improve by the close. I want to see a cleanout like we saw on Friday, what do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that they would rather wash out rapidly than just kind of be this long drawn-out decline in the markets but we have gotten used to virtually no volatility last week in the last week the Dow dropped one percent two times, two moves of at least one percent. We only had 10 one percent moves in all of 2017. So it's really incredible to low volatility environment that we've all gotten used to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, no wonder trading has been under such pressure for the major banks, right? Coming up this morning, I'll talk exclusively to CEO and President of Wells Fargo, Tim Sloan, my special guest to get reaction to the new Federal Reserve penalties on the bank. Basically putting a limitation as to how big this company can get and how much growth they can actually generate. So timothy Sloan will react to that coming up, that news from the fed announced 6:15 p.m. Eastern on Friday night.</p><p>Also joining the conversation this morning Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe one of only three members in Congress to have seen the underlying data and the underlying content of that FISA memo and the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighing in as well, you don't want to miss a moment of it. We got a big hour coming up and kick it off right here with the top story. President trump headed to Ohio today, he's expected to promote the tax reform overhaul at a plant in Cincinnati while a budget battle rages on a Capitol Hill and senators aim a to end the impasse with a dreamers bill, Blake Burman covering the story at the White House right now with the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. The president at the White House, the treasury department they say this is the month February when workers will start to see more in their paychecks because of the new tax bill so to that end The President will hit the road today to continue this aggressive sales push. Keep in mind it's still been 47 days since they passed this in the law but he will once again tout this new measure Cincinnati Ohio visit a manufacturer there. The President over the weekend tweeting out wondering why the economy has not gotten more attention saying in the tweet, ''Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages and nobody even talks about that.'' Meantime part of the talk here in Washington is the need to get a spending bill passed by Thursday, it does not appear as if congress has the stomach again forget another shutdown. So one of the questions remains what might happen with an immigration deal? One of the spokespersons over here at the White House Hogan Gidley saying over the weekend that there should be a compromise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: It is rationale and reasonable, it's 70 percent issue to fix DACA, it's a 70 percent issue for the American people to get border security and chain migration. So there is no reason we should not come to a deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Later today Senator John McCain a Republican of course and Chris Coons his Democratic colleague will introduce some new legislation that would include protection for Dreamers also with some measures Maria along the border. This now falls well short of what President Trump has been calling for -- so we will see if this receives some sort of frosty support or really a lack of support from conservatives here in Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We are going to watch that, I think they're being - - he is putting the Democrats in a box offering them three times what they actually wanted for the Dreamers Blake. And if they say no to this, you have to question if they actually want a deal.</p><p>BURMAN: And that is part of the line now from Republicans all across Washington is they say look it is three times what President Obama had gave or had offered during his administration. So why would you walk away from protecting some 1.8 million people and The President has said he put this out there to see if Democrats really want a deal or not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. All right. We will keep following that, Blake. Thank you so much. Joining me right now is the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Cybersecurity Committee, Member of the House Judiciary and Ethics Committee, it's Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas. Congressman, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, (R) TEXAS: You bet. Hi Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get to the FISA memo because I know that you are only one of three members that actually have seen the underlying data but let me just kick off where we just ended with Blake, would you support a bill that offers a path to citizenship for the Dreamers without funding for a border wall.</p><p>RATCLIFFE: Well, I think if we get as Republicans, if we get border security, if we get an end to chain-migration, if we end diversity lottery, we've got to give something in return and so some sort of whether it's citizenship or some sort of renewable legal status to some percentage of the Dreamer population, I think Republicans would be on border with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so you think that the Republicans will be on border even if it doesn't include actual funding specifically for the wall? Because isn't that what The President said --</p><p>RATCLIFFE: No, no.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is -- OK. Yes. I didn't think so .</p><p>RATCLIFFE: It absolutely -- so in the past the mistake that we have made is people talk about authorizing a wall, we need appropriation we need a trust fund of money set aside to make sure that the wall is going to be built. It can't be checks is in the mail, so I think Republicans would demand that. But to the earlier point I don't think at the end of the day the Democrats want a deal on this they don't want the Donald Trump to solve the immigration problem in the country that would be the worst thing for Democrats. So I think it's going to be hard -- it's going to be hard to at the end of the day for Democrats ultimately to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that is what I am saying I feel like they're in a box case because The President just offering much more than they initially wanted. If they say no now then to you have to question if they actually just want to resist everything this president offers.</p><p>RATCLIFFE: Absolutely. I mean that has been the strategy for 15 months, it has been resist and obstruct and so, you know, I expect that strategy to continue and again they do not want Donald Trump to be successful the economy is booming without the help of any Democrats on tax reform. They certainly don't want Donald Trump to solve the immigration problem and have Latino voters say maybe we should vote Republican from now on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Congressman, let me move to this market selling that we are seeing -- we are seeing renewed pressure this morning after suffering the biggest declines in more than a year on Friday even though the backdrop to the economy seems pretty good with the 200,000 jobs created in the month of January, the Atlanta Fed talking about 5.4 percent economic growth and of course wages growing at the fastest pace and more than 8-1/2 years 2.9 percent move that we saw in the jobs' report. Your take on how worried we should be about what is taking place in public markets.</p><p>RATCLIFFE: Well, I think folks are a little bit skittish frankly about some of the other things that are happening in Washington with respect to for instance investigations into the Department of Justice and FBI. You know, the market dropped on Friday coincided with the release of this memo. People's fate and trust in the justice system being shaken can have an impact on the market. But the good news Maria is the tax cut and jobs bill, you know, cutting the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, that's a jet fuel in the long term that's going to keep this economy humming.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So let me get to the memo and what you've learned, Congressman, because you are one of only a handful three in fact, Congressman, or three members of the GOP who have seen the underlying data and content below this FISA memo. What's most important that we need to focus on in the memo and what -- and from all this content that you've actually viewed?</p><p>RATCLIFFE: Well, from my perspective is the fact that there was not full disclosure to the FISA court. And again, the FISA court is one where the government gets to present its cases by itself. And so, when we give the government strong surveillance, tools, law enforcement tools, especially when those are used against American citizens, it comes with an obligation for there to be full disclosure. And the fact that the FISA court here with respect to the initial application and each of the renewals was not advised that the central piece of evidence upon which the warrant was granted, the Steele dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign and was put together by an avowed anti-Trump person who was bent on making sure that he would not get elected president. Those are facts that the FISA judge should have known before allowing a warrant to be issued against a Trump campaign associate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, they didn't tell the FISA judge that the Democrats and Hillary Clinton campaign paid for what was largely the evidence that they were using to get the FISA warrant in the first place but they didn't do that once, right? They did that a total of four times which is really stunning to me. Did they keep using the same FISA evidence, did they keep using that dossier as evidence for four times or was there new information to allow them to go back and renew it because they renewed it three times, correct?</p><p>RATCLIFFE: They renewed it three times, right. And each time the FISA application gets thicker, so I reviewed all four of the FISA -- or the applications and all three of the renewals and essentially it's -- it is four phonebooks worth of information that was submitted and it grew each time because one of the things that they had to do was to tell the court that as a result of the warrant and information that they were getting that the investigation was proceeding that they were essentially fruits of the warrant there and so that's why more information was involved. But at the same time I think that's troubling because in the instance of Carter Page, I think the additional information clearly showed that he was not in a position to influence Trump administration officials with respect to Russian policy, and so I think not just the initial application based on the Steele dossier but each of the renewals was in question because of the lack of information to support it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what does this tell us about special counsel? What does this tell us about this investigation that's ongoing looking at President Trump? And his coordination or lack of with Russians?</p><p>RATCLIFFE: Well remember, the charge to Special Counsel Mueller to look into Russian interference in the election. Including any links to the Trump campaign or administration. So what it tells us is Carter Page is not a link to any Trump-Russia collusion. Doesn't mean that Bob Mueller can't continue to look at other individuals, folks like George Papadopoulos and others, so that's why this does not end the Mueller Special Counsel probe but I do think what it shows is that there still is no eggs in Trump- Russia collusion basket. The basket that Democrats have been counting on for so long and there's still no evidence of that. And I think, Maria, you and I have talked about this before. Washington is a town that can't keep a secret for 10 minutes, much less for better part of two years and if there was evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, Adam Schiff would be holding a press conference about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he would have leaked it already. Let me ask you this real quick. What should we be looking for going forward? I know that there are more text and more memos to come, correct?</p><p>RATCLIFFE: More texts. There's going to be more interviews, the intelligence investigation is continuing bringing, so they're bringing in more folks. The investigation that I'm doing with the Judiciary Committee and Oversight and government reform, we're proceeding. We just got to keep our foot on the gas here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will be -- we will be watching that, Congressman. Thank you so much, Congressman Ratcliffe. We'll see you soon.</p><p>RATCLIFFE: You bet. Thanks, Maria.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New developments this morning in yesterday's deadly Amtrak crash, the train traveling on the wrong track when it slammed into a freight train. Lauren Simonetti with the details. Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Yes. Maria, Federal investigators are trying to figure out why a switch was in the wrong position which sent the Amtrak train on a collision course with the CSX train South Carolina. The Amtrak train was traveling between New York and Miami when it hit the CSX train. The Amtrak conductor and engineer were both killed, more than 100 others injured.</p><p>Well, health insurance company Anthem announcing contributions to 401(k) retirement plans for over 58,000 employees and to recent retirees in response to new tax code, the company will give them $1,000 dollars each. Anthem joining the growing list of 317 companies now to offer employees better wages or bonuses as they become financially flexible. Thanks to changes in the tax code. Let's take a look shares then from up 50 percent in the past year.</p><p>Well, in technology, Broadcom sweetening its offer for Qualcomm. The company increasing its offer for the chipmaker to $121 billion in increased pressure on Qualcomm which rejected the first offer which was at 105 billion. If this is successful, the deal would be biggest ever in technology. Let's show you shares of Broadcom, they are up $2.00 in the premarket. Qualcomm shares down about $1.47.</p><p>Another story we're following, oh, actually, I'm going to end it there, Maria and send it back to you because I think you want to talk about the big game last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we're going to check, I mean, the Eagles soared last night, Lauren. Thank you. Pass the Patriots, their first Super Bowl victory ever. Cheryl Casone was there to watch it all happen in Minneapolis. She's got more right now in that huge win for the Eagles. Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria, from U.S. Bank Stadium here in Minneapolis. It was an incredible game behind me last night as of course you saw the Eagles beat the Patriots. The underdog, the Cinderella story if you will, the Philadelphia Eagles, it was all about Nick Foles last night, that incredible trick play that he pulled. He throws it over to Trey Burton, Trey Burton throws it back to him. Incredible score right there. And then the good story was the other quarterback and that was of course, Tom Brady, the Patriots that basically the Hail Mary that wasn't from Tom Brady. He's so famous for making that happen and he didn't. Patriots lose into the Eagles. The fans in Philadelphia going crazy overnight. The Party was on a little out of control (INAUDIBLE) one fan had to say about the big win.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Way overdue. We got it. Eagles.</p><p>CASONE: Overdue is right. Of course, the other big story here was all of those players that yes, stood for the national anthem and of course that national was sung by Pink who is fighting the flu. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: That's how we kicked off the game and of course with Pink who was amazing, of course, patriotic and inspiring then you get after the first two quarters of the halftime show Justin Timberlake did not disappoint, he of course did this entire thing solo we thought Janet Jackson may show up, that was the rumor, she didn't. But I got to tell you, his tribute to Prince, Maria, one for the books.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Oh, it was incredible, Maria. I know that you've interviewed Prince in the past and I got to tell you, it was a fabulous night. The hometown hero, of course, is Prince. It was a great game, Indiana, Indianapolis, Maria. Back to you. . BARTIROMO: Cheryl, you look cold, we are -- we are sending you our hugs and warmth. See you soon. Cheryl Casone there. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The truth about tech. A group of Silicon Valley insiders including early employees of Facebook and Google now say that they are fighting back against what they actually created. According to The New York Times, the new center for humane technology is finding an anti-tech addiction lobbying effort and adds about the effects of social media on young mind. Joining us right now Jeremy Ring, entrepreneur of former Florida State Senator and author of We Were Yahoo! From internet pioneer to the trillion-dollar loss of Google and Facebook. Good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JEREMY RING, AUTHOR, WE WERE YOU!: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you are one of the very first Yahoo! Employees. Tell me about how things have changed and how you see what has happened in Silicon Valley.</p><p>RING: Well, when it started with Yahoo!, I mean, we were the biggest in the world. At the time we were bigger than Disney, News Corp and Viacom combined in terms of value. Now we're probably the only people on planet earth talking about Yahoo! today. So you can tell about how far -- how far it fell. The book and story really is about missed opportunities. We're talking about you just mentioned Google and Facebook. Imagine where were Google and Facebook don't even exist. Yahoo! turned down buying Google one -- for $1 million.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>RING: And that in time again it turned it down for buying it for close to six billion and then it turned down buying Facebook for 1.1 billion. Those two companies are worth of combined $1.2 trillion today. They control our lives as this new group is asserting. And yet, Google would not exist today and Facebook would -- best be a shelf of itself. Had Yahoo! not miscalculated.</p><p>MCSHANE: It all happened kind of quick -- I mean, I don't -- it doesn't seem though but it all did happen fairly quick. I remember thinking I was cool because I had a Gmail address like when they used to send out the invites sitting back then, this is a while ago but it does make you think about, you know, what's next in all of this if you -- if you are the behemoth today, if you're the Facebook or whatever you (INAUDIBLE) be careful because somebody else could always come up and do the same to you I guess, right?</p><p>RING: Yes. We used to call -- in our early days we always say, don't get Netscape. Remember Netscape, Microsoft came in and ate Netscape quickly, then Google came in and ate Microsoft and Microsoft kind of came back. Obviously Apple at one-point was near bankrupt and no -- they would have sold to anybody at the time and they came back. If you're not careful, there's a lot of threats out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, are you saying though, for Facebook or even a Google to avoid the fate of Yahoo!, you need a genius like Steve Jobs because Steve Jobs envisioned a -- basically envisioned a world with technology devices recreated, changed our lives and reinvented Apple. How do Facebook and Google prevent suffering the same fate of Yahoo!?</p><p>RING: Well, it seems they've been preventing through acquisition. And looking to the future, I mean, obviously Google's acquisition of YouTube was significant, and then Facebook went and bought Instagram and -- but beyond that they look into future. You know, Facebook was Artificial Intelligence (INAUDIBLE) drones, driverless cars, healthcare that they announced last week. So they are -- they are saying what is -- what do I need to do next and even if it doesn't make money any time in the near future, they seem to be over, so I feel pretty good that they will be around whether that's good or not, I -- they seem to be much brighter than Yahoo! was.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you have a problem with the addiction on young people.</p><p>RING: Terrible problem with addiction. I mean, Facebook has their -- I guess is a year older, messenger kids app six year olds. And you spend 15 minutes a day I saw Facebook and I see you on Facebook (INAUDIBLE) to services nine hours a day looking at screens and entertainment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But isn't that a parent issue? I mean, shouldn't the parents be doing that? You can't blame Yahoo! Can you?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RING: Oh, you got it. You -- look, if we could -- as a former elected official, if would legislate parenting, the world would be a whole better. So, don't get me wrong. I'm not going to push back at all on something that should be absolutely about parenting. But, you know, the companies also -- it's addictive. They create -- they know how to create, you know, an addictive environment as well. So, it's all society. And by the way, adults are just as addictive as kids. We keep talking but this is a societal problem, it's not just a kids' problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true. Jeremy, good to see you.</p><p>RING: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Jeremy Ring joining us there.</p><p>RING: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up. The Federal Reserve's new penalties against Wells Fargo after the fake account scandal. The CEO and president, Tim Sloan will join me. We will exclusively on that consent decree from the Fed against Wells Fargo. As we take a break, take a look at futures this morning. We are expecting a sharp sell-off at the start of trading this morning. We are off of the lows, nonetheless down 175 points on concerns about the booming economy. We're carefully driving up interest rates and inflation. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, February 5th. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Global markets are under pressure again, inflation fears have taken hold. Dow Industrials expected to be down 150 points right out of the gate this morning. This is off of the lows of the morning. Earlier we had looked at a decline of close to 300 points on the Dow. Markets of course extending Friday's big slide, the Dow was down 665 points on Friday. The worst one-day decline since the Brexit vote back in June of 2016. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 also down roughly two percent apiece. Investors overseas taking a queue from the move in Europe this morning, declines across the board. But the FT-100 and the CAC Quarante down better than one percent and the DAX Index almost one percent. In Asia overnight, a sharp sell-off there as well.</p><p>We did have some positive economic data out of China and the Shanghai Composite was up three quarters of a percent. But the other majors in Asia down across the board with Japan, worst performer down 2-1/2 percent on the Nikkei Average, the worse-day decline there since the U.S. Presidential Election in Japan. Only the Shanghai Composite posting a gain overnight. Investing -- investors are also focused on earnings, Bristol-Myers, Squibb reporting better-than-expected profit in revenue, the stock is up four percent. Bucking the down trend, the pharmaceutical giant also meeting a goal for a late-stage cancer study, the stock is up as you can see there. Chaos in Philadelphia after the Eagles stunned the Patriots in the Super Bowl. Eagles quarterback Nick Foles praising the team's effort and fans after being named Super Bowl MVP.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK FOLES, PHILADELPHIA EAGLES QUARTERBACK: We dreamed about this moment, there's plenty of kids watching this game right now dreaming about this moment someday will be here and to be here with my daughter and my wife, my family, my teammates, this city, we're very blessed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sweet music to Apple there. The company streaming service set to overtake Spotify subscribers. All of that coming up this morning and we got a lot on tap this morning with this market sell-off.</p><p>MCSHANE: It could be one of those -- could be a lot worse than it is right now, and kind of just watching it tick by tick and we were to your point earlier we were down 300 and you got the sense that things were going to get a little bit sloppy and now, we don't get ahead of ourselves, so maybe good sign to see a little bit stability before the opening bell after what we saw on Friday I think, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's see about that. The worry is interest rates as you've been pointing out, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And it was that 2.9 percent increase in average hourly earnings year-over-year that really sparked it on Friday. You had already seen the 10-year yield moving upwards and the higher these longer term rates go now it raise the question with Jay Powell taking over from Janet Yellen as the head of the Federal Reserve ,could the Fed then have to play catch-up and do more than people are expecting and I was pointing out at the top of the hour that you have seen market declines when new Federal Reserve chiefs take over. Remember, Alan Greenspan took over in August 1987 and then you had the market crash roughly two months later. So that was a little bit unexpected but again it's the unknown of how somebody would act as much as people are sure that Jay Powell will be just like Janet Yellen.</p><p>MCSHANE: Just quick thing, you mentioned the reintroduction of volatility earlier that we're not used to this and markets are a little volatile again, that's the VIX which measures fear, of course the fear gage, whatever you want to call it at it -- at its highest level since the day after the election. So, it's a pretty good gain, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, as you said earlier. There's been no volatility whatsoever.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And assets particularly stocks that look overvalued to many people, there was a report out about a week ago that we cited on this very show, do you look at the median price to earnings ratio of all the stocks on the New York Stock ExchangeNASDAQ in the American Stock Exchange, that is at an all-time high.</p><p>CARTER: And let's look also that there is a lot of people saying that we need a correction, so hopefully this will come out fast and then we can move on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean, this is all on the face of good economic strength.</p><p>CARTER: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The backdrop, you're talking about wages up 2.9 percent over the last year, you're talking about growth in terms of three percent. Expectations now for the first quarter up 5.4 percent.</p><p>CARTER: And usually that's what you would expect the President will be talking about, but he has taken credit for so much of the (INAUDIBLE) the so-called Trump bump.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FOLES: Stock markets not going to speak today in Cincinnati.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You try to get credit for it on the way up then you're going to own it on the way down, Mr. President. One other thing that -- about the 10-year yield since the financial crisis, every time you've seen yields get to this level on the 10-year, people have moved in and seen it as a buying opportunity to fixed income investors, that's one of the central questions. Jeff Gun like the famous bond investor gave an interview of \"THE WEEKEND\" and he said he doesn't even think three percent is at that level, he's not sure people will in and start buying treasuries even at a three percent yield.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He also made a prediction about the first quarter.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nominal GDP growth of seven percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Seven percent.</p><p>MCSHANE: Dagen mentioned that earlier, I was like, could you push like the country? I was like --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was talking about China.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right.</p><p>FOLES: That the U.S. I love too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, there's a lot of stimulus, you know, accommodative Federal Reserve even with interest rate increases and this tax reform package being a big, big tailwind for the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We keep seeing companies --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or economy rather.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. For the economy and that -- and that's exactly what happened. But you wonder why it is that what's so unnerving just for three percent, I mean, I recognize as rates go higher that stock investors have a -- have a decision to make, do I want to stay in a safety of treasuries or do I want to take some risk in the stock but three percent, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: No. I know. Historically it's so low and I think part of this is that we haven't had a conversation. When is the last time there was like a serious conversation of country about inflation, you know, being a real issue. I mean, it's got to be -- 10 years ago or whatever it may be, people are actually talking about inflation as an economic issue that we all had to deal with.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We were talking about inflation of stock -- of home prices during the -- during the housing bubble but we weren't talking about inflation.</p><p>MCSHANE: Right. We're just not used to it, so we're thrown off by that conversation again but to Maria's point, you know, three percent on a 10- year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think it's also the great unknown of the Federal Reserve not only of raising short-term interest rates but trying to unwind a four trillion balance sheet and it also goes to the issue of the supply of treasuries both on the short end but also the longer end with these -- with the tax cuts until they begin to somewhat pay for themselves that's going to be a problem for the bond market</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're are going to talk -- I'm sorry, pardon me, Dagen. We're going to talk with the CEO of Wells Fargo coming up, Tim Sloan. But we want to show you what's going on in market first because now big technology is also taking a beating coming after the market had that worst week in two years, last week. Joining us now to weigh in is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney. Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. You mentioned big tech and I, you know, like you, I follow very, very closely. I'm noticing the premarket this morning, Apple is below 160, Microsoft has threatened to go below 90, Facebook is below 190, Amazon is close to dropping below 1400. So, there's a lot of pressure on them but I want to pick up on your conversation just a couple seconds ago. How many times, Maria, have we said that future profits are the bedrock of today's stock prices? I mean, we say it all the time and I think that's accurate, profitability of American corporations dictates their stock price. But if we're looking at significant increases in profits down the road because of tax reform and for whatever reason a growing economy, why would the market tank right now? And surely that extra profitability down the road would limit today's losses or this week's losses or last week's losses. I would have thought that the expectation of profit will narrow the loss that we're now in. That's my point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I think you make a good point because we are talking about what, 23 percent earnings growth in 2018, Stu. These are really good numbers. And I'm really -- Dagen just talk about Jeff Gundlach, very high profile, mutual fund manager who's talking about seven percent nominal growth. Seven percent in the first quarter, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, I heard the Atlanta Fed talk five percent growth which is a knockout, seven percent is truly stunning but in that environment of growth and profitability I think the loss will be limited, that's my point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes. Backdrop is pretty strong.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Those profits are worthless though, Stuart if interest rates are a lot higher, that's the issue playgrounds the stock market.</p><p>VAUSE: I take your point, but again, I think the loss will be limited but far for me to predict the stock market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stu, I'm looking forward to joining you in the next hour.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. Good stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I will see you soon. Stu, thanks so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern. We're going to talk with the CEO and President of Wells Fargo in an exclusive interview right after this short break. .</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The shackles on Wells Fargo, the Federal Reserve has slapped Wells Fargo with an unprecedented punishment for years of misconduct including the creation of millions fake user accounts. The punishment imposed on Janet Yellen's last day as chiarman of the Fed will restrict growth at Wells to under $2 trillion in assets. Pressure the removal of four Wells Fargo board members and require the submission of detailed plans to remedy Wells Fargo's wrongdoing. Joining me right now in an exclusive interview is Wells Fargo and company CEO and President, Tim Sloan. Tim, thanks very much for joining us this morning. We appreciate your time.</p><p>TIM SLOAN, CEO, WELLS FARGO: Oh, you're welcome, Maria. It's great to see you and be with your viewers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Your reaction to what the Fed instituted on Friday?</p><p>SLOAN: Sure. Maria, there is no doubt it was a disappointment. But I think the important point is that we've been making fundamental changes at Wells Fargo since I became CEO about 16 months ago. We've addressed leadership concerns, we've made fundamental changes in terms of how we're organized, we've invested billions of dollars in improving risk management practices. We have addressed any concerns that customers have including remediating customers who were impacted by the retail sales practices issue. And so, that the issue is that the Fed called out in order, our items that we are in midst of correcting anyway, and we have been for months. And in fact, in the order itself, the Fed highlighted the changes that the board has made as well as the changes that management has made to -- make Wells Fargo a better company and address these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and you have announced a lot of the changes that you have been putting in place, over the last year, but given the fact that your asset size is dependent on the positive growth and if your growing deposits by what 4.6 percent a year or so. This consent order is going to force to you shrink your business, right? I mean, (INAUDIBLE) forced you to shrink some businesses in order to keep your assets flat so where do the -- which areas are you going to shrink?</p><p>SLOAN: Well, first and foremost, Maria, Wells Fargo is absolutely open for business. We can operate our company, serve our customers, with the $2- trillion balance sheet that you referred to. There are some areas, where we've outgrown our balance sheet because there have been opportunities created from some of our competitors. We will be reducing some non- operational deposits, we'll reduce some short-term investments, we'll reduce some deposits that we get from other banks, but overall, the order allows to us operate the company in a make-sense way so that we can continue to grow loans, Maria, as you know, we're the largest lender in this country, and being able to provide credit to our customers is not only critical for them but critical for economic growth, and then we'll continue to be able to take deposits from most of our customers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this morning, we're seeing a lot of your analysts react on Wall Street, everybody is downgrading the stocks, several downgrades on Wells Fargo shares, and obviously, the stock is down two percent right now, Tim. I mean, isn't it true as one analyst write, the operating leverage story is now delayed. The fact that now you are getting a restriction to growth just at the same time that we're actually seeing growth expand in the U.S. You're not going to be able to take advantage of that broader growth because you've got a restriction on growth.</p><p>SLOAN: No, Maria, I would push back on that. Again, Wells Fargo is open for business, we will be able to grow loans we will be able to grow deposits and serve our customers. It restricts our balance sheet growth but it doesn't restrict our ability to serve almost all of our consumers, that's what I communicated to our team on Friday and I'll re-communicate that to them again today. I want them out there serving our customers and being part of the continued economic growth of this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure, of course, but I'm just saying that it's unlikely that you can take full advantage of the economic growth story that is at your -- at your request fingertips here, even though you have got a risk you have terrific cash flow, significant excess capital position. You've got a risk here because you've got to limit growth, do you think this punishment was too severe?</p><p>SLOAN: You know, Maria, let me get back to your last question and then I'll answer that one. We were very clear on our call with our analyst investors on Friday that we think that net income after tax impact of the restriction of balance sheet growth this year will be $300 million to $400d million. We expect to have this cap lifted because, again, all the activities that the Fed would like us to improve on are the same ones that we like to improve on, and we believe that, well, it's likely that the asset cap could get lifted by the end of the year. So, we think the earnings impact is primarily focused now.</p><p>Again, to get back to your point about taking part in economic growth, you know, since the beginning of the year, we've seen an increase in our loan pipelines, and our expectations is that we'll be able to take a part in that economic growth. Again, there's no restriction on growing loans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SLOAN: There's no restriction on providing credit, there's no restrictions on growing retail deposits, and so, we'll continue to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, will -- so will you have to shrink the trading and financial -- and the financial franchise to make room for more loans?</p><p>SLOAN: Maria, we have access liquidity at the company -- what we talked about on Friday, and provided a fair amount of detail in the deck that we provided to investors and analysts is that the three areas that will be focused on, making sure that we manage appropriately to get -- to stay below the cap; are one, non-operational deposits; two, deposits that we received from some financial institutions; and three, our short-term investments. That will allow us ample room to be able to grow, loans, serve customers, and grow deposits.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, you said that this is obviously going to start being in the rear-view mirror at some point. You said perhaps at the end of the year. What gives you that indication that this is going to be no longer a problem by year-end?</p><p>SLOAN: Well, again, it's my hope that that's -- and my expectation that that will be the case. And I say that for two reasons, Maria. First, in the order is very specific -- there's a very specific timeframe by which we're going to provide two different plans, to the Fed, the Federal Reserve, will review those plans, we'll bring a third party in to make sure that all the changes that we have been making and will make have been implemented and adopted within the company. That -- the next report by the third party is due by the end of September. And my expectation is that we'll meet and exceed the expectations of the Fed. And again, I think it's reasonable to assume that the cap could be lifted by year-end.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the cap could be lifted by year-end. Let me ask you this, have you done work in terms of replacing these four board members? You've already said that you put plans in place in terms of new board members, and you've made those announcements publicly. What else -- what other changes are on the horizon in terms of these board members?</p><p>SLOAN: Yes, Maria, it's a really good question and observation. I think that the reporting related to these board members was mischaracterized. And, in fact, I know the Fed has been out speaking with the media to correct any mischaracterization that occurred on Friday. Our board has been making fundamental changes in terms of its governance, in terms of its oversight and refreshing board members over the last year. We've brought on six incredibly talented new board members since in the last year. We also brought in Mary Joe White, the former chair of SEC to assist in our board review and governance. So, we've made a lot of fundamental changes and we'll continue to listen to our shareholders as well as other stakeholders in terms of other changes that the board needs to make.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, we've been talking largely about the broader environment for financials, given the fact that interest rates are starting to go up, and net interest margins you expect to be -- to be a positive rather than a headwind going forward. Also, the backdrop of economic growth, and a rollback in regulations. But it seems, Tim, that Wells Fargo is not going to be able to really participate in a lot of the positives happenings for the broader averages and the broader banking sector because of these restrictions. So, I ask you again, do you see this as too strict? I mean, isn't this handicapping you?</p><p>SLOAN: Maria, there's no question that it's a disappointment. But, again, just to politely push back, Wells Fargo is open for business. We have 260,000 of the best team members in the industry that serve our customers every day. We will participate in the economic growth of the country, we'll participate and be a part of the economic growth of our customers. We're the largest mortgage lender in this country, we're the largest agricultural lender, we're the largest small business lender. We just did a survey of our small businesses along with Gallup, and they're as optimistic as they've been in over a decade, so we'll be able to participate in the growth. It's just that we're going to do that in a way that we maintain a level of as of 12:31 of our balance sheet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But the Federal Reserve is basically saying we're not changing this decree until we absolutely see evidence of change in terms of mentality at the bank and the change in terms of consumer protection. So, what specifically are you going to go back to the Federal Reserve to say, here's what we've changed, and we're ready for this decree to be lifted, whether it's at the end of this year or next year or whenever it is, you are going to have to provide evidence that, in fact, there are changes, what is that evidence that you see presenting?</p><p>SLOAN: Oh, sure. I mean, Maria, let's be specific about the order. The order asks for two plans, one, to see continued improvements in government oversight at the board level. That's easy to do because we've already been on that journey as I just mentioned. In terms of change -- or the plan that management is going to provide, they want to see our focus on a compliance plan and an operational plan. We've been well on our way for months, if not, more than a year, in terms of improvements in both compliance and operational risk management. So, it's not as if we're starting from a standing start, we've been working on all these areas now for the last few months if not the last year. And so, that's why I am confident we'll be able to meet and exceed the Fed's expectations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you expected to sell divisions to pair back on certain divisions like the trading business given the fact that you are needing to stay under this cap of $1.95 trillion in assets, Tim?</p><p>SLOAN: No, not at all. There's -- there are no requirements in the -- in the consent order for any asset divestitures. Now having said that, we've been on a journey over the last couple of years to make sure that we've got the right businesses serving our customers. And so, we sold our crop insurance business a year ago. We sold our shareholder services business, in fact, we just announced that last week, we sold our commercial insurance brokers business. And so, there have been a number of businesses that we've decided are better in the hands of others, and we can return more -- it allows us to return more capital to our shareholders. That's an ongoing review at Wells Fargo that has nothing to do with this consent order. And we have no plans to exit any of our investment banking or trading activities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, Tim, you need to gain back the trust of Wells Fargo clients, we know that, and the Federal Reserve is calling this and that is quote, widespread consumer abuses and compliance break down. How did we get here, Tim? How did that happen?</p><p>SLOAN: Well, Maria, I think it's important to note that there's nothing new in the order. And so, it's bad comment --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, it's widespread consumer abuses, compliance breakdowns. All I'm asking is how did you get here? What do you think as you look back? And I know that you came in, they put you in charge to fix this situation, but how did this happen, a widespread consumer abuse and compliance breakdown?</p><p>SLOAN: Maria, you're absolutely right. We've been making fundamental changes since I became CEO in October of 2016. There's no question that we made some mistakes, we've taken responsibility for that in terms of our retail banking business. What have we done to change that? We ended the retail banking incentive plan. We've got a new plan in place, it's working extremely well. Customers appreciate the change. The reaction from customers today and a retail banking business measured by customer loyalty and customer service has been -- has really been increasing, again, I think, in order there is nothing new that the Fed found. They were talking about history. We agreed that we made mistakes, we're fixing those mistakes or we fixed them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But today, the market is reacting to the impact on your business. The fact that the rest of the industry is going to be growing, taking advantage of increasing growth numbers in the economy and you will be limited in terms of doing that. That's what all the analysts and the market is reacting to today. Tim, your stock is now down eight percent.</p><p>SLOAN: Maria, again, right, Wells Fargo is open for business. We will be able to continue to grow loans. We're -- again, we're the largest lender in the country and we're going to continue to be able to grow deposits for almost all of customers. We just need to be able to do that under a balance sheet cap. Many of our competitors over the last few years have shrunk their balance sheets and still been able to grow. And we expect to be able to serve our customers. Again, we're open for business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you think -- you think that further focus on compliance and on customers obviously widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdown as how the Fed said it, you think you will be able to grow going forward and really focus on that loan business as a result, even though you've got these limitations to grow with the asset size?</p><p>SLOAN: Absolutely. But, Maria, that doesn't take away from the fact that we are focused on improving risk management at Wells Fargo. We believe and we've demonstrated that we can do both at the same time. You've seen the progress over the last year that we've been able to make. You and I have talked about it on a few occasions. And again, I'm confident in our team, I'm confident in our business model and I'm confident we're going to be able to serve our customers even with the asset cap limitation that we have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. This is really a rare decree by the Fed, Tim, were you surprised?</p><p>SLOAN: Well, I was disappointed, for certain. I mean, the Fed had been public about the fact that they've been looking at how to resolve their concerns about Wells Fargo. This is the resolution of those concerns, there's no disagreement between ourselves and the Fed in terms of what we need to do to improve; we will make those improvements in risk management; we have been making those improvements.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure. In 17 months you have. Tim, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us this morning. Tim Sloan there.</p><p>SLOAN: Thank you, Maria. It's a --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sending right over to \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" and Stuart. Stu, over to you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018020503cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RK7-8SW1-DXH2-62BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

This creates a scenario where banks have a pathway to continue making money from traditional banking services but also generate new revenue streams from technological innovation, he said.Gilbert: Take Profits Off The TableEven if the environment for banks remains encouraging, the options market is signaling investors are taking advantage of the recent surge in bank stocks to take some profit off the table, Gilbert[4] told CNBC. After all, banks as a whole offered \"cautious at best\" commentary in their recent round of earnings reports,and investors should be wary ahead of the next round in October, she said. \"We'd actually use [Wednesday's] opportunity to take some profits right here.\"Price ActionShares of the Financial Select ETF were trading higher by more than 1 percent at $29.04 at the time of publication Thursday.

The company said it expects double-digit growth to resume next year in the semiconductor sector.</p><p>Yahoo! shares rose in late trading after the company posted earnings per share of 1 cent, slightly ahead of the break-even consensus forecast. Yahoo! forecast break-even results for the third quarter.</p><p>During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average added 65.38 points, to 10,241.02. New York Stock Exchange trading volume reached 1.38 billion shares.</p><p>Among the 30 Dow industrials, General Motors added $2.73, or 4.3 percent, to $65.47, after upbeat comments by a Lehman Brothers analyst.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble gained $1.74, to $68.75. The consumer products giant boosted its quarterly dividend.</p><p>But the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 1.34, to 1180.18. Overall, losing stocks outnumbered winners by about 5-4 among NYSE-listed issues.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite index added 9.25, to 1972.04, on Nasdaq trading volume of 1.76 billion shares. Losers topped winners by 4-3 among Nasdaq stocks.</p><p>The Dow Jones transportation average advanced on an upbeat earnings forecast by CSX and news that Canadian authorities had approved the proposed acquisition of Rosemont-based Wisconsin Central Transportation by Canadian National Railway. The deal still needs approval from U.S. regulators.</p><p>The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks dropped 2.31, to 475.83.</p><p>Treasury securities ended slightly lower. The Treasury's auction of $5 billion in 10-year inflation-protected notes, called TIPS, brought a yield of 3.50 percent, down from 3.52 percent at the previous TIPS auction in January.</p><p>Dollar days: The dollar has slumped against major foreign currencies in recent days, but investors looking for a slide in the dollar to boost profits of U.S. multinationals may be in for a disappointment.</p><p>The surprising strength in the dollar this year, despite repeated cuts in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve and an unattractive U.S. stock market, has sliced into the reported revenues and profits of U.S. exporters.</p><p>A stronger dollar makes U.S. exports less competitive overseas and forces multinationals to take a hit when they translate overseas results into dollars.</p><p>But the dollar strength is better described as weakness in the euro and the yen. Until economic growth in Europe and Japan accelerate, the dollar will retain its global position as the storehouse of value.</p><p>The Clinton administration, in the person of former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, left a powerful political legacy in favor of a strong dollar. That legacy persists, even if the dollar has become too strong.</p><p>Moreover, the lack of demand for U.S. exports reflects global economic weakness, not the relative value of the dollar, said Carl Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics. \"The impact of the stronger dollar on U.S. growth prospects is very limited,\" he said.</p><p>Local news: Downers Grove-based Vysis, a developer of medical diagnostic materials relating to genetic diseases, fell $3, to $21. Its principal shareholder, petrochemical giant BP, said it plans to divest its 65.5 percent stake in Vysis.</p><p>- Goldman Sachs, which was not a principal underwriter of this year's $31-a-share initial public offering of Northfield-based Kraft Foods, began research coverage of the stock with an \"outperform\" rating, citing a sluggish outlook for sales. Shares slipped 5 cents, to $30.30.</p><p>- Salomon Brothers named Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, as one of its 15 \"exceptional names\" for the year. Abbott, which is scheduled to post second-quarter results Thursday, rose $1.78, to $50.18. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHTRIB-0107120230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHTRIB2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:43GP-3MK0-010D-X522-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8119</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2001 Chicago Tribune Company</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Tribune</publicationName><edition>NORTH SPORTS FINAL EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>July 12, 2001 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0001T6V</classCode><className>YAHOO!

Not the kind that you see in movies, or in black and white TV shows where someone gets stuck and then slowly disappears. It was more than 30 years ago. We had a young fellow walking well out in front, a Haitian immigrant. I liked him a lot. We also had a kid walking each flank, and one on rear guard. I was the one in the center with the map and the compass. There was only one way to get around in those days. No GPS. If you got lost out in the rain forest, then you really got lost.</p><p>For the uninitiated, navigating through a jungle environment is extremely difficult. In a normal circumstance you would shoot your azimuth (direction), and hopefully find something noticeable and distant directly in your path, walk to that spot, and repeat as often as necessary. In the jungle, nothing visible is very distant. It's when you need to move around large obstacles that one's math skills are put to use. Know your stride. Understand the impact of slope upon personal stride, and understand geometry. If you can't use a protractor on a map, then you can't lead.</p><p>One day, my point man disappeared right in front of my eyes. In a flash. He was there, and then he wasn't. All that was left was a patrol cover floating on top of some kind of disgusting goo. One of the other guys in the squad (also a Haitian immigrant) happened to be one of the biggest folks I had ever met. This fellow was a former college level offensive lineman who had been to camp as a free agent with the New York Jets. Cut early in camp, he had made a different decision with his career trajectory. These two were fast friends. This football player quickly threw off all of his gear, and put most of his body into that goo, and fished around for his friend. None of the rest of us would have been large enough or strong enough. The point man was a small guy, thank goodness. A scary amount of time passed. The large one grabbed onto something, and finally pulled the other (just covered in the worst stuff, and gasping for oxygen) out of the murk. One of the scariest things that I have ever witnessed. Etched on my brain til my dying day.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks To Avoid</emphasis><br/></p><p>There are a few stocks that remind me of quicksand. That's where I was actually trying to go with that memory. These are not actually short calls. I don't get short a lot of equity. if I don't like a stock, I could sell calls, which is dangerous if you're naked the stock. I would in many cases rather buy puts, though I am slow to lay out capital in this way. I find that selling/writing options is better for the P/L ration over time than buying options. Just as you have a shopping list for down days, every one of you should also have a mental list of stocks you avoid.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">1) </emphasis>Facebook </emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: </emphasis></emphasis>This one is fairly new to my list. Revenue stream? Growing business? Seemingly tame forward looking valuation? Sure, you may answer yes to all of the above. I feel that there is now too much uncertainty connected to the name, especially now that both CEO Mark Zuckerberg before Congress, and VP of Global Marketing Carolyn Everson in London, have told you that overhead is only going to increase as more employees are brought on to monitor abuse. Any loss of revenue could be short-term in my opinion, but hiring is long-term, and any coming regulation is sure to squeeze profit margins. I am long several FB put options. I think the stock revisits last week's lows, and might consider an equity long position if entry might be gained significantly lower than current levels (perhaps below 140).</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2) Wayfair </emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">:</emphasis> There just seems to be something wrong here. Yes, I know that Citron Research warned on Wayfair earlier this month. I do not always agree with Citron, in fact, being long a name such as Nvidia  , I don't always appreciate their commentary. That said, this firm is something of an enigma to me. Net Sales show dramatic improvement year over year, yet Net Income plummets. EBITDA, Gross profit margins, Sales turnover, and return on assets all seem to headed in the wrong direction over time. Perhaps even scarier is a Quick Ratio that persists at levels below 1.00 even with total cash and equivalents that grew 78% from Q4 2016 to Q4 2017. Hmm. Might it be that total debt grew more 1300% over that same time frame? Maybe.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3) Tesla</emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: </emphasis></emphasis>Have the short sellers already missed their chance here? I will readily admit that this is the one stock that I have regularly shorted over time (with some wins &amp; losses). Fundamentals are meaningless here. The imagery of an obviously playful CEO at a time when such playfulness was obviously inappropriate was tough on the eyes. This is the current deal. The share price reacted well to the Q1 update. There is no doubt that as Musk ramps up S3 production, gross margins contract. Are rising expenses sustainable? Musk has always been golden when it comes to raising cash. Can this be counted on? He will have to find out prior to year's end. Don't forget that the US EV (Electric Vehicle) tax credit starts to phase out this year. That might pull consumption forward (as you may now be seeing). That may also spell doom for this name, especially as competition from traditional automakers is only going to continue to increase. Given a chance to short this name above 305 in the short-term, I likely do so small. No size positions taken in cult stocks. Not ever.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GoAmateur</emphasis><br/></p><p>GoPro  has seen it's share price decline by 41% over the past year. Yet, in Thursday trade, the shares increased in value by more than 7% on speculation. Thank a circulated report that China's Xiaomi has contemplated acquisition. Unless you indeed buy this name on pure spec, I can not for the life of me, even imagine spending five bucks on one share of this stock. For that money, I would rather buy a gallon and a half of gasoline, or maybe two gallons of milk. Other than the fact that competition is fierce, and really anybody who can manufacture a camera can do what this firm does, what's really wrong with this company? The real question is where to even begin? Drones? No, GoPro already exited that business.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">1) For Q4 2016, the firm reported EPS of $-0.30 on revenue of $338.4</emphasis></emphasis> (-38% y/y/), both numbers badly missing expectations. the firm reports Q1 2018 data on May 3rd. Expectations are currently for $-0.48 on about $175.4M. If they hit this revenue number, that would represent a 19.7% drop from Q1 2017.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2) Over the past year, Gross Profit Margins have dropped</emphasis></emphasis> from 41.3% to 26.6%, while Operating Margins have plummeted from a barely profitable 1.9% to -16.3%.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">3) In that same span of time, book value has dropped</emphasis></emphasis> from 3.16 to 2.18, and total debt has ballooned from nearly zero to $130M. While Current ratios remain a comfortable looking 1.55, and show improvement, once inventories are stripped out, the Quick Ratio languishes below 1.00, and you know what that means. (For you non-accounting majors, that means in theory that the firm could have a problem meeting short to medium term cash needs if forced to liquidate.) Is solvency an issue? They do have some nice cash on hand, so .. no, not yet. That said, growth is certainly a problem.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economics</emphasis> (All Times Eastern)</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">07:30 - Fed Speaker:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Boston Fed Pres.

Let's take a closer look at three such stocks, and why they might still have room to run.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Image source: Getty Images.</p><p>Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) supplies manufacturing equipment, services, and software to semiconductor, display, and solar module makers across the world. Rebounding demand for semiconductors, NAND flash memory chips, and high-quality OLED displays helped Applied Materials post double-digit annual sales growth over the past two quarters. In 2016, the company's orders, revenue, and earnings all hit their highest levels in the company's 29-year history.</p><p>Analysts expect\u00a0Applied Materials' revenue to rise 17% this year, compared to 12% growth in\u00a0fiscal 2016. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to rise 34% this\u00a0yearand to 47% growth last year. That makes its current P/E of 21 -- which is lower than the industry average of 26 for semiconductor equipment companies -- still look cheap after its 70% rally over the past 12 months.</p><p>Applied Materials almost merged withTokyo Electron last year, but the plan was scrapped due to antitrust issues. However, the company could still swallow up some smaller supply chain players to widen its moat against potential rivals.</p><p>One of Applied Materials' biggest customers is\u00a0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the largest pure-play semiconductor foundry in the world. Only three foundries --Intel,Samsung, and GlobalFoundries -- have comparable chipmaking facilities. \"Fabless\" chipmakers, which don't manufacture their own chips, usually rely on one of those four companies to manufacture their chips.</p><p>Shares of TSMC rallied more than 30% over the past 12 months on rising semiconductor demand and strong sales of iPhones. Earlier this year, analysts cited by the Taipei Times estimated that orders from\u00a0Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 10% of TSMC's revenue last year. That percentage likely increased this year as TSMC became the exclusive supplier of Apple's A10 chips, instead of splitting Apple's orders with Samsung.</p><p>Image source: Apple.</p><p>That's why TSMC's revenue and earnings respectively surged 22% and 28% annually last\u00a0quarter. Analysts expect its revenue to improve another 14% this year, and for earnings to grow by 9%. Those estimates would likely be higher ifQualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) hadn't reportedly inked\u00a0an exclusive deal with Samsung's foundry for the production of its Snapdragon 830 processors. Nonetheless, TSMC's P/E of 16, which is lower than the industry average of 22 for semiconductor/IC makers, makes it a fairly cheap play at current prices.</p><p>Qualcomm, the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, is expected to post just 1% sales growth and 7% earnings growth this year. Its chipmaking business, which generates most of its revenue, remains under pressure from cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party ARM chips from Apple, Samsung, andHuawei. Its patent licensing business, which generates most of its profits, faces pressure from defiant OEMs and regulators which claim that its cut (up to 5% of the wholesale price of a device) is too high.</p><p>However, the bulls believe that Qualcomm's \"best in breed\" SoCs will remain the preferred chipsets for premium flagship devices, and that new licensing agreements (especially with Chinese OEMs) will keep its licensees in check. Qualcomm is also expanding into chipsets for adjacent markets like Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets, wearables, home automation devices, drones, and connected cars.</p><p>These new chipsets could diversify its top line away from mobile devices. To accelerate that expansion, Qualcomm acquired IoT/automotive chipmaker CSR last year, and agreed to buy automotive chipmakerNXP Semiconductors\u00a0earlier this year. If you believe in Qualcomm's expansion and recovery plans, its current P/E of 18 -- which is lower than the industry average of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies -- looks cheap relative to its long-term growth potential.</p><p>Applied Materials, TSMC, and Qualcomm all rode high on the recovery of the semiconductor market over the past year. All three stocks still look cheap relative to their industry peers, but investors should realize that an unexpected slowdown in chip demand could also cause their rallies to peter out. If you have a bullish outlook on the semiconductor market, these three stocks could be great investments. But if you don't, you should probably check out cheap stocks in other industries instead.</p><p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity</p><p>The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

How to deal with unstructured data</emphasis></p><p>Unlike the narrow types of data consumer companies parse to get insight on buying decisions, the healthcare industry gets data from a much wider variety of sources and in a much wider variety of formats. To get the full benefit of all that information, it somehow needs to be integrated and processed so it can undergo analysis.</p><p>Intelligence agencies developed the concept of a \u201cdata lake\u201d after the 9/11 Commission cited them for data gaps they could have closed by sharing information they had on hand. According to Vigilante, federal healthcare agencies face an analogous situation now. Without the ability to integrate and share information, the analysis that could trigger new connections, hypotheses and discoveries could end up sitting in agency databases indefinitely, just waiting to be uncovered.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. How to share data without sacrificing security</emphasis></p><p>Healthcare data are also subject to a huge amount of regulation\u2014and for good reason. The intelligence agencies have deep experience handling sensitive information, however. The authors' key recommendation here is something intelligence data scientists call \u201ccell-level security.\u201d That means systems control access to pieces of information at the most granular level possible. Vigilante cites systems such as Accumulo, which allows fine-grained control.</p><p>\u201cIf you imagine a data lake as a spreadsheet of infinite size, each cell has an item of data in it, and each item has a metatag that can be regulated to say who can access that item of data in that cell by their role, or even limit the time of day they can look at it\u2014it's an extraordinary level of security,\u201d he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/onc-unveils-long-awaited-information-blocking-rule\">HIMSS19: ONC unveils long-awaited information blocking rule</url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. How to measure and ensure data quality</emphasis></p><p>One of the other issues with large, varied data sets is the wide spectrum of quality in the underlying data. \u201cIn big tech, with enough reinforcement and alignment it's okay to have low-quality data streams because they're drowned out,\" Escaravage said.</p><p>Healthcare and intelligence have more urgent needs for precision. \u201cOne observation could indicate a completely different set of circumstances\u2014and it's not just quality, but methods: you have to understand the provenance of the data, the platform that did the collection, and the end-to-end lineage.\u201d</p><p>Intelligence agencies deal with that issue through strict tagging of data and go a step further by requiring the deep involvement of data scientists within the overarching data pipeline. That's an area healthcare will need to address, because this type of analysis requires a more dynamic approach to dealing with the source data than medical researchers typically take, according to Escaravage.</p><p>\u201cHaving the skillset to query into a data lake versus a static report is completely different,\u201d he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRCHLC-628581</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRCHLC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W48-CMX1-DXM4-G03N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"683\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FierceHealthcare</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 16, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001Z8M</classCode><className>BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS541611 ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT &amp;

The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has rallied 30.5%, the SPDR KBW Regional Banking KRE[1] Index has risen 23% and the S...00 Index has gained 27.2% during the same period.However, the rally hasn't been a smooth one. Banks faced a number of concerns, including the Federal Reserve's accommodative stance that led to three interest rate cuts this year. This essentially offset the positive effect of last year's higher rates. Also, flattening/inversion of yield curve, the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict and expectations of global economic slowdown resulted in bearish investor sentiments. </p><p>But banks were able to overcome the challenging operating backdrop on the back of strong domestic economy (which is expected to continue), modest loan demand, strong balance sheet position and improving asset quality.Further, banks continue undertaking several initiatives that will improve revenue mix, diversify footprint and offer cross selling opportunities. Moreover, technology upgrades are expected to help ward off competition from big tech firms and FinTechs.Additionally, easing of regulations and large amount of free cash (owing to lower corporate tax rates) have upped banking industry's M...ctivities. In one of the biggest banking deals in a decade, BB...orp acquired SunTrust Banks to form the sixth largest bank (in terms of assets) in the United States - Truist Financial TFC[2]. Though the chances of any such a large transaction in the coming year are less, several small and mid-sized banks will continue to resort to inorganic growth strategy to generate revenue and cost synergies.While these are likely to support banks' financials in 2020, investors must keep an eye on the effect of lower interest rates and other geopolitical matters.Bank Stocks to Stay Away From for 2020While it will be wise to invest in bank stocks at present, not all have strong prospects.

Inge is Chairman, President, and CEO -- he's to my left -- of 3M. He became CEO in February of this year; Chairman in May. And prior to that, Inge was Chief Operating Officer of 3M.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He has held numerous management positions, both domestically and internationally, with 3M since 1979. But he cautions me he joined in grammar school. So, in case anyone is trying to figure out the dates.</p><p>And to his left, we have David Moline, CFO. He has held this position since March of last year. He joined 3M in 2008 as Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Prior to that, he was with General Motors and had roles including CFO of North America and CFO of Europe.</p><p>So with that, I'm going to hand the mike over to Inge, who is going to give us a quick update on the Company. Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, CEO, 3M COMPANY: Okay. Thank you, and good morning. Been in the Company for 30 years, so I'd like to give a little bit of perspective on why this is an incredible Company in terms of competitive advantages. So, first of all, I led the international for eight years became a before I COO last year in May, and then took over the CEO position this year in February.</p><p>The competitive advantage and position for 3M is [the capital]. First of all, it's a unique culture of innovation. And innovation, research, and development is the center of the plan for us and has been for many, many years, and will remain with the same as we move forward, which means that we are able to develop new products and solutions for our customers in order for them to become better. So it's an important element in our plan.</p><p>We have a broad-based portfolio, and its broad and it's deep. And every segment we are in, on the six business segments, are leading in their respective markets. And all of them have over 20% operating income margins, so very strong position.</p><p>Like many strengths from the Company in terms of, first of all, technologies, process manufacturing, global presence, and brand equity and, in addition to that, a very collaborative team around the world that are working together in order to find solutions based on technology platforms. Then, the way we can manufacture that and then how we can commercialize it on a global and local scale, and that's another thing to think about 3M.</p><p>We are both global in terms of capabilities, but we're very local in terms of our execution with subsidiaries in most countries around the world, which makes a unique element of us to be first into every country. We don't go through distribution as the first layer into a country. We do it through our own subsidiaries.</p><p>There are many leverage points for 3M and one is, of course, manufacturing capabilities. The other one is technologies. And then it's the infrastructure, with subsidiaries around the world that everyone can use as they are moving into the country and commercialize the products. And then we have an embedded operational excellence model that I think we are well known for, well respected for, which is based on Lean Six Sigma.</p><p>If you take that together with what we have done over the years, we have had outstanding performance relative to return of investor capital, very strong balance sheet, and we have returned a lot of good cash flow for the shareholders. So if you think about it, since 2004 we have had margins ahead of 20% every year. And we have had a return of invested capital about 20% for the last decade, including 2008 and 2009. So, very impressed impressive from that perspective, and sales have doubled in the last decade from $16 billion to $30 billion.</p><p>So -- and relative to this year, then, first half of the year, record sales of $15 billion; records earning per share of $3.25 per share and we took also $0.07 or one-time actions, which was in order to improve our businesses as we move ahead. Pricing was good and productivity was good, specifically relative to manufacturing and productivity. And on top of that, we have been able to really drive a good balance in between investment and cost management during the first part of the year.</p><p>As we move ahead, a couple of things that we're doing [which help with] framing us for the future with a new vision for the Company that we've laid out. We have restated six strategies; four are on growth, one around people, and one is around operational excellence. And we have [type of] formed three new divisions into the Company in areas where we believe we have big opportunities for the future.</p><p>We formed Mining, Oil, and Gas, as a division. We formed Aerospace as a division, and we formed Defense as a division. So, three new divisions were formed.</p><p>We also consolidated six divisions into three divisions. Stationery and Office Supply, two sizable divisions of around $800 million each, was formed and consolidated to one big division, all relative to relevance to the market. Safety, Security, and Track and Trace was consolidated into one business and the same was with the Home Environment that was moved into a Do-It-Yourself Division in the Company. So in terms of forming new divisions for opportunities, three were formed and we were consolidating six into three.</p><p>We also made a step-up change relative to our commercialization perspective and appointed a vice president for sales on a global base, vice president of marketing excellence on a global base. And we put the total focus on Lean Six Sigma, also from a central position in order to improve efficiency and productivity, of course, in the Company. So I think those steps are important for us as we move ahead, specifically relatively to what where we stand.</p><p>We have a very strong position in research and development; we are very strong in manufacturing; and now we will go for a global execution in terms of commercialization, and that is why we [don't have] stepped up sales and marketing, e-transformation, that type of sense of excellence as we move ahead. So with that, I am done and I think we go to questions and answers to me and David.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Thank you, Inge. As you get seated, one of the reasons we wanted to have 3M kick the conference off is because you touch so many end markets, and especially on a shorter cycle basis, so visibility on the macro is very helpful. And so maybe we can start there.</p><p>Geographically, take us through -- let's start with Europe in terms of what you're seeing. It's 23% of your revenues. You're a little bit weaker in the second quarter. Healthcare was fairly strong, but what additional color can you provide at the ground level in Europe today?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: We just came back from Europe, actually; David and myself and the team was over there last week. And we knew, as we moved into this year, that it would be a tough year. So we had planned very well for that in terms of the efficiency for us and the plan for us in West Europe is very much along operational excellence.</p><p>And that had started for us a couple of years back when we [took an] adjusted organization in Europe and went for more regional organizational structure with a subsidiary, [like] subsidiary. So we tried to drive efficiency in the back office, specifically, why we maintained the front and in terms of commercialization. We knew that this would be a tough year and we are operating relative to plan.</p><p>We're doing very well in terms of margins. And, I would say, generally speaking, is of course currency that is a headwind for us. But we're very pleased with the way they operate in Europe. And, as I said, this was nothing for us that came as a surprise.</p><p>I think had planned for tougher times in Europe, generally speaking, three to four years back when we both separated Central East Europe from West Europe and Middle East/Africa from West Europe. And then in West Europe we regionalized that portion. So we formed or rather had four subsidiaries in Nordic; we now have one regional organization there. The same with Alpine, the same for [Algeria], and the same for Benelux, so it's working well for us.</p><p>But it's a tough situation. I think operational excellence is important for us and we take market share.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You mentioned currency. With the weakening dollar, how does that ripple into, quickly, into the P&amp;L? You're one of the few companies that we cover that those currency hedging. So is it -- what's the delay factor (multiple speakers) see it?</p><p>DAVID MELINE, SVP, CFO, 3M COMPANY: So the way we do hedging for the business is, basically, we do it on a 12-month rolling basis and we hedge roughly 50% of our net exposure. So that gives us some visibility. In terms of exchange rate movements, we're able to have some visibility in forecast of the impact of those movements.</p><p>So as we finish the second quarter, when we issued guidance, we'd actually indicated that we were updating the outlook for the year assuming the euro would be at EUR1.21 against the dollar. Obviously above EUR1.30 where we are sitting today is certainly supportive to our results on the year. As to how significant that is, quite honestly, it's relatively insignificant within the context of the fact that we only have a few months left in the year.</p><p>We have the hedge, which certainly offsets about half of that impact. So I would say no material change vis-a-vis our forecast, but certainly on the margin it's supportive to the results.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That's helpful. Just go back to Europe for a second. A term we always use and that we look for is destocking. And you, of all your SKUs, can get a flavor whether a destocking element has run through or not. So where does that stand?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: I think it's very lean. I think most companies today, globally, to be honest, are really -- have taken action relative to the inventory levels. So I think that the stock levels are now very much based on demand, and we don't see any -- have not seen any difference in the last six months.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Okay. China, 9% of revenues; second quarter was exceptionally strong -- 10% organic revenue growth. That's excluding electronics. Again, healthcare was one of the strengths. So from the businesses that you touch today, how does China feel?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: First of all, the fact that first quarter this year, excluding electronics, was growth of 8%. Second-quarter, as you said, was growth of 10%. China start to slow the second half of last year, as Europe did, meaning that the comparison for the rest of the year will be easier for us. Healthcare is doing very well, not only in China, but broad-based, healthcare for us in international and specifically in developing emerging countries are doing very, very well.</p><p>And so when you -- when we look upon -- in China, we know that we will have faster growth in the second part of the year due to comparisons and it seems better. And I think about the three laggards, as we have talked about before relative to China, in terms of consumer electronics, domestic markets and export to West Europe, I think that -- we now hope that both domestic market is coming back, and so consumer electronics export to West Europe will probably take some time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: If we switch into the US side of the macro, the fiscal cliff, I've heard everything from some off-road equipment customers saying, I'm going to hold off until the elections. Are you seeing that mentality ripple into any 3M's businesses?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: No, we have -- it's very difficult for us to determine that. I cannot say that we have seen that definition. US, for us, and I would say North America, including Latin America, has been the fastest-growing geographical areas for us in the first part of the year, which is very unusual anyway. And it's very difficult for us to say that there has been any impact relative to the cliff that you are talking about.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: So if we step away from macro -- and certainly, during Q&amp;A, if people have other questions, feel free to focus there. One of the points I wanted to touch on here is, Inge, you took the reins this year for 3M. The idea is I think investors and analysts are still getting to know who you are and what you are tenure as the leader for 3M, how that will develop, and what mark you will make on the Company.</p><p>So, from my perspective, you are the consummate insider; so 30 years with the Company, deep culture carrier. So from this point, how do you think investors will see how Inge makes his imprint on the Company?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Well, I think, first of all, insider, yes, maybe; but also an outsider. I am very market and customer oriented, and I lived all over the world. So I've had a lot of experience from the outside of 3M relative to the market. So I think that's important to put into the picture.</p><p>So I think the other thing that is advantage for me, I've had opportunities to be part of this Company for many years. And for the last 10 years in the two strategic cycles, I was part of the management working on that. And the two cycles had a couple of different characteristics in terms of playbook. The first five years, 2000 to 2005, was very much about efficiency, operational excellence, and productivity through Lean Six Sigma at the time.</p><p>The second part was very much about the big dream, really invigorating research and development and drive up the pipeline on new product. And we started to grow slightly better in the second part of the 10-year period. Now when we go into the next five-year period in terms of strategic plan, it's for us to build on those two streams. We have a very strong DNA in the Company relative to operational excellence. As I said in my opening comments, we're now focusing even more on Lean Six Sigma in order to get focused on it, in order for us to maybe to reinvest for growth. So I think, still, that's an opportunity there.</p><p>And then it's last to globally commercialize in a more effective way the stronger pipeline we have today versus what we had five, six years ago. And as you know, 3M PDI has gone from maybe [20s] up to [32]. So the pipeline is, by definition, much longer. So now it's becoming a commercialization issue for us while we continue to invest in research and development, which I made a very clear statement that that's the commitment for us as we move ahead.</p><p>That's the central to plan. That is the real differentiation for 3M is to be able to invest in research and development and commercialize those products in 3M PDI, in a way, is an important metric. But the very important thing is for us to maintain and improve margins, which we can with the flow of new products that will reposition us and [help our] capital and become even more effective. So that's one thing, so I think you would see a commercialization effort stepped up along that.</p><p>I also think that -- I am an individual that believes in privatization. I think privatization will be a clear thing we will talk about relative to make choices as we move ahead, so I think that's also the differences.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: So you tell me -- again, you're probably reading too much into this, but one of the things I've noticed -- and you just said up here this morning -- are some of the organizational changes, the consolidations of divisions, creating new divisions, and also, geographically, setting up the Saudi Arabia, the Sub-Saharan focuses. Is it an organizational imprint also, an organizational focus (multiple speakers)?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: No. I think it's -- you always talk with the strategists. And the strategies are very much around customers and relevance to customers. I think that's where we start -- what is the relevance for us, relative to customers.</p><p>The other thing is where to play and how to win. The third thing is about investment, research and development. If you take those type of things and you think about consolidation of six divisions down to three, that's very much relative to relevance for us in the market with the customers.</p><p>And I think it's very easy for many companies that you organize yourself based on internal metrics and not external metrics. So I think that's one thing that, if you say consolidation, which is scale and leverage for us, would be easier to do business with.</p><p>The other three divisions that were formed is based on big opportunities in the marketplace, and we need to build that out as a Company and enroll those three places -- Mining, Oil and Gas, Aerospace, and Defense -- we had done business before. But the way we did it was by not focusing in with full investment into research and development. So we took basically what we had in the pipeline, went to market, and tried to commercialize that.</p><p>It's my view, what you need to have in order to win, you need to have your own capabilities in terms of research and development so you can get an organic draw through your own pipeline and new products. And in addition to that, when you put the strong management team in place, which we did, they will also be able to create a much stronger business case for eventually other investments, which could include mergers and acquisitions such as we have. But that's where you try to go with it. So I think strategy is first, structure second.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: And it's probably not a coincidence that when you set up those two divisions right out of the box first quarter, they killed it with, I guess, Natural Resources were up 20% and Arrow up 24%. So if you're going to set them up, you want to set them up with some momentum?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Yes, that's right. I don't think we saw the results already first quarter, to be honest, based on the organization change. The point was, they were doing very well and now the point is how can we accelerate as to that. When we saw all those EBOs, as we call the emerging business opportunities that were put in place, as I said, we tried to commercialize what was already in the pipeline. When we know it's working, then we put more efforts into it.</p><p>So I think we should see even more acceleration. And we have big expectations of those businesses as we now have formed them, right. That's why we expect them to go even faster.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: So the invitation just went out yesterday for the November 8 analyst day in Minneapolis. Matt Ginter will probably cringe if I start out too much to steal any of the thunder he has planned. But one of the questions I have to ask is the 3M pyramid, is that going to be something that will be -- continue to be worshipped and focused and explained, or will that be something that gets put into the closet?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: The pyramid is a way of describing the marketplace and what we are doing in the strategy is to expand our relevance in the market. So I think that the pyramid is more a symbolic way of talking about the total market in terms of our expansion. So we are continuing to work a way to improve our relevance to the customers, to expand the marketplace in terms of presence, both from a portfolio perspective, but also geographically.</p><p>So, conceptually, it's something that is there. And I think it's [easier] for us to manage it with our competitive platforms in order to make sure wherever we compete in the marketplace, that we make money. And for us, in many cases, it's the market share gain, specifically in developed economies, but is profitable market share. We are not after market share for the purpose of market share. You need to be profitable as we take them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: One of the -- in addition to inheriting an earnings guidance for the year, which has been reaffirmed in the second quarter, you also have inherited and you are part of this plan to put -- that set a 7% to 8% organic revenue growth over the course of the cycle. We touched on it previous earnings call; it's still investors' top of mind.</p><p>Is that still achievable? Has the market changed? Has the mix changed at all in terms of what the potential is for that type of growth?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Yes, I think the market has changed since that target was put in place. So it was done in a different economical environment and it was based on what the consensus externally was, relative to the GDP and IPI growth on a global base. So, 7% to 8% were put in place in that environment.</p><p>Now it's a stretch target in a way that, in 3M, we had an organization that responds very well to stretches. So, still, I would say 7% to 8% is a type of stretch target, but I think in an economical environment has changed relative to how achievable that is. So I think that's the answer to the question.</p><p>But -- and I think that if you look up on the last 10 years for us, our growth rate has been actually 7% to 8% in total. Half of that was organic, and we grew 1.5x IPI during that period of time. So we've been, in the last period, grown 3% to 4% organically and now we need to step that up a little bit. So I would say it's a stretch target.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Just in terms of protocol, just as a reminder, so you are going to have a November 8 meeting in Minneapolis. The typical December meeting you have in New York will be a conference call.</p><p>DAVID MELINE: That's correct, yes. That's correct.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: And anything else you can share about the agenda, maybe to start whipping up expectations and a frenzy to get people to storm up to Minneapolis?</p><p>DAVID MELINE: Yes, well, it's always beautiful in Minneapolis in December, as all of us know, so we certainly welcome -- I'm sorry, in November. But, yes, so in November we'll be doing a full review of the businesses. So we'll have several of the sector leaders presenting there.</p><p>Inge will obviously have a significant portion of the morning, where we'll have a chance to discuss in much more depth the vision and strategies for the Company, how we're going to deploy against those. And then will also have -- I'll do an update as to our longer-term thinking around financial objectives and metrics. So I think it will be a really interesting morning and we hope all of you are able to make it out there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I can see Matt Ginter kind of saying, don't disclose too much. All right.</p><p>So, one of the news items I think caught some people by surprise when it was announced, we thought there would be some issues from a regulatory standpoint is the Avery Dennison office products. So just kind of -- and there was some back-and-forth in terms of press announcements. Just kind of frame for us what happened and where it goes from here.</p><p>DAVID MELINE: Yes. So, first of all, there's no new developments in the last -- since the news came out a couple of weeks ago. For those of you who may not be familiar, we entered into a purchase agreement late last year for Avery Dennison's Office Products Group -- $550 million acquisition of that business, to complement our existing office and stationery products business.</p><p>We've been going through regulatory review over the last month, and two weeks ago the Justice Department informed us that they were going to block the transaction. And at that time, we then jointly withdrew our Hart Scott Rodino filing. And what we felt the best course of action for the Company at that time was to look at the concerns the DoJ had an attempt to address those. So that's what we're doing right now. So, stay tuned.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: There's still a potential that something could --</p><p>DAVID MELINE: They have a contract that remains in place at the present time and we are reviewing the situation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Okay. And are there -- just give us a quick update on M&amp;A pipeline, expectations for this year with the budget, and maybe pricing and so forth.</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Maybe I can make some comments on that. First of all, our commitment relative to the value of being $1 billion to $2 billion and we stand behind that. So it will be in terms of value that's important, as we have seen in the last strategic planning session.</p><p>You will probably see slightly bigger than we have done in the past, meaning maybe fewer or slightly bigger. So we did a lot during the last 5 to 6 years, I think with it's around [70]. And so I think you will see fewer, but the most strategically important for us and linked into some of the growth opportunities we see. And they should be a little bit more sizable for us, and they should also -- we should also be able to leverage them and broad-based as we do them, meaning from a technology perspective or from a geographical perspective.</p><p>So that's an important element, but again, our prime strategy is of course organic growth. So the strategy in terms of acquisition is tactically in order to supplement our position as we move ahead. But we are committed to it. The pipeline looked good.</p><p>We are looking at broad-based because it's also a way for us to get the good feeling of the total market and how it looks like. So everyone is working on it. We will, David and myself, together with the team, we will prioritize, however, based on strategic importance as we move ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Anything you can comment on in terms of pricing, seller expectations?</p><p>DAVID MELINE: Yes, I would say, I mean, if you look at the pipeline today -- and, first of all, just to remind us that -- and as we've seen with this recent transaction, we set out a plan of $1 billion to $2 billion deploying against acquisitions this year. The timing is always uncertain as to when you close. So as to whether we will end up in that place this year is still not clear.</p><p>In terms of the pipeline, it's good. I would say we feel good about the pipeline. We feel good about the situation we are in, in that. I would say there is more realistic expectations right now in terms of sellers' expectations than perhaps it was a year and a half ago. And given where we are, given the strength of our balance sheet, that puts us obviously in a very good position to be able to transact, should we identify opportunities that are interesting to us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I want to make sure I had time for any audience questions. So, people, there is a mike around. I know it's still early so there may not be -- and I'm being blocked by a podium here too. So as you mull over questions, how about -- hopefully, you understand this is a high quality problem.</p><p>Second quarter I think more than half the analysts on the conference call asked about pricing. And it was the fact that it was so strong, so it evokes how sustainable is that. But nearly 2%, you raised the higher end for the year. Just in terms of where it goes from here, the sustainability, and what that tells you both about new products and the visibility into 2013.</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Well, maybe I can talk on that. First of all, we took action early in order to make sure, and I think that's the strength of 3M and order to be able to balance what we can do based in terms of demand and raw material increases. So we took action early in order both to make sure that we compensate for raw material increases, at the same time a sure that we still could play in the market based on demand. And it came in place.</p><p>We have -- so our outcome was very, very strong year today, and it's sticking as we move ahead. So I think it's, again, an advantage for us because we often are the price leader in the market segment. So that's also why we, in many cases, can go early when we see raw material coming in and play a potentially negative (inaudible).</p><p>DAVID MELINE: Yes, I would just add to that. So if you look at how price and raw materials trends have developed over really the last now year and a half, we saw very strong raw material cost increases last year exceeding 4%, which is as high as we've seen as a Company in recent history. We had 1% recovery in price last year, which is basically neutralizing that raw material cost impact, in that about 25% of any dollar of revenue is in the form of raw materials.</p><p>As we came into the year, then, we continued to look at the opportunities to get some price performance. We saw momentum in that a lot of the price that was put in place last year only impacted us in the second half. So that momentum carried into the first half.</p><p>So what happens now, as we move forward, the comp gets more difficult because we had price in the second half of last year. And I would say offsetting that is, not surprisingly, raw material costs have certainly softened to the point where we see raw material cost impacts in the second half being either flat or perhaps slightly negative. So that will be a contributor to our profitability and margins here through the balance of the year. I would say not as strong as the first half, but certainly we'll see that continue.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Question up front, yes. We have a mike coming around, too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. The mining end market has been slightly controversy over recently. Can you please address the trends that you are seeing there?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Controversial in terms of --?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Whether there have been some changes in CapEx budgets in Latin America and (multiple speakers) Australia.</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Yes, there has. I think you have to look upon it relative to our relative position and the way we bill it out. For us today, that is around a $900 million business, which we try to ramp up in the plan up to $2 billion. So our base, after this point in time, has been very much around safety and security products.</p><p>And when we try to do now is move into new spaces. So I think even if that is happening, which I think it's a cyclical thing, that will not have any indication for us relative to how we view that opportunity long-term as a Company.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Other questions? Here we go.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can you make a comment on the percentage of sales that you spend on R&amp;D? Are you satisfied with the amount of R&amp;D that you're spending at the moment?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Yes. First of all, we have spent over the years around 5%, 5.5%, 6%. I think at times it was up to 7% when we had pharma as part of the portfolio. As we speak, one of the strategies we are laying out, and it's the third strategy of six, is actually starting with a statement saying invest in innovation. So that's a statement for us in order to make sure that we focus on it and that we upscale the investment as we move ahead.</p><p>I think the outcome as we're spending today around 5.5% is not bad in terms of the new product vitality index. I think that we will like to see is what we call Class V, new products to the world, right, which is something that we would like to move resources in order to invest more in. So I think that's the big opportunity for us.</p><p>It is, AS I said, it's central to the plan for 3M and I think we have been effective in terms of our investment up to this point in time. But we are very -- and David and myself are the whole time challenged, saying that line, if you like, to make sure that we as an organization, the whole time, make sure that we invest on the right level in order to be able to commercialize those products, because we believe that is the big differentiator for 3M. So I think it should be somewhere in between 5% to 6% is the right level for us as we go forward as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: This is a follow-up to that R&amp;D question is -- how do you optimize R&amp;D spend? There is that Lean and Six Sigma approach, but you can't just walk into the lab and say, innovate, and then expect to see the stream of new products. George used to talk about, say, look, I don't take wheelbarrows of cash and dump it into the R&amp;D section. And so how do you optimize?</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Well, first of all, when you look upon research and development, I think we have to separate them in between research and then development. And the research part is 15% and the development part is 85%.</p><p>And I would say the development part is more into the divisions and subsidiaries in terms of working on products that can be commercialized on a shorter term cycle. The research is where people work [with a 45] technology platforms is coming up with really new to the world technologies that we have done so successfully over many years.</p><p>I think on the 15% part, the technique there is to not ask question of commercialization times. When will it be commercialized? Those individuals need to have the freedom to work on big projects that will take time and that will be a big benefit to the Company long-term, when they are ready to go to what I would say the development phase.</p><p>In the development phase, into the division of subsidiaries, that is where you have to make sure that is clear guidelines and clear milestones. And that is where we ask the question relative to commercialization, so you are not losing the view of that you have to go to market, right, because it's not only a research and development. It's also to be able to commercialize them and do that successfully in time.</p><p>So I think that's much more focused into the division. And that's happening, I would say, in what we call a product steering committee in each division. And they are meeting monthly and they have timelines in terms of -- [engage] where they review the projects in order to continue or to stop the project. So that's working pretty well.</p><p>But I think your point earlier is to say that, in many cases, you cannot push too much dashboards specifically when you are going to look upon the research part, right, which is where people work on -- with four to five technology platforms to combine them and come with new to the world technologies that could revolutionize some of the businesses. And we have many examples of that in the past, like micro applications and other things like that. It took a long time before it happened. Now a big portion of the Company is utilizing that technology in very successfully commercialized products.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: And do researchers still have an ability to spend a portion of their time on assigned projects, things that they want to -- have a special interest in? What is that arrangement? Because it's been historically pointed to as one of the hallmarks of the 3M lab.</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Yes. The 15% rule is still there. And David and myself, actually yesterday, was that we had a big tech forum yesterday where they shared all projects going on in the Company. It was a fantastic event that we went to.</p><p>And one big section of that event was the [up to] 15% projects where people showed what they are doing based on the 15% time that they are putting in. Today that'd still alive. We're talking about it.</p><p>It was a big portion of the -- not the biggest, but the big portion of the section yesterday. And we have commented yesterday as we flew in that it was actually a really fun afternoon for us, because that's where we saw the future of the Company relative to products. So the 15% is still alive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Well, I'm going to suggest that that be part of the November 8 analyst meeting. We should bring just the highlights of those if we could. So with that, I want to thank 3M, Inge, David, for presenting here this morning.</p><p><person><nameText>INGE THULIN</nameText></person>: Okay.

W. Scott McGill/Shutterstock.com[1]  Courtesy ofBhaskar Chakravorti[2], Tufts University[3] As the public and government regulators around the world discuss whether and how[4] to manage the power of technology companies, one idea that keeps coming up is breaking up these large conglomerate corporations into smaller pieces. Public distrust for tech companies has shifted to talk of antitrust action[5] against them. Facebook, for instance, might then have to compete with Instagram for photo-sharing[6] and WhatsApp for messaging - rather than owning both. The idea has managed to garner support from both Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren[7], a Democrat, and Republican President Donald Trump[8]. However, advocates[9] and opponents[10] of breaking up big technology firms are falling prey to some serious misconceptions. I study the effects of digital technologies on lives and livelihoods across 85 countries and lead Tufts Fletcher School's Digital Planet[11] initiative studying technological innovation around the world. In my opinion, there are three myths worth busting before considering taking on big tech. Myth 1: Comparing Standard Oil and Google       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/284102/original/file-20190715-173370-5ovggf.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/284102/original/file-20190715-173370-5ovggf.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>   John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil. </p><p>Urbanrenewal/Wikimedia Commons[12]  Arguments for and against antitrust action against tech firms rely heavily on the experiences of earlier cases[13]. The massive 19th-century monopoly Standard Oil[14] has, in fact, been referred to as the 'Google of its day[15].' There are also people who are recalling the 1990s antitrust case against Microsoft's dominant position[16] in the era of personal computers. <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/284103/original/file-20190715-173360-2qxmqd.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/284103/original/file-20190715-173360-2qxmqd.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>Google co-founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page. Joi Ito/Wikimedia Commons[17], CC BY[18]  Those cases from the past may seem similar to today's situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: the global technology marketplace. Currently, there are two parallel 'big tech' clusters. One is in the U.S., dominated by Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple[19]. The other is based in China, dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei[20]. This global market is subject to different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft. Both clusters are attempting to add users to accumulate reservoirs of data[21], which will fuel the next stage of competitiveness in a future run by artificial intelligence. The Chinese government has blocked most of the U.S. companies from entering the Chinese market, protecting its 'AI national team[22].' The U.S. government has done likewise[23], blacklisting some Chinese outfits for a period while discouraging others. If the U.S. technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented U.S. companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms. Geopolitical factors aren't limited to the U.S.-China rivalry. The European Union, Russia and India are also heavy users of Silicon Valley technologies, and each is exploring its own options[24] for legislation and regulation too. U.S. companies' size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. Their power would change if they were broken up - and, in my view, that should be a key consideration in regulators' decisions. Myth 2: Price is right There are two main views of antitrust action in these discussions. One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken since the 1960s[25]. The other view suggests that regulators should look at the underlying structure of the market[26] and potential for powerful players to exploit[27] their positions. Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are free to the consumer[28], and that Amazon's marketplace power drives its products' costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say that having low or no prices[29] is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are hard to leave[30]. Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users pay for digital products with their data[31], rather than just money. Regulators shouldn't focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in intrusive or abusive ways[32] and whether customers are getting good value in exchange for their data[33]. Myth 3: Trust-busting is all or nothing There aren't just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further. My own idea of the best outcome would take a page from the history of antitrust litigation: The company that is sued is not broken up, and yet the very fact that there was a lawsuit leads to progress. That has happened in the past, in the cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/284111/original/file-20190715-173376-1k7ro27.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/284111/original/file-20190715-173376-1k7ro27.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>   A replica of the first transistor, developed at AT... Bell Laboratories in 1947. National Archives[34]  In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System, which settled a seven-year legal proceeding against the company, the company wasn't split up, but Bell was required to license all its patents royalty-free[35] to other firms. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history - including the transistor[36], the solar cell[37] and the laser[38] - became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System was eventually broken up[39] in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread innovation and competition[40] as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier. The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn't break up the firm. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to separate pricing for its hardware and software products[41], previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company, called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement. Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement, Microsoft agreed to ensure its products were compatible[42] with competitors' software. That made room in the emerging internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple's Safari, Mozilla's Firefox and Google Chrome. Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that 'Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows[43].' But that doesn't mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends, of breaking up the companies. Antitrust rules are complicated enough, and plenty of experts will be called on to give their views on what to do with 'big tech.' Technology pervades every aspect of modern lives, giving each person a responsibility to weigh in on this issue without misconceptions clouding their judgments. Technology has become a political issue. In a politically overheated climate, public sentiments may matter even more than the opinions of experts.

I study the effects of digital technologies on lives and livelihoods across 85 countries and lead Tufts Fletcher School's\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://sites.tufts.edu/digitalplanet/\">Digital Planet</url>\u00a0initiative studying technological innovation around the world. In my opinion, there are three myths worth busting before considering taking on big tech.</p><p>Arguments for and against antitrust action against tech firms rely heavily on the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/19/business/microsoft-trial-precedents-previous-antitrust-cases-leave-room-for-both-sides.html\">experiences of earlier cases</url>.

Currently, there are two parallel \"big tech\" clusters. One is in the U.S., dominated by\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://theconversation.com/big-tech-isnt-one-big-monopoly-its-5-companies-all-in-different-businesses-92791\">Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple</url>. The other is based in China, dominated by\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://singularityhub.com/2018/08/17/baidu-alibaba-and-tencent-the-rise-of-chinas-tech-giants/\">Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei</url>. This global market is subject to different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft.</p><p>Both clusters are attempting to add users to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://hbr.org/2019/01/which-countries-are-leading-the-data-economy\">accumulate reservoirs of data</url>, which will fuel the next stage of competitiveness in a future run by artificial intelligence. The Chinese government has blocked most of the U.S. companies from entering the Chinese market, protecting its \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2120913/china-recruits-baidu-alibaba-and-tencent-ai-national-team\">AI national team</url>.\" The\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/alibaba-pulls-back-in-u-s-amid-trump-crackdown-on-chinese-investment\">U.S. government has done likewise</url>, blacklisting some Chinese outfits for a period while discouraging others.</p><p>If the U.S. technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented U.S. companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms.</p><p>Geopolitical factors aren't limited to the U.S.-China rivalry. The European Union, Russia and India are also heavy users of Silicon Valley technologies, and each is\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ft.com/content/3eb00398-9815-11e9-8cfb-30c211dcd229\">exploring its own options</url>\u00a0for legislation and regulation too.</p><p>U.S. companies' size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. Their power would change if they were broken up - and, in my view, that should be a key consideration in regulators' decisions.</p><p>There are two main views of antitrust action in these discussions. One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/724991\">since the 1960s</url>. The other view suggests that regulators should look at the\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">underlying structure of the market</url>\u00a0and potential for\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pbwt.com/antitrust-update-blog/a-brief-overview-of-the-new-brandeis-school-of-antitrust-law\">powerful players to exploit</url>\u00a0their positions.</p><p>Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://slate.com/technology/2019/06/facebook-big-tech-antitrust-breakup-mistake.html\">free to the consumer</url>, and that Amazon's marketplace power drives its products' costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say that\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">having low or no prices</url>\u00a0is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/why-no-one-really-quits-google-or-facebook/\">hard to leave</url>.</p><p>Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://theconversation.com/how-much-is-your-data-worth-to-tech-companies-lawmakers-want-to-tell-you-but-its-not-that-easy-to-calculate-119716\">pay for digital products with their data</url>, rather than just money. Regulators shouldn't focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://theconversation.com/7-in-10-smartphone-apps-share-your-data-with-third-party-services-72404\">intrusive or abusive ways</url>\u00a0and whether customers are\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.axios.com/mark-warner-josh-hawley-dashboard-tech-data-4ee575b4-1706-4d05-83ce-d62621e28ee1.html\">getting good value in exchange for their data</url>.</p><p>There aren't just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further.</p><p>My own idea of the best outcome would take a page from the history of antitrust litigation: The company that is sued is not broken up, and yet the very fact that there was a lawsuit leads to progress. That has happened in the past, in the cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft.</p><p>In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System, which settled a seven-year legal proceeding against the company, the company wasn't split up, but Bell was required to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/how_antitrust_enforcement.pdf\">license all its patents royalty-free</url>\u00a0to other firms. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history - including the\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/who-invented-the-transistor/\">transistor</url>, the\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.popsci.com/article/science/invention-solar-cell/\">solar cell</url>\u00a0and the\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.photonics.com/Articles/A_History_of_the_Laser_1960_-_2019/a42279\">laser</url>\u00a0- became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System was\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cio.com/article/3267826/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do-why-the-bell-system-breakup-isn-t-a-model-for-tech.html\">eventually broken up</url>\u00a0in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AV826_ATT_16U_20171120171814.jpg\">innovation and competition</url>\u00a0as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier.</p><p>The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn't break up the firm. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/ibm-and-microsoft-antitrust-then-and-now/\">separate pricing for its hardware and software products</url>, previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company, called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement.</p><p>Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17827042/antitrust-1990s-microsoft-google-aol-monopoly-lawsuits-history\">Microsoft agreed to ensure its products were compatible</url>\u00a0with competitors' software. That made room in the emerging internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple's Safari, Mozilla's Firefox and Google Chrome.</p><p>Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that \"<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html\">Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows</url>.\" But that doesn't mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends, of breaking up the companies.</p><p>Antitrust rules are complicated enough, and plenty of experts will be called on to give their views on what to do with \"big tech.\" Technology pervades every aspect of modern lives, giving each person a responsibility to weigh in on this issue without misconceptions clouding their judgments. Technology has become a political issue. In a politically overheated climate, public sentiments may matter even more than the opinions of experts.</p><p>Bhaskar Chakravorti is the dean of global business at The Fletcher School within Tufts University.

Public distrust for tech companies has shifted to talk of antitrust action against them. Facebook, for instance, might then have to compete with Instagram for photo-sharing and WhatsApp for messaging-rather than owning both.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The idea has managed to garner support from both Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, and Republican US President Donald J. Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, advocates and opponents of breaking up big technology firms are falling prey to some serious misconceptions. I study the effects of digital technologies on lives and livelihoods across 85 countries and lead Tufts Fletcher School's Digital Planet initiative studying technological innovation around the world. In my opinion, there are three myths worth busting before considering taking on big tech.</p><p>MYTH 1: COMPARING STANDARD OIL AND GOOGLE</p><p>ARGUMENTS for and against antitrust action against tech firms rely heavily on the experiences of earlier cases. The massive 19th-century monopoly Standard Oil has, in fact, been referred to as the 'Google of its day.' There are also people who are recalling the 1990s antitrust case against Microsoft's dominant position in the era of personal computers.</p><p>Those cases from the past may seem similar to today's situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: the global technology marketplace. Currently, there are two parallel 'big tech' clusters. One is in the US, dominated by Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. The other is based in China, dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei. This global market is subject to different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft.</p><p>Both clusters are attempting to add users to accumulate reservoirs of data, which will fuel the next stage of competitiveness in a future run by artificial intelligence. The Chinese government has blocked most of the US companies from entering the Chinese market, protecting its 'AI national team.' The US government has done likewise, blacklisting some Chinese outfits for a period while discouraging others.</p><p>If the US technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented US companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms.</p><p>Geopolitical factors aren't limited to the US-China rivalry. The European Union, Russia and India are also heavy users of Silicon Valley technologies, and each is exploring its own options for legislation and regulation, too.</p><p>US companies' size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. Their power would change if they were broken up-and, in my view, that should be a key consideration in regulators' decisions.</p><p>MYTH 2: PRICE IS RIGHT</p><p>THERE are two main views of antitrust action in these discussions. One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken since the 1960s. The other view suggests that regulators should look at the underlying structure of the market and potential for powerful players to exploit their positions.</p><p>Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are free to the consumer, and that Amazon's marketplace power drives its products' costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say that having low or no prices is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are hard to leave.</p><p>Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users pay for digital products with their data, rather than just money. Regulators shouldn't focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in intrusive or abusive ways, and whether customers are getting good value in exchange for their data.</p><p>MYTH 3: TRUST-BUSTING IS ALL OR NOTHING</p><p>THERE aren't just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further.</p><p>My own idea of the best outcome would take a page from the history of antitrust litigation: The company that is sued is not broken up, and yet the very fact that there was a lawsuit leads to progress. That has happened in the past, in the cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft.</p><p>In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System, which settled a seven-year legal proceeding against the company, the company wasn't split up, but Bell was required to license all its patents royalty-free to other firms. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history-including the transistor, the solar cell and the laser-became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System was eventually broken up in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread innovation and competition as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier.</p><p>The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn't break up the firm. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed to separate pricing for its hardware and software products, previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company, called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement.</p><p>Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement, Microsoft agreed to ensure its products were compatible with competitors' software. That made room in the emerging Internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple's Safari, Mozilla's Firefox and Google Chrome. Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that 'antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows.' But that doesn't mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends, of breaking up the companies.</p><p>Antitrust rules are complicated enough, and plenty of experts will be called on to give their views on what to do with 'big tech.' Technology pervades every aspect of modern lives, giving each person a responsibility to weigh in on this issue without misconceptions clouding their judgments. Technology has become a political issue. In a politically overheated climate, public sentiments may matter even more than the opinions of experts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSMIR-BMIRROR200720190000500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSMIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMJ-J901-F00C-62FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410350</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1176\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Mirror All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Mirror (Philippines)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Public distrust for tech companies has shifted to talk ofantitrust actionagainst them. Facebook, for instance, might then have tocompete with Instagram for photo-sharingand WhatsApp for messaging - rather than owning both. The idea has managed to garner support from bothMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , a Democrat, andRepublican President Donald Trump .However,advocatesandopponentsof breaking up big technology firms are falling prey to some serious misconceptions. I study the effects of digital technologies on lives and livelihoods across 85 countries and lead Tufts Fletcher School'sDigital Planetinitiative studying technological innovation around the world. In my opinion, there are three myths worth busting before considering taking on big tech.</p><p><br/>Myth 1: Comparing Standard Oil and Google<br/><br/><br/>John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil.<br/>Urbanrenewal/Wikimedia Commons<br/>Arguments for and against antitrust action against tech firms rely heavily on theexperiences of earlier cases . The massive19th-century monopoly Standard Oilhas, in fact, been referred to as the ' Google of its day .' There are also people who are recalling the 1990santitrust case against Microsoft's dominant positionin the era of personal computers.<br/><br/><br/>Google co-founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page.<br/>Joi Ito/Wikimedia Commons ,CC BY<br/>Those cases from the past may seem similar to today's situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: the global technology marketplace. Currently, there are two parallel 'big tech' clusters. One is in the U.S., dominated byGoogle, Amazon, Facebook and Apple . The other is based in China, dominated byBaidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei . This global market is subject to different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft.Both clusters are attempting to add users toaccumulate reservoirs of data , which will fuel the next stage of competitiveness in a future run by artificial intelligence. The Chinese government has blocked most of the U.S. companies from entering the Chinese market, protecting its ' AI national team .' TheU.S. government has done likewise , blacklisting some Chinese outfits for a period while discouraging others.If the U.S. technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented U.S. companies against consolidated state-protected Chinese firms.Geopolitical factors aren't limited to the U.S.-China rivalry. The European Union, Russia and India are also heavy users of Silicon Valley technologies, and each isexploring its own optionsfor legislation and regulation too.U.S. companies' size and data accumulation capabilities give the country economic and political influence around the globe. Their power would change if they were broken up - and, in my view, that should be a key consideration in regulators' decisions.<br/>Myth 2: Price is rightThere are two main views of antitrust action in these discussions. One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have takensince the 1960s . The other view suggests that regulators should look at theunderlying structure of the marketand potential forpowerful players to exploittheir positions.Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that arefree to the consumer , and that Amazon's marketplace power drives its products' costs down. On the other side, though, are those who say thathaving low or no pricesis evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that arehard to leave .Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Userspay for digital products with their data , rather than just money. Regulators shouldn't focus only on the monetary costs to the users. Rather, they should ask whether users are being asked for more data than is strictly necessary, whether information is being collected inintrusive or abusive waysand whether customers aregetting good value in exchange for their data .<br/>Myth 3: Trust-busting is all or nothingThere aren't just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further. My own idea of the best outcome would take a page from the history of antitrust litigation: The company that is sued is not broken up, and yet the very fact that there was a lawsuit leads to progress. That has happened in the past, in the cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft.<br/><br/><br/>A replica of the first transistor, developed at AT &amp; T's Bell Laboratories in 1947.<br/>National Archives<br/>In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System, which settled a seven-year legal proceeding against the company, the company wasn't split up, but Bell was required tolicense all its patents royalty-freeto other firms. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history - including thetransistor , thesolar celland thelaser- became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System waseventually broken upin 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spreadinnovation and competitionas the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier. The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years and didn't break up the firm. However, as part of its tactics to avoid appearing to be a monopoly, IBM agreed toseparate pricing for its hardware and software products , previously sold as an indivisible bundle. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Paul Allen to create a new software-only company, called Microsoft. The surge of software innovations that have followed can clearly trace their origins to the IBM settlement. Two decades later, Microsoft was itself the target of an antitrust action. In the resulting settlement,Microsoft agreed to ensure its products were compatiblewith competitors' software. That made room in the emerging internet marketplace for web browsers, the predecessors of Apple's Safari, Mozilla's Firefox and Google Chrome.Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that ' Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows .' But that doesn't mean they all have to achieve their most extreme ends, of breaking up the companies. Antitrust rules are complicated enough, and plenty of experts will be called on to give their views on what to do with 'big tech.' Technology pervades every aspect of modern lives, giving each person a responsibility to weigh in on this issue without misconceptions clouding their judgments. Technology has become a political issue.

Public distrust for tech companies has shifted to talk of antitrust action against them. Facebook, for instance, might then have to compete with Instagram for photo-sharing and WhatsApp for messaging, rather than owning both.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The idea has managed to garner support from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, and Republican President Donald Trump. However, advocates and opponents of breaking up big technology firms are falling prey to serious misconceptions. I study the effects of digital technologies on lives and livelihoods across 85 countries. There are three myths worth busting before considering taking on big tech.</p><p>Myth 1: Comparing Standard Oil and Google. Arguments for and against antitrust action against tech firms rely heavily on earlier cases. The massive 19th-century monopoly Standard Oil has, in fact, been referred to as the \u201cGoogle of its day.\u201d There are also people who cite the 1990s antitrust case against Microsoft\u2019s dominant position in the era of personal computers.</p><p>Those cases from the past might seem similar to today\u2019s situation, but this era is different in one crucial way: the global technology marketplace. There are two parallel \u201cbig tech\u201d clusters. One is in the U.S., dominated by Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. The other is based in China, dominated by Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei. This global market is subject to different political and policy pressures than regulators faced when dealing with Standard Oil and Microsoft.</p><p>Both clusters are attempting to add users to accumulate reservoirs of data, which will fuel the next stage of competitiveness in a future run by artificial intelligence. The Chinese government has blocked most of the U.S. companies from entering the Chinese market, protecting its \u201cAI national team.\u201d The U.S. government has done likewise, blacklisting some Chinese outfits for a period while discouraging others.</p><p>If U.S. technology giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, pitting fragmented U.S. companies against consolidated, state-protected Chinese firms. Geopolitical factors aren\u2019t limited to the U.S.-China rivalry. The European Union, Russia and India are also heavy users of Silicon Valley technologies, and each is exploring its own options for legislation and regulation too.</p><p>Myth 2: Price is right. There are two main views of antitrust action in these discussions. One focuses on consumer welfare, which has been the prevailing approach federal lawyers have taken since the 1960s. The other view suggests that regulators should look at the underlying structure of the market and potential for powerful players to exploit their positions.</p><p>Those two sides seem to agree that price plays a key role. People who argue against breaking up the tech giants point out that Facebook and Google provide services that are free to the consumer, and that Amazon\u2019s marketplace power drives its products\u2019 costs down. On the other side are those who say that having low or no prices is evidence that these companies are artificially lowering consumer costs to draw users into company-controlled systems that are hard to leave.</p><p>Both sides are missing the fact that the monetary price is less relevant as a measure of what users pay in the technology industry than it is in other types of business. Users pay for digital products with their data, rather than just money. Regulators shouldn\u2019t focus only on the monetary costs to the users. They should ask whether users are being asked for more data than strictly necessary, whether information is being collected in intrusive or abusive ways and whether customers are getting good value in exchange for their data.</p><p>Myth 3: Trust-busting is all or nothing. There aren\u2019t just two ways for this debate to end, with either a breakup of one or more technology giants or simply leaving things as they are for the market to develop further.</p><p>The best outcome would take a page from the history of antitrust litigation: The company that is sued is not broken up, and yet the fact there was a lawsuit leads to progress. That has happened in the past, in the cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft.</p><p>In the 1956 federal consent decree against the Bell System, which settled a seven-year legal proceeding against the company, the company wasn\u2019t split up, but Bell was required to license all its patents royalty-free to other firms. This meant that some of the most profound technological innovations in history, including the transistor, the solar cell and the laser, became widely available, yielding computers, solar power and other technologies that are crucial to the modern world. When the Bell System was eventually broken up in 1982, it did not do nearly as much to spread innovation and competition as the agreement that kept the Bells together a quarter-century earlier.</p><p>Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s top antitrust official and frequent tech-giant nemesis, has said that \u201cAntitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean they all have to break up the companies.</p><p>Antitrust rules are complicated enough, and plenty of experts will be called on to give their views on what to do with \u201cbig tech.\u201d Technology pervades every aspect of modern lives, giving each person a responsibility to weigh in on this issue without misconceptions clouding their judgments. Technology has become a political issue. In a politically overheated climate, public sentiments may matter more than the opinions of experts.</p><p>Bhaskar Chakravorti is the dean of global business at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>David Marcus, CEO of Facebook\u2019s Calibra digital wallet service, speaks during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Facebook\u2019s proposed cryptocurrency on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.

He claims though that where political censorship arises, he tries to root it out but provided no specifics. \u00a0</p><p>This does nothing to quell concerns that the people who work for Facebook (from tech staff to reviewers) do not filter or censor conservative content.

New regulations from Congress will stifle competition and harm smaller startups.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'I think part of the challenge with regulation in general is that when you add more rules that companies need to follow, that's something that a larger company like ours inherently just has the resources to go do, and that might just be harder for a smaller company getting started to be able to comply with'</p><p>This is an interesting admission. Facebook has said it welcomes Congress to create new regulations. However, that would be terrible for competition. \u00a0</p><p>Big tech companies like Facebook have lobbyists to help craft legislation in a way that gives them an advantage and the resources to comply with new regulations. Regulations would create new barriers to entry for startups though and could potentially put smaller competitors out of business. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 3. Creating a safe environment may win out over openness to ideas. \u00a0</p><p>In response to Senator Ted Cruz's question about censorship, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>concluded,</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'I am very committed to making sure that Facebook is a platform for all ideas.' \u00a0</p><p>Yet, later in response to Senator Mike Lee's questioning about censorship, he says,</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 '\u2026 one of the things that is really important though is that in order to create a service where everyone has a voice, we also need to make sure that people aren't bullied, or -- or basically intimidated, or the environment feels unsafe for them.'</p><p>In this political environment, one person's postings may be 'triggering' to another. One could envision a situation where Facebook considers some content hate speech or unsafe simply because the reviewers don't agree with it. He says they don't ask about political affiliation, but also doesn't explain how the 'extremely left-leaning' perceptions of Silicon Valley don't impact their work.</p><p>As we've seen on college campuses today, students are quick to shut down opposing speakers and thought because they consider them offensive. College administrators have sided with students on limiting speech.

Zuckerberg admits that Silicon Valley is extremely leftist and there's bias against conservative views.  <br/>    \"First, I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook in the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place, and I -- this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we do not have any bias in the work that we do, and I think it is a fair concern that people would at least wonder about.\"  <br/>Zuckerberg didn't explain how he seeks diversity of views among staff. He claims though that where political censorship arises, he tries to root it out but provided no specifics.    <br/>This does nothing to quell concerns that the people who work for Facebook (from tech staff to reviewers) do not filter or censor conservative content. Just ask conservative commentators Diamond and Silk.  <br/><br/> 2. New regulations from Congress will stifle competition and harm smaller startups.  <br/>    \"I think part of the challenge with regulation in general is that when you add more rules that companies need to follow, that's something that a larger company like ours inherently just has the resources to go do, and that might just be harder for a smaller company getting started to be able to comply with\"  <br/>This is an interesting admission. Facebook has said it welcomes Congress to create new regulations. However, that would be terrible for competition.    <br/>Big tech companies like Facebook have lobbyists to help craft legislation in a way that gives them an advantage and the resources to comply with new regulations. Regulations would create new barriers to entry for startups though and could potentially put smaller competitors out of business.    <br/><br/> 3. Creating a safe environment may win out over openness to ideas.    <br/>In response to Senator Ted Cruz's question about censorship, Zuckerberg concluded,  <br/>    \"I am very committed to making sure that Facebook is a platform for all ideas.\"    <br/>Yet, later in response to Senator Mike Lee's questioning about censorship, he says,  <br/>    \"133; one of the things that is really important though is that in order to create a service where everyone has a voice, we also need to make sure that people aren't bullied, or -- or basically intimidated, or the environment feels unsafe for them.\"  <br/>In this political environment, one person's postings may be \"triggering\" to another. One could envision a situation where Facebook considers some content hate speech or unsafe simply because the reviewers don't agree with it. He says they don't ask about political affiliation, but also doesn't explain how the \"extremely left-leaning\" perceptions of Silicon Valley don't impact their work.  <br/>As we've seen on college campuses today, students are quick to shut down opposing speakers and thought because they consider them offensive. College administrators have sided with students on limiting speech. What's to stop Facebook from following their lead?    <br/>If there's one big takeaway from these exchanges, it's that we need greater competition in the social media space.    <br/>As a private company, Facebook is well-entitled to set the rules for those who use their platforms. We can hope they will act objectively, but there are real examples that say otherwise. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN737878020180412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3B-VRS1-J9XT-P2SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Breaking up tech companies won't stop political power from being \"thrown around.\"</p><p>Antitrust laws, used in the way Sen.

Today most homes and businesses are still powered by fossil fuels, but in just a few decades - maybe even as little as 15 years - most energy could be coming from renewable sources. </p><p><br/>An enormous new survey of industry experts shows how fast things are moving. Recently, DNV GL, an international energy consulting company, asked 1,600 people who actually work in the field - at equipment manufacturers, power producers, utilities, policy-making agencies, energy retailers, regulators, and equity investment firms - about the future of renewables. One of the main questions: How quickly will renewables be generating 70 percent of the energy in the markets you work with?  <br/>Almost half of the survey respondents said they could see that happening by 2030. And almost all of them - about 80 percent - thought renewables would dominate by 2050. <br/>Here's why they're optimistic about renewable energy: <br/>Politicians are supporting it. \"It is mainly a political question. It is clear that a renewables-based electricity system is technically and commercially possible, perhaps by the middle of this century, but only if backed up by political support,\" one German respondent told DNV GL. It's not a given, but, increasingly, politicians - even American conservatives - are onboard with the idea that the future of energy includes wind and solar power.  <br/>Energy storage is getting better. Two thirds of the DNV GL survey respondents chose energy storage as one of the top three technologies needed for renewables to work. (The other two: smarter grids and more money to build them.) And storage technologies are improving: This week, for example, Tesla is expected to announce that it's releasing a \"home battery\" that could help store power generated by rooftop solar panels. This is key to convincing people that renewable energy can be relied on - and making sure that's true.  <br/>Investment in renewable power is growing. Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported this week that in 2014 $270 billion was invested in renewable energy, about one fifth more than the year before. The largest portion of that money was going to projects in developing markets - Brazil, Indonesia, Chile, Mexico, Kenya, and China, where investments totaled $83.3 billion. <br/>In other words, power, technology, and money are all aligning behind the same idea - that in the next few decades the way we power the world will change, dramatically. The only real question is how fast. 2015 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ERGMWW-50790210</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ERGMWW2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FNK-4K11-F11P-X19C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417292</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"449\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">Syndigate.info</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Energy Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35453\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>April 3, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUMwRjNCRUQ4NUI2NEIwMkI1RTcyRUEzRDgxMEZCMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REJGNjMzRTJDMDRGNDM0Mjg3QjAxNTE2MDU2RjlDMDY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Many organizations are scrambling[2] to adopt it into their marketing materials and incorporate it into their internal processes. </p><p>Given the current buzz around the term, surely it makes sense to 'get with the program' and to capitalize on the high level of interest. Why wouldn't you want people looking at your company to immediately think 'AI?' Science and technology communities have seen the use of AI as problematic for decades[3]. The term is infrequently mentioned within research fields such as machine learning, data science, image analysis, and natural language processing. Perhaps now is the time for those of us who work in these areas or who have a deeper appreciation of the history of the field to think about how we engage with our employers and stakeholders. Particularly, how we communicate effectively around these emerging technologies, whilst minimizing the risks inherent in aggregating them all under a single over-hyped brand[4]. Below I present three inter-related reasons for the unpopularity of the AI label within the scientific communities and extend each with an argument as to why we might want to be cautious about over-adoption of this term in the industry.1. The 'historical' argument'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.' \u2014 George Santayana We have seen two AI winters[5] now. When these occurred, research funding dried up, projects were canned, jobs were been lost, and scientific progress was constrained. The next major glitch in the history of AI will be different, it will be less of a winter and more of a backlash[6]. This seems almost a certainty now. The question that remains is more about how big the backlash will be. If current predictions about the impact of automation on the employment market become a reality, this could be sizeable[7]. In which case, expect to see increasing negative publicity associated with AI and, as with the previous two AI winters, a consequent scramble by individuals and organizations to achieve damage limitation by visibly distancing themselves from the term. The fallout could deeply impact academic research activities if it reaches political levels. Reaction at a political level[8], to public pressure, risks seeing the introduction of knee-jerk, rather than well-considered, regulatory responses.2. The 'educating the public' argument'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' \u2014 Arthur C. Clarke For most people working in fields which some might see as AI, there are precise, accurate, and meaningful labels which exist. Let's use them. If we're working in data science, let's say so. If we're developing augmented reality hardware, let's say so. If we're focused on natural language processing, then let's be explicit about that. If we're combining machine learning approaches within robotics, then let's describe it with that level of accuracy. Conflating these distinct technologies under a single abstract label wraps an unnecessary veil of mystique around what would otherwise be clear and explicable technologies. If we want to inform the wider public with a sensible understanding of the developments that will impact them, let's help create that understanding by communicating using accurate and meaningful terminology wherever possible. If AI will become the huge, all-encompassing, life-changing, paradigm-shifting, singularity-inducing, 'thing' that many think, then it will affect every field of science and the lives of everyone on the planet. And this term will thus become even more of a vague umbrella label than it already is capturing pretty much everything, and meaning pretty much anything. It will be even more non-specific and problematic than it is now. If the majority of the general population comes to perceive AI as effectively 'magic,' then the science and technology communities will have failed in one of the most important educational challenges they ever faced.3. The 'semantic' argument'The question of whether machines can think is about as relevant as the question of whether submarines can swim.' \u2014 Edsger W. Dijkstra We took the word intelligence, that for centuries people argued over the meaning of, and incorporated it into a term intended to define a scientific discipline. The consequence is that we created an expression which in itself is also indefinable. The resulting wide-ranging views of what AI now means (unfortunately, 'Skynet' for many) routinely derail valuable discussions or debates. Technical conversations about the relevance of some form of machine learning approach to a particular challenge can be instantly marginalized by interjections along the lines of 'What is intelligence?' 'Can machines truly become conscious?' or 'Will the machines take over?' A conversation that is off-topic in this way can't usually be recovered. It is worth highlighting that there are, in fact, many crucially important philosophical and ethical issues[9] emerging from the fields of data science (personal data, the right to privacy) and automation (issues around self-serving cars, impact on employment) which need urgent consideration. The argument is not that discussions such as these are irrelevant, it is that discussions, arising or ongoing within the context of a specific field, require some degree of focus in order to have any value or achieve any outcome. Since AI is not a specific field, any conversations around this term are, quite reasonably, wide open to interjections from anyone based on their views of what AI represents for them personally. The term has thus become a hotbed for fostering confusion and misunderstanding and is routinely a flashpoint for disagreement between different disciplines and interests.The counter argument'Once a new technology rolls over you, if you're not part of the steamroller, you're part of the road.' \u2014 Stewart Brand Of course, there is the argument that AI is the 'genie out of the bottle.' It's effectively now an unstoppable force with huge economic impetus driving it; which means that it will impact us regardless of our choice of terminology. All of this is undoubtedly true, and none of this invalidates the arguments above. However, if 'AI' development\u00a0forges ahead without acknowledging or engaging[10] with some of the concerns raised above, it may have troubling social consequences adversely impacting further progress. Some of these consequences might include:Academic research funding is often more vulnerable to political concerns than businesses are. A reduction in public academic funding, e.g. ML or automation research, due to an AI backlash, simply means an even greater proportion[11] of the continuing scientific development will be increasingly focused within a smaller number of powerful profit-driven corporations. Whilst it might serve the interests[12] of powerful corporations, to brand themselves as AI, since they can likely weather any such backlash, similar market positioning (should the public come to see AI as negative) may adversely impact small to medium size companies to a relatively greater extent. On a slightly different note, the guaranteed survival of AI in the industry by economic forces, despite an AI backlash by the general public, may polarize industry versus individual perspectives\u00a0alongside increasing wealth inequality[13]. The possibility of such a scenario arising for AI only strengthens the case for improving public understanding. Attempts to build that understanding will be obfuscated if, as a matter of routine, the many underlying technologies are uninformatively merged within a single denigrated term.AI clearly is now the genie out of the bottle. This expression is here to stay. When it's the right expression to use, let's use it. When it's not, and given that we have a wealth of well-defined, commonly accepted, accurate, and meaningful terminology at our fingertips, let's communicate with our audiences as effectively as we possibly can.

The tech titan had no choice, given Visa's impressive $11.2 trillion in annual payments on its global network of 54 million merchant locations and 3.3 billion cards. Mastercard's reach is only slightly smaller. </p><p>The three digital banking behemoths, called MVP for Mastercard, Visa and PayPal, have not only impeded Apple's access to the digital payments space, but they have also outperformed the FAANGs[4] solidly over the past three years. We'll look at what happened to prevent Apple from dominating this space, what it means and what comes next.Below is a summary of stock performance for the biggest names in digital payments and the FAANG stocks. FAANGs Get Crushed by Visa, Mastercard, PayPal (3 Years) +154%: MVPs (Mastercard, Visa, PayPal)+127%: FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google parent Alphabet)+38%: S...00 Index Source: Barron's; through May 29, 2019  Apple Cedes to MVP  Apple's mobile wallet, Apple Pay, launched in October of 2014 amidst talks of a global payments revolution, according to a detailed report by Barron's[5]. Apple, one of the biggest companies in the world by market value, hoped to dominate the space. However, Apple's decision to partner with Visa, Mastercard and American Express (AXP[6]) effectively strengthened the power of these behind-the-scenes digital payments giants. \"When Apple Pay came along and they decided to use existing rails, that was a pretty good early proof point\" for the prior model, according to James Tierney, CIO of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein, according to the report.Apple Pay has been most effective among U.S. consumers, who make up the bulk of its 87 million users, per a report by Slate[7]. This leaves the tech giant well behind PayPal (210 million users) and Chinese competitors WeChat Pay and Alipay (1 billion combined users). What It Means for Investors  One of the reasons the MVP companies have been so tough to challenge is their scale, strengthened through their vast networks of merchants, consumers and banks as well as regulation and security, which daunt even the largest tech companies. Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette explained that, \"because [MVP] are already at scale and they are on the same technology curve as Big Tech, there is no way to ever underprice them.\" Visa and Mastercard take just 0.15% per card transaction on average, while merchants claim 98% and issuing banks about 1.5%. The model has worked fantastically well, as Visa and Mastercard generated $10.7 billion and $5.9 billion in net income last year, per Barron's, and their stock prices in recent years have increasingly reflected that. With stellar brand recognition and trust, the steady march toward electronic payments globally, and a growing business to business[8] market (estimated at $120 trillion, per another Barron's[9] report), these established companies are very tough to beat. What's Next  Apple continues in its efforts to expand its base, primarily by enhancing compatibility across institutions and credit cards (now more than 2,700 institutions support Apple Pay, per Slate). The company has also expanded the service to new countries and into peer-to-peer[10] payments, the latter via Apple Pay Cash, built directly into the Messages app. [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/ma/\">https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/ma/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/v/\">https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/v/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/pypl/\">https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/pypl/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/visa-mastercard-paypal-digital-payments-51558670403?mod=hp_HERO\">https://www.barrons.com/articles/visa-mastercard-paypal-digital-payments-51558670403?mod=hp_HERO</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/axp/\">https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/axp/</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/apple-pay-can-apple-beat-paypal-venmo-in-mobile-payments-war.html\">https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/apple-pay-can-apple-beat-paypal-venmo-in-mobile-payments-war.html</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btob.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btob.asp</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/visa-ceo-al-kelly-interview-51559097742?mod=hp_DAY_1\">https://www.barrons.com/articles/visa-ceo-al-kelly-interview-51559097742?mod=hp_DAY_1</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peertopeer-p2p-service.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peertopeer-p2p-service.asp</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VLK1010971559907947074251765700092</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IVR-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W90-GD91-JCMN-Y35G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"737\"/><timeReceived>11:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investopedia Stock Analysis</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 7, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009QKU</classCode><className>MASTERCARD INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001S8A</classCode><className>FORBES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00023A6</classCode><className>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009QNQ</classCode><className>ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN HOLDING LP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The latest Q2 results were also soft, with the earnings beat ratio coming in at 77% and the revenue beat ratio hitting just 57.4% (read: Forget Big Tech; Buy These ETFs Instead[1]).\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Beyond these results, this corner of the market will be in focus this week due to some acquisition talks that could provide a boost to the broad space. The major catalyst is Microsoft (MSFT[2]), which is looking to acquire Nokia's (NOK[3]) core cellphone business for \u20ac5.4 billion ($7.2 billion). </p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>Microsoft-Nokia Deal in Detail<br/>\u00a0<br/>The possibility of a deal between Microsoftand Nokia came as no surprise. Nokia is the only manufacturer that has exclusive rights to use Microsoft's Windows Phone 8 operating system in its smartphones. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Windows Phone is struggling to gain significant market share over the past couple of years from its two powerful rivals, Google's (GOOG[4]) Android and Apple's (AAPL[5]) iPhones. <br/>\u00a0<br/>The transaction would be accretive to both the companies and will likely close in the first quarter of 2014, subject to regulatory approvals. Upon completion, Microsoftwill obtain the Asha brand and 10-year license for the Nokia brand (read: 3 Internet ETFs Leading the Tech World Higher[6]).<br/>\u00a0<br/>The deal would strengthen the competitive position and would add revenue streams and profit opportunities for Microsoft. For example, Microsoft's gross margin on sale of one Nokia handset would increase from the current $10 to $40.<br/>\u00a0<br/>ETFs to Watch<br/>\u00a0<br/>A number of technology ETFs are currently under pressure due to lackluster performances by big tech firms and huge loses made in the latest earnings season. The recent move by MSFT could erode some of the losses in the overall space as many ETFs have large allocations to this company (see: all the Technology ETFs here[7]).<br/>\u00a0<br/>Below, we have highlighted three popular tech ETFs that are heavily invested in this technology company and are thus in focus this week. Investors should closely monitor the movement in these funds and could catch the opportunity when it arises:<br/>\u00a0<br/>Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK[8])<br/>\u00a0<br/>The most popular technology ETF on the market, XLK follows the Technology Select Sector Index, and has amassed about $11.3 billion in its asset base. The fund charges 18 bps in fees per year from investors.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In total, the fund holds about 78 securities in its basket. Of these firms, AAPL takes the first spot with 15.14% of the total assets, MSFT comes in second with 8.31%, with GOOG and International Business Machines (IBM[9]) following at 7.54% and 6.29%, respectively (read: Tech ETFs Slump on MicrosoftEarnings Miss[10]).<br/>\u00a0<br/>In terms of industrial exposure, the fund is widely spread across computer peripherals, IT services, software, diversified telecom services, and Internet software services that make up for double-digit allocations in the fund.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The fund returned about 4.7% so far this year. XLK currently has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or 'Hold' with a 'Medium' risk outlook.<br/>\u00a0<br/>iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF (IYW[11])<br/>\u00a0<br/>This ETF tracks the Dow Jones US Technology Index, giving investors exposure to the broad technology space. The fund holds 133 stocks in its basket with AUM of $2.3 billion while charging 46 bps in fees and expenses.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The top three holdings are AAPL, MSFT and GOOG with a respective share of 18.14%, 9.95% and 8.99%, respectively. The product is heavily skewed towards the technology hardware and equipment segments, as these make up for more than half of the portfolio. Software and computer services take the remaining portion in the basket (see more in the Zacks ETF Center[12]).<br/>\u00a0<br/>The fund added 9.4% in the year-to-date period. The product has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or 'Hold' with a 'High' risk outlook.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT[13])<br/>\u00a0<br/>This fund manages a $3.5 billion asset base and provides exposure to a large basket of 417 technology stocks by tracking the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Again here, AAPL is the top firm with 12% share, followed by MSFT (8.9%), GOOG (7.6%) and IBM (6.5%). From a sector perspective, system software, Internet software services and computer hardware take the largest share with at least 14% each.<br/>\u00a0<br/>VGT gained 12.41% year-to-date. The ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 or 'Strong Buy' with a 'Low' risk outlook, and thus could be a solid pick for investors seeking to play the tech sector this year (read: Buy This Top Ranked Tech ETF Now[14]).<br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
