The platform was launched in 2018 by John Matze, a University of Denver grad, and marketed as a more robust free speech platform than Twitter, whose insistence on regulating the content and viewpoints of its 330 million monthly users tends to go in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, the defenders of Big Tech, who generally dismiss accusations of viewpoint bias as hysterical, misinformed, or irrelevant, have told unhappy users to just \u201cbuild their own platform.\u201d So, somebody finally did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the sour grapes response to Parler\u2019s surge (within days, it was the\u00a0most downloaded news app\u00a0in Apple\u2019s store), has presented an interesting Rorschach test for how the \u201cbuild your own\u201d crowd really feels about the people who actually go and, well, build their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within days, the tech free-marketers were taking public shots at the free-market alternatives. </p><p>Staff at both the\u00a0Cato Institute\u00a0and the\u00a0Charles Koch Institute\u00a0began dunking on Parler\u2019s terms of service which are, admittedly, somewhat extreme. (The company has said the terms are being updated.) It\u2019s striking that the same individuals who wax poetic on tech\u2019s \u201cfree marketplace\u201d had never once taken a good look at the free-market alternatives. That is, until they needed something negative to say about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The libertarians at\u00a0Reason\u00a0magazine, who are forever finger-wagging at anyone with bad things to say about Big Tech, started\u00a0making fun\u00a0of the platform\u2019s conservative slant. Apparently it\u2019s OK to\u00a0call out\u00a0the biases of Parler\u2019s creators, but not Twitter\u2019s. Got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upset about Parler\u2019s attempt to woo more liberals to its site to create more diversity of views, Mike Masnick of the tech industry blog\u00a0TechDirt\u00a0helpfully\u00a0lit into them\u00a0as a \u201cs\u2014hole platform for [invective] and trolls.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason\u00a0senior editor Elizabeth Nolan Brown also\u00a0slammed\u00a0Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for signing up for Parler, but not leaving Twitter. Availing yourself of all the market alternatives apparently makes you a hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No word on if\u00a0Reason\u00a0will also be trashing\u00a0Representative Thomas Massie\u00a0(R-Ky.),\u00a0Senator Mike Lee\u00a0(R-Utah), and\u00a0Senator Rand Paul\u00a0(R-Ky.), all of whom have also set up Parler accounts alongside their Twitter presence, in part because they say they are sick of Twitter\u2019s bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gleefully, the writers at\u00a0Reason, the tech industry blog\u00a0TechDirt, and, of course,\u00a0The\u00a0Dispatch\u2019s\u00a0David French\u00a0began pointing out that Parler\u2014which markets itself as a \u201cFirst Amendment platform\u201d and says \u201cif you can say it on the streets of New York, you can say it on our platform\u201d\u2014were banning users for pornographic content, posting pictures of fecal matter, and other smutty content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haha!\u00a0This crowd exclaimed. It\u2019s not a \u201cfree speech\u201d platform! They\u2019re banning people! See?\u00a0Content moderation is hard, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 (The unstated corollary being Twitter, the sainted platform, is thus entirely justified in its moderation practices.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Aaron Ross Powell of the Cato Institute\u00a0hopefully put it, \u201cParler will be a ghost town in six months and everyone who ran to it as a safe space for conservatives will be back on Twitter pretending the whole episode never happened.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a weird brand of free marketer who so earnestly wishes for the free market alternatives to spectacularly fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completely Missing The Point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to unpack here. The first is the massive straw man that all these groups have created regarding what conservatives actually want from their social media platforms. Claiming that we\u2019re all a bunch of hypocrites because our \u201cfree speech platform\u201d also, like Twitter, engages in content moderation is a big swing and a miss over the actual point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives are not angry about content moderation as a matter of absolute principle\u2014that is, the ability to take down harassing, smutty, or obscene content. In fact, they realize how important that is. It\u2019s why every effort in Congress to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is tied to the ability of platforms to do just that\u2014generally with more accountability, transparency, and responsibility when it comes to things like child sexual exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, the issues that fire up conservatives center around two aspects of content moderation, both of which are routinely dismissed, ignored, or downplayed by pro-tech advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, there is the objectivity and fairness with which content moderation is applied. Twitter claims to be a \u201cfree speech platform\u201d just like Parler, but it routinely applies so-called fact checks only to certain users, hides from view President Trump\u2019s tweets for \u201cglorifying violence\u201d while leaving up death threats against Jews from the leader of Iran, and so forth. The transparency in how Twitter subjectively applies its standards is limited, and users have very little recourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, there is the ripple effect of how this viewpoint discrimination\u2014particularly because it is done on an unprecedented scale\u2014has over free thought, market access, behavior, and even election integrity. Ninety percent of the world uses Google. When Google decides what you see and whose words matter, the ramifications are hugely consequential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For a taste of the havoc Google\u2019s \u201cacademic\u201d definitions can render on both objective learning and individual reputations, see this unsettling essay from a former undergraduate professor of mine, Dr. Paul Kengor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn\u2019t\u00a0if\u00a0these companies have a right to engage in content moderation. They obviously do. Rather, the question at the root of much of our policy debate is\u00a0how\u00a0that power is being weaponized at scale, the consequences of it, and if this power has become so unaccountable that Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jack Dorsey are effectively deciding the terms of our national political debate\u2014and even worse, the terms of what constitutes \u201cappropriate thought.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cBuild Your Own So We Can Trash You For It\u201d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parler may market itself as just an \u201calternative to Twitter,\u201d but it\u2019s taken on an outsized role in the center of this political and policy debate over the power social media has over our society. And, sadly for a new and growing business, the so-called \u201cfree market advocates\u201d of the tech world are intent on distorting the actual concern that Parler is seeking to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parler markets itself as a \u201cFirst Amendment platform\u201d seriously, but not literally. The company does not want its platform to be a trashy mess of pornography and harassment, but it does want a diversity of views to flourish. And that\u2019s the thing its newfound user base is responding to with enthusiastic approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Twitter has said the same thing about itself. Its actions prove otherwise\u2014but you\u2019ll never hear the pro-tech \u201clibertarians\u201d point out the obvious disingenuousness of Twitter execs. That\u2019s only reserved for Parler and its leadership. It\u2019s also ironic because, as one former Google engineer pointed out, Parler\u2019s efforts are actually closer to what the law governing content moderation online originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parler, of course, is not immune from criticism, but it\u2019s a bit rich for the \u201cfree enterprise\u201d crowd\u2019s first response to a surge toward a Twitter alternative to be so publicly negative, nasty, dismissive, and crude. It adds a new, insincere spin to the line \u201cbuild your own;\u201d a second clause that says: \u201cbuild your own\u2014so we can trash you for it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-107014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B6-YSH1-JBJN-M0WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1324\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media &amp;Culture;</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

It's all about the fact that these companies are selling you to advertisers as clickbait. </p><p>Facebook, Google, Twitter and others are not free at all. You just think they are because you are the product. But what about banking? We all bank for free, or in many countries we do, and yet there is no such thing as free banking. Someone's paying. Right now, it's the poor who pay. The people who fall into an overdraft or need loans and credit. In fact, the poorer you are the more you pay. Take a look at payday loan companies or money transmitters. If you're trying to send $100 from the USA to the Philippines, your family won't see much of that $100 by the time all the fees and currency transfers are applied. But this is all about to change. I've been saying for a while that the whole idea of free banking is flawed, and the industry agrees. Many UK bankers will tell you it's a broken idea, but that the only way it will change will be if the regulator tells the banks to change. After all, no bank wants to break ranks and say hey, here's a bank account you have to pay for! It's not a very attractive offer when all the competition is free. So they think they will all have to change to chargeable bank accounts as a whole, and that the system will never change unless the regulator says so. I disagree, as FinTech is changing the free banking model. As I blogged about last week[1], the big tech giants will be targeting the low hanging fruit of finance, namely payments and credit. That is also where many FinTech start-ups have been making a mark such as TransferWise and Zopa. As more and more technology firms eat into narrow areas of banking, the banks will be left holding the expensive aspects of deposit accounts, which will no longer be viable. As a result, technology will force retail banks to end free banking. I think that'll be a good thing as it might make banking more equitable. If all of us know how much a payment costs, a money transfer costs, a 36-month loan costs, and we can compare apples with apples - as right now most banks have lemons and oranges - then we will be far more transparency into the system. It's called the democratisation of finance and it's happening whether we like it or not. So, the fallacy of free banking will disappear.

For all intents and purposes, it's a Bitcoin ATM.</p><p><br/> Brothers Mark and John Russell of Las Vegas are the brains of the operation, having already run a software company that builds software powering more conventional ATMs. Russell was already an avid Bitcoiner, so building a Bitcoin ATM was just a natural extension of what they were already doing.<br/> Here's how it works. You put your cash deposit into the machine and either it tell it to generate a digital Bitcoin wallet for you and put your money there, or give the machine a preexisting wallet address for depositing your coins. It will print a QR code as a receipt of your transaction. About 10 minutes later, the Bitcoin network will push your transaction through, giving you access to your new Bitcoins.<br/> If you want cash for your Bitcoins, bring your QR code back to a RoboCoin kiosk, scan it, and watch as it dispenses your physical money. Bitcoin to cash instantly, cash to Bitcoin almost instantly (consider the three- or four-day waiting period).<br/> The Russells don't intend to operate the RoboCoins themselves, but will instead sell the devices to operating partners for $18,500 (the price will later rise to $20,000). It's not clear where the brothers foresee the ATMs being placed. Those who buy the kiosks will have to be smart when it comes to following financial regulations. These ATMs are essentially a money-launderer's dream come true, but that's hardly the point here. Where Bitcoin likely feels intractable for some, RoboCoin brings it into the physical world. Suddenly we're dealing with Bitcoin right in front of us in terms that we understand - it's just like any ATM you've used a thousand times before. It simply builds a bridge between digital and physical currency.<br/> The first RoboCoin kiosk will open later this year in Vancouver and will spread quickly thereafter, according to the plan. The Glasers tell us there's already plenty of interest.

Despite the talk, regulation is unlikely. The tech industry is already working to scuttle new rules, and public sentiment is in its favor.\u00a0 There's growing talk about regulating Big Tech. But you shouldn't expect that talk to turn into actual action.\u00a0 With more and more details emerging about how people linked to Russia tried to influence last year's election via some of the nation's biggest online services, policymakers have\u00a0started\u00a0earnestly\u00a0entertaining the idea that the government needs to step in and craft new rules to govern those and other tech companies. </p><p>Next week, congressional\u00a0representatives\u00a0will grill the leaders of Facebook, Google, and Twitter about what happened on their networks last year and what should be done about it. Meanwhile, in perhaps the most serious effort yet to put in place new rules on Big Tech, Democratic senators Mark Warner and\u00a0Amy Klobuchar recently\u00a0introduced a bill[1]\u00a0that would regulate political advertising on Google, Facebook, and other widely used online sites in\u00a0largely the same way as such ads are regulated when they are run on television or in print.New rules? Don't count on itBut even though there's bipartisan\u00a0support for Warner and Klobuchar's bill, don't count on Congress passing it. Indeed, even though there is widespread outcry over Russia's alleged meddling and growing concern over the power of the Big Tech companies, you shouldn't expect Washington to do much of anything in the way of placing new rules on how the Facebooks, Apples, and Googles of this world go about their business.\u00a0 Congress hasn't been doing much of anything on any number of issues lately, so expecting it to do something about Big Tech may have been a stretch no matter what.\u00a0And with\u00a0President Trump unwilling to commit[2] to pushing for new rules, it's even less likely\u00a0Congress will\u00a0pass something.Big tech's big lobbying effort\u00a0Even so, Big Tech isn't taking any chances and is doing whatever it can to scuttle any efforts to saddle it with\u00a0more government oversight.\u00a0 Already, the Big Tech companies have been actively moving to weaken\u00a0or\u00a0quash\u00a0any proposed laws or regulations. Industry lobbyists worked to water down Warner and Klobucher's bill. Meanwhile, with her company at the center of the storm over fake ads, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, went on a charm offense in Washington recently, meeting with lawmakers and the press. The tech giants are also\u00a0ramping up their lobbying efforts. Combined, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Twitter spent $14.2 million on lobbying last quarter, a sharp rise from the $11.9 million they spent in the same\u00a0period a year earlier,\u00a0The New York Times reported[3].Stepping up self-regulationBut Big Tech isn't just relying on its lobbyists to persuade lawmakers\u00a0new rules\u00a0won't be necessary. It's also trying to show\u00a0them\u00a0it can get its own house in order.\u00a0 In recent weeks, several of the tech companies have been stepping up their own efforts to weed out fake news and fake ads and to make their businesses more transparent to users.\u00a0Facebook announced it will allow users to easily see who paid for the ads that pop up in their News Feeds.\u00a0Twitter\u00a0announced a similar plant and also said it would\u00a0bar ads from a pair of Russia-funded news organizations[4]. I'm dubious that these companies can actually police themselves, given that they've largely failed so far in other areas, such as combatting rampant personal abuse on their sites. Even if they can do a better job of combatting and exposing fake ads and fake news, that would only address a small part of the larger concerns about their power and role and society. Still, their efforts are likely to be persuasive to lawmakers, particularly the Republicans in charge of Congress, who tend to be strongly opposed to new regulations that might constrain corporations.\u00a0The public loves its tech gadgets and servicesAnd Big Tech has one other big thing going for it in its effort to battle new rules \u2014 public sentiment. The public at large\u00a0overwhelmingly loves these companies[5].\u00a0 It's not hard to see why. Big Tech has become an intricate part of our lives. We use their products and services every day. And they've done a great job of making those products and services\u00a0super-compelling.\u00a0 Apple's iPhone X is super cool. Google's Gmail service is free to use and an easy way to send email.\u00a0Amazon makes it insanely easy to shop. Facebook is\u00a0great for keeping up with friends and family.\u00a0 The public may be aware of some of the dangers these companies pose, but they seem largely focused on the day-to-day benefits they get from using Big Tech's products.\u00a0And without some sort of significant and broad public anger\u00a0toward\u00a0Big Tech, there's little chance our elected representatives will push hard to regulate them.\u00a0 So don't get too distracted by next week's hearings, the hubbub about Warner and Klobucher's bill, or any other talk about putting new rules on Big Tech. The most likely thing that's going to happen is nothing at all.

But you shouldn't expect that talk to turn into actual action.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With more and more details emerging about how people linked to Russia tried to influence last year's election via some of the nation's biggest online services, policymakers have\u00a0started\u00a0earnestly\u00a0entertaining the idea that the government needs to step in and craft new rules to govern those and other tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Next week, congressional\u00a0representatives\u00a0will grill the leaders of Facebook, Google, and Twitter about what happened on their networks last year and what should be done about it. Meanwhile, in perhaps the most serious effort yet to put in place new rules on Big Tech, Democratic senators Mark Warner and\u00a0Amy Klobuchar recently\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/honest-ads-act-facebook-google-twitter-russia-2017-10?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">introduced a bill</url>\u00a0that would regulate political advertising on Google, Facebook, and other widely used online sites in\u00a0largely the same way as such ads are regulated when they are run on television or in print.</p><h>New rules? Don't count on it</h><p>But even though there's bipartisan\u00a0support for Warner and Klobuchar's bill, don't count on Congress passing it. Indeed, even though there is widespread outcry over Russia's alleged meddling and growing concern over the power of the Big Tech companies, you shouldn't expect Washington to do much of anything in the way of placing new rules on how the Facebooks, Apples, and Googles of this world go about their business.\u00a0</p><p>REUTERSCongress hasn't been doing much of anything on any number of issues lately, so expecting it to do something about Big Tech may have been a stretch no matter what.\u00a0And with\u00a0President Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/921488606706978817/photo/1\">unwilling to commit</url> to pushing for new rules, it's even less likely\u00a0Congress will\u00a0pass something.</p><h>Big tech's big lobbying effort\u00a0</h><p>Even so, Big Tech isn't taking any chances and is doing whatever it can to scuttle any efforts to saddle it with\u00a0more government oversight.\u00a0</p><p>Already, the Big Tech companies have been actively moving to weaken\u00a0or\u00a0quash\u00a0any proposed laws or regulations. Industry lobbyists worked to water down Warner and Klobucher's bill. Meanwhile, with her company at the center of the storm over fake ads, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, went on a charm offense in Washington recently, meeting with lawmakers and the press.</p><p>The tech giants are also\u00a0ramping up their lobbying efforts. Combined, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Twitter spent $14.2 million on lobbying last quarter, a sharp rise from the $11.9 million they spent in the same\u00a0period a year earlier,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/big-tech-government-regulation.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=10&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">The New York Times reported</url>.</p><h>Stepping up self-regulation</h><p>But Big Tech isn't just relying on its lobbyists to persuade lawmakers\u00a0new rules\u00a0won't be necessary. It's also trying to show\u00a0them\u00a0it can get its own house in order.\u00a0</p><p>In recent weeks, several of the tech companies have been stepping up their own efforts to weed out fake news and fake ads and to make their businesses more transparent to users.\u00a0Facebook announced it will allow users to easily see who paid for the ads that pop up in their News Feeds.\u00a0Twitter\u00a0announced a similar plant and also said it would\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-is-banning-all-ads-from-russian-news-agencies-rt-and-sputnik-2017-10?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">bar ads from a pair of Russia-funded news organizations</url>.</p><p>I'm dubious that these companies can actually police themselves, given that they've largely failed so far in other areas, such as combatting rampant personal abuse on their sites. Even if they can do a better job of combatting and exposing fake ads and fake news, that would only address a small part of the larger concerns about their power and role and society. Still, their efforts are likely to be persuasive to lawmakers, particularly the Republicans in charge of Congress, who tend to be strongly opposed to new regulations that might constrain corporations.\u00a0</p><h>The public loves its tech gadgets and services</h><p>And Big Tech has one other big thing going for it in its effort to battle new rules - public sentiment. The public at large\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/14/anti-tech-propaganda-based-on-false-premises-commentary.html\">overwhelmingly loves these companies</url>.\u00a0</p><p>It's not hard to see why. Big Tech has become an intricate part of our lives. We use their products and services every day. And they've done a great job of making those products and services\u00a0super-compelling.\u00a0</p><p>Apple's iPhone X is super cool. Google's Gmail service is free to use and an easy way to send email.\u00a0Amazon makes it insanely easy to shop. Facebook is\u00a0great for keeping up with friends and family.\u00a0</p><p>The public may be aware of some of the dangers these companies pose, but they seem largely focused on the day-to-day benefits they get from using Big Tech's products.\u00a0And without some sort of significant and broad public anger\u00a0toward\u00a0Big Tech, there's little chance our elected representatives will push hard to regulate them.\u00a0</p><p>So don't get too distracted by next week's hearings, the hubbub about Warner and Klobucher's bill, or any other talk about putting new rules on Big Tech. The most likely thing that's going to happen is nothing at all.\u00a0</p><p>NOW WATCH: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-6s-vs-iphone-8-x-upgrade-2017-9?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">I won't trade in my iPhone 6s for an iPhone X or iPhone 8 - here's why</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Also:</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/google-lens-pixel-2-review-2017-10?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">I tried Google Lens, one of the coolest new features of the Pixel 2 - here's what it's like</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/google-best-things-about-working-at-2016-8?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">The best things about working for Google, according to employees</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-will-make-all-ads-public-share-how-they-are-targeted-2017-10?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Twitter says it will make all its ads public, and share who is behind them</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE ALSO:\u00a0Google built a Trojan Horse to get inside every aspect of your life</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISIUS-59f335e4bcf93d21008b4f64</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISIUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VD6-SG41-DXY7-W15K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465531</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><timeReceived>08:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Insider Inc.

Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other -- sell their own goods or run a third-party marketplace -- but not both.</p><p>  ''You can be an umpire or you can own teams,'' she said. ''But you can't be an umpire and own one of the teams that's in the game.''</p><p>  Ms. Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors, as in Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, large tech companies have made it harder for smaller start-ups to compete on fair terms. She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers, and break up the conglomerates.</p><p>  Regulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the 2020 presidential race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants. And Ms. Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy than most elected officials.</p><p>  But many of the tech-industry insiders I spoke with in Austin, including some who agree with Ms. Warren that the big companies are too powerful, cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague, and could backfire if put into effect as written.</p><p>  Ms. Warren's plan is a bold first stab at reform, and some of her proposals make a lot of sense. But I'd offer a few edits.</p><p>  Apply specific fixes to specific problems. One shortcoming in Ms. Warren's plan -- and it's an understandable one, given that this is a campaign proposal and not a final set of rules -- is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problems.</p><p>  Lawmakers don't typically craft regulations for individual companies. That's for good reason: A law that specifically targeted Amazon, and not its competitors, would be seen as creating an unfair double standard.</p><p>  Instead, Ms. Warren's proposal targets technology companies with more than $25 billion in annual revenue that operate third-party marketplaces -- a group that includes Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google -- and proposes a set of rules that apply to all of them, as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future. (Microsoft, which makes more than $25 billion in annual revenue and has a third-party marketplace in the form of the Windows app store, was somehow spared.)</p><p>  The problem with applying a one-size-fits-four model to tech, as the industry analyst Ben Thompson has written, is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anti-competitive risks. The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out e-commerce brands, which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developers.</p><p>  The possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important. A law that banned Amazon from competing with third-party sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops, or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes libraries.</p><p>  Rather than one giant package that crams everything together, a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely, and address each with surgical precision.</p><p>  Split off cloud businesses. Ms. Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses, like separating Google's ad operations from its search engine. But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry: cloud computing.</p><p>  Right now, much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that include Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These companies make a killing by renting out data storage, computing power and other essential services to other businesses, essentially selling the picks and shovels of the digital gold rush.</p><p>  The cloud-computing market may not seem like an obvious antitrust target. It is highly competitive, and years of price wars between the giants have driven the costs of these services down. Doesn't giving young start-ups the ability to rent world-class infrastructure make it easier, not harder, for them to compete?</p><p>  Yes, it does. But the concentration of critical infrastructure among so few companies -- each of which also operates enormous consumer-internet businesses of its own -- gives those companies enormous power, and invites anti-competitive abuse.</p><p>  For example, let's imagine that Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, decided to sabotage Netflix, which runs on Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud-computing unit, in order to help his company's streaming video service. He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflix's traffic, or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazon's streaming-video team should copy.</p><p>  To be clear, Mr. Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that, given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazon's privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer. But the reality that companies with dominant internet services also provide the infrastructure that powers much of the consumer internet is a clear example of the kind of market consolidation Ms. Warren is trying to address.</p><p>  An effective breakup proposal could require companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft to spin their cloud-computing divisions off into stand-alone businesses, in a manner similar to the one Ms. Warren proposed for breaking up e-commerce marketplaces. To adapt her baseball analogy, tech companies would either play on the team or own the stadium, but not both.</p><p>  Get rid of the ''app tax.'' Another easy, specific fix would be to stop Apple and Google, the makers of the two dominant mobile operating systems, from taking unfair advantage of mobile app developers.</p><p>  At the moment, any company that wants to sell in-app purchases or subscriptions through an iOS app must pay what software developers derisively call the ''Apple tax'': a fee of 15 to 30 percent that Apple skims off the top of in-app purchases and subscriptions bought by users. (Google's mobile app store charges similar fees.)</p><p>  These fees add up quickly. Before it removed in-app subscriptions last year, Netflix was paying Apple an estimated $700,000 a day for the privilege of selling subscriptions in its app. And some competitors have begun to complain that these platforms' strict developer policies amount to bullying. On Wednesday, Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission over Apple's App Store policies, arguing that they unfairly stifle competition.</p><p>Apple and Google would argue that their fees are justified, because operating an app store requires hiring reviewers and security teams and all kinds of other expenses. But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes, and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitors.</p><p>  Don't get lured into a censorship debate. Something bizarre happened on Monday when Facebook momentarily took down several of Ms. Warren's Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech. Ms. Warren seized on the episode, saying it was proof of Facebook's ability to ''shut down a debate'' over its power.</p><p>  The ads were quickly reinstated, and Facebook made it clear that the removal was not a case of politically motivated censorship. The company has a longstanding policy that limits the use of Facebook's name in ads, a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be ''Facebook's official quiz game'' or whatever.</p><p>  But the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and other conservative lawmakers who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorship.</p><p>  ''She's right -- Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,'' Mr. Cruz wrote of Ms. Warren in a message on Twitter.</p><p>  One problem with the debate over the tech companies' power is that it risks conflating real anti-competitive behavior (like Facebook's shutting off data access to competitors) with imaginary abuses (like Mr. Cruz's unsupported claims that social media platforms are biased against conservatives). The former is a real menace; the latter is a bad-faith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage. But in political discourse, both can be framed as proof of the need for ''neutral platforms.''</p><p>  The best advice I could possibly give Ms. Warren, or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel, is to focus squarely on competition, and to avoid being sucked into partisan debates about content censorship.</p><p>  The worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies' power, while leaving their fortresses intact.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>speaking about policy ideas last week at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex.

The global slowdown has been accentuated by widespread uncertainty, which is also linked to the risk of trade dispute escalations, hurting investor and consumer confidence in many regions, especially in Europe and China. A range of triggers beyond the current tensions could spark further deterioration in risk sentiment. This would result in adverse growth implications, especially given the high levels of public and private debt. </p><p> Over the past twenty-five years, open markets have contributed to a dramatic fall in global poverty. However, progress has been uneven, and there are indications that the picture may be changing in some areas. In Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in fragile and conflict-affected situations, the total number of poor is on the rise. This on its own is of great concern and could further amplify the risk of a mass exodus from those areas. In many countries, the bottom 40 percent of the population has been progressively left behind. It is therefore imperative to intensify the promotion of economic growth, while at the same time ensuring that the poorest reap the benefits.  Two measures appear crucial to eradicating extreme poverty. First, emerging economies that need it most should adopt appropriate redistributive policies. Second, the international community should step up the effort to ensure that resources sent to poorer countries are invested in the most effective way, to promote investment in high quality infrastructure and to tackle conditions of marginalization, often linked to poor health and education. Encouraging the build-up of institutions to limit the phenomenon of exploitation - still too widespread in these countries - would buoy economic development and make it more inclusive. Disruptive technologies  Technological progress and globalization can provide important development opportunities for all countries. In the short to medium term work displacement is a risk and may well exacerbate income inequality.  In several developing economies - including in Africa - there is growing evidence that information technologies can create jobs by raising the productivity of existing firms and encouraging the entry of new ones. We should remain vigilant about the consequences of such changes for the economies at large: disruptive technologies may not be socially sustainable if the fruits of progress only  benefit the few; they may also not be economically sustainable, if worker displacement reduces aggregate demand.  Global enterprises at the frontier of technological innovation - including the so-called \"Big Tech\"  - are in the best position to exploit economic integration by taking advantage of access to very large markets. They can cut prices through investments in technology, benefitting from economies of scale, as well as across-country differences in the cost of labor for given skills. The ability to produce at lower prices could indeed benefit consumers, but if \"dominant positions\" emerge, there is the further risk that cost reductions may not be fully translated into prices.  Another competitive advantage of \"Big Tech\" companies is the huge amount of personal information they possess. This poses delicate problems of security, management, and data processing that go beyond the mere protection of privacy. The level of cybersecurity should be strongly prioritized. The risk of payment service interruptions, large-scale financial fraud, and widespread and prolonged breaks in the supply of electricity may have worse consequences than those of the \"traditional\" crises that originate in the economic system. The complexity and global nature of these issues makes any attempt at unilateral regulation bound to fail.  An answer to these challenges that would consist of slowing technological developments, or reintroducing barriers to economic integration - a tendency that seems to be gaining ground dramatically in recent years - would amount to a huge waste of opportunities. Goods and services that can improve our living standards would only come with severe delays and at much higher costs. On the contrary, we should strive to build and properly manage the necessary institutions to govern these risks effectively and make the most of the great opportunities offered by technological progress. Implementing the commitments of sustainable development  We are encouraged by the advances in the implementation of the \"Forward Look\" and the commitments agreed upon with the Capital Package for the IBRD and IFC. The narrative underpinning the request for additional capital is predicated on the need to foster development by creating markets in the world's most challenging arenas. Therefore, we look forward to the approval of the resolutions for the IFC, so that a complete implementation of the package may be achieved through leveraging private sector resources.  The recent focus on IBRD and IFC capital needs should not diminish the crucial role that IDA and MIGA are expected to play in the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals. We encourage IDA to take advantage of its financial capacity and build on the lessons learned from the Private Sector Window to promote better World Bank Group solutions for the poorest countries. We also expect that - in response to the call of the G20 Eminent Persons Group - MIGA will take stock of the guarantee and de-risking facilities put in place by the Multilateral Development Banks and will explore options to enhance coordination and cooperation with these institutions.  We support the roadmap for review of the system governing IDA voting power and the aim of presenting a paper to the Governors at the next Annual Meetings. We back the principle that the  voting rights system should ensure protection for IDA recipients, while providing adequate incentive for new and existing donors to contribute.  We commend the World Bank Group's commitment to achieving further budget efficiencies, after the successful implementation of the expenditure review. With the increasing costs of doing business, further efforts will be necessary to prevent recurring to IBRD capital in order to cover administrative expenses in excess of revenues. The financial sustainability of the IBRD's business model is essential to ensure solid income generation which will bear future needs.  We are concerned that a large part of the projected savings may come from increased average project size. We urge Management to ensure that this will not jeopardize the agreed-upon shift of resources towards the poorest and most fragile contexts.  We support a more selective engagement with clients in the upper income range and expect that intervention in these countries will be focused on strengthening policies and institutions. A continuous engagement of the IFC in these countries will facilitate an orderly graduation process from IBRD lending and a more systematic reliance on market mechanisms to pursue each country's development strategy. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN997316820190502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W18-58F1-J9XT-P00R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1196\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 2, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

After solid growth in 2017 and early 2018, world GDP decelerated significantly in the second half of last year. Although there are signs that the downward momentum might have stopped, in many countries economic activity remains weak.  According to the IMF's latest forecasts, in 2019 the global economy will expand at the lowest rate since 2009, when it recorded a recession.  Trade tensions, mostly fuelled by the new protectionist strategy pursued by the United States, and their effects on confidence, especially of private enterprises, are contributing significantly to this poor performance of the world economy. </p><p>International trade progressively slowed in 2018, falling by 1.0 per cent in the last quarter of the year, and recent data suggest that the economy remained weak in the early months of 2019.  The progressive liberalisation of trade that has characterised the last few decades has come to a sudden halt and is being reversed in some important economies. The average tariff rate applied to imports by the United States, for example, more than doubled in 2018 (from 1.5 to 3.3 per cent). More generally, the system of supranational institutions and multilateral rules on international trade that supported the sustained global economic expansion after World War II is encountering serious difficulties.  Protectionism is a response - a wrong one - to the challenges of globalisation and technological change, which both have momentous consequences for the job prospects of workers with lower skills. In the OECD countries, for example, the rise of automation is estimated to cause a high probability that as much as one job out of seven will be lost, while three out of ten may undergo significant changes over the next fifteen to twenty years. Even though new jobs will be created, managing the transition will be no easy task. Not enough has been done up to now to make appropriate plans for an affordable, timely and adequate retraining of workers, to invest resources in education, and to combat poverty and inequality.  In the shorter term, global risks are still tilted to the downside. The economic outlook remains vulnerable to persistent trade tensions, to a greater-than-expected cyclical slowdown in China, and to the possibility that the United Kingdom exits the European Union without a deal. GDP growth decreased markedly in the euro area as well, to 1.8 per cent in 2018 (from 2.4 per cent in the previous year). The euro area is much more open to foreign trade than the United States and Japan. For this reason its business cycle is highly correlated with the international one. Dependence on external demand is especially high in Germany, where the export-to-GDP ratio is close to a stunning 50 per cent, but it is also significant in France, Italy and Spain (where it is slightly above 30 per cent) due to their integration in the global value chains, including the European ones, commonly known as the \"European factory\".  In the euro area the negative impact on GDP growth of weaker exports has been amplified by a slowdown in domestic demand. Since mid-2018 the outlook for investment has progressively deteriorated due to the adverse effects of increased global uncertainty on firms' confidence and capital accumulation plans. The drop in production in the car sector following the introduction of a new international regulation on emissions from light-duty vehicles has also played an important role.  Against this background, the European Central Bank's monetary policy continues to be highly expansionary. The Governing Council expects official rates to remain at their current low levels at least until the end of 2019 and, in any case, for as long as necessary to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its target of a growth rate of consumer prices \"below but close to 2 per cent\" to be maintained over the medium term. Even after the first rate hike, the Eurosystem will continue for an extended period of time to reinvest in full the principal payments from maturing bonds purchased under the asset purchase programme (APP). Last March we also decided to launch a new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III), the first of which will be conducted next September; these operations will help to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy.  Our stance does not endanger overall financial stability. In the current situation, the main risks come from the weak growth and inflation outlook. As is well known, the global crisis spurred a widespread debate on whether the mandate of central banks should be broadened to formally include the preservation of financial stability. Even though the latter is certainly a precondition for price stability, this change could raise potential conflicts between the two objectives, undermining the credibility of central banks and the effectiveness of their policies. Preserving financial stability should  instead be the main task of macroprudential action. The same considerations apply to regulation and microprudential supervision: each policy can work well only if it has clear objectives and targeted intervention tools to achieve them.  The deterioration in the international outlook has also had a strong negative impact on the Italian economy: economic activity progressively weakened in 2018, recording a slight contraction - a so-called \"technical recession\" - in the second half of the year.  Overall GDP growth was just 0.9 per cent last year, around half the level recorded in 2017; all the main international forecasters expect it to decelerate further this year. The slowdown of activity in Germany, with which we share close economic ties, and the fall in business confidence, have been especially important factors in the weakness of aggregate demand and, especially, the marked deceleration in investment by Italian firms.  Our surveys confirm that weak capital accumulation reflects greater cautiousness on the part of enterprises in the face of uncertainty about economic and political factors, and the persistent trade tensions.  Economic activity returned to slightly positive growth in the early months of this year: according to the preliminary estimate GDP increased by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. This trend could continue, especially if the global rebound in investors' confidence observed since late 2018 proceeds and continues to exert its effects in Italy too. But to fully recover the path of sustainable growth, Italy must tackle its two main structural problems: the stagnation of productivity observed since the 1990s and the high level of public debt. Italy has been growing on average by around 1 percentage point less than the rest of the euro area since 1999. This is the result of the country's delayed response to the big changes of our era: globalisation and the technological revolution. A short-lived relief provided by fiscal or monetary policy, albeit important, is not enough to solve this problem. To address it, Italy must quickly adopt a consistent growth strategy combining measures to support innovation, with those to improve the quality of human capital, and to create a more favourable environment for \"doing business\".  Following the double-dip recession associated with the two financial crises that erupted in the past decade (the global financial crisis of 2007-09 and the euro-area sovereign debt crisis of 2010-13), many Italian firms have introduced organizational changes that have enhanced their efficiency, making them more competitive on international markets. The restructuring process has been more intensive in the export sector and, as a result, domestic firms have been gaining market shares in many countries. It is a process that must continue and be extended to the rest of the economy, supported by appropriate public policies.  In recent years various measures have been introduced to support high-tech investments and innovative start-ups. In order to be effective, industrial policy needs stable and appropriate fiscal incentives, while the regulatory framework must be aligned with international best practices. The Italian economy has many strengths that can help support these recent positive developments: private sector net wealth is high by international standards, the debt-to-income ratio of Italian families is low, exports remain strong and the current account of the balance of payments is in surplus - it has been this way for many years now, so much so that the net foreign asset position is balanced.  A reduction in the risk premium on Italian public sector bonds is another crucial objective: at the beginning of this week the yield differential with respect to 10-year German bonds was over 270 basis points, more than twice the level prevailing in early 2018, before the latest general elections.  The premia on credit default swaps suggest that the yield differential has risen as a result of the increase in both credit risk and the risk of redenomination of bonds in a different currency. The high public debt-to-GDP ratio exposes Italy to the volatility of financial markets, with the annual amount of bonds to be refinanced currently standing at around \u20ac400 billion. The average residual maturity of the public debt is above 7 years; therefore, the initial impact of higher interest rates on servicing costs is small but, if the increase in rates persists, it would inevitably weigh on expenditure. Reducing the differential between the interest burden on public debt and the nominal rate of growth of GDP - which is positive in Italy, compared with negative values in most advanced countries and throughout Europe, including in Greece - while maintaining an adequate primary surplus, is therefore of vital importance.  The transmission of higher rates from government bonds to the cost of loans for households and firms has been limited so far, thanks to banks' ample liquidity and improved balance sheets. But signs of tension are beginning to emerge. According to our surveys, credit conditions tightened somewhat, especially for small enterprises, following the increase in banks' funding costs and the deterioration in the economic outlook. In the longer run, a high risk premium on government bonds would inevitably end up affecting the real economy. A credible strategy to reduce the burden of Italy's high public debt in the medium term can no longer be postponed and the factors that lead investors to perceive higher risks, such as lax budgetary conditions and the prevalence of transfers and subsidies over growth-enhancing measures, should be tackled. The financial sector: progress and open issues  In the euro area banks' capital position has strengthened considerably. Between mid-2015 and end-2018 the capital (CET1) ratio of the so-called \"significant institutions\" - those under the direct supervision of the ECB, which account for around 80 per cent of the area's banking assets - increased from 12.7 to 14.3 per cent. For the entire Italian banking system it stands at 13.3 per cent.  In Italy the stronger capital position of banks has been accompanied by a substantial improvement in the quality of their assets, mainly thanks to large disposals of non-performing loans (NPLs). The deterioration in credit quality recorded during the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis was due for the most part (about 90 per cent according to our estimates) to the negative developments in the macroeconomic outlook. As of end-2018 the ratio of NPLs, net of provisions, to total loans had fallen to 4.3 per cent, more than halving with respect to mid-2015, when it had reached 10 per cent; in the same period, the value of net NPLs diminished from almost \u20ac200 billion to \u20ac90 billion. According to the plans requested from all banks by the supervisory authorities - the ECB for the significant institutions and the Bank of Italy for the others - the net NPL ratio should decline further, to around 3 per cent at the end of 2021.  Notwithstanding significant progress in Italy and in the rest of the euro area, much remains to be done. Four areas require special attention: banks' profitability, where intermediaries need to tackle the difficult challenges posed by technology; the appropriate treatment of risks on the asset side of banks' balance sheets; the management of higher funding costs (and the need to satisfy the new requirements on \"bail-inable\" liabilities); and the framework for managing banking crises, which has turned out to be rather complex in recent years.  Profitability. Despite recent improvements, the profitability of European banks remains weak: the average return on equity (around 6 per cent for the major intermediaries) is barely in line with the cost of equity in the euro area (and is somewhat lower in Germany and in Italy). The reasons are not only those related to the weak economic outlook.  Indeed, in Europe the role of banks in financing the economy has been diminishing for over a decade, making it difficult to increase revenues by expanding credit volumes. The transition towards a more market-based financial system is necessary in a modern economy. In this respect, in the euro area non-financial companies continue to be excessively dependent on bank credit. The ratio of bank loans to total financial debts is 36 per cent in the euro area (56 per cent in Italy), against 33 and 27 per cent in the United States and the United Kingdom. By contrast, the share of bonds is still about 10 percentage points lower than in the United Kingdom and 30 points less than in the United States. The market capitalisation of listed non-financial companies is also insufficient: at end-2017 it stood at 25 per cent of GDP in Italy and 60 per cent in Germany, against around 125 per cent in the United States.  In order to raise profitability banks must contain costs, diversify the sources of income, and find ways to significantly raise efficiency levels. The changes that are currently taking place in the financial sector pose novel challenges, but also provide fresh opportunities for well-managed financial intermediaries, among which banks can certainly be included. FinTech and Big Tech companies are offering new financial services and exploiting innovative technologies and massive amounts of data. Banks are responding by expanding the range of products provided through digital channels. It is a process that is bound to continue, as more intensive use of new technologies is necessary to compete effectively in the market and achieve adequate levels of profitability.  Risks on the assets side. We can draw a number of lessons from Italy's double-dip recession and the consequences for its banking system of both the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis. The first lesson concerns the treatment of impaired assets, an area where Italy's experience has been especially important. Following the large-scale disposals of bad loans completed in recent years, in Italy more than half of banks' total NPLs currently consist in exposures to firms whose difficulties may prove to be temporary (loans defined as \"unlikely to pay\"). Their management should aim at maximising the probability that these loans become performing again. On the one hand, significant benefits could be obtained if non-financial firms, where necessary with the collaboration of banks, resorted to specialised operators such as \"turnaround funds\", able to provide the knowledge and resources to relaunch impaired enterprises. On the other hand, supervisory and regulatory authorities should consider how best to support these strategies, including through the adoption of new specific measures.  The current European regulation on minimum coverage of new NPLs, for instance, imposes increasing provisions on loans based only on the time that has elapsed since their classification as non-performing (known as \"calendar provisioning\") and distinguishes only between guaranteed and non-guaranteed loans. The difference between bad and unlikely-to-pay loans is instead overlooked. There is therefore the risk of creating perverse incentives for banks to hold fire sales or liquidate NPLs, amplifying losses for both the banks and their customers and discouraging an active management of the credit relationship. This is an area in which regulation could be improved.  Another lesson regards the debate that has intensified in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis about the so-called \"bank-sovereign nexus\" (or \"doom loop\").  Some have proposed that the prudential treatment of banks' sovereign exposures be made more restrictive. These recommendations are built on the premise that a capital requirement or the assignment of a risk charge would break the link between banks and the State. But this link goes well beyond the holding of sovereign bonds. Indeed, it is the real economy that provides the most important connection: a restructuring of the public debt, for example, might be so disruptive that firms and households could be swept away by it, damaging the entire banking system regardless of its capitalisation or its holdings of government bonds. These proposals, moreover, overlook the stabilising role that banks, by acting as contrarian investors, can play on bond markets in periods of tension.  For these reasons, after almost three years of work and intensive discussions, at end-2017 the Basel Committee decided to maintain the current regulation.  The reduction in sovereign risk must ultimately come from sound government policy, as it cannot be obtained by simply shifting sovereign bonds from the balance sheet of one economic sector to that of another. This requires not only balanced and prudent fiscal policies but, most importantly, structural reforms aimed at regaining sustained GDP growth. The latter, in turn, would help make loans to households and firms more attractive, and reduce the share of government debt in banks' balance sheets.  While there has been a heated debate about NPLs and sovereign bond holdings, much less attention has been paid on the risks deriving from the stock of illiquid and opaque assets in banks' balance sheets, including the instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy. These risks are not easy to measure, but available estimates put them broadly on a par with those associated with NPLs. The Single Supervisory Mechanism has recently adopted some initiatives aimed at defining the most appropriate interventions to take adequate account of these risks. These efforts must be intensified.  The increase in the cost of funding is the third area that should not be neglected. In the coming years all large banks will have to raise a significant amount of \"bail-inable\" liabilities in order to fulfil the new global and European regulation on total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). Raising funds may indeed pose a difficult challenge. Regulators and supervisors have to strike the right balance between the need to set appropriate criteria in order to stop taxpayers bearing the cost of future banking crises, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the need to be sufficiently rigorous, with the risk, in persistently adverse market conditions for many intermediaries, of ultimately increasing the probability of future banking crises. The principle of bailing-in creditors makes sense but its concrete application requires care, especially in the current circumstances.  The management of banking crises. Italy's experience has revealed serious drawbacks in the new European regulation governing small-and medium-size intermediaries which, under the new rules, cannot access the facilities embedded in the so-called \"resolution\" procedure. For these banks - the vast majority of the roughly 3,000 euro-area institutions - a piecemeal liquidation is the only option currently available in the absence of interested buyers. But liquidation threatens the continuity of the supply of financial services, may imply large losses for both creditors and debtors and, due to potential contagion effects, may pose serious risks to overall financial stability. More must be done in this field, and from this perspective the experience of the United States is especially important. The US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - a government entity whose reserves are made up of private funds, but which can activate a large line of credit with the US Treasury - has successfully managed the crisis of almost 500 financial intermediaries since 2007, minimising the harm for the economy at large. It is a lesson that merits careful consideration. Conclusion  Let me conclude. As the economic prospects for the euro area are currently dominated by uncertainty, many analysts fear that should the situation degenerate into a full-blown recession or lead to deflation, monetary policy would be disarmed. This is a mistake. Central banks can rely on a wide range of instruments to support economic activity and, if necessary, the Eurosystem is ready to use them all in order to fulfil its mandate. But monetary policy should not remain alone in sustaining the economy. In the absence of a common European budget, threats to the growth or inflation outlook require greater coordination of national fiscal policies, while structural reforms would provide essential help by boosting productivity dynamics.  On the financial front, the most serious difficulties posed by the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis are now being overcome. In Italy there has been significant progress: NPLs have been halved, provisions have increased considerably and banks' capitalisation has risen significantly, even though the legacy of the double-dip recession continues to weigh on some intermediaries. Further progress will depend not only on banks' continued efforts to improve their balance sheets and lending strategies, but, above all, on their ability to rise to the challenges posed by the digital revolution, adopt strategies based on higher investment in new technologies, reduce operating costs and restructure their distribution network.  Today there are also risks associated with the incompleteness of the European construction, as we have witnessed since at least 2010. The standstill in the reform of economic governance, due to a mutual lack of trust among countries that developed during the crisis, is particularly dangerous at this stage, as the constraints on national policies have been rapidly made more stringent but the introduction of their supranational counterparts has been delayed.  In the economic and financial domain, it is clear what the most immediate steps should be: completing the banking union, rethinking the management of banking crises, and establishing a well-functioning capital markets union. But, at the same time, the reasons for discontent and criticism of European institutions also require a response. We must work to restore mutual trust, enhance security, and to create a sense of belonging. Italy must play its part by working hard and consistently to improve its economic environment and to make a credible commitment to a path of gradual but significant debt reduction. The hope is that, after the forthcoming European elections, the conditions will be established for resuming the reform agenda and pushing it forward with renewed vigour. Otherwise, as the song says, \"the long and winding road will never disappear\". </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN1033083320190518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4N-PF11-DXCW-D52H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3964\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 18, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With an aim to give citizens of the European Union more rights over their online information, the new law threatens fines of up to 4 percent of a company's annual revenue for non-compliance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The new law applies to all businesses that deal with EU citizens' data, regardless of whether they have incorporated units in the region. This could have far-reaching implications for tech giants such as Facebook and Google. It could also have repercussions for companies in Hong Kong, mainland China and other markets in Asia.</p><p>Despite the risk of onerous fines under the new rules, many businesses in the region are slow in getting themselves compliant with the new rules, according to Scott Thiel, a partner at DLA Piper's Hong Kong office.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with EJ Insight, Thiel shared his views on what Asian companies with dealings in Europe need to do to comply with the new rules and avoid significant penalties.</p><p>EJ Insight: Could you explain what GDPR is and why do firms need to be aware of it?</p><p>Thiel: The GDPR is Europe's new data privacy law, regulating all aspects of the manner in which personally identifiable information can be collected, stored and used.</p><p>It is a big change with some fundamental legal differences from the existing and other privacy laws around the world. One of the reasons it has gained so much attention is the huge increase in the level of sanctions. There could be very substantial financial penalties, up to 4 percent of the global group turnover or 20 million euros (US$22.86 million), whatever is greater.</p><p>One of the unique aspects of the GDPR is that it regulates companies outside of Europe where they are targeting or collecting data from European citizens. For example, it applies to Asian businesses selling or trying to sell to people in Europe. If you don't have offices in Europe, and you are not trying to target or profile European-based citizens, then it likely won't apply to your business. We do speak with some companies who say: \"Some of my staff in Asia are holding European passports, does GDPR apply to their data?\" No, it doesn't.</p><p>The fundamental difference between the GDPR and other privacy regimes creates a significant challenge for multinational companies with large data sets. The question arises as to how they are going to deal with the fact that laws from multiple countries may be applying to different datasets at the same time. For example, data collected in a country in Asia might need to be compliant with both GDPR and the other regulations in Asia if it is going to be sent through IT systems based in the EU. Likewise, data collected from European citizens that is brought back to Asia might also need to comply with two or more very different sets of privacy laws.</p><p>Q: What does GDPR mean for technology companies?</p><p>A: One of the things we are seeing more of is the fragmentation of data centers within businesses. The multiple law compliance challenge is driving some businesses to create individual country or regional data silos to minimize this compliance risk.</p><p>European-headquartered companies that have operations in Asia, and have their growth expectation perhaps in the Asian market, may reconsider sending data back to Europe. Companies in Asia are also questioning whether sending data to a European country (for example to their EU headquarters) might restrict what they can do with that data if GDPR will apply to it.</p><p>Q: On the first day of GDPR enforcement, Facebook and Google have been hit with a raft of lawsuits, which seek to fine both firms billions of euros, accusing the companies of coercing users into sharing personal data. Will we see more of this?</p><p>A: The expectation is that we will see more enforcement, more civil claims, and more data protection authorities bringing in claims against companies.</p><p>There is one view that GDPR was designed in part to specifically curtail the data handling practices some of the world's biggest data companies, particularly social media and internet search businesses. Interestingly enough, few if any of these are European businesses. Europe does appear to be focused on technology regulation while much of the rest of the world is promoting technology companies and innovation, particularly in the US and mainland China.</p><p>The GDPR sanction risk is potentially very significant for multinational companies, and we are encouraging all our clients to take it seriously.</p><p>Q: How about Chinese and Hong Kong tech firms? Have they\u00a0prepared for compliance?</p><p>A: No, they haven't, from our experience. A couple of weeks before the law went live, we were suddenly getting phone calls from clients saying, \"Can you get me GDPR compliant in eight weeks?\" Even two days before, we received phone calls like that.</p><p>We just had a new instruction last week from a telecommunications company which hasn't yet planned properly for GDPR. That's not that surprising in some ways. Being in Asia, inevitably there is a lag in terms of people thinking \"that isn't even our law\", \"it's not our core market\". Businesses may not be prepared and as we are seeing businesses just getting started, to me, that suggests there are a lot of businesses that are some way off being compliant.</p><p>But I think there is a genuine risk for those big tech players, typically Chinese companies, as they are increasingly coming out of China, looking to global markets, and they will need to be careful about GDPR compliance just as non-Chinese companies need to be mindful of the new data and cybersecurity laws in China.</p><p>Q: For those not compliant with the new rules yet, will we see more GDPR enforcement from the authorities?</p><p>A: With foreign companies, we simply don't know the answer to that yet. But I think there is a very real risk, and I think it depends on some broader macroeconomic issues that are recurrent in the world.</p><p>- Contact us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:english@hkej.com\">english@hkej.com</email></p><p>BN/CG</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HKEJIT-1921325</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HKEJIT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T2X-2J91-JB57-6531-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1002\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 EJ Insight of Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EJ Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5530\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 20, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0008JNU</classCode><className>DLA PIPER LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>CHINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HONGKONG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TAIWAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

It was May 2010 and the future vice presidential candidate was running against Chris Kelly, Facebook's former chief privacy officer, to be the attorney general of California.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the social network still smarting from the uproar over its new privacy policy in 2009, Harris went for the jugular. \"Was Kelly simply a fox guarding the hen house at Facebook?\" she asked. \"If Kelly couldn't stand up to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on behalf of Facebook users, how on earth can Californians trust Kelly to go to bat on their behalf?\" Today, however, Silicon Valley luminaries probably breathed a sigh of relief when Joe Biden announced her as his running mate. Since Kelly's defeat, Harris has intertwined herself ever more closely with the tech industry, leading many observers to believe that she will be more friend than foe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is despite her strenuous efforts to cast herself as a tech sceptic, such as by demanding that Twitter ban president Donald Trump and hinting that Facebook should be broken up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I don't think anybody is worried that Kamala Harris is going to get into the White House and take on tech in a huge way,\" says Silicon Valley area Democratic fundraiser Cooper Teboe.</p><p>Indeed, he believes Biden's choice will cement the support of the tech industry's big money donors, who had looked likely to support the Biden ticket anyway but who will now give more promptly and enthusiastically.</p><p>Silicon Valley is a constituency few Democrats can afford to take lightly: solidly liberal, yet affluent enough that you could easily throw a barbecue exclusively for people who can afford to make the maximum allowable donation of $2,800 (\u00a32,144) ten or a hundred times over.</p><p>Biden had a wide range to pick from, and earlier in the campaign it had looked possible that he would pick anti-Big Tech activist Elizabeth Warren. One of her major policies was breaking up Apple and Amazon.</p><p>These donors, explains Teboe, have a \"strain of independence\" in them. \"Many, while they hated Trump, and were certain to vote against Trump and work against Trump, were very curious about who would be the Democratic vice president,\" he says.</p><p>\"Some were thrilled at the thought of Elizabeth Warren and then others, probably more in the donor community, were not so thrilled about that. But all pretty unanimously were at least content with the Kamala Harris vice presidential pick.\"</p><p>Harris, after all, is a native daughter of the area, born and raised in Oakland, a city just across the bay from San Francisco. She has close connections with the great and good of the industry that has made the region wealthy and powerful.</p><p>California has never sent a Democrat to the presidential election before, so there is some local pride involved. But her record also shows a willingness to compromise with Big Tech.</p><p>\"Kamala Harris was attorney general [of California] while Facebook was acquiring WhatsApp and Instagram, and while it was solidifying this monopolistic position that it holds now in social media,\" says Max Moran, at the Left-wing Centre for Economic and Policy Research (CESR) in Washington.</p><p>Those mergers are now under the national spotlight, with Zuckerberg hauled in front of Congress earlier this month to answer questions about market dominance. Harris's colleagues repeatedly grilled him about emails suggesting he had bought the apps to kill them as competitors - but Harris had the power to regulate him.</p><p>\"Rather than take that obligation seriously she was relying on many of these people for fundraising,\" says Moran. \"She was building relationships with them, helping some of their executives promote their books.\"</p><p>That is a reference to Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's longserving chief operating officer. Harris is a long-time friend and appeared at the company's headquarters in 2015 to give a talk about cyberbullying, publicly praising tech firms' efforts to tackle the issue.</p><p>Meanwhile, Uber and other \"gig economy\" companies such as Airbnb now face a lawsuit from California's current attorney general for failing to comply with a law restricting their use of private contractors, designed explicitly to outlaw their business model. That model emerged during Harris's tenure.</p><p>As it happens, Uber's chief legal officer Tony West is married to Harris's sister, Maya. There is no evidence that the relationship influenced Harris's decisions, and she has publicly backed California's anti-Uber law, but will voters see it that way? Meanwhile Rebecca Prozan, who managed Harris's breakthrough 2003 campaign to be San Francisco's chief prosecutor, is now Google's head lobbyist for the state of California.</p><p>In financial terms, too, the Valley has been kind to her. According to a database compiled by CESR's \"Revolving Door Project\", listing all known donors associated with major industries who gave a total of $1,000, Harris's Democratic primary campaign attracted money from 37pc of tech donors compared to 22pc for Biden, 22pc for Buttgieg and just 3pc for Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>She also owes more to tech than her rivals, having received 28pc of her total purse from tech compared to Biden's 16pc. Donors associated with Google gave her $26,159, Apple $12,450, Microsoft almost $12,000 and Facebook $10,500.</p><p>LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman was one of her biggest \"bundlers\", chaining together $2,800 donations into a formidable financial base.</p><p>These days the wind has changed, and Big Tech is Democratic public enemy number two (behind the president, of course). It sorely needs an advocate, so will that be Harris? In fact she too has changed her tune, calling last year for \"serious regulation\" of Facebook, and in May she wrote to Zuckerberg pressing him on his misinformation policies, saying Trump adverts redirecting people searching for census information to the president's website were \"a robust unacceptable interference in the census\".</p><p>Jamison Foser, a Democrat political strategist, said: \"Senator Harris's aggressive criticism of social media companies for giving Trump special treatment \u2026 demonstrates a rapidly growing understanding in the Democratic Party of the threat these companies pose to both democracy and progressive values.\"</p><p>Many, however, argue that she has been vague enough to leave room for reversals and carefully stopped short of concrete, aggressive proposals. Teboe thinks that she has not convinced many.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, one staunch tech critic is all but in her corner.</p><p>Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor and former mentor to Zuckerberg who has now become a persistent thorn in his side, says her sway in the Valley might allow her to administer some tough love.</p><p>\"Think about Lyndon Johnson doing the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, or Nixon going to China,\" he says. \"Biden owes his nominations and eventual election to the communities most harmed by the hate speech and disinformation and conspiracy theories spread over internet platforms.</p><p>\"I'm extremely optimistic that Senator Harris, in her new role, will embrace that challenge \u2026 unless she's nuts - and she's not nuts - her future is about doing the right thing for all Americans. I think that will be good for everyone, including those platforms.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>SCAREDY CAT FOR THE TELEGRAPH</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-162355407</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KF-9K81-JCBW-N019-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1206\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is neither for my benefit, nor because (in her words) she's some \"unhelpful Instagram maniac, always looking perfect\". Rather it is her coping mechanism, one she refined long before lockdown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are \"meeting\" to discuss the Women's Prize for Fiction, whose judging panel Lane Fox chairs this year. She ploughed through 60 books to reach a shortlist - including Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo and Hilary Mantel's The Mirror &amp; the Light - which she describes as \"incredibly strong\". But shops are shut, Amazon has just announced it is downgrading book orders and the customary glittering awards dinner will, of course, not happen. \"Such a shame,\" she says sadly, especially when more than ever we need the solace of reading.</p><p>As we talk about the restrictions and strains of lockdown, it strikes me that Lane Fox is unusually well versed in coping strategies. She would deny it hotly, and say - as she does constantly - that she is privileged and wealthy. \"Lucky\" is the word she uses most to describe herself. And true, born into landed gentry stock, privately then Oxford educated, she became the beautiful young face of the first internet boom and, after <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">www.lastminute.com</url>, which she founded with Brent Hoberman, was sold, she pocketed \u00a313 million. Now 47, she has ascended to the Great and the Good as the crossbench Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho. (She applied and was accepted under the People's Peers programme, becoming the youngest woman in the Lords.) She has an exquisite portfolio of directorships: Twitter, the Donmar Warehouse, Chanel.</p><p>Yet I have interviewed her before, in real life, when she lived in a five-storey Mayfair house as grand as an embassy (she now lives in Maida Vale), and it was hard not to be awed by her Tate-grade modern art, swishing domestic staff and the burnished appearance only found among the super-rich. Until she stood up.</p><p>Limping across her vast living room, you witnessed the constant, barely suppressed pain.</p><p>It is 16 years since, on a holiday to Morocco to celebrate being offered, at just 31, the role of CEO of Selfridges, she was catapulted out of a 4x4, breaking 28 bones, including vertebrae and her pelvis in six places. But for the resources to be airlifted home and fund her treatment - she was in hospital for two years - Lane Fox might have died or been confined to a wheelchair. But that she is not, indeed is still prominent in public life, is also a testament to her steeliness, self-discipline and an unwavering daily regime.</p><p>\"My strategy is not very sophisticated,\" she says. \"Ever since my accident, exercise is a fundamental part of survival. So every day I do a Facetime session with my physio, I do boxing on Facebook with my brilliant boxing lady, and I try to do a walk every day, because otherwise I find my mental health goes to shit. So that's a cornerstone of every single day. And I try to make sure I am up and dressed, and I am going to go to work at my desk, because otherwise the whole day starts slipping.\"</p><p>She endures difficult times by setting herself small goals, like lifting a slightly heavier weight each day. \"I had a very bad fall at the end of last year,\" she says, \"and I was in a lot of pain for a number of months, and it was bad and bleak again.\" Dealing with her health is \"like another job, in a funny way. You just have to manage all the shit that's wrong. Continence, pain, movement - it takes just a load more effort than it does for everybody else. Loads of people have a thing, and that's just my thing.\"</p><p>Music and books help, too. \"There is always an imaginative place you can go to, which is why I feel like people are being creative in so many ways at the minute. In hospital, I couldn't really deal with music; it made me too sad. So I didn't listen for quite a long time, and then I did. As an example, just this morning I had a bit of a disco in my house, one of my favourite activities, which was good, so that cheers the mood up a lot. But in hospital, I sometimes listened to audiobooks, and people read to me. I loved that. But music was tough.\"</p><p>Both her professional internet credentials and her need to conserve her limited energy mean Lane Fox is well prepared for the new world of working from home and socialising online. She links up with her best friend, sister and mother regularly to discuss poetry, last night Sir Patrick Spens, a medieval Scottish ballad, her mum's favourite. I say that poetry can make me burst into tears right now. \"Fair enough!\" she says. \"I think there probably were tears, but that's OK too.\"</p><p>Lane Fox says she's an eclectic reader, enjoying everything \"from astronaut Scott Kelly's memoir [badly written but mindboggling] to Elif Batuman's The Idiot [beautifully written and hilarious]. I could read How to Be Both by Ali Smith every week for a long time.\" Before judging the competition she prided herself on reading a book a week. \"Now that seems like a cinch.\" Many images from the shortlisted books linger in her mind: \"The amazing depictions of how women moved through Tudor spaces in Maggie O'Farrell's Hamnet, to the elegiac expression of life in Britain as a woman of colour in Girl, Woman, Other.\"</p><p>Now lockdown has made her reconsider the internet paradox she tackled during her three years as David Cameron's digital tsar: the people still not connected, notably the elderly, are those who would benefit from it most. She has just given her father, Robin Lane Fox, a gardener and classical historian, an iPad. \"He's 72. He's not old; he's constantly telling me he feels about 28 and that each decade gets better. He writes in solitary confinement all the time. I'm trying to work out how to educate him about his iPad remotely, because I know being able to use Zoom or Facetime for him will be transformational. He would love to see us all.\" But to her frustration, despite the instructions she wrote for him, he cannot master it.</p><p>\"I feel so\u2026 like I didn't do a good job,\" she says of her digital tsar years. She succeeded in gleaning funds to improve hospital wifi, which is critical now, but failed to budge the figure of five million people still not online. The problem, she discovered, wasn't simply rolling out connectivity, but imparting tech skills. \"It wasn't just the old either. Poor people too. And something that I found interesting, when Brexit happened, if you mapped people who were not connected to the internet and Brexit voters, guess what? Pretty much you could map them on top of each other. I'm not for one minute suggesting there's a causation there, but there's definitely a correlation.\"</p><p>The lockdown, she says, could be a turning point for tech companies, after a period when they've been reviled for permitting fake news, vicious trolling and tax avoidance. \"Tech's had a bad rep in the past few years, understandably, and sometimes deservedly. But even ten years ago we would not have had these connectivity tools. Clearly the current situation is not the utopian vision of a libertarian Silicon Valley of the Eighties, but there is something remarkable about an isolation where we're all feeling more connected in a funny way.\"</p><p>What will be the lasting consequences for internet companies? \"Right now, Zoom is valued at more than the entire US airline industry. I mean, that's clearly nuts, right? What I hope is that tech companies realise that they have a responsibility to society, not just to their bottom line.\" She hopes the old Wild West notion that the online world transcends the rules and ethics of the real world is over: \"Tech firms are bricks and mortar. The knotting and weaving together of society is so fundamentally created by technology and tech companies. I do think it's impossible for any of them to shy away from their greater responsibility to society now.\"</p><p>So will they begin to pay a fairer share of tax? Lane Fox thinks it is absurd to compare the far smaller Twitter to gargantuan Facebook, Amazon, Google or Microsoft. \"It's a completely different ball game.\" Nor is she certain that in a post-coronavirus economic depression these companies will face a global political reckoning. \"In the end it comes down to regulation and legislation, and what the US does, especially after the election. I have no idea what's going to happen. But it feels like Amazon has behaved appallingly in terms of tax and what it did with the US cities, getting them to pay it to build its places there. That feels very\u2026 troubling. But at the same time, we'd all be stuffed right now without Amazon.\"</p><p>Will the lockdown change work habits for ever? \"Walking about in London, you just feel the quality of the air, how it shifted so quickly. Hearing the birds. I hope in some way this will show people that nature can come back quickly, and it is such an important task for all of us in the next decade.\" But she is not convinced home working will become the new norm. \"I think probably people will be desperate to get back into spaces where their lives are more structured. We're lucky here - we've got space to work and I've got a lovely office in my home, and I've got help normally at home, so I don't need to worry about my kids.\"</p><p>After her terrible injuries, Lane Fox feared she'd never be a mother. But she and her partner, Chris Gorell Barnes, a digital entrepreneur and marine conservationist, whom she'd barely started dating when he accompanied her on that Moroccan holiday, have three-year-old twins, Felix and Milo. They were born via a surrogate and I wonder, since a government review may in the future permit commercialised surrogacy, if she will address the issue in the Lords. \"It feels quite private,\" she says. \"I don't necessarily want to use my experience\u2026 But also it's a miracle to live in 2020 and have these different ways of having families. So making sure that's done in the most safe, moral, ethical and accessible way feels the right thing to do. But I haven't worked out yet whether I want to use my voice in that.\"</p><p>Her sons, she says, are coping with the lockdown well. \"They have loads of fun. The other morning, I went upstairs and they told me that their two favourite teddies had masks on because they didn't feel very well. And I thought, 'We haven't really talked about masks.' They must have seen people in the street or whatever, and picked it up by osmosis. But it wasn't upsetting for them: they just said it as a fact. I said, 'Do you think they are going to feel better soon?' They said, 'Oh, yes, they are going to feel better after breakfast.' \" Unlike the Silicon Valley parents who send their children to computer-free schools to preserve their innocence and attention span, Lane Fox says she doesn't have \"that kind of hysteria about screens. I've never seen any research or data points that show screens are inherently a terrible thing. We all spend a lot of time on them, it can be incredibly rewarding and meaningful, and that's how my children are keeping in touch with their grandparents now, through Facetime chats. They play silly games or learn spelling on different apps. I don't have a problem with any of those things.\"</p><p>She simply extends her own internet rules to her sons. \"I never have notifications on; I keep the screens dimmed - all that stuff. I don't want to feel badgered by it. I want to feel I am in charge of it, not the other way around. I don't take my iPad or phone into our bedroom. They stay downstairs, and then when we go up to bed that's it.\" Recently Gorell Barnes expressed concern about how much time their kids would spend online when they're ten. \"I'm like, mate, when they're ten we're not going to be worrying about the iPhone; it's going to be what their AR and VR goggles are doing, or what games they are playing in some kind of crazy, virtual, alternative reality. The challenges are going to be so different.\"</p><p>Having the twins has made her personal regime even stricter: she would never work in pyjamas, needs proper clothes for her brain to get going. Yes, I say, but who knows on Zoom what is worn below the waist? At this, Lane Fox's mood lightens. \"I would like you to know! [She stands up.] There you are. I am wearing trousers.\" Then she swings her laptop around to the wall where in a glass case are a pair of scant panties and nipple tassels. They were presented to her by the Soho Society to celebrate the karaoke business she founded, Lucky Voice. Has she ever worn them? \"Well, you will be pleased to hear I will not be inflicting that on anybody in the world.\" n The winner of the Women's Prize for Fiction is announced on September 9 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.womensprizeforfiction.co.uk\">www.womensprizeforfiction.co.uk</url>)</p><p>'Amazon behaved appallingly with its tax.

Gnarled politicians with a regrettably loose grasp of what <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>actually does ask the young billionaire about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, Russian electoral interference and <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>role in distributing hate speech and fake news. They are the vanguard of a backlash that has been brewing for months. Giant technology companies have become targets of suspicion because of their size, their influence, their possibly addictive products and their apparent indifference to our privacy. So <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is deferential. He apologises frequently. He gently explains his business model, pledges to do better and avoids saying anything very memorable. In the circumstances, Wall Street judges it a tactical triumph.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the very same time, 3,000 miles to the west, the chief executive of Apple is holding forth before a smaller panel of inquisitors. It consists, in fact, of only one person - me.</p><p>Unlike <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Tim Cook </nameText></person>is on home turf. We are sitting at one end of an airy mezzanine dining area in Apple Park, the company's futuristic new headquarters in Cupertino, California. Two media aides are listening in. Other employees are eating lunch nearby, undisturbed by their low-key boss. A bodyguard was around earlier and is presumably still somewhere at a discreet distance in case I attempt to exact violent retribution for that time when my iPhone lost hundreds of Notes memos during an update.</p><p>In other words, this is not the showdown in Washington DC. But the wider context is the same, and Cook didn't get to run the world's most valuable company by mincing his words.</p><p>\"There's certainly a negative narrative around Silicon Valley right now just in general,\" he says in his measured Alabama drawl. \"Whether that's in this country, or in your country, or in the broader EU. So I think it's important to tell everybody what our values are and be clear about those, because our users deserve to know that.\"</p><p>Cook, 57, is in his regular uniform of jeans and trainers with an open-necked shirt, thin sweater and dark-framed glasses. A \"fitness nut\" who gets up before 4am most days to email and work out, he lives a life that is otherwise \"very focused on Apple\". No one would mistake him for an intern. He is lean, straight-backed and silver-haired with strikingly white teeth and slightly mechanical body language. His manner is warm and understated but calmly insistent.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>plans to argue that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is not an outlier. Photographs of his notes will show that he is ready to say - although he doesn't - that Apple is \"similar\" to <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in terms of its collection of data and that his company is only a \"small part\" of the online advertising market. Google, for instance, also collects vast amounts of data about its users and has an advertising business more than twice the size of <person><nameText>Facebook's.</nameText></person></p><p>Cook's approach is different. He maintains that his company does not deserve to be corralled into any sort of public shaming for Big Tech. He really wants you to know that this mess is not Apple's fault.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley as a whole is not monolithic,\" he explains. Unlike some other companies he could mention, but won't, Apple has regarded privacy as \"a basic human right\" for a long time and \"built the company around\" that belief. The sprawling, intimate personal data profiles that companies like <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google compile \"shouldn't exist\", Cook thinks. On cybersecurity, most modern Apple devices come with sophisticated defences built in and the company also protects its FaceTime and Messages apps with end-to-end encryption unlike, say, Google's standard Gmail and Twitter direct messages. Unlike YouTube, Apple's App Store is \"curated\" to the extent that you (and your children) won't find hate speech or pornography on there. On the environment Apple has, just the day before, reached the \"huge milestone\" of being run entirely on renewable energy. He does not need to add that Greenpeace gives Apple an \"A\" rating for its energy sustainability while Amazon gets a \"C\".</p><p>As he ticks his points off, Cook leans slowly from one side to the other, planting his fingers down on the table for emphasis and making intense eye contact, like a concert pianist playing chords and checking his sheet music.</p><p>Despite a personal fortune estimated by Bloomberg at $600 million - and a company ruling that forbids him from flying anywhere except by private jet in the interests of security and efficiency - Cook is a man of apparently modest tastes driven primarily by strong moral convictions. He has told shareholders that Apple will do things because they are \"just and right\", even if there is no obvious profit to be made. In some small way he aspires to live up to the sacrifices of his heroes Martin Luther King Jr and Bobby Kennedy, whose portraits hang in his small top-floor office, opposite the plain desk with its Apple laptop and incongruously clunky in/out tray and landline telephone. It was King and Kennedy's examples of fighting for equality that encouraged this very private man to come out publicly as gay in 2014, becoming the most prominent businessman to do so. In an essay written to provide inspiration to anyone wrestling with their identity, he wrote, \"Let me be clear: I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.\" He cited Dr King again last summer following the deadly racist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. In an email to Apple staff he stated that he disagreed with President Trump's reluctance to condemn unequivocally the white supremacists involved. \"This is not about the left or the right, conservative or liberal. It is about human decency and morality.\"</p><p>But Cook does not believe that he would be much of an activist. It is through business that he thinks he can create the most beneficial changes. When Cook talks about the good that Apple does in the world, his pale blue eyes glisten. His disapproval for what he considers the irresponsible practices of other technology companies is equally evident.</p><p>\"Even companies that people typically associate with each other, I think it's important to dig more,\" he says. \"There's a tendency to lump big ones together.\" There is.</p><p>\"Or people with big market caps, or whatever, or internet companies. But what I found is: rarely are two substantial [companies] even similar \u2026 in terms of the way they're run, the way they think, the way they make decisions. They're very different.\"</p><p>Doesn't he worry that those distinctions are lost on worried customers and on politicians around the world who are pressing for greater regulation of the technology sector? \"Well, I care most about our users, our users and our employees,\" Cook says. \"Those are the two that I put on the pedestal. Users know that we prioritise the user experience, that that's what we're about. And employees want to be a part of a company that has a greater purpose to it. And I think our employees know that [Apple is that]. And so, do I expect either of those groups would indiscriminately paint us with the same roller?\" Here he enthusiastically paints an imaginary wall between us with an imaginary roller. \"I don't think so. I don't think so.\"</p><p>Right, but doesn't this climate encourage even Apple enthusiasts to think the worst of the company when unfavourable news does break? For example, when leaked documents revealed in November that much of Apple's $252 billion stash of offshore cash had been moved to a tax haven in the English Channel? Or when it emerged in January that the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating the company over a software update that deliberately slowed down older iPhones? Cook offers an inscrutable smile.</p><p>\"We're large and there will always be allegations and so forth. We have to be clear about our view and how we look at it. Will anybody say, 'Tech is bad, and I look at those two [stories] and that proves that you're bad?' Some people will. But I think the number of those [people] is very small. We have such a significant relationship with our users that I don't think that one allegation coming in is going to blow up all of that. I mean, it's like if you and your spouse, or partner, have a debate.</p><p>It's unlikely that one is going to split you up, right? This is very much how I look at it. But I do think it's important that we never go in the bunker and sort of hope it passes or whatever. I think we have to be straightforward.\"</p><p>We had first met two weeks earlier in Chicago.</p><p>The occasion was the unveiling of the latest iPad, essentially an update aimed largely at the education market. Of course, the company introduced it to the world with all the restraint of Disney premiering a new Star Wars movie.</p><p>For a company with a minimalist sensibility Apple loves a gaudy product launch. Hundreds of journalists, employees, teachers and students were flown and bussed from around the world to Lane Tech College Preparatory School.</p><p>Television crews surrounded the vast brick campus. Scores of cheerful Apple Store staff were on hand as greeters, wearing dark green Apple sweatshirts and orange woolly hats. They herded everybody into a wood-panelled art deco auditorium where bass-heavy rock music pounded in the background. With 15 minutes to go before the presentation, the greeters were dividing the crowd into sections and organising cheering contests. With ten minutes to go, the former US vice president Al Gore (an Apple board member) wandered in.</p><p>On the dot of 10am, the lights went down, hundreds of iPhones were thrust into the air to capture the moment and on a giant screen a gorgeously shot film of smiling children in a school playground began. In the voiceover a child's voice said, \"We can make anything we want and we can make it change the world.\" The lights came back up and Cook wandered on stage to a rock star welcome. He wore black trainers, fawn chinos and a navy blue sweater. A chunky Series 3 Apple watch was strapped to his left wrist. Later I noticed that his socks were slightly insouciant: dark blue with green discs.</p><p>Cook doesn't try to emulate his visionary predecessor, the late <person><nameText>Steve Jobs, </nameText></person>who was such a master of the theatrical product launch that Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin built their 2015 biopic of him around three such events. Instead, Cook ceded the stage for most of this presentation to a cast of Apple executives and teachers from the US and Britain who sang the new device's praises.</p><p>Cook returned at the end of the presentation, like an archbishop delivering the final blessing and dismissal after Holy Communion. \"We believe that our place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful tools that amplify learning and creativity,\" he said. \"This is something that only Apple can do.\"</p><p>Talking to Cook in the upstairs library afterwards, he was vigilant and composed, and betrayed not a hint of post-event adrenaline. \"We want to remind people how important education is to the company and how we think that education is a great equaliser,\" he said. He talked about how Apple is teaching children around the world to code as a way to level educational playing fields.</p><p>The company is also betting big on augmented reality (AR), a technology that Cook loves because it encourages interaction and enhances people's performance rather than replacing them. One app demonstrated in Chicago puts a virtual frog on your table. Looked at through an iPad, you can zoom in and examine the frog's appearance or its muscular system and throbbing organs or, with an Apple pencil, dissect it. Another AR app makes it look as if you have a real Old Master painting from a museum hanging on your bedroom wall. You can approach it from any angle and get in so close that you can see the brush strokes and cracks in the paint, AR \"changes education. I think it changes business. I think it changes the consumer. I think it changes the world,\" Cook said.</p><p>I asked what he had meant earlier by \"this is something only Apple can do\".</p><p>\"I think most companies in the technology industry are almost solely focused on technology. That's fine. That's not a criticism, but they're solely focused on that. Apple has always fused humanity into technology.\" The company was all about \"providing the user [with products] that would empower them to express their passion or to change the world in some way \u2026 We're fine with being the Lone Ranger there. We think it's a special place.\"</p><p>When I interviewed the chief executive of Microsoft last year, though, he talked a lot about helping people around the world fulfil their potential. Satya Nadella's stated vision for his company is \"to empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more\". What about Microsoft? A hint of disapproval crept into Cook's expression. \"Do you see anybody sitting in front of a Windows PC feeling empowered and creative?\" We moved on to screen time. In January, on a visit to Britain, Cook said, \"I don't have a kid, but I have a nephew I put some boundaries on. There are some things that I won't allow; I don't want them on a social network.\" Two activist shareholders with a combined Apple stake worth about $2 billion recently called on Apple to create ways for parents to restrict children's iPhone access and to invest in research into the effects of heavy screen usage.</p><p>Cook told me that there \"should be\" serious concerns about the mental health impact on children in particular of spending too much time with their screens. But he said he was \"not hearing\" that Apple's devices themselves were addictive. It's the apps that other people make for them that he is \"deeply worried about\".</p><p>From there it wasn't hard to skewer Twitter, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and others without mentioning them by name. The real problem, Cook said, is the corrosive need to check \"what the latest post is\" or tally \"how many likes have I had?\".</p><p>\"We're in a sort of unique position there, because we don't measure our success by how much time somebody's using our product. We don't want you using our product all the time,\" he added. \"You need to do other things in your life as well, right? \"If you have a model that is based solely on digital advertising, that can lead you down a path where the user isn't the user any more. The user is the product. The customer is the advertiser and the desire is as many clicks as you can get.\" He frowned. \"The user is lost in that. Humanity is lost in that.\"</p><p>Cook grew up in Robertsdale, Alabama, which he has described as a small town \"on the road to the beach\". He was one of three sons born to Don, a shipyard worker, and Geraldine, who worked in a pharmacy. When he was seven years old, King and Kennedy were both assassinated in the space of two months. Cook remembers the tragedies being all over the television and \"not really understanding why the good guys were getting killed [when] they were trying to get everyone to recognise everyone else with the same essential rights, which is always what America has stood for\". He registered \"this great conflict between what I thought and what was happening\".</p><p>As a boy, he saw the impact of the Ku Klux Klan first hand. Once he witnessed a crossburning outside the home of a black family in his neighbourhood. \"This image was permanently imprinted in my brain, and it would change my life for ever,\" he said in a 2013 speech. But he stresses that there was racial tension across the country. \"In Chicago there were riots and marches. Dr King talked about the slums and ghettoes of our northern cities. It wasn't just the South. It's broader.\" He remains \"a proud Alabaman. Very much so.</p><p>The people there are salt of the earth. They believe in really hard work. They help their neighbours. They look you in the eye. They say hello. It's a privilege to be from there.\"</p><p>A star student at high school and then at Auburn and Duke Universities, he rose up the Silicon Valley management chain at IBM and Compaq. Looking back, though, he thinks that he was \"rudderless\" then. \"I was spending a ton of time at work working really hard \u2026 but the purposes were to become more productive or more efficient. There wasn't a North Star that was the gravitational pull.\" Then, in 1998, Cook met <person><nameText>Steve Jobs.</nameText></person></p><p>At the time Jobs was just embarking on his second stint in charge at Apple, the triumphal comeback that would cement his place in business folklore. \"My intuition told me that joining Apple would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for a creative genius,\" Cook would later tell Jobs' biographer, Walter Isaacson. He loved Apple from day one. Joining was \"sort of like being born again\", Cook says now. The company had a sense of mission, a \"different soul\" to it. \"There was a reason for the company and, for me, that was an incredible feeling that I'd never felt before.\"</p><p>Cook slashed the number of suppliers, the number of warehouses, the amount of inventory and the time it took to make an Apple product. He became Jobs' \"indispensable backstage partner\", Isaacson wrote.</p><p>In 2004 he filled in as interim chief executive for two months while Jobs recovered from cancer surgery. At the time some analysts ridiculed the idea that the steady Cook might become a long-term successor. But in August 2011 Jobs resigned and made his friend chief executive. Six weeks later Jobs was dead.</p><p>\"It was a very emotional period for the company, for me personally,\" Cook says. \"I had Continues on page 49 convinced myself that he would live longer than I would. And I look back now and I think, you know, the set of circumstances would have said that that was a really dumb thing to think, but I thought it. He always bounced. I had seen him go down before and always come back up.\"</p><p>Robert Iger, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company and a good friend of both men, joined the board of Apple shortly after Jobs' death. That period was perhaps Cook's finest hour, he tells me. \"He stepped into some rather large shoes at the beginning, knowing that there was no other Steve and also in deep mourning himself for his personal loss, with everybody at Apple. So he begins his real tenure as CEO with a dark cloud over everyone. A very painful thing. And from the beginning he was steady. His legs never seemed like they were giving out from under him. Apple needed that. They needed someone to hold on to and he was that for them.\"</p><p>Cook has evolved as a leader, gaining confidence and steering the company through enormous growth. \"He doesn't let the scrutiny that Apple gets get in the way of making rational, thoughtful decisions,\" says Iger. \"It's very much his company now, but he would be the last to admit that. Actually, he would be the last to want to admit that.\" Cook is \"one of the most genuine, authentic people there is\", he adds. \"He comes across as an earnest guy but Tim has a great sense of humour and an uncanny ability to have a good laugh beneath that somewhat stoic exterior.\"</p><p>Cook's leadership was tested again in December 2015 when the Obama administration leaned heavily on Apple to unlock the iPhone of a homegrown terrorist who had carried out a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The company refused because of the precedent that such a move would set. A national debate raged over how to balance privacy against security. Eventually the FBI found a mysterious third party who hacked the device anyway.</p><p>\"We learnt a lot,\" Cook says. \"The lesson I was most shocked over was that when the government turns against you, that there's a very nasty side of it. And that the rule book that I always thought was there can be thrown out of the window \u2026 Obviously, I was naive.\"</p><p>Cook used to have a reputation for steeliness and withering stares. I ask if he had to become more empathetic as chief executive. He replies that he has \"always had an empathetic gene that was pretty dominant because of my background \u2026 because of being a gay man in a period of time that, ah, you know, was difficult.\"</p><p>He pauses. \"The thing that being different does for you, or it did for me and I think a lot of people: it's not that I know what it's like to be an African-American. I don't and I know I won't. But I know what it's like to be in a minority, a very small one, and to be made to feel like you're on the Island of Misfit Toys.</p><p>\"For that reason it's always been clear to me that the world would be so much better off if we all just treated each other with dignity and respect. And it's pretty much that simple. We don't need a big budget increase to do it. We all have it within us to do it.\"</p><p><person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>hoped that the enormous ringshaped \"spaceship\" where we are sitting now would be \"the best office building in the world\". Time will tell - staff only began moving into Apple Park late last year - but with a reported cost of $5 billion (\u00a33.5 billion), it is almost certainly the most expensive.</p><p>Sunlight pours in through the giant exterior curved glass panel that stretches four storeys from the floor to the ceiling far above us. At ground level outside Apple staff glide past on silver company bicycles. Gardeners with saplings and men in hard hats tramp through the unfinished landscaped grounds. In the distance you can see the Santa Cruz mountains.</p><p>Glance in the opposite direction through more glass at the huge garden in the centre of the complex and there are pathways, outdoor tables and more trees. Between here and there you can see staff pacing along glass corridors that wrap around the main interior wall. The ones on the higher floors look like they are striding through the sky.</p><p>Everything in this extraordinary building has been obsessively \"curated\" by Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple's British chief design officer, who worked with architects from Lord Foster's practice on every step of the project. It is not a surprise to learn that the simple wooden table we are sitting at was produced by a 100-yearold Dutch family firm. Or that the bentwood dining chairs are Japanese, custom-made and sell for upwards of $2,500 (\u00a31,700) each.</p><p>Around and below us hundreds of identical chairs and tables and matching benches fill the busy 4,000-seat caf\u00e9, along with dozens of tall trees in planting boxes. The caf\u00e9 serving area itself is so polished and minimalist and white that you feel like a lost earthling in a Sixties sci-fi movie who has crash-landed in the distant future. You can't tell what the chefs are cooking because there are no menus on display (the options are on your phone if you're an employee). You don't seem to be able to pay cash for anything and there are no sauce sachets or eating utensils to be seen unless you know where to look (they're with the other unsightly essentials like bottled drinks and napkins, sunk out of sight in smooth, curved central islands reminiscent of giant iPods).</p><p>The overall effect of the place is so hypnotic that later, on emerging back through the security gate into the real world, I will feel briefly violated by the ugliness of traffic, litter and boxy supermarket buildings.</p><p>The knock against Cook since he took over has been that Apple has not come up with a product to match the iMac, the iPhone or the iPad since 2011. One response would be: who has? Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with the tech-focused research firm Creative Strategies, disregards the \"if Steve were alive\" grumbles, which she expects to continue for years to come. There has been innovation - notably the Apple Watch. There have also been \"impressive improvements\" to existing products, wellmanaged expansion and diversification. Cook has come into his own, she says, by \"trading on his strengths\", especially through expanding Apple's engagement with social concerns.</p><p>So what is the chief executive not so good at, I ask him. He beams. \"I'm terrible at so many things!\" What are you trying to get better at, then? Cook raises his eyebrows and laughs loudly. \"That's like asking me my weaknesses in a nice way! I always try to avoid that question. Jeez, I could do everything better. I think I could do pretty much everything better.\" One of his aides chuckles to herself knowingly.</p><p>Eventually, Cook settles on something that he is already taking pains to do better: avoiding biased or sensational news. Inevitably, there's a curated in-house app involved - Apple News. Cook uses it and systematically reads both liberal and conservative views. Part of his morning routine is also asking Siri to play the headlines from both National Public Radio and on Fox News. He has \"profound disagreements\" with the Trump administration on many things, including immigration, climate change and trade, but says that his dealings with the administration have left him \"optimistic\" for America and the world.</p><p>And about his industry? What about that \"negative narrative\" around Silicon Valley he spoke about earlier? Is it a blip or here to stay? \"I think it's a combination of things,\" Cook says. \"Something's happened that has brought great focus on that. But it's [also] sort of the natural outgrowth of tech becoming a large percentage of the economy. With the success comes more scrutiny, which is right. I think scrutiny is good. I don't agree with all of the points being made by any means, but I think scrutiny in and of itself, for companies that are large and are in industries that touch so many people's lives every day - this is a must.\" n</p><p>he doesn't believe apple devices are addictive. It's the apps he is 'deeply worried about'</p><p>'rivals see the user as the product. the desire is as many clicks as you can get.

Based in the city's bustling start-up hub Catalyst Inc, the tech firm's chief executive is a man with a billion-dollar goal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I have a vision that we will make this the first, or one of the first, unicorns to come from Northern Ireland,\" said Co Down man Alan Foreman (46).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such a claim might earn a swift rebuke in any of Belfast's many drinking establishments, but in Las Vegas, where Alan has just returned after launching the firm's latest product at the world's biggest tech event, CES, the industry is sitting up and taking notice.</p><p>B-Secur uses the human heart as the source of its next-level biometric technology.</p><p>From early incursions into electrocardiogram (ECG) based security, the company is now adopting its software for use in the motor and wearable tech industries.</p><p>\"Through our technology, I can tell you how stressed you are in real time, I can tell you what your heart rate is like, I can tell how fatigued you are and I can tell if you have any health problems,\" Alan said.</p><p>Introduced into a vehicle or an item of clothing and the applications are immeasurable.</p><p>\"By simply touching your steering wheel, or through the watch or T-shirt you are wearing, we can see in real time and detect how well you are.</p><p>\"That has huge implications for the NHS, and for drivers. A quarter of all driver road deaths are caused by fatigue. We know about three minutes before a driver is in a fatigued-enough state where they cannot drive the car. So we can save lives.\"</p><p>Founded in 2002 by Colin Anderson, B-Secur emerged out of efforts to understand the differences between people for security purposes. </p><p>The company remained largely dormant for a number of years, until it gained new momentum just over four years ago when Alan Foreman came on board.</p><p>The Co Down man, who had been out of Northern Ireland for some 25 years, was at the time the global managing director for tech firm Accenture.</p><p>\"Colin said, 'Why don't you look at this little dormant project and pick it up? The world is now right for the next generation of biometrics.'\"</p><p>The adoption of biometrics into smartphone devices has resulted in an explosion of the technology, with millions of people using fingerprint, iris, voice and facial recognition daily.</p><p>\"Until Apple put it into the iPhone four years ago, no one was comfortable about sharing that type of biometric data,\" Alan recalled. </p><p>\"Now everyone accesses their bank account or personal details using biometrics. So the world has really moved on in recent years.</p><p>\"But those traditional methods of biometrics are really quite rudimentary and now the tech world is looking for the next evolution.\"</p><p>B-Secur believes it has the answer in the guise of its ECG/heart technology.</p><p>\"The new generation of biometrics, such as ECG, offers much more,\" Alan said. </p><p>\"Not only can we secure data, but we can offer insights into individuals' health and wellness.</p><p>Speaking last week, the chief executive was still buzzing after the successful launch of B-Secur's new product Heartkey at CES - the world's largest tech event in Las Vegas.</p><p>\"We were chosen as a 'top pick' for CES; I don't think that's ever happened for a Northern Ireland company before. It's really cool.\"</p><p>B-Secur has already developed prototype T-shirts and steering wheels to demonstrate the technology's potential.</p><p>It's already understood to have attracted the interest of a number of major car manufacturers, with one of Europe's biggest motor firms believed to be among those currently testing the tech.</p><p>\"Our software fits into everyone else's technology, whether it be a steering wheel or a wearable,\" said Alan.</p><p>While the potential adoption by major German car makers is an exciting turn for the firm, Alan believes its application could have an even greater impact in the heavily regulated world of truck driving, where drivers face restrictions on their time behind the wheel.</p><p>\"If we can automate that and know the driver is within certain parameters, then we can control the vehicle.\"</p><p>Despite the market for wearable tracker devices becoming increasingly crowded, Alan remains undaunted.</p><p>\"The stuff that Fitbit and Apple and what everybody has come out with is very rudimentary technology.</p><p>\"They use a little light that shines into your skin, it's old technology. So all of them are coming to us now to give them ECG or medical-grade technology. </p><p>\"We can build that into a Fitbit, for example, and allow it to move from just a fitness tracker toward a health or medical device. That's where the world wants to go.</p><p>\"Apple and Google have already announced that they [each] want to move to become a medical and health-related company. That's where the big market is for the tech guys in the world.\"</p><p>Apple are currently developing their own in-house ECG programme.</p><p>But Alan said other firms who have attempted to deploy similar software to date have eventually turned to B Secur and Belfast.</p><p>\"We're working with every other player in the market.\"</p><p>B Secur has also developed a new T-shirt which similarly will detect stress and fatigue.</p><p>\"You can put this onto older dementia patients or young children, take them out of the hospital environment and monitor them in real time.\"</p><p>Other potential uses include monitoring security or armed forces; fire fighters; medical staff or any employees where health and safety is an issue.</p><p>\"We know if their stress level is beyond the norm such that intervention is required.</p><p>\"All the big tech companies are starting to wake up to the idea that this is possibly important.\"</p><p>After four years of development, things are beginning to move fast at B-Secur. </p><p>In July 2017, the company sealed the largest funding round of any Northern Ireland start-up that year, when it raised \u00a33.5m from a syndicate of investors including Accelerated Digital Ventures (ADV) and Kernel Capital. </p><p>Last month, B-Secur gathered another significant investment, understood to be in excess of 2017's record-breaking round.</p><p>\"It allows us to really accelerate into delivering to our customers in many geographies and allows us to grow,\" Alan explained.</p><p>In the past 12 months, B-Secur has grown from five to 36 staff. It expects to add another 10 and a new office in San Francisco this year.</p><p>Next month, it will move into a larger space at its base in Catalyst Inc.</p><p>Although he still lives in south Manchester with his Glaswegian wife Roisin and their three children Tom (11) and twins Charlie and Rose (8), Alan admits he is considering a more permanent move to home ground.</p><p>From north Down originally, he grew up \"a country boy\", attending Andrew's Memorial Primary School in Comber before moving on to Regent House Grammar in Newtownards and later Campbell College in Belfast.</p><p>Aged 18 he left Northern Ireland to study business and engineering at the University of Strathclyde. In 1995, he began an 18-year career with technology and business consulting firm Accenture. </p><p>Rising to managing director, he specialised in product and healthcare-based industries. </p><p>He remained there until June 2014, when he came on board with B-Secur.</p><p>While he travels less now than in his Accenture days, airport departure lounges remain a big feature in his life.</p><p>\"I fly over to Belfast every week. Most of our investors and clients are not in Northern Ireland, so I spend my time running the business in Belfast and the other half with our customers.</p><p>\"When I was in Accenture, I was away five nights a week. Life is relatively easy now - it's all UK-based, for a start. Manchester to Belfast is a very straight-forward flight. I try to keep it to two nights a week away now.\"</p><p>He insisted that the use of Belfast as B-Secur's base is not about sentiment.</p><p>\"I searched the whole of Europe whenever we were setting it up. I considered Berlin, but eventually we landed on Belfast, mainly because of the talent we able to see,\" he said.</p><p>\"Back four years there was also a growing ecosystem, which I would put down to Catalyst Inc.</p><p>\"Small companies can thrive and become unicorns if they've got enough momentum in a small space.</p><p>\"Catalyst has joined us up with people in England and Scotland. That's what has given us the ability to grow.\"</p><p>The proximity to Queen's University's two key tech hubs in the Titanic Quarter - the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) and the Institute of Electronics, Communications and IT (CSIT) - was another draw.</p><p>B-Secur has also successfully encouraged some of its recruits to move from England to Northern Ireland, including its chief commercial officer, Ben Carter. </p><p>Along with chief technology officer Adrian Condon, the pair have been key to the start-up's success to date.</p><p>\"Those guys have really built the technology so well and run the show down at Catalyst,\" Alan added.</p><p>\"We still articulate ourselves as still early stage, but our technology is pretty pioneering stuff. </p><p>\"We've developed from a very small base to a company that's making waves on the world forum. </p><p>\"We're starting to investigate China, we can't avoid it. But we need to nail the US first as our primary market before we spread our wings even further.</p><p>\"We're really only starting to be understood.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELWEB-51044016</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELWEB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7Y-3G41-F021-62KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400553</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1518\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent News &amp;

Edited excerpts</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now it is Diwali time. The common rhetoric on whatsapp this year is Diwali tip, Muhurat Stocks, Muhurat Ideas. What would be your money making idea for our viewers?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Diwali you need money. You already made the money. Now go and spend it. Buy some mithai and all that. We will talk next Diwali.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So that is the consumption view.</p><p>Yes well we will do whatever we can do.</p><p>Looks like we are in for not only a good Diwali but the extended period after Diwali as well.</p><p>Yes markets have been good globally. Look at emerging markets, look at Brazil and others. They have been doing very well. General commodities have been good as well, crude has been very strong. Overall that tide has shifted in favour of emerging markets after nearly five years of negativity over EMs and I think the bottom got made in February this year. Since then, EMs have done quite well in dollar terms. I think there are up by about 30-35%, something like that. I do not think that is going to slacken off in hurry. Overall EMs doing well is good for India.</p><p>Do you think the long emerging market trade could last another quarter or so?</p><p>Could be even longer because it is coming out of a long bear market. When things come out of long bear markets of the kind that EMs endured from 2010 onwards till 2016, then the rally will last a while. I do not think it just peters out in a couple of quarters. So, it could be even longer than a quarter.</p><p>In next 10 days and then we know who will occupy the White House for next four years, who will be the boss of Oval office? Markets are pricing a Democrat win. Is a reversal bad news?</p><p>I do not think markets will react much to this. There might be some temporary flutter here or there but I do not think we should be too concerned about who comes to the Oval office. It looks like the Democrats are coming into it but I mean I am not expert on US politics and my view is that it is mirrored the politics in India quite accurately so in one sense I feel proud that they are mirroring what we did two years back that there has been sort of a left leaning candidate and a very right leading candidate and we have had exactly the same situation in India.</p><p>If you look at Twitter, if you look at all the kinds of messaging it has been very similar to what we saw two years back so India has led America in at least one respect and that is the whole political landscape. If you look at the debates they are very similar to what we have seen here.</p><p>So if markets fall because of the US election outcome, whatever may be the outcome, if they fall like they fell on the Brexit Day, would that be a buying moment for you?</p><p>I would think so. I do not think US presidential outcomes will determine EMs. I do not think we should make that kind of extension.</p><p>So what is the risk in the system?</p><p>Frankly, the risk is that nobody knows. We are all hoping that whatever has been done, just continue it. We do not want to analyse it. We do not want to hear that you want to exit from this. You want to unwind this easy money and we do not want to hear all this. It is what somewhat worked. Let us just continue with it but I do not think anybody has any clue.</p><p>But are markets taking implementation of GST, earnings recovery for granted because the earnings upgrade cycle has not started. We are still in a downgrade cycle, the quantum of downgrade may have got reduced, but let us be clear prices have moved up and earnings are yet to catch up.</p><p>I do not think earnings cycle is recovering at all because earnings are dominated by largecaps and I do not think largecap earnings are looking good at all. It is very, very simple. Over the last three years, everybody starts the year with 17% and it comes down to between zero and five per cent and all these analysts and strategy should be fired.</p><p>You have been a strategist?</p><p>Yes but I do not have stocks which are giving 17-18%. That is rubbish. Look at the data. If you are wrong for three years, then you have no business occupying that street. The earnings picture is looking quite, quite poor because largecaps are looking bad and I do not see earnings recovery happening at all. The only thing India has going in favour as far as largecaps are concerned are bond yields. They have crashed as we have discussed it in the last couple of years and that I think is the single biggest sort of change that I could see -- at times about 8%, now you at sub-7%. That itself is providing some level of floor to the market.</p><p>Will that make PSU banks a tactical buy?</p><p>I am not going to go out and buy banks. I mean let us be very clear about it. Many people have called the bottom. The stocks have had technically rally but I not a believer yet in these.</p><p>So when you talk about mid and small cap stocks, you have to be stock specific. Shankar Sharma has never been stock specific. He has always been a top-down guy. So what is the top-down Shankar Sharma doing?</p><p>I am not doing top-down. I do not see anything very compelling in top-down. As I said, I made some money in Brazil and all these commodity kind of companies, those were the sort of big macro trades. But they have played out. They have done very well. I do not think there is more money at least from\u2026 I mean I do not see Brazil going up another 50%.</p><p>I will talk about specific from mid and small cap stocks. You have always maintained that one should not look at India in isolation. India will do what the world will do. It will map up or down 2% or 3% here or there. One is getting a sense that in next 12 months a lot would be thrown at us whether from Fed or whether from political leaders, even from Europe. These are large ponderables which we would be discussing and debating in the next 12 months.</p><p>For the last seven, eight years since the 2008 crisis, nobody seems to have any answers to how things are going come back to normal if at all. They would come back to normal or what is the new normal. We should stop thinking that central banks know something that we do not. I think that part of the equation is quite clear that nobody really knows. So there will be many questions and I think markets will react when they come up but there will be fewer questions in emerging markets than in the developed markets. In any case, in emerging markets you have not followed the kind of hugely loose policies that the west has followed or the developed markets have followed. Most of the questions are centered towards west rather than Ems. That is what the market is distinguishing now. For a change, EMs have less questions than let us say Europe has or let us say Japan has.</p><p>I do not think Indian largecaps will catch up. You have to segment India into two different markets all together and both belong to completely different classes of equity. It is time that we recognise that India is no longer just a single market. Large caps in my view in India are more or less fatigued. I do not see where in largecaps barring the handful on the autos, etc are going to get great alpha.</p><p>Look at IT, pharma and even consumers. Everybody is struggling. So the only bright spark out there has been the few auto companies and two wheeler companies but that can drive largecaps in aggregate.</p><p>Coming down the market cap spectrum, the microcaps have seen amazing growth from 2009 and even in the last couple of years. So my view is largecaps in India are going to disappoint, but the action has been in smallcaps and I continue to believe that that is the area where that segment of the market will do the best in the world and it has been doing phenomenally well as well. So I am not a believer in largecaps.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>And that seems to be global phenomenon. If I look at the Russell Index, if I compare the S&amp;P versus Dow, the broader you go, the better you do.</p><p>Yes. It is not true for the commodity driven markets but it is true for markets where there is a large population of smallcap companies. The US is very similar to India in that it has a large population of smallcap companies and it has a large overall listed company base. What has happened is in this entire turmoil around 2008 and onwards, large companies have not been able to figure out how they to out of the problems. Smaller companies have been able to figure some element of the game out and that is why you are seeing money coming into small caps and I continue to believe there are great, great opportunities.</p><p>The challenge history with small and midcap companies has been that they start off well but they struggle to scale up. That has been the case with IT, pharma, engineering companies as well. For this year and next year you can talk about a rosy picture for midcaps but when they start reaching a minimum hurdle, a minimum size, they tend to flatten out.</p><p>And that is true for everybody. That is also true for your net worth, that is true for mankind. Everything will reach a point when you age and are not that nimble anymore. That is true for companies also. That is true for smallcaps and largecaps. Whatever it is, it will be a while before they reach there. I do not think they will suddenly become large companies in one year\u2019s time, at least not in India. India has actually zero tech companies. Our companies are mostly old economy or oil economy and I do not think e-commerce is new economy because it is still ultimately a very old business. These companies take time to go from zero to hundred and like a pure tech play or a social media platform which can go from anything to anything in matter of a few quarters. We do not have those kinds of plays. So to that extent, the fall is also a little slower. The age itself also does not catch up immediately. I mean you can see age having caught up with a number of the big tech listings in the US already, the time they list actually they have already been fully priced. India I think is still a long way from reaching that position.</p><p>We have debated and argued in the past that central bankers are running out of options. We know that the effective rate cut is not making the markets happy. In fact, markets now do not even react to some of the rate cut announcements or quantitative easing announcement. What could be that trigger that could take asset prices higher?</p><p>The only trigger is the fact that there are no options for investors worldwide to go and put their money and hope to get a measly return. With interest rates being near zero, it is a pure straightforward thing that money will move out of fixed income and into equities and that has been the reason why you have seen equities do well despite things not changing much fundamentally for equities. Simply a zero interest rate option that you have versus that equity might give you 4-5% a little bit more than that I think people are being forced to compel to take excess of risk.</p><p>IT is where the debate is. IT is where the disruption is. These companies who always claim that look we have got a secret potion which is fountain of youth, are now admitting that they will also slowdown. Growth from late teens has come down to single digit and now they openly talking about more pain is about to come.</p><p>I do not think the pain has come yet. Look, these are very large companies. If they are slowing down from mid-teens to single digit, I do not think that is doomsday. The real doomsday I hope it does not happen to IT as it has been very central to the new India, the new consumption, the pool of talent it sucked up and who made a lot of wealth for them, give them good life styles. It drove the consumption boom, eating out, caf\u00e9s, cars, everything. So it is not just about a single industry, I think IT re-shaped the modern India 20 years back. So I as an Indian do not feel too happy about this but I as human being understand that people age, people slow down and I think they are hitting that kind of point. The fear I have is that unless they figure out a way out of this, I do not think this low-single digit or the mid-single digit is the final point of stopping.</p><p>You actually expect the IT companies to contract?</p><p>I am not saying I expect it. I am saying that would be a real dooms day situation and I hope our management are smart enough to figure the way out. I do believe we have very good management in these IT companies. So for one, I am not making a case that they are poor management. I think by and large our mainland IT companies have great managements. But you are being faced with a hugely disruptive tech landscape and they are very large companies for them to think their way out of this will be a severe challenge for sure.</p><p>Will your midcap argument exist in IT or for midcap IT, it is a dangerous terrain?</p><p>That does not extend to midcap IT unless somebody has a particular product or particular niche. When things turn bad for the large guys, I think it will turn slowish for the small guys as well. So I think as a pack there is a problem.</p><p>And I can extend that with midcap pharma as well because if the large guys are feeling the heat of US FDA, regulation and pricing challenge would hit midcap pharma more.</p><p>My view is \u2013 Indian pharma has a lot to blame itself for, I mean that is fact. Unlike IT which\u2026 things can get disrupted. Facebook may not exist tomorrow. Something else will come up. You cannot keep on outthinking every new disruption that is not possible. Nobody has ever managed that. So I do not blame the IT guys for not having seen cloud and all that. It is not a bad situation.</p><p>As bad a situation as the pharma finds itself in terms of management quality, people have played fast and loose with the FDA. I mean this is not the way to run a quality operation supplying to customers in the most lucrative market in the world and then you have the kind of practices that we all know of. So I think they brought it on themselves.</p><p>So the pain is here to stay?</p><p>I do not think it is here to stay because there are still significant companies. I do not think US FDA will do anything very drastic. I think it is more rap on the knuckles and some fines and penalties and life will go back to normal. More important is that reputation has been dented and that is the real problem. When somebody is going to put some medicine in the mouth and you have some doubts about the veracity and the legitimacy of that, that is severe reputational damage.</p><p>We have seen a big uptick even in midcap financials and largely NBFCs. Bajaj Finance now has a market capitalisation of Rs 50,000-60,000 crore which I have been told is highest market cap in the PSU banking space. Is that a hunting ground for you \u2013 midcap NBFCs, midcap financials?</p><p>No. I am sitting out that boom and I am not a big believer in credit-led businesses.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Even though if it is consumer lend?</p><p>My belief is and by the way I mean that brings me to the other aspect. In otherwise pretty gloomy scenario for consumption, I do not see how lending can keep increasing two consumers at this space. So I am sure a lot of irresponsible lending is happening. But the thing is with NBFCs or credit-led finance in general is that profits have front ended, their losses are back ended. So all the so called paap that many of the players would be doing will not show up for the next couple of years. They might show up two-three years from now.</p><p>It is like saying buying PSU banks in the 2003-2008 credit cycle?</p><p>Exactly. So now you are paying for that, correct. That time they were all rocking, so the profits are front ended and in the next couple of years look very good for this industry and I think you want to play that momentum, by all means do it.</p><p>So if midcap pharma is out of the equation, you do not like banks, you have never liked banks in the past, midcap is out of the equation, so then what do you like within midcap?</p><p>There are lot of companies. Infra is very good. Chemicals is good. There are odd companies which do not fall into any sectors and midcaps and small caps, there are plenty of companies out there to be honest with you and frankly, the bigger problem in investing in many of them is simply that there is no liquidity to invest in them. I find many good companies which are trading 2000 shares a day and it is impossible to get into those companies but there are quite a lot of them out there, trust me.</p><p>But if this one largecap stock which you think is still looking reasonable may be markets are missing on the earnings recovery or may be markets are not realising the value of their franchise which is that large cap?</p><p>I like Zee Telefilms and that has done very, very well because for a long time it was kind of underappreciated but I think what Subhash Chandra has done in a lot of senses it is almost like the IndiGo equivalent in the media space where people have been struggling but in particularly the electronic media part. We all know it has been a big-big challenge but they have managed to re-invent themselves and it is a pretty global company now and the stock is now beginning to reflect that. So I have like that, now that does not fit into any broad because media itself is a very small sector in India and particularly in the listed space. So those kind of odd ball plays in large caps we have found but I cannot find anything which is so deeply undervalued and the market is missing a big recovery.</p><p>Even Tata Motors at 500.</p><p>I think it is good.</p><p>We have discussed United Spirits in the past and against expectations, despite the Diageo takeover, the stock is available at a price where it is lower than Diageo open offer. We have discussed this one in the past. Is there money to be made in liquor stocks, especially United Spirits?</p><p>That I do not know because my real fear is this whole liquor ban thing and when people say it does not matter or it would not happen and all that but I am not so sure of that and there will be around 2018-2019 many states will go to elections because they get bunched around the Lok Sabha time. So you never know how many more states jump on to this bandwagon and whether it translates into real sales hit, we do not know but the sentiment gets hit and I think that is one of the reasons why the stock is not doing well.</p><p>If I talk of the big picture for metals, the big picture is therefore like China is slowing down, their surplus capacity in the world in the every major commodity and demand is going to be low. But despite this common consensus view, metal stocks and metal prices they both have done very well from the recent low.</p><p>Yes that is the way markets are. Everybody had a view, everybody was right on that view for couple of years. One fine day, that view does not work. So it stopped working. I do not think metals are bad now. I have been bullish on it all year.</p><p>February we had interaction and you said buy metals.</p><p>Correct. Exactly so stocks have done well and I think it was excessive pessimism. I think with some degree of recovery in emerging markets, the sentiment for metal commodities is generally more positive than it has been in the last five years. It may well be only a technical move. I do not think there is a big resurgence in their demand but I think at the margin, things are not that bad and when you have beaten down 80% in commodities, then all you need is just a lessening of pessimism, a lessening of the bad. You do not need actually real good news you just lessening of the gloom which is enough for you to make 100%.</p><p>So awful has become bad but awful has not become great.</p><p>You do not need that. You know it would become great to make serious money.</p><p>So what is awful and where awful could become bad?</p><p>In my view, what is not awful yet but could become awful are some of our large caps, were clearly fatigued and I think there is a whole churn that is going to happen over the next four-five years when many will move out and many new sectors and new companies will come in and that transition is always painful.</p><p>It has been 30 years for the Sensex and you are an old timer. You track Sensex more than the Nifty. Only six companies in the Sensex have survived. So if you have to let us say talk about what the Sensex could be or the Nifty could be in 2020 or 2021, how do you think the picture would change because that is a more pertinent question?</p><p>I am still thinking about it I do not have an answer yet but yes obviously we are at a point where two major sectors are getting fatigued and even the consumer space is not looking too hot right now. So we will see, we will work on this theme.</p><p>So you feel that we are in for good days but this is not like a blow out bull market which we could be staring at?</p><p>I do not think it is a blowout bull market by any standards for large caps. I think there is a very strong bull market for small and midcap companies but I think there is a big overall bull market for emerging markets.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Do you see serious money also flowing back to emerging markets in the wake of a Fed rate hike or in the wake of what is going on with other economies?</p><p>It is already flowing.</p><p>It is not large, it started\u2026</p><p>But that is a point that it does not have to become large from day one. People are still nervous, people are still tentative. Nothing will start as a deluge, it will start as a small trickle but at least the trickle has come after four-five years and at least two years of abysmal flows in EM. So the tide has started to turn and it will take a while to get in and gather momentum. I have talked to many people who are still sceptical about Brazil, Russia, about oil. That is good because that will keep this market afloat. So it will be a while before big money comes but I can see the trend coming back to EMs in money flows as well.</p><p>But India is more like a crowded trade both from an MSCI benchmarking purposes which is absolute. If I look at the relative also, we have got solid inflows and most of the global funds either are overweight India or extremely overweight India.</p><p>Which is fine, which is a sensible strategy. The problem with them is that they have been underweight. The market that have done very well, the oil centric markets. Brazil has 5% weight in the MSCI and most people were like 1% or 0.5, 1.5% and the market is up nearly so almost doubled now in dollar terms. So when you miss out a 100% in five-six months time that is painful and that 5% index weight that is not small. So by being underweight by 4% and the market has doubled, you have given up like virtually 7-8% in performance. People are still recovering from that kind of hit.</p><p>Every investor or every trader has a niche. Like Buffett is known for buying consumer monopolies. Soros is known for the man who rouged Bank of England. What do you think is that unique way in which Shankar Sharma approaches the market?</p><p>I have nothing unique. Look I am not going to die one day and expect people to remember me after the day I am died. So I have no visions of gradient. My point is as long as you are around, you have to figure out something different. So I do top-down. I do bottom-up. My view is if you want to be a batsman in cricket, you will have to be able to play all the strokes. You cannot say that I can play only the off drive and not the square cut. So I like to play all the shots.</p><p>But if you have to hit a century, you have to plan the game in advance.</p><p>Correct.</p><p>So how are you planning the next one year or financial savings or investing?</p><p>As I have said many times, the bulk of my money is in fixed income. The risk capital part is in equities which is itself quite substantial but the fact is that I am seeing a lot of opportunities even now in the smaller companies, lots and lots of them.</p><p>Buffett says that there are two things which get better with age \u2013 serious investing and wine. So I would not talk about your wine antiques but let us talk about the way you have changes as an investor. In last 10 years, how has Shankar Sharma changed?</p><p>You have to change. One thing that has definitely changed is that after the 2009 crisis, 2008 crisis, what I could not foresee was how low rates could go because we had never seen that era. So when the cuts happened, I never thought we would see zero and which actually made me sit out some part of the rally that happened subsequently because I never thought that we would ever see a world wherein, forget zero going to negative and I look back and I say maybe that should have been the call to have ki look there is no way out of this except lower and lower and lower interest rates because this problem is not going away. It is a structural problem. Maybe one should have been bold enough to have seen that and played equities accordingly with far greater aggression than what I did.</p><p>We tend to talk about numbers. You and me have both enjoyed watching Wall Street One and Wall Street Two. The famous line of Gordon Gekko in Wall Street One was that every man has a number, everyman on Wall Street is chasing a number. So is there a number you are chasing in your life?</p><p>We all are.</p><p>What is your number?</p><p>I will tell you when I get there.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ETNOW-55115358</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETNOW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M20-D6G1-JB3N-T2B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382883</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4178\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Edited excerpts</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now it is Diwali time. The common rhetoric on whatsapp this year is Diwali tip, Muhurat Stocks, Muhurat Ideas. What would be your money making idea for our viewers?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Diwali you need money. You already made the money. Now go and spend it. Buy some mithai and all that. We will talk next Diwali.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So that is the consumption view.</p><p>Yes well we will do whatever we can do.</p><p>Looks like we are in for not only a good Diwali but the extended period after Diwali as well.</p><p>Yes markets have been good globally. Look at emerging markets, look at Brazil and others. They have been doing very well. General commodities have been good as well, crude has been very strong. Overall that tide has shifted in favour of emerging markets after nearly five years of negativity over EMs and I think the bottom got made in February this year. Since then, EMs have done quite well in dollar terms. I think there are up by about 30-35%, something like that. I do not think that is going to slacken off in hurry. Overall EMs doing well is good for India.</p><p>Do you think the long emerging market trade could last another quarter or so?</p><p>Could be even longer because it is coming out of a long bear market. When things come out of long bear markets of the kind that EMs endured from 2010 onwards till 2016, then the rally will last a while. I do not think it just peters out in a couple of quarters. So, it could be even longer than a quarter.</p><p>In next 10 days and then we know who will occupy the White House for next four years, who will be the boss of Oval office? Markets are pricing a Democrat win. Is a reversal bad news?</p><p>I do not think markets will react much to this. There might be some temporary flutter here or there but I do not think we should be too concerned about who comes to the Oval office. It looks like the Democrats are coming into it but I mean I am not expert on US politics and my view is that it is mirrored the politics in India quite accurately so in one sense I feel proud that they are mirroring what we did two years back that there has been sort of a left leaning candidate and a very right leading candidate and we have had exactly the same situation in India.</p><p>If you look at Twitter, if you look at all the kinds of messaging it has been very similar to what we saw two years back so India has led America in at least one respect and that is the whole political landscape. If you look at the debates they are very similar to what we have seen here.</p><p>So if markets fall because of the US election outcome, whatever may be the outcome, if they fall like they fell on the Brexit Day, would that be a buying moment for you?</p><p>I would think so. I do not think US presidential outcomes will determine EMs. I do not think we should make that kind of extension.</p><p>So what is the risk in the system?</p><p>Frankly, the risk is that nobody knows. We are all hoping that whatever has been done, just continue it. We do not want to analyse it. We do not want to hear that you want to exit from this. You want to unwind this easy money and we do not want to hear all this. It is what somewhat worked. Let us just continue with it but I do not think anybody has any clue.</p><p>But are markets taking implementation of GST, earnings recovery for granted because the earnings upgrade cycle has not started. We are still in a downgrade cycle, the quantum of downgrade may have got reduced, but let us be clear prices have moved up and earnings are yet to catch up.</p><p>I do not think earnings cycle is recovering at all because earnings are dominated by largecaps and I do not think largecap earnings are looking good at all. It is very, very simple. Over the last three years, everybody starts the year with 17% and it comes down to between zero and five per cent and all these analysts and strategy should be fired.</p><p>You have been a strategist?</p><p>Yes but I do not have stocks which are giving 17-18%. That is rubbish. Look at the data. If you are wrong for three years, then you have no business occupying that street. The earnings picture is looking quite, quite poor because largecaps are looking bad and I do not see earnings recovery happening at all. The only thing India has going in favour as far as largecaps are concerned are bond yields. They have crashed as we have discussed it in the last couple of years and that I think is the single biggest sort of change that I could see -- at times about 8%, now you at sub-7%. That itself is providing some level of floor to the market.</p><p>Will that make PSU banks a tactical buy?</p><p>I am not going to go out and buy banks. I mean let us be very clear about it. Many people have called the bottom. The stocks have had technically rally but I not a believer yet in these.</p><p>So when you talk about mid and small cap stocks, you have to be stock specific. Shankar Sharma has never been stock specific. He has always been a top-down guy. So what is the top-down Shankar Sharma doing?</p><p>I am not doing top-down. I do not see anything very compelling in top-down. As I said, I made some money in Brazil and all these commodity kind of companies, those were the sort of big macro trades. But they have played out. They have done very well. I do not think there is more money at least from\u2026 I mean I do not see Brazil going up another 50%.</p><p>I will talk about specific from mid and small cap stocks. You have always maintained that one should not look at India in isolation. India will do what the world will do. It will map up or down 2% or 3% here or there. One is getting a sense that in next 12 months a lot would be thrown at us whether from Fed or whether from political leaders, even from Europe. These are large ponderables which we would be discussing and debating in the next 12 months.</p><p>For the last seven, eight years since the 2008 crisis, nobody seems to have any answers to how things are going come back to normal if at all. They would come back to normal or what is the new normal. We should stop thinking that central banks know something that we do not. I think that part of the equation is quite clear that nobody really knows. So there will be many questions and I think markets will react when they come up but there will be fewer questions in emerging markets than in the developed markets. In any case, in emerging markets you have not followed the kind of hugely loose policies that the west has followed or the developed markets have followed. Most of the questions are centered towards west rather than Ems. That is what the market is distinguishing now. For a change, EMs have less questions than let us say Europe has or let us say Japan has.</p><p>I do not think Indian largecaps will catch up. You have to segment India into two different markets all together and both belong to completely different classes of equity. It is time that we recognise that India is no longer just a single market. Large caps in my view in India are more or less fatigued. I do not see where in largecaps barring the handful on the autos, etc are going to get great alpha.</p><p>Look at IT, pharma and even consumers. Everybody is struggling. So the only bright spark out there has been the few auto companies and two wheeler companies but that can drive largecaps in aggregate.</p><p>Coming down the market cap spectrum, the microcaps have seen amazing growth from 2009 and even in the last couple of years. So my view is largecaps in India are going to disappoint, but the action has been in smallcaps and I continue to believe that that is the area where that segment of the market will do the best in the world and it has been doing phenomenally well as well. So I am not a believer in largecaps.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>And that seems to be global phenomenon. If I look at the Russell Index, if I compare the S&amp;P versus Dow, the broader you go, the better you do.</p><p>Yes. It is not true for the commodity driven markets but it is true for markets where there is a large population of smallcap companies. The US is very similar to India in that it has a large population of smallcap companies and it has a large overall listed company base. What has happened is in this entire turmoil around 2008 and onwards, large companies have not been able to figure out how they to out of the problems. Smaller companies have been able to figure some element of the game out and that is why you are seeing money coming into small caps and I continue to believe there are great, great opportunities.</p><p>The challenge history with small and midcap companies has been that they start off well but they struggle to scale up. That has been the case with IT, pharma, engineering companies as well. For this year and next year you can talk about a rosy picture for midcaps but when they start reaching a minimum hurdle, a minimum size, they tend to flatten out.</p><p>And that is true for everybody. That is also true for your net worth, that is true for mankind. Everything will reach a point when you age and are not that nimble anymore. That is true for companies also. That is true for smallcaps and largecaps. Whatever it is, it will be a while before they reach there. I do not think they will suddenly become large companies in one year\u2019s time, at least not in India. India has actually zero tech companies. Our companies are mostly old economy or oil economy and I do not think e-commerce is new economy because it is still ultimately a very old business. These companies take time to go from zero to hundred and like a pure tech play or a social media platform which can go from anything to anything in matter of a few quarters. We do not have those kinds of plays. So to that extent, the fall is also a little slower. The age itself also does not catch up immediately. I mean you can see age having caught up with a number of the big tech listings in the US already, the time they list actually they have already been fully priced. India I think is still a long way from reaching that position.</p><p>We have debated and argued in the past that central bankers are running out of options. We know that the effective rate cut is not making the markets happy. In fact, markets now do not even react to some of the rate cut announcements or quantitative easing announcement. What could be that trigger that could take asset prices higher?</p><p>The only trigger is the fact that there are no options for investors worldwide to go and put their money and hope to get a measly return. With interest rates being near zero, it is a pure straightforward thing that money will move out of fixed income and into equities and that has been the reason why you have seen equities do well despite things not changing much fundamentally for equities. Simply a zero interest rate option that you have versus that equity might give you 4-5% a little bit more than that I think people are being forced to compel to take excess of risk.</p><p>IT is where the debate is. IT is where the disruption is. These companies who always claim that look we have got a secret potion which is fountain of youth, are now admitting that they will also slowdown. Growth from late teens has come down to single digit and now they openly talking about more pain is about to come.</p><p>I do not think the pain has come yet. Look, these are very large companies. If they are slowing down from mid-teens to single digit, I do not think that is doomsday. The real doomsday I hope it does not happen to IT as it has been very central to the new India, the new consumption, the pool of talent it sucked up and who made a lot of wealth for them, give them good life styles. It drove the consumption boom, eating out, caf\u00e9s, cars, everything. So it is not just about a single industry, I think IT re-shaped the modern India 20 years back. So I as an Indian do not feel too happy about this but I as human being understand that people age, people slow down and I think they are hitting that kind of point. The fear I have is that unless they figure out a way out of this, I do not think this low-single digit or the mid-single digit is the final point of stopping.</p><p>You actually expect the IT companies to contract?</p><p>I am not saying I expect it. I am saying that would be a real dooms day situation and I hope our management are smart enough to figure the way out. I do believe we have very good management in these IT companies. So for one, I am not making a case that they are poor management. I think by and large our mainland IT companies have great managements. But you are being faced with a hugely disruptive tech landscape and they are very large companies for them to think their way out of this will be a severe challenge for sure.</p><p>Will your midcap argument exist in IT or for midcap IT, it is a dangerous terrain?</p><p>That does not extend to midcap IT unless somebody has a particular product or particular niche. When things turn bad for the large guys, I think it will turn slowish for the small guys as well. So I think as a pack there is a problem.</p><p>And I can extend that with midcap pharma as well because if the large guys are feeling the heat of US FDA, regulation and pricing challenge would hit midcap pharma more.</p><p>My view is \u2013 Indian pharma has a lot to blame itself for, I mean that is fact. Unlike IT which\u2026 things can get disrupted. Facebook may not exist tomorrow. Something else will come up. You cannot keep on outthinking every new disruption that is not possible. Nobody has ever managed that. So I do not blame the IT guys for not having seen cloud and all that. It is not a bad situation.</p><p>As bad a situation as the pharma finds itself in terms of management quality, people have played fast and loose with the FDA. I mean this is not the way to run a quality operation supplying to customers in the most lucrative market in the world and then you have the kind of practices that we all know of. So I think they brought it on themselves.</p><p>So the pain is here to stay?</p><p>I do not think it is here to stay because there are still significant companies. I do not think US FDA will do anything very drastic. I think it is more rap on the knuckles and some fines and penalties and life will go back to normal. More important is that reputation has been dented and that is the real problem. When somebody is going to put some medicine in the mouth and you have some doubts about the veracity and the legitimacy of that, that is severe reputational damage.</p><p>We have seen a big uptick even in midcap financials and largely NBFCs. Bajaj Finance now has a market capitalisation of Rs 50,000-60,000 crore which I have been told is highest market cap in the PSU banking space. Is that a hunting ground for you \u2013 midcap NBFCs, midcap financials?</p><p>No. I am sitting out that boom and I am not a big believer in credit-led businesses.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Even though if it is consumer lend?</p><p>My belief is and by the way I mean that brings me to the other aspect. In otherwise pretty gloomy scenario for consumption, I do not see how lending can keep increasing two consumers at this space. So I am sure a lot of irresponsible lending is happening. But the thing is with NBFCs or credit-led finance in general is that profits have front ended, their losses are back ended. So all the so called paap that many of the players would be doing will not show up for the next couple of years. They might show up two-three years from now.</p><p>It is like saying buying PSU banks in the 2003-2008 credit cycle?</p><p>Exactly. So now you are paying for that, correct. That time they were all rocking, so the profits are front ended and in the next couple of years look very good for this industry and I think you want to play that momentum, by all means do it.</p><p>So if midcap pharma is out of the equation, you do not like banks, you have never liked banks in the past, midcap is out of the equation, so then what do you like within midcap?</p><p>There are lot of companies. Infra is very good. Chemicals is good. There are odd companies which do not fall into any sectors and midcaps and small caps, there are plenty of companies out there to be honest with you and frankly, the bigger problem in investing in many of them is simply that there is no liquidity to invest in them. I find many good companies which are trading 2000 shares a day and it is impossible to get into those companies but there are quite a lot of them out there, trust me.</p><p>But if this one largecap stock which you think is still looking reasonable may be markets are missing on the earnings recovery or may be markets are not realising the value of their franchise which is that large cap?</p><p>I like Zee Telefilms and that has done very, very well because for a long time it was kind of underappreciated but I think what Subhash Chandra has done in a lot of senses it is almost like the IndiGo equivalent in the media space where people have been struggling but in particularly the electronic media part. We all know it has been a big-big challenge but they have managed to re-invent themselves and it is a pretty global company now and the stock is now beginning to reflect that. So I have like that, now that does not fit into any broad because media itself is a very small sector in India and particularly in the listed space. So those kind of odd ball plays in large caps we have found but I cannot find anything which is so deeply undervalued and the market is missing a big recovery.</p><p>Even Tata Motors at 500.</p><p>I think it is good.</p><p>We have discussed United Spirits in the past and against expectations, despite the Diageo takeover, the stock is available at a price where it is lower than Diageo open offer. We have discussed this one in the past. Is there money to be made in liquor stocks, especially United Spirits?</p><p>That I do not know because my real fear is this whole liquor ban thing and when people say it does not matter or it would not happen and all that but I am not so sure of that and there will be around 2018-2019 many states will go to elections because they get bunched around the Lok Sabha time. So you never know how many more states jump on to this bandwagon and whether it translates into real sales hit, we do not know but the sentiment gets hit and I think that is one of the reasons why the stock is not doing well.</p><p>If I talk of the big picture for metals, the big picture is therefore like China is slowing down, their surplus capacity in the world in the every major commodity and demand is going to be low. But despite this common consensus view, metal stocks and metal prices they both have done very well from the recent low.</p><p>Yes that is the way markets are. Everybody had a view, everybody was right on that view for couple of years. One fine day, that view does not work. So it stopped working. I do not think metals are bad now. I have been bullish on it all year.</p><p>February we had interaction and you said buy metals.</p><p>Correct. Exactly so stocks have done well and I think it was excessive pessimism. I think with some degree of recovery in emerging markets, the sentiment for metal commodities is generally more positive than it has been in the last five years. It may well be only a technical move. I do not think there is a big resurgence in their demand but I think at the margin, things are not that bad and when you have beaten down 80% in commodities, then all you need is just a lessening of pessimism, a lessening of the bad. You do not need actually real good news you just lessening of the gloom which is enough for you to make 100%.</p><p>So awful has become bad but awful has not become great.</p><p>You do not need that. You know it would become great to make serious money.</p><p>So what is awful and where awful could become bad?</p><p>In my view, what is not awful yet but could become awful are some of our large caps, were clearly fatigued and I think there is a whole churn that is going to happen over the next four-five years when many will move out and many new sectors and new companies will come in and that transition is always painful.</p><p>It has been 30 years for the Sensex and you are an old timer. You track Sensex more than the Nifty. Only six companies in the Sensex have survived. So if you have to let us say talk about what the Sensex could be or the Nifty could be in 2020 or 2021, how do you think the picture would change because that is a more pertinent question?</p><p>I am still thinking about it I do not have an answer yet but yes obviously we are at a point where two major sectors are getting fatigued and even the consumer space is not looking too hot right now. So we will see, we will work on this theme.</p><p>So you feel that we are in for good days but this is not like a blow out bull market which we could be staring at?</p><p>I do not think it is a blowout bull market by any standards for large caps. I think there is a very strong bull market for small and midcap companies but I think there is a big overall bull market for emerging markets.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Do you see serious money also flowing back to emerging markets in the wake of a Fed rate hike or in the wake of what is going on with other economies?</p><p>It is already flowing.</p><p>It is not large, it started\u2026</p><p>But that is a point that it does not have to become large from day one. People are still nervous, people are still tentative. Nothing will start as a deluge, it will start as a small trickle but at least the trickle has come after four-five years and at least two years of abysmal flows in EM. So the tide has started to turn and it will take a while to get in and gather momentum. I have talked to many people who are still sceptical about Brazil, Russia, about oil. That is good because that will keep this market afloat. So it will be a while before big money comes but I can see the trend coming back to EMs in money flows as well.</p><p>But India is more like a crowded trade both from an MSCI benchmarking purposes which is absolute. If I look at the relative also, we have got solid inflows and most of the global funds either are overweight India or extremely overweight India.</p><p>Which is fine, which is a sensible strategy. The problem with them is that they have been underweight. The market that have done very well, the oil centric markets. Brazil has 5% weight in the MSCI and most people were like 1% or 0.5, 1.5% and the market is up nearly so almost doubled now in dollar terms. So when you miss out a 100% in five-six months time that is painful and that 5% index weight that is not small. So by being underweight by 4% and the market has doubled, you have given up like virtually 7-8% in performance. People are still recovering from that kind of hit.</p><p>Every investor or every trader has a niche. Like Buffett is known for buying consumer monopolies. Soros is known for the man who rouged Bank of England. What do you think is that unique way in which Shankar Sharma approaches the market?</p><p>I have nothing unique. Look I am not going to die one day and expect people to remember me after the day I am died. So I have no visions of gradient. My point is as long as you are around, you have to figure out something different. So I do top-down. I do bottom-up. My view is if you want to be a batsman in cricket, you will have to be able to play all the strokes. You cannot say that I can play only the off drive and not the square cut. So I like to play all the shots.</p><p>But if you have to hit a century, you have to plan the game in advance.</p><p>Correct.</p><p>So how are you planning the next one year or financial savings or investing?</p><p>As I have said many times, the bulk of my money is in fixed income. The risk capital part is in equities which is itself quite substantial but the fact is that I am seeing a lot of opportunities even now in the smaller companies, lots and lots of them.</p><p>Buffett says that there are two things which get better with age \u2013 serious investing and wine. So I would not talk about your wine antiques but let us talk about the way you have changes as an investor. In last 10 years, how has Shankar Sharma changed?</p><p>You have to change. One thing that has definitely changed is that after the 2009 crisis, 2008 crisis, what I could not foresee was how low rates could go because we had never seen that era. So when the cuts happened, I never thought we would see zero and which actually made me sit out some part of the rally that happened subsequently because I never thought that we would ever see a world wherein, forget zero going to negative and I look back and I say maybe that should have been the call to have ki look there is no way out of this except lower and lower and lower interest rates because this problem is not going away. It is a structural problem. Maybe one should have been bold enough to have seen that and played equities accordingly with far greater aggression than what I did.</p><p>We tend to talk about numbers. You and me have both enjoyed watching Wall Street One and Wall Street Two. The famous line of Gordon Gekko in Wall Street One was that every man has a number, everyman on Wall Street is chasing a number. So is there a number you are chasing in your life?</p><p>We all are.</p><p>What is your number?</p><p>I will tell you when I get there.</p><p>For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ETNOW-55062839</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETNOW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M20-D6G1-JB3N-T2BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382883</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4178\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Here, he describes the recent experiments conducted to improve customer understanding of and engagement with the universally dreaded Terms and Conditions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I have read and agree to the Terms and Conditions\" may very well be the biggest -- and most common -- lie on the internet. <br/><br/>We've all impatiently, absentmindedly, ticked a box to agree to the terms of the latest iOS upgrade, the returns policy of an online retailer, or just clicked past the link that allows us to \"learn more\" about a company's data-privacy policy. Some people have even agreed to do things like clean <url normalizedValue=\"https://purple.ai/blogs/purple-community-service/\">toilets for a thousand hours in return for WiFi</url>, or provide their       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2757465\">first-born child as payment</url>. <br/><br/> \"I agreed to do what?\" Getty Images</p><p>The recent ACCC digital-platforms inquiry highlighted the importance of ensuring consumers are informed when giving companies access to their data. However, the problem lies in actually getting people to read and understand privacy notices. But it's no wonder people don't actually read the T&amp;Cs, as they are usually long, boring and incomprehensible -- PayPal UK's T&amp;Cs are longer than Hamlet (and about as difficult to understand).</p><p>But these documents are actually quite important. Taken together, T&amp;Cs (the contract you are agreeing to when buying a product or using a service), data-privacy policies (covering how the company collects, uses, shares, and manages your data), terms of use (covering rules about using a website), and cookie policies (covering how your behaviour is tracked), represent the terms on which we engage with companies and others online. Of course, part of the reason for our apathy might be the perceived inevitability -- after all, if we don't agree with the T&amp;Cs there's not really anything we can do about it! It's not as though we're in a position to negotiate with the big companies, and there's certainly no option of saying, \"No, I haven't read it and don't plan to\" (as honest as that may be). <br/><br/> The power distribution. Getty Images <br/>Cliff Notes (FAQs) partially help -- <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">partially</emphasis></p><p>The good news is that at least some of these challenges are surmountable. In a recent set of experiments, Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) tested new and effective ways of presenting T&amp;Cs and privacy policies to increase understanding and engagement. For example, some of our recent research has shown that by including key points from T&amp;Cs in the form of an FAQ, you can increase comprehension by 36%. And just by telling people how long terms and conditions would take to read, we doubled the proportion of people who opened them. We also know what doesn't work. We've found that providing 'layers' -- where customers initially only see short summaries, which, when clicked, expand to show more -- is actually ineffective, and doesn't improve comprehension.</p><p>But overall, the best rates of comprehension were still fairly disappointing -- we measured comprehension by asking eight questions about the T&amp;Cs, and at most we saw on average about 40-50% of the questions answered correctly in the best- performing interventions. <br/>Set a comprehension benchmark that companies must meet</p><p>This is a serious challenge for regulators and policymakers, who just don't have the resources to conduct extensive and widespread testing -- but maybe there's another way forward. Instead of making regulators and policymakers do the legwork, let's put it back on to the big companies. BIT thinks the government should use the ACCC process to develop a benchmark of what constitutes comprehension from consumers when it comes to privacy and data collection. Once this framework has been established, the government should put the onus back on Facebook and Google (and the like) to figure out the best way of getting consumers to understand what's going on.</p><p>In other words, rather than prescribing a specific way of doing things (such as how information needs to be disclosed), we should instead prescribe a minimum standard -- and let the market figure out the best way of meeting this standard. The government could monitor this process by regularly taking a representative sample of consumers, and seeing what their comprehension was. Importantly, if performance fell below the benchmark, the companies could be penalised -- or rewarded if they were able to make improvements. <br/>Be outcomes-based</p><p>This sort of regulation, or 'outcomes-based regulation', takes advantage of big tech companies having substantial expertise and resources dedicated to testing and innovating with their online platforms and their customers. It harnesses this power and the competitive power of markets to help ensure consumers are protected rather than exploited.</p><p>The reality is that the current situation has simply become untenable. We know that consumers aren't reading and understanding T&amp;Cs, and yet our lives are becoming more and more entwined with companies who are accessing more and more of our data.

STEAD, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CEO, IHS MARKIT LTD.: If we can get seated, we'll get started in 2 minutes. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody, and it's a great pleasure to welcome you to our first IHS Markit Investor Day. I have been privileged to do these for many years. There is none that I think I'm more excited or will enjoy than this one today. So it's great to have you here. First, I'm going to just have our leadership team, what we call the Office of the CEO, stand. I'm not going to go through and announce their names, but you'll want to catch them at their breaks. So if our team could please stand, let's recognize them. These are the folks that do all of the work. Then, at this table, we have 5 of our directors, and if they would just stand, because I know you'll want ask them things they can't answer at break. And it's great to have all of you with us. So we'll get started. I want to go through. We use these words thoughtfully today, the evolution of an information powerhouse. When Lance and I first started talking about it, we set it out to be an information powerhouse, we'll talk about that in a moment. I ask our General Counsel to stand and read this for you. Are you ready, sorry? Thank you. Good job. Okay. Now we'll move on. This is the agenda. I'll spend about 20 minutes giving you a good update, then we're going to get Lance up here to share our vision and strategy that we've been working on for some time. We presented it to our board in London a few weeks ago and have fine tuned it since then. I must say it's one I'm more excited about than any I've been privileged to be part of. Then, our segment reviews with Jonathan Gear, Transportation; Adam will then do Financial Services; and then we'll take a 15-minute break. I will announce that after Adam finishes, and we will start, pronto, after 15 minutes. And then Jonathan comes back and picks up Resources and CMS. Then we'll have the clean-up hitter, Todd Hyatt, our CFO. Todd said he didn't think the highlight of any Investor Day should be the CFO's presentation. Let's wait and see because it's pretty good, because it talks a lot about capital strategy and the financial performance that we all have joined together and 100% supported. Lance and I have had a great time working with Todd and the team to prepare it. And then we'll get him up here. I'll lead the Q&amp;A, we'll do that for a long period of time as long as you all have, and then I'll do a quick recap and we'll move on.</p><p>We talked, as I said, about creating a powerhouse combination when we brought IHS and Markit together. This is just a few of the highlights we had. For quick background, if you don't know, I was privileged to get to know Lance almost 5 years ago when Bill Ford asked me to talk with Lance as Lance prepared to take Markit public. And we talked often, never met, always on the phone. I even got to know Lance's son and his favorite football soccer team. And so then last December, we got together for a breakfast, wonderful discussion, and said we wanted to carry forward. Coincidently, and I think it was what I would call a God wink, Lance was heading for a holiday and I was too. So we talked 2-plus hours a day for about, I'd say, almost 2 weeks. And when we got done, we said we want to take it the next step, which we did, then bringing teams together, one of the most fun meetings I have ever had. We had 20 -- 10 from each of the teams together for 2 days talking about what this company could do if we brought it together in the future. We announced on March 21 of last year. We spent a heavy amount of time in June of last year working on identifying revenue synergies that I'll talk about in a few moments, cost synergies, what we would do, and if you remember and I'll show you, we were very specific when we announced on March 21 what we were going to do with those, and I'm delighted with our progress. On July 1 we were successful in acquiring Info, and that's a story I can give you on a break sometime of being able to get that, because that will stand for what this company is all about for many years to come. And you're going to hear a lot about that today. This is the information powerhouse today and of the future. We announced the close of the merger on July 12. It was interesting. I have great respect for lawyers and bankers, but they're always too slow. And so they told Lance and I it was going to be mid-September and I said no, it's going to be mid-July, and they delivered with a little help from us. So on July 12, we closed. We gave guidance for 2017 in November of this year, and we'll talk about that. You saw we reaffirmed it publicly today. And then on Q4, we gave on January 17th the earnings announcement for the year and for the quarter. That was a complicated earnings announcement because of SEC regulations. You'll see as the year goes forward the real IHS Markit from a financial standpoint, and gave you good picture of the progress on March 28 of this year with Q1 earnings, organization alignment and announcing.</p><p>When Lance and I were with that team on the weekend, February, in Scottsdale and had a great time, they were working together, 2 things happened that was fascinating that really led to our success together. We split the 2 teams up on a -- they worked together Saturday, and then we split them up on Sunday. Said here are 3 things: tell us what 3 things you're going to do if we bring these 2 together, and what would be most successful. It was amazing to me. Both teams came back with the same 3 priorities, and it was also exciting to see how close they were in figuring out how to make it happen. While they were doing that, Lance and I were talking about a lot of things in a room. And I said, \"Lance, if you get a chance, if we can pull this together, what would you talk to -- about for 3 minutes about why this is a great thing?\" He gave the best extemporaneous speech I've ever heard in my life. Unfortunately, I didn't tape it. So today you're going to take 30 to 33 minutes to do what he did even better in 3 minutes. But it got me so excited and Lance that we delivered it and you're going to see the results as we go forward.</p><p>Information analytics and expertise. That's our sweet spot. You'll see us as we roll that out today with Jonathan and Adam and giving the great overviews with the team we're blessed with. You're going to see how we do that, and we'll do it better than ever before for years to come. We grab the idea of this being the new intelligence because everything we do is focused on how we help customers make better decisions quicker than ever before. We worked hard in bringing the 2 together on a merger of equals. It's critical that we have really good vision mission values. This was very straightforward. The leading source for critical information analytics and insight that power growth efficiency and value of our customers. Everything we do is focused on that. Vision is a beacon that we reach out to the future, work backwards and measure it. Mission is, what I tell our team, if you've been asked to do too many things, which we all are, go back to that mission and make sure what you're doing priority-wise is working. Very straightforward, again, delight our customers daily so they can make more informed decisions to enable their long-term sustainable growth, very straightforward. Work, we want to be measured and we are, we'll talk about that in just a moment, by our customers on are we living that mission. Then really the values, which are a compass for the way we operate. It was interesting, again, Markit had 6, we had 5, 5 of the 6 we brought together and added a sixth one. That's pretty remarkable they were that consistent. I would also comment that while we were doing that, as we worked using BCG to help us do the synergy identification, and they did great work for us, we also had them do an analysis that -- on culture, and they've done it with about 20,000 companies. There is 12 indices that they looked at. We were remarkably -- in fact we were so close that they reran it because we were remarkably close on what we thought from our groups, I think, we've had about 85% of our team, 14,000 people participate in that, and that helped Lance and I see what we hoped was true would be true. You'll note that everything we talk about with our values, our mission and in our vision is focused on external inside-out customers.</p><p>I'm going to roll through these pretty quickly. These 4 key critical points is what we've worked on from a critical information analytics and solutions standpoint. First, information powerhouse innovating for the future, innovating for the future, mission-critical information, very deep domain expertise across consolidated markets, financial resources and transportation financial services. We have must-have products; you're going to see that today and why they help our blue-chip customer base. I'll give you a good flavor of what we say -- mean when we say blue-chip in just a moment, and then information assets and expertise enabling next-generation products and services.</p><p>This one was a fun one to put together. This is our, as you can see, 2012 through 2016, 11% annualized total growth when we put the 2 together. This is the split out. I want to make one comment on that. This is the split-out on where invoiced. So, for example, JPMorgan, Exxon, much -- many of their products are used far outside of the U.S. But this report says we're required to do by SEC from where the invoice is submitted. So if you thought about it, you'd find that we're actually much stronger in serving our customers around the world than in APAC than in EMEA than it demonstrates, but this will give you the flavor from a requirement reporting standpoint. This is one we like. Some of you will remember in 2008 when we did our Investor Day, we were -- I committed publicly that we'd bring IHS from 52% energy down to something less, because energy is a great business, as Lance would tell you, it's a powerhouse that nobody has ever touched. But we've gone through the cycles. So what we laid out to do was automotive, which we did, transportation and then the great privilege of merging with Markit. So today, you see our balance, Financial Services 34%, Resources 25%, Transportation 26% and CMS 15%. What that says and what you should think about is, in the future we'll have far less volatility than we've had historically as we work forward to get that balance. 3 year, you're going to see more about this from, actually from everybody and Todd will hit this hard with his, organic growth, Financial Services 5%, Transportation 9%, Resources minus 3%. You're going to see a chart from Jonathan in a bit that shows capital spending in energy was down 52% and we ended up being down 3% on average, and then CMS 2% 3 years' average. Most important, you're going to see from Lance and each of Adam's and Jonathan's presentations and then to Todd's where our targets are: mid single-digit, Financial Services; high single-digit, Transportation; mid single-digit, Resources; low to mid-single and a very strong focus on delivering consistently 4% to 6% long term. You'll also see from Lance as we've laid out the strategies, of which he has done a great job of leading, that we are going to do the things we are very best to be operating at that upper end of 6%, and you'll see from Todd later what that does from a financial standpoint.</p><p>This is 1 of 2 charts that's great fun. I'm not going to go through it all. But first on my right, your left, 84% recurring revenue. Our target's about 85%. That's about as good as it gets. Great foreseeability, great ability to predict. When we run really as energy comes back, resources come back, you'll see us run negative working capital because of the cash delivered upfront. So we're at 72% recurring fixed, 12% recurring variable, that means it's based on transactions or activity, and then nonrecurring 16%. So we're right about where we want to be going forward. This is just examples and I'll show you a more fun one now. 85% of the fortune Global 500, 75% of the Fortune U.S. 1,000, 94 of the 100 largest U.S. companies. We have a goal, by the way, on each of these is to get 100 of 100, and 50, 50. 46 of the largest global asset managers, 49 of the largest U.S. banks, 10 of 10 of the automotive largest, and 49 out of 50 global oil companies. The one we don't have is the Iranian oil company. Then across the bottom, you can see this is what we mean from a blue-chip standpoint, incredible customers we're honored to serve. By the way, we have 50,000 total customers and every one of them are equally important, but it shows that we really do provide the kind of information analytics that our customers need. Interesting chart. We have about 14,000 people. More than 5,000 of those folks are analysts, data scientists, financial experts and industry specialists. Very, very exciting to be part of that organization, know how to interpret information, that's really something that we do better than anybody in the world. Award-winning forecasting, trusted relationships with industry leaders and then every one of our colleagues being rewarded and sharing a common focus on serving our customers inside out.</p><p>This is the chart we use for public measurement. There are 5 performance benchmarks. We start with colleague success, everything does start with our colleagues. We measure that on our annual basis using an outside firm. We expect to be in the top quartile or higher. We'll be doing that later this year with our benchmark. Customer delight, we use outside again. We're running at 70%. Our target is 78% in the next couple of years. Top and bottom line profit, you will see that, of course, this year's guidance's $3.525 billion in the midpoint and almost $1.4 billion, a $1.388 billion at the midpoint of our guidance today. Happy to announce TSR of 49% as of yesterday from the day before we -- the Friday before we announced the merger on March 21. So critical to us is that circle of colleague success, customer delight, profitable top and bottom line, share owner success and then corporate sustainability, which is really critical for us. We're very proud of that. Dow Jones Sustainability Index is our target. We've been in there. We intend to stay and intend to climb in the future, and you'll see those as we go forward.</p><p>Quick update on integration. Very pleased. When the merger was announced here is what we said: deal would close in quarter 3; we closed in quarter 2. We said cost synergies of $35 million in 2017; they are now north of $50 million. We said revenue synergies of $10 million in 2017; we're on track for that. And if you ask Shane at break, he will tell you you're going to outperform that. Now they don't have to ask you, Shane. See the time I saved for you? Long-term adjusted EBITDA, we said low to mid-40s the day Lance and I announced it. Today, we've announced a mid-40s and you're going to see how's that going to happen. So just couldn't feel better about how that's played out. Two other things, we said $1 billion buyback in '17 and '18; we're doing $1.2 billion in '17. And then finally, we set a target of $2.08, and that's where we are at the top end of our guidance. So what we said on March 21 and committed to you as our share owners, we're delivering at or better in every case. I must say fourth merger of equals I've done, by far the best results to date and we're just getting warmed up.</p><p>This is, and you can look at it on your own pages, but this is the activities we've been working for, and only going to call out a couple of them because it's been great success every place. Critical is our information technology. We're building a new complete backroom that we'll exit 2017 with a new CRM and HR systems along with integrating our SAP systems. So feel very good about what that's going to do for us in years to come. Then, the other thing I wanted to mention is we've made huge progress. Monday, we -- Lance and I welcomed and thanked everybody -- what do we got, Adam, 700-plus there colleagues at our new New York headquarters. We've got, Lance, 1,600 in London? About that. So most important, people don't, I think, appreciate this enough, it's not just for the cost savings and they're very high. Equally important is you walk around and see the consolidating of the talent synergies brought together and help us become one company, IHS Markit, and huge, huge progress with that.</p><p>Line of sight to savings. As I said, we originally said we'd do $35 million in 2017; we're $50 million plus, $95 million commitment 2018 and exit 2019 of $125 million more. These are the ways we've used them. On an average, we spent $1.50 to get a $1 of savings and I've just been really, really pleased with that progress to date.</p><p>Now let's talk a little bit about synergies because this, from a revenue standpoint, this is the one I hear every investor I have ever met said, yes, everybody says you're going to get the synergies and they never happen. They're going to happen and we're going to give you examples today, and we'll continue to report on it. These are the progress milestones that we put in place early, couldn't feel better about those. Our confidence level today of delivering $100 million of run-rate synergies exiting 2019 is very high. I believe we'll exceed that with time. Here is examples only, 50 deals closed year-to-date 2017, 20 we closed in July to November. The earlier ones were smaller as you would expect. Pipeline steadily increasing. We did a daily up across the board and couldn't be happier and we're clearly on pace for 2017 $10 million or more. Just going to give you a few examples. Large sell side, large buy side, not going to go through these. They are in your book. Happy to talk to you about them at time. But a great cross-section of selling products both ways and solutions and couldn't feel better about it. We've had positive surprises as we've done this as we've gone forward, including together selling new into customers neither one of us had, but because we brought the 2 together we've been able to sell more products. These are -- so I showed you large -- I'll go back just for a second. Large sell side, large buy side, these are corporations and then Asia, where Shane is leading us, great examples. All of these, and as you'll note here, we're talking names, so we can give you exact examples where customers have allowed us the privilege of sharing their names of what we're on target for. This is going to turn out to be not only good and successful for all of us, but brings together that incredible powerhouse that I was talking about earlier. We're organized for success. On March 28, we announced a series of organization changes that brings us focus to the future with Jonathan and Adam leading our commercial operations, Yaacov and Randy leading our analytics and technology operations, and it's exciting. It's fun to be part of this, and it's fun to see the great progress. Lance is going to talk quite a bit about the technology efforts we're working on. This is our executive leadership team. You'll see and all those folks are here today, and would look forward to having a good discussion with you during breaks or afterwards. I've been blessed over the years, this is now year 38 I've had as leading 8 public companies as CEO, this is the best team I've ever been fortunate enough to be part of and I couldn't be prouder of it. We are one company today, very much, after successful integration, a very clear path which we're sharing with you and a shared passion through our vision mission values. One of the folks that's here today came up to me just before we started the meeting. He said, I hid my badge so none of your people knew who you were -- who I was. I went around to each of them, he said, I asked the question, \"How do you feel it's going?\" He said the enthusiasm and reality of excitement was the answer from our people at those demos was unanimous. It made me very happy and I believe that. Solid strategy to delight customers and provide very strong returns to shareowners, and this is about one of my favorite charts and God willing, it'll just keep heading up and to the right. So that's from the Friday before we announced, we announced on March 21, and that index says we're at 149 versus our peer group, which you all have selected as in the S&amp;P 500 at 118, and that's what we're just able to deliver with what we've accomplished thus far. Now you're going to hear a whole bunch more as we go forward. Many of you -- somebody was here a little while ago I just talked to that was at the first Investor Day we did, where is he? First Investor Day, there he is, first Investor Day we did years ago. You'll remember I never handled this off for years because I wanted to keep this baby moving. Today, I have such confidence in this entire team. Lance, if you come up, I'm going to give it to you to let you rip. I got to tell you, this is the most fun we've had together. I'm so proud of what Lance has done. When we first talked, we made the decision, actually it was Lance's idea and I supported it, that he was going to do the integration, give him time to do all the things we needed to do, get to know the people, et cetera. And he's done that. It's been great fun. As we've gone through with our board the transition, we're right on schedule. And Lance led the strategic plan you're going to see and I get to play coach for it and it's incredibly good. So we're having a great time. I had suggested that the people start reporting to Lance late August, early September that I'm currently [gone] and Lance said, no, I'll be on vacation then. Is that what you said?.</p><p>LANCE UGGLA, PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR, MARKIT LTD.: Exactly, until September anyways. So thank you, everybody, and thanks to all the team. I hope you've had the chance to walk around to some of the exhibits and really see the passion for what we're creating at IHS Markit. And when I first met Jerre, we sat down -- it was actually on a balcony in Florida, Super Bowl weekend, so the weekend was cut short because everybody had to leave on the Sunday. But we're sitting on the balcony, and we started to talk about the vision of IHS Markit. And our confidence really started to grow. And we're both realists, as you know. Some people call us optimists, but ourselves, realists. And we had confidence then and I have to say that every single day that I wake up and I get to come into IHS Markit, that confidence is growing. And that will be a theme of what I talk about as I prepare you for our strategy and vision and then pass it over to my colleagues to carry you through the commercial and financial parts of the presentation. You're clearly better at this than I am, Jerre. Okay, here we go. So let's set the stage.</p><p>Information services. Think back in the agricultural age and rubbing your hands each morning, or in the industrial age. Well, today, we're [an owner] of large information sets, and we sit squarely in the middle of the information age and that affords us great opportunity. But imagine my day when I think about the assets of the company. I've got the best job. In the last year, I've had a lot of fun and I start off when I think about the assets. When I think about our assets, I start off and I think about our people. IHS Markit is rich with talent, some 14,000 people total. And when I think about the people that I get to work with, think about last night, I had dinner actually with Dan Yergin, 2 times Pulitzer prize winner, who gets to do that, discussing energy markets. When I was in Davos I spent time with Carlos Pascual, and we talked about geopolitical risks and some of the changing political environments around the world. He's former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and then Mexico. Or I get to build a new index with [Sophia Danziger] or [Aaron Flores], both market experts. We've got some 14,000 people globally that are experts at what they do, and they really are our best assets, many of them here today. We also have, as Jerre said, leading customers, 50,000 customer relationships and an opportunity to go deep with those customers with a real, unparalleled confidence. And finally, we did a merger and the merger has afforded us a financial flexibility that's allowing us -- is allowing us. Are we okay on the mic, Jerre? Yes, Okay. I'm not sure of which one, I keep hearing a bit of feedback, so let me know if we need to switch it up. The merger has given us the ability to have a financial flexibility, and that's come through the cost synergies and outperforming the synergies that we announced at the time of the merger, and we're going to invest that additional return back into our company. And that makes our long-term goals very achievable. So let me reiterate the goals that Jerre said. 4% to 6% organic growth, that's a great confident committed goal that the leadership team is comfortable with and confidence -- and has a lot of confidence in achieving. It's going to come with disciplined capital management ensuring that those mid-40s margins are hit as we look forward. And that's going to give us solid double-digit EPS growth. This is our commitment to you. As a team, we've built these plans together and we're confident of being able to deliver it. So I hope your confidence starts to grow as you listen to the team today, and you see our presentation. And I love a comment that my partner, Yaacov, always says: \"This is what good looks like.\"</p><p>So what have I been doing for the past year? I've been very focused on the businesses of IHS Markit. I've traveled around the globe, I've been to some 20-plus offices, met nearly 70% of our people, over 100 customers and I can tell you that this has helped me gain confidence, and I can confirm to you that our foundation is very solid. And it's solid in our product offerings, where we have leading #1 rank positions in all of our key verticals. We're already using diverse technology, and we have the expertise to be able to develop that further. We've got great colleagues. I'm talking about experts in every channel that we operate in, and we share that common vision, mission and values that Jerre mentioned, which brings us together as a new firm and something that gets us really excited. When you think about our customers, think about unparalleled access. This is a company that accesses the C-suite in all of our verticals. That's not normal amongst our competitors. We can walk into the C-suite of asset managers, energy companies, OEMs, suppliers, technology companies, large manufacturing companies. We have deep, trusted relationships that are in all of our verticals. And we have great brands. We have acquired often in the past and some of those acquisitions came with amazing brands. Think of CERA and CERAWeek, which was Dan Yergin's company and [Jamie Rosenfield]. I think they're both here today. Think about Jane's, the defense brand. Think about Fairplay, think about Polk in automotive, think about our iBoxx, [iTracks], CDX index series or PMIs. This company is filled with amazing brands that exist within the IHS Markit family.</p><p>So our foundation is strong and I hope that you can feel that confidence that I have, and I think this is the real doozy, this slide here. This is the slide that, when we were putting the company together, Jerre and I sat down with a BCG partner in London, actually one from New York and one from London, and they said you guys are the luckiest guys that I have met. And we said, well, why is that? And they said you're going to be an information services company in markets that are growing at 1.5x to 2x GDP. And I hate to say what he said next, because his comment was that if you show up, you should be able to deliver mid-single-digits growth. We want to do better than that, and the strategy as we lay it out today is all about us wanting to achieve the high end of our range when markets afford it, accelerate through when we can and protect the downside when markets are tough. But 4% to 6%, it's a solid, confident level that this chart supports. It also shows you on the right-hand side of this slide that information intensity, that's the intensity that our industry participants spend money on information services, is growing. Information in the information age, we're well positioned as a company to take advantage.</p><p>Let's take a look at about our product mix and positioning. I think this is the real beauty of the slide. It shows the established offerings that we have, the niche offerings, these are the deep moated product set we serve up to our customers every day. But what's most important is on the lower half. You can see that we're making investments, our future growth. Looking forward, we expect our emerging products and our emerging offerings to make up a good proportion of our revenue, and we want to measure that and we're committed to reporting on that. We want to look forward long term and make sure that our organic growth investments are delivering a good part of our future revenue.</p><p>So before we start talking about areas for investment, I think it's really important if I want you to have confidence, you need to have confidence that we understand the markets around us, we understand the changes that are happening around us. We constantly make technology an integral part of every decision we make. We have Big Data; we had Big Data before the word Big Data was invented. And in fact, we have to use Big Data to develop our business. We have petabytes of data stored and moving across the firms -- our firm every day, and we need to use that position and be aware of the changes in the technologies and the usage and the analytics and stay at the cutting edge. And we also need to be aware and cognizant of emerging competitors that are around us that may try to eat our lunch. And we are very focused on the environmental conditions around the company and making sure that our strategy, which we are going to start talking about now, is poised to allow us to stay competitively relevant and widen the gap to those key competitors.</p><p>Okay, so let's reflect for just a moment. What have I talked about? I've talked about great people. I've talked about amazing customers, deep-moated products, well diversified, well</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>That opportunity is to generate that incremental capital, the additional capital to put back in, in a flexible way and invest in 4 areas: technology itself, product, customers and colleagues. All of these investments in each of these targeted areas have a technology component to them and I'll talk about those one by one.</p><p>So the tech priority, we're going to start here. I think the first thing that you need to know is the trends that are happening around IHS Markit. New technologies, easy access for data analysis, we need to make sure that we are aware of new technologies and that we're using those technologies to better perform with our customers. We talk about massive new data; it's being created every day around us. When you drive your car, you're creating data, satellite imageries creating data, when you use your phone you're creating data, any platform you shop on creates data, the Internet of Things is creating data. We're a proprietary content company, but we need to combine our data with other relevant data sets to multiply that competitive edge and make sure that we're using data in all the ways possible for us to be great. And then analytics, faster analysis of data, readily available. And when we talk fast, and Yaacov and I talk about new analytics, it's lightning fast. We have to make sure that we're using data, analyzing data in all ways possible. And I'll talk more about advanced analytics in a moment.</p><p>So how are we going to position ourselves to better meet our customer needs? Well, the first thing is use some of the incremental savings and make sure that the product investments are fresh, that we protect our current revenues. We have great products. To protect them, you need to continually invest in them. You need to enable them with technology to achieve their full benefits. Let me give you an example. We have many software products. 3 years ago, 1 or 2 of our customers would request a delivery of our software via the cloud. There'd be all sorts of challenges around information security, certainty of delivery, performance. Today, more than 50% of our customers are taking our offerings via the cloud. So we need to be cloud enabled. We need to make sure that all of our products and services are cloud enabled and reach into the future with new technologies. This reduces costs for our customers, it increases availability, think our 50,000 customers, we can reach hundreds of thousands of customers using technology to extend our reach. And it reduces the time to get to market with our new products. Now if you're a great company investing in technology, your people expect that you invest in technology in the company. So within this part of our strategy, we are also investing in the platforms that we use inside of IHS Markit. So we have invested in a global CRM. We are using multiple CRM systems across the combined entity. We selected Salesforce.com; we are currently rolling that out on track for the end of this year. So we can have a single CRM. And that's going to allow us to do a whole bunch of things to be better. We also wanted to be efficient with our HR platform. And again, we had the opportunity in the combination to invest in a single platform. We chose Workday, cloud-based HR platform. We're rolling that out and we expect in the next 6 to 12 months to have that fully rolled out across the globe, making IHS Markit a much better place for our people to be able to serve themselves on their HR needs.</p><p>Now you're going to see that in each of the areas I talk about, not just technology, that there is a technology angle to all the incremental investment that we're going to putting work in IHS Markit globally, and product's no different. I talked about established offerings, niche offerings and the emerging differentiated offerings. Our teams are brimming with ideas in every single one of our product groups, excited about their products, wanting to develop in the white space around them, wanting to expand the product offerings, want to use technologies to make the product offerings faster, more readily available, reach more customers. There is no better place but investing in ourselves for many of the ideas that we have going forward. But we can't do them all. So what I can promise you is a very disciplined approach from our team in terms of the investment process. So where are we going to be focused? Well, of course, high-growth potential areas. We want to help ourselves hit the upper end of that 4% to 6% range and have the opportunity to accelerate upwards. For that, we have to make sure that when we make investments we are not just protecting what we have, but we're also looking at the future and looking for areas that we can produce high growth. We're going to use a lot of advanced analytics. Announcing Yaacov Mutnikas as Chief Data Scientist is all about analytics and data coming together to build new products, and I'm going to talk about those in a couple slides. We need to enhance existing products. The fact is, whether you're doing a consulting, providing research or insights, whether you're valuing an asset, pricing an index, all the different things that we do for our customers globally, we need to make sure that we are constantly enhancing and using technology to make that customer experience better. At times, we'll develop new products to fill opportunities or gaps. And then, of course, we're going to address new trends. And if you walk outside and visit some of the stands and you went to the -- out to the far right, you could have spoke to the IHS connect folks, [Cunilia], and she was telling me about our new online store and the offerings of chemical research online. That's a new feature just launched. Historically, they would've got an e-mail with all the chemical reports on them they might have had an interest. Now we can personalize and deliver and create a full online sale right through the purchase online. You can visit her afterwards and she'll show you how to do that. Secondly, walk down to the back, where Steve Had's sitting on the automotive side, and next to him a presentation on our new VPaC product. These are trends, emissions output across the OEMs. Those OEMs want to measure their performance relative to the regulations, organically grown product, presented here, live producing revenue. This is the type of trends that are happening around us. You can meet on the right-hand side the team here focused on FRTB. That's taking our processing business, leveraging it into a financial regulation and delivering a product that allows the better management of capital across the industry, leveraging data in one part of the company to a new product that was developed by Adam and Yaacov's team. And we have many of those. If you go to CARFAX, it had the best vehicle history reports in the marketplace. Today, they're building the best-used car listing franchise, leveraging our position in one market and taking it into another and producing real growth. Those are the trends that we need to invest in. And as I said, brimming with ideas, we are filled with ideas across IHS Markit globally, but we need to be disciplined, focused, selective in what we do. We can't do it all, but we'll do as much as we can to help ensure that, that 4% to 6% is at the top end of that range.</p><p>Okay. I want to talk a little bit more about analytics. We are rich in content at IHS Markit, we're deep with our customers, and data analytics allow us to extend our data sets through analysis and unlock opportunity for our extended customer relationships. We need to use analytics to help our customers gain deeper insights into their data sets. That helps us develop new products and new offerings and helps us create efficiencies in terms of managing data ingestion. Think about IHS Markit as this big engine of information, and it costs us a lot of money to manage and handle all that information every day. We need to use machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence. We need to use those tools to improve our margins and manage the vast amounts of data that we have. And we'll do that through bringing our data sets onto a unified platform and use technology and analytics to reduce those costs. But analytics are not just about costs. They're equally important to us as we look to build new products and services and using much more rapid analytics through clustered computing to allow near real-time processing of data and therefore, better products and services for our customers.</p><p>Okay, I love this slide. This is the best slide in the deck. When you look at this slide, what do you see? You see that IHS Markit has 2 very real competitive edges. We have rich proprietary content and we have industry expertise second to none in the verticals we operate in. Now analytics, I mentioned Yaacov. He's getting a lot of mention today because data scientry is part of our future and that was a very, very important announcement that Jerre and I made early on in this merger to put specific talent against analytics and turn that yellow tick to green. And then finally, computing power. The big tech companies have a lot of computing power, but there is no barriers to entry in using enabling technologies. We just have to use our financial strength, our financial position and make sure that we're investing in IHS Markit. And our competitive edge for leveraging that proprietary content, our industry expertise positions us to benefit from all the increasing demands around us.</p><p>Okay. So we haven't been resting. We've already produced 3 proof of concepts that are laid out here, and we have several more already in our pipeline. These are proof of concepts where we're starting the transformation with Yaacov. He works with the product teams, we develop the new product offerings, and then we hand that back to the product and Randy Harvey to be put into process and commercialized as we do with all of our products. We're not creating 2 technology teams, we're transform in one, and we're run in the other. These proof of concepts are great examples of some of the things that we've been doing. Let me just talk about the forward valuations on the left. This is taking financial market content with our deep energy expertise and looking at ways to combine data sets with scenario analysis, rapid, fast, where we can run tens of thousands of scenarios against an asset, a company, an investment. And we can help evaluate that company. We can also help make an investment decision and, even more, help our customers understand the risk of the things that they own under different scenarios. These exciting proof of concepts are growing each day, we're staffing up against the team, and we expect many more of our future emerging differentiated offerings to come through this new team.</p><p>Okay, customers. I think it's really important that we also use technology to have an impact with our customers and a real impact. Each of these channels that I talk about here or each of these pieces of this slide have a technology angle. Let's start on the upper left. Data-driven sales, what does that mean? Well, when I was talking to Cornelia and I looked at the online sales for chemical, she said this is really helping our online sales, and I said -- or our sales in that we're having more inquiry coming through now that we've launch the IHS Markit store. Now what's interesting is when you go into the store, of course, there is still a lot of articles. I felt like I need to have a science degree to actually get to the bottom of the list. But the fact is, we can use technology there as well. What can we do? We can analyze the things that we've sold a customer before. We might combine that with LinkedIn data to show that, that customer has moved to a new place of employment, and we followed them and connected them and created a warm lead that suggests that this client uses our chemical research and now might need that chemical research in their new job where they haven't bought before from that company. Data-driven sales, personalization, digging in, this isn't just B2C. We have to use our data to understand our customers. And in the bottom left, measure our customer experience and know when they're happy, when they are users and when they are inactive, because if we can keep a customer retained that's the best sales we can make. And our retention is in the low 90s, and every 1% that we improve customer retention, it goes straight into our financials in a really strong way, and we need to use technology to improve that.</p><p>And then finally, channels. Channels are important, and the new channels that we need to develop are inside sales capability and our online E capability. We have vast room for improvement, investment, and we'll continue to grow those alongside of our direct sales efforts, and we see that as a great growth area for years to come.</p><p>Okay. We're moving into the final priority, colleagues. I think this is got to be the most important thing that we can invest in is our own people. And it's all about being great. If we invest in our people, we invest in our talent right from interns to young managers to burgeoning executives. We need to invest in the career path. We need to make it rewarding, we need to be -- make it exciting, we need to show a path from the start of the firm all the way through. It doesn't matter, if you start in economic research, you can see all the way up to Nariman Behravesh and straight up to Jerre Stead, to the top of the firm. If you are an energy consultant, you can see all the way up to Dan Yergin. If you're in automotive sales or you're an analyst, you can see all the way up to Jonathan Gear and therefore, Jerre Stead. It's important that our teams can see their career paths, and know that if they join our company they've got a great future. Learning and development, talent investment, digital engagement, that's the technology tools used to keep track of our -- to meet new interns, students, to keep track of our existing employees and communicate with them. And even well-respected alumni that have left the firm can be important if they end up in our customers. And we need to have a way of engaging to be the firm that we want to be. And out of that, develop a culture that motivates and inspires globally. We've also invested in technology there. We've just selected a platform called Glint for employee engagement. If you don't know it, you can look it up online. It's a great platform that allows us near real-time pulse on our employees, staying engaged with their moods, their thoughts, their career path excitement. And it's very important as a firm that we use technology to recruit, retain and develop diverse talent and invest in IHS Markit globally.</p><p>I'm going to end on this next slide and I just want to reiterate, I think our path forward is very promising. We are very confident. I can tell you that Jerre and I through this transition, our confidence grows every single day. It's never waned. We've got a great foundation, great people, great assets, great customers. We're positioned -- remember information in information age growing at 1.5x to 2x GDP, we're positioned very competitively in growing markets. Incrementally, we're going to invest in 4 key areas with targeted investing, targeted investments afforded to us through the financial flexibility of the merger. From that, strong shareholder returns that will return to you in a very disciplined approach, sticking with that 4% to 6%, mid-40s margin, solid double-digit EPS returns. That's our commitment. I'm confident. I hope your confidence grows. Jonathan is going to come up next and start off with Transportation. It's great to be here. I'm excited about the rest of the day and I hope you enjoy yourselves as all the team has today. Thank you.</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR, EVP OF RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION, IHS MARKIT LTD.: Great, Lance. Thanks so much. Great. Is my microphone working back there? All right, great. Well, Lance, thanks so much. It is a great overview of our strategy. In fact, Lance, I almost wanted to work for your company, you made me that excited. It's great to see that. Now in the next few segments Adam Kansler and I will walk through and give you an overview of our 4 business segments. And during that time, what we hope to do is give you a feel for the markets that we serve, the types of products and solutions that we bring to bear and what's giving us the confidence behind the growth that we're seeing in these markets. And I'm going to kick it off now with our Transportation segment.</p><p>So just very briefly, our Transportation segment covers 3 very distinct end markets: automotive market; aerospace, defense and national security; and finally, maritime and trade. Now across these 3 markets, we do support them with the same 3 types of solutions as Lance described, absolutely mission-critical information. On top of that, we build analytics and derive data sets, and finally, go to market with insight, research and consulting. Looking at the financial performance with Transportation. It has been a great, great story. We are incredibly proud of the performance that our teams have delivered, organic revenue growth the last couple of years of 9% to 10%, and during that time, driven by that revenue expansion and operational improvement, we've continued to drive margin expansion about 200 bps a year each of the last 2 years. Looking at the profile on the right-hand side, you'll see that this segment is dominated revenue-wise by our products and solutions sold into automotive. So I'm going to focus most of my discussion around that end market.</p><p>So moving into automotive. Let me begin with an overview of how we look at the automotive industry. Now begin at walking you across the very top of the screen with these 4 major workflows across the automotive industry. It starts with strategy and product planning. So this, if you could imagine, for OEMs they're thinking about what is the new model that I need to introduce 5 years from now and begin the planning of right now. It then moves to next stage around the manufacturing and supply chain around creating that new vehicle. Then, finally, on to stage 3, the launch of that new vehicle with all the sales and marketing efforts around that. And finally, into the last segment, which is by far the biggest segment, it involves used car sales, after markets, collision repairs, and so on and so forth. And then going down on the vertical, you see the different segments in the markets: automotive OEMs, like BMW, VW; parts suppliers like Federal-Mogul and Delphi; dealers, used car dealers such as your local branded dealership like a Toyota dealership or maybe Lance's used car dealers down the road, dealers like that, and so on, and so forth. Now across this spectrum of workflows and customer segments, you see in those green boxes where we play. And a couple of things I will call out as you look at the slide. First, we cover the entire value chain from the early conception of a vehicle in the headquarters of an OEM all the way through that life cycle and the full life of that vehicle, and then we also cover and touch every major customer group that supports that segment. That puts us in a very powerful place to support this industry with the major decisions that they have.</p><p>Quick thing on our capabilities here and I will call out 3 core assets that we hope use every day to help drive and support the industry. It starts with our people, and you met a few of them, as Lance mentioned, outside, over 1,300 dedicated colleagues across IHS Markit who support our automotive solutions and our automotive products. We have an incredible, incredible customer list, Jerre talked about some of them earlier. All major automotive OEMs are a customer of IHS Markit. 95 of the largest automotive parts suppliers are a customer of IHS Markit and over 20,000 car dealers use our products every single day. And finally, driving that capabilities and the customer reach is our underlying core data and analytics capabilities. It starts with our vehicle park coverage. That's industry speak for saying that we have a database and a view of all the vehicles in operation globally. So we know around the world, the year, make, models of all the vehicles driving around outside of this hotel, driving around in London, driving around in Detroit, so on, so forth. Incredibly powerful information to have on knowing the underlying dynamics of the automotive industry and cars. We supplement that with ongoing sales forecasts and production forecasts, both at the car level and also at the component level, including drive trains, technology and all the pieces and components that go into cars. And finally, probably our best-known brand here in North America is we have by far the leading database on vehicle history reports through our CARFAX and CARPROOF brands. So it's a very strong set of capabilities.</p><p>Now we help our clients across various parts of the supply chain answer absolutely mission-critical questions. Now I'm just going to walk through a couple of them to give some examples. So imagine you're in this blue box right here. So you're the head of marketing for a large automotive OEM, you're about to go through this major launch of your newest model, you've been given a $1 billion plus marketing and dealer incentive and consumer incentive budget to spend to make sure that you achieve that goal of selling 800,000 new units in the next 2 years. It's a very typical example of what our clients might see. They are coming to us to get an understanding, leveraging all of that critical data and critical analytics to understand specifically the marketplace for cars, to know where can they upsell, most likely their current customers, who is most likely to be loyal and move up and buy the newest model, which are their competitors -- competitor customer segments are most likely to be disloyal to those competitors, so they can pick off and upsell and sell into this new model. It's absolutely critical information to help to be successful. And I'm going walk over to another example at the other end with dealer services. This is a very easy one because we all know the brand. Imagine you're a car dealer, you have 100 used car vehicles in your lot, and you walk in. And you see this car, you love this car, you drive this car around and it looks great and but you're nervous that this car is a dud. You're nervous it's a lemon. With our CARFAX vehicle history report, we help our dealers give the confidence to their customers that they are buying a high-quality car and help them close that deal and close that sale. Now looking at this market, it is a very, very large market. Now point -- let me break it into 2 different buckets here. On the left we show what we call the current addressable market. These are the products, so this is the market that we are targeting our current products and our current solutions today and actively selling into. It's about a $5 billion to $6 billion market size today. So extremely large market. The great news, while that's extremely large, there is an additional market that we're really looking to growing into called our future market. And these are markets, again, in automotive, that we've identified that we can leverage many of our current capabilities, our current data sets, our expertise and grow and provide future products into those segments. I'm going to give you an example of one in a few slides here. But the nut coming out of this, it is a massive, massive market for our information, our analytics and our services. There is a long runway ahead of us to grow.</p><p>So this is a fascinating industry, the automotive industry. Incredibly dynamic, and several of the key trends that we hear from our customers that's driving our thoughts around solutions and how to help -- that's helped them, one, and I think, Lance you mentioned this, was VPaC, is around emission regulations, the carbon footprint of fleets and regulations around that. An ongoing trend that's been going on for years now around the increased use of electronics and technology in cars. And really a car is really -- I mean, it's amazing. You go back 10 years, the newest models used to be launched at the Detroit Auto Show. They are now launched at the Consumer Electronics Show. There's been a shift in cars from being mechanical beasts to being personal consumer electronics. We see that trend continuing and the trend also to more and more automated cars in the future. The third thing, very topical right now, is around flattening new car sales, but typically here in North America, and I'll talk about that in a few slides. And finally, this is more of a long-term question that the industry is facing, is what's going to happen to mobility choices in the long-term? And when you think about the growth of ride-sharing like Uber and Lyft or car sharing devices, these are fundamental questions the industry has, how is the world going to look like in 15 or 20 years.</p><p>So this is -- Lance you had your favorite slide, this is my favorite slide, looking through automotive. The story of the growth in automotive the last 3 to 4 years has been a story of product innovation and new product introduction. And it's being creating new products off those core mission-critical databases to create new analytical tools that we can help sell and leverage our customer relationships to grow more and more. And the great story here is, as much we've seen that growth the last 3 years with new product introduction, we have, again, a very, very long runway ahead of us of new products. I'm just going to point out a couple of them on this slide. First is UCL 2.0. That stands for the CARFAX used car listings. Again, Lance, you talked about this. We launched this product 3 years ago. And again, it's a great story to me, because when we acquired CARFAX as part of R.L. Polk, at that time, it really was a one trick pony. Now it was a great trick, it's the best trick in the world with the vehicle history and CARFAX reports, and was really it was more a thoroughbred than a pony. But it was a one product show when we acquired CARFAX, and that team, and if you saw the demo you've seen the evidence of that, has taken those assets and evolved it into additional value-added services for the industry and for our dealer customers. And that's been a key, key driver of growth. 2.0 is our latest version of that. We're launching right now and as much as it's driven the growth the last couple of years with a very, very early stage of the introduction of that product. So much more to come.</p><p>The other one I'm going to point out is a very different type of product, which really speaks to the power of how we bring IHS Markit together, and that's the reinventing the wheel product. And I think Dan Yergin is somewhere in the crowd here There is Dan back there. Dan Yergin, our Vice Chairman, is personally leading this new product. It's helping to answer that question I had on the prior slide, what will mobility choices look like in the future? What will fleets look like in the future? And the great thing about this and why I love this one so much is it brings together our clients from automotive, our automotive parts clients, our chemical clients and of course, our energy clients, as they have a huge vested interest as to what happens to the fleets in future and likewise this is bringing together those clients, it brings together our teams across all these different business lines and levels of expertise. It's a fantastic product and example of what we do when we bring our capabilities together.</p><p>I'm now just going to walk through couple of quick examples to kind of show really what we do. First, I'm going to talk about this industry challenge that I mentioned prior, which is the flattening out of new car sales. And if you go back to the great recession, 2008, 2009, that was a low point of new car sales. That was, in North America, just under 10 million units of new cars sold in that 2008, 2009 time period. It's been steadily rising every single year since then, up to last year about 16 million units, so 60% increase over that time period. It's been a great time to be an automotive OEM, a great time to be selling parts into automotive OEMs. But that time's coming to an end. We are now forecasting, through our great automotive team, a flattening out of what's called SAARs or new car sales at that 16 million [dollar] level, and that brings new challenges for automotive OEM clients and new ways we can help them. So what are we focused on now? So for automotive OEMs, the game has changed from growing with this rising tide towards capturing market share from competition. That's how they are going to win the next few years, and we help our clients win. So when they're looking at their market share they, obviously, have view as to their own narrow view of their own customer base, we have a view of the entire market. So when they're out launching new vehicles, when they're out doing the sales, we're providing the intelligence to understand how they are performing vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis their competition. When they are launching promotional campaigns targeted at a specific customer segment, we're providing them real-time information how are you being effective. Sure, you know the sales you're doing, but we can tell them how their competition is doing, and are they really gaining share or not and why. These types of solutions and insights become critical in the time of a flattening out market.</p><p>A quick another example, this is a different scenario, it's more about leveraging our capabilities with CARFAX. And again, I talked about our one magnificent trick thoroughbred of CARFAX. You look at the core assets, it starts with an incredible, incredible team. And from that team, they have built over time 3 critical attributes. By far the leading database of vehicle history reports and records in North America, by far. Number two, incredibly trusted and deep relationships with our car dealer customers. And then finally, what is one of the top, if not, the most trusted automotive consumer brand in North America, bar none. Starting with that assets, again, as we discussed, they've leveraged that into new products. I talked about used car listings. I'm now going to talk about another one, which is my CARFAX. And I know all of you have in your pocket, your iPhone device or Android device, I don't know which one you have; you have one of those 2. What I hope is that you have on your phone is your my CARFAX app. Everyone have it? You can download it right now. I won't be offended if you look down. Go ahead and download that app. And with that app, you can enter your vehicle VIN number, your license plate number, and it produces a ton of information on your car, essentially captures all the information we have through our CARFAX vehicle history report, also has information to tell you when it's time to change your tires, change your oil, update your registration, so on and so forth. We even have a great new product which we have launched this year on vehicle-specific pricing. This is an accurate tool that again, leverages all the information we've built from our CARFAX vehicle history report plus the information we're getting from listings to produce a vehicle specific valuation based not just on year, make, model and location, but also how well have you maintained it, has it been in an accident, so very specific information. And all this resides on your phone. Now the great thing about this tool as we build it out is we have yet to monetize it. We've been building it slowly the last year or 2. We're going to continue to expand it. But this is an example of the type of solution that falls into that second bucket of market potential around future market growth that we'll grow into. So, again, just I couldn't be more proud of what the team is doing.</p><p>So as we wrap up on automotive, I just want to leave you with a few, few key thoughts. It has been an incredible performer the last few years. And the performance has been driven for all the reasons I've talked about, our underlying data, the great teams and our ability to be a flywheel of product innovation. Now the great news is we fully expect all of those 3 attributes to continue and drive similar growth for years and years to come. So this story will certainly continue.</p><p>I'm now going to flip over and briefly cover the other 2 business lines and Transportation, which is aerospace defense and then maritime and trade. Now briefly on Aerospace and Defense. What we sell here is called open source intelligence. Now that is national security speak for not confidential, not secret information. We are the one of the world's largest suppliers of open source intelligence. We sell it into 2 very distinct end markets and to the national security end market and into defense industry and suppliers. You can see some examples of the types of databases that we have. Now the overriding key theme here, the key industry trend is around an explosion in the growth of information. Incredibly hard to manage, and we are sourcing providing a ton of it through our teams. So looking at this -- here we go. Look at this business line, couple of comments on this. First, financially it is a good solid performer, think of it growing organically at low to mid-organic growth rates. It's also exceptionally high margins, one of the highest margin business lines, certainly, in my portfolio. And we see this growth and this financial performance continuing for the future, really driven by this growth of product innovation, and through the help of colleagues like Yaacov. Yaacov is an honorary member of all my teams. We will start with the aerospace, defense team as we look to apply advanced analytics to help our clients again mine this information and provide more intelligence around the open source.</p><p>Finally, on maritime and trade, start with covering the 4 core capabilities. They are presented in the blue bubbles in this chart on the right-hand side. We have 2 maritime capabilities and 2 trade capabilities. Maritime capabilities. First, we have what is called ship movement information. So we track the movements of all oceangoing vessels over 100,000 tonnes, we know where they are, we know where they came from, where they're going to and at what speed. We track that both through satellites and through our own proprietary terrestrial antennas and then we also have our own proprietary ship data information. This is, some would call it, the CARFAX of ships. It's not quite that. But it's everything you want to know about a ship. It's who owns the ship, what's the size of the ship, what engines are on that ship, what cargo can that ship contain, what ports has that ship been to prior to coming into your own port. So the combination of the ship movement and the ship data itself, very important to people who container ship, to container shippers, to maritime industry itself and, if you can imagine with the records on visiting ports, very important to national security. Then we have 2 trade capabilities. We have bill of lading information off every container that goes in and out of U.S. ports. And then we have global trade statistics at the country to country level.</p><p>I'll tell you a quick story on the last one. Last summer, I was in Frankfurt the day of the Brexit vote. And so I was in Frankfurt hanging out with my team. That night, I went to my hotel and stayed up until 4 in the morning watching the returns come in off of BBC and Sky News, and that morning, I walked into very, very quiet streets of Frankfurt that morning to our office. As I was walking down the streets, our maritime team in London got a phone call about 9 in the morning from Brussels. The EU, the European Commission, is one of our clients on the trade information, and they wanted us to very, very rapidly, they knew what the trade profile was of a 29-member EU, they wanted us to quickly tell them what was the trade profile of a 28 member EU. And that's the type of analysis that we were able to do.</p><p>Financially, very similar profile towards aerospace, defense, it's a strong mid-digit organic grower, also has high margins. And the growth here as we look forward, 2 key drivers: one, again, honorary member, Yaacov, is going to be driving analytics. If you think about the detail of data and information we have in this team, lots we can pull together and analytics we can build on top of it. And the second honorary member, Shane, with account management, helping us leverage our now very strong relationships from our financial market teams and helping to sell this product, which is ready off the shelf, ready to sell into financial markets today.</p><p>So just as we wrap up on Transportation, just a few takeaways to leave with you. This has been a fantastic performer, really could not be more pleased and proud of what the teams have done in the last few years. And the great news is, while I'm as happy as I'm looking back at what has happened, I'm equally happy looking forward, and for all the reasons that I have discussed today, particularly driven by the combination of the critical information we have, the trusted relationships that we have with the industries and then our ability to knit together and be a flywheel of product innovation will continue to drive this growth for years and years to come. So with that, I'll wrap. And it's my pleasure to introduce my great colleague, Adam Kansler. Adam leads our largest segment, Financial Services.</p><p>ADAM J. KANSLER, EVP OF FINANCIAL MARKETS, IHS MARKIT LTD.: Okay. Microphone working? Good. I definitely don't have Lance's resilience. If the mic went out, it could be a mess up here. So thank you, Jerre, Lance, Jonathan, it sets things up nicely for me to fit our financial services businesses into the framework. One early warning, I thought about what photos I could put up, and like a stock certificate or a picture of a bond, not nearly as interesting as pictures of planes and trains and automobiles. I promise you, you'll get more of those from Jonathan later. But it is an exciting business. I've been part of this business really since the beginning, working with these teams about 15 years ago. Our first product, a daily credit derivatives pricing product, still alive today, still thriving today, still a market leader today and a very firmly established market leader, the definitive product today. That's something that we're very proud of. But our business is also much bigger and much more diverse. And I'm going to talk to you about a lot of our different products. One thing all of those products have in common has been our intense focus on our customers and our intense application of expertise of real financial services experts to helping those customers solve their issues.</p><p>It's a lot of fun to talk about our business. We are near $1.2 billion of revenue in 2016 across a quite diverse set of services, solutions and products. The 15-year story of how we got here is a fun one, probably better for a coffee or a cocktail. But the exciting thing is that the best is really still in front of us. Over the last 3 to 5 years, we've seen a period of regulatory activity that's really been unprecedented and its impact on financial markets unprecedented. Yet through that period, we've continued to deliver organic growth. Through that period, we've continued to invest in our products. Some exciting investments and some of those are starting to pay off now, and I'll talk about them. But what you see is even in Q1 of this year some of those investments starting to pay off with the delivery of north of 7% organic growth in Q1. And what you also see is that we've made investments in the business so that we're well positioned when revenue is able to outperform that expands our margin, and we had over 2% margin expansion in Q1 alone.</p><p>So how do we keep driving that business forward and how do we make sure that we deliver that mid-single-digit organic growth and reach for the higher ends like Lance talked about, and a lot of the things I talk about will sound very familiar from what Lance described. So I think about it in 3 core areas. We leverage our strengths. We use our leading products, our industry expertise, our deep relationships with our customers, our proven ability to deliver regulatory solutions, and we leverage that into new or adjacent markets, launching new products, solving new problems for our customers. Second core is the scope of the market opportunity. It's big. We operate in a big marketplace and I'll come back with some details on it in a moment. The third is to take advantage of the secular trends that create additional opportunity for us, making sure we are looking outside of the company and seeing what's happening in the world. Again, I'll talk about it in a little bit more detail.</p><p>Let me get deeper on what our core strengths are as a customer -- I'm sorry, as a company. And let me start with our customer. Our intense focus on the customer has been critical to our success. We bring it into every new product we launch. We bring it into every conversation. And as Lance described, our relationships at the top of the house with some of our customers has been critical. It not only provides ideas for innovation, but it provides us a mechanism to resolve any outstanding issues or close deals where other competitors might not be able to do so.</p><p>Our deep industry expertise. We don't think of ourselves as just a data company. We think ourselves as financial services experts that go and find the right data information analytics and solutions for complex financial services customers. Our leading products, you'll see some there on the right. This is by no means exhaustive. We have over 65 products and they're not just good products, many of these products are the must-have product in their industry. And last, our proven ability to deliver. When customers faced that unprecedented regulatory activity beginning in the post-2008 financial services meltdown, we began to deliver those services -- those solutions to our customers. Those have been implemented today and they're up and running.</p><p>Okay, let me take you just one layer deeper. So we have leading businesses in many spaces, our fixed income pricing and index business, our valuations business. When you think about credit derivatives pricing, loans pricing and a rapidly growing broader set of fixed income data, we are recognized as a leader. Our iBoxx indices among the world's leading fixed income indices; our enterprise data management solution, award-winning for probably 7 or 8 years, every single year the leading product. But the story for us is actually a bit bigger. Yes, the products win and they're leading products, but the real affirmation of our success is the customer base that we've been able to achieve. 49 of the 50 largest U.S. banks, every one of the largest global asset managers, right? 4,200 people around the globe servicing this customer set and this product set in 13 countries in an integrated management structure. And what do I mean by that?</p><p>When we acquire a new asset or we launch or build a new asset, for example, we bought the leading Asian fixed income index from HSBC last year called the ALBI. When we launch that new index product, we do it with the same level of quality and capability as we run our HYG or LQD indices in the U.S. You may have heard of them. Those are the indices that underlie some of BlackRock's most successful fixed income indices in the U.S., have near $50 billion -- actually slightly over now, $50 billion of AUM against them. We celebrated the 10th anniversary of the launch of those ETFs just a couple of months ago at the New York Stock Exchange. So bringing that kind of capability across the globe to very powerful franchise.</p><p>So hopefully, I've convinced you we're set up for success in our strengths. What is the opportunity that we're going after? It's big. It's very big. Many of the markets that we operate in are somewhat niche. So it's a little bit difficult to know exactly what the size of those markets are, but this is our best estimate. And this brings you to $17 billion or $18 billion of untapped market opportunity for us. Obviously, a big pond to play in. There is even better news, and the better news is some of the stuff that Lance talked about before, none of these numbers include what we intend to do with the vast proprietary data set that we have today and the ability to go to the vast set of customers that we service today. Before the merger, we had about 3,000 customers. Today, we face off against near 50,000 customers. Bringing our financial services products to the treasury desk, to the legal tax and risk groups at corporates, to the global supply chain management teams at corporates. This is a vast set of untapped customers. None of that is in these numbers.</p><p>Okay. Hopefully, you're excited about the strengths that we bring, and you're excited about the market opportunity. It all seems very easy now. It's not so easy. This next slide I had originally had a bunch of our competitors on one side and customers on the other. But there's no 1 or 2 competitors that are useful for you to benchmark us against. There are some obvious names like a Thomson Reuters or Bloomberg or others that have some products that compete with us, but across our scope of products, we compete against a vast range of competitors. Often, our largest competitor would -- might be a financial institution themselves that has an internal system that we're looking to show them something that can do the job better, more efficiently, more effectively.</p><p>We compete in a highly competitive environment. There's no doubt about it. Financial services is a tough place to compete. How have we done it? We've done it through that industry expertise, but most importantly, we've done it by winning the confidence of our customers. As Jerre mentioned in the beginning, a blue chipset of customers, like those on this page, is not that easy to accumulate. But the exciting thing is that there are actually 3,000 more of them that I just didn't stick on the page. And that's what we've been able to achieve over 15 years, and that's what gives us our edge: constant focusing on what they need; how our solution can be bigger, better, faster, make them more efficient, save them cost. That's how we progress the business.</p><p>So hopefully, I've convinced you we're in a strong position. We've got a big market opportunity in front of us. We've got a great set of relationships with our customers. I was reading the annual letter that Jeff Bezos sends out, where he talks about a variety of things. But one interesting one is the importance of looking out at the world around you and understanding what the trends are. And if you're fighting those trends, you're probably fighting the future. And if you're embracing those trends, you've probably developed for yourself a significant tailwind.</p><p>So that is exactly the way we try to look at things.</p><p>Regulation. It's been a big one. Unprecedented activity. We've tried to build straight into it and take advantage of where financial services, firms, asset managers, banks in the U.S, in Europe and in Asia need to comply with regulations, building the kinds of solutions that get them there.</p><p>That regulatory activity hasn't stopped. There's a lot of dialogue as to where that's going to go. But in many jurisdictions, those regulations continue to be effective and financial institutions are still working on implementation. We're quite active with them.</p><p>There's another thing happening in regulation, though, which I find even more interesting and encouraging. Some people call it regulatory uncertainty. I've been calling it regulatory optimism. I -- in speaking with customers, I'd say, over the last 4 or 5 months, there is a new wind of opportunity that they see. There's a new confidence in investing and innovating new products. We've launched a [indiscernible] [Cook] index. We've launched the new CLO index. We see trading desks once again interested in committing capital and thinking that capital requirements may shift going forward, and that these activities can once again be profitable or interesting for them.</p><p>Changes in investment style. You probably have read the debates between passive investment versus active investment. That's not one that I'm going to solve on this stage. There are many great minds talking about it and looking at what's happening in the market. But the truth is, many assets have shifted to a passive investment style, and that means you need tools like measuring best execution, total transaction cost. You need indices to benchmark performance against and to measure that passive index -- passive investment performance. That's the kind of stuff that we do.</p><p>I'm going to skip down to the one second from the bottom, technology. This is a big one. And for me, technology is really 2 prongs. Prong 1 is the use of technology against a vast set of data that we have, both our own proprietary technology and all -- sorry, both our own proprietary data and all of the other big data sources that are available to us. Being able to apply technology to that machine learning, artificial intelligence, use of technologies like blockchain and to deliver next-generation solutions for our customers.</p><p>The second prong, which I actually think is very interesting for us, is the way technology is disrupting the way things got done in the past and may get done in the future. You think about something like blockchain. You think about some of the communication systems, something called Symphony, there are bunch of them. But people are consuming data and using data and having data processed and managed internally at their firms in a way today that's different than the way they used to, right? The very basic example, think about a terminal business, like a Bloomberg or a Reuters Eikon terminal, where firms used to source most of their financial data. I'd read in the paper about a month ago, Bloomberg reported last year that they had less terminals than they had outstanding the year before. That's only the second time that has ever occurred. First time occurred in 2009 immediately following the 2008 crisis.</p><p>I don't think that's because business is bad. I think that's because there's been a fundamental shift in the way markets want to consume large amounts of data, and I think that provides a tremendous opportunity for us.</p><p>The last point is consolidation. And I think this is one for us to just keep on our radar and make sure we have our sights squarely focused on our competitors. People say imitation is the greatest form of flattery. In this case, I'd rather not be flattered, but I do see our largest competitors, Bloomberg acquiring Barclays indices, ICE acquiring IDC and the S&amp;P pricing businesses. Our competitors are increasingly wanting to move into the market space that we have lead positions in. I don't think these are competitors we haven't competed against before, but it is something for us to have on our radar and for us to keep ourselves quite sharp in making sure we leverage those customer relationships and stay ahead.</p><p>Okay. Let me take you a little bit deeper into our specific business lines. Our Information division, so we've historically broken down the financial services business into 3 divisions or 3 segments. Our Information segment, pricing indices, Ref data, equities, valuations, it's been a steady grower for many years. We expect that to continue.</p><p>These are -- we look at our strong well-positioned businesses like credit derivatives, pricing for example, and we look at how to leverage that into new businesses and new opportunities. That can be done in a number of different ways. Let me give you a couple of examples.</p><p>So fixed income pricing. This is a good one. So we've always -- at least for the last 10 years, we've had the leading product in derivatives pricing. We've had the leading product in loan pricing. But we've had smaller businesses in corporate sovereign bonds, municipal bonds. We had a product, but we weren't -- we're not the leading product by any stretch of the imagination. So we invested. We brought the quality of the product up to best-in-class. We launched a live pricing system so that you can actually see the price of a relatively illiquid security on a real-time basis anytime we believe an adjustment should be made to an evaluated price. Hopefully, some of you got a chance to look at the Markit live pricing demo that we had out in the hallway earlier today.</p><p>We provide an extensive set of data, far deeper set of data from many, many more inputs than our competitors can offer. And we've integrated those datasets into a lot of third party platforms like a BlackRock Aladdin as a good example.</p><p>Today, as a result of those efforts, we're winning large mandates with that pricing. Most of the banks, actually, every large bank is now using our pricing. We see asset managers increasingly looking at our pricing and saying, \"You know what, you're just as good or you're better than the competition.\" That's a $1 billion end market in bond pricing, of which we have a tiny fraction and we're gaining market share on a double-digit basis every year. That's the way we leverage the position into a new one. Another example, private debt and equity valuations. We're good at valuing complex illiquid securities, right? We have evaluations business that values derivatives now -- today values across asset classes globally.</p><p>We looked at that and said, \"Okay, can't we value private equity alternatives, expanding asset classes, can't we do this in those asset classes as well?\" Well, we can. About 3 years ago, we launched that business, and today, we're seeing, I'm tempted to say, triple-digit, because we're really literally doubling the business every year and winning mandates away from Duff &amp; Phelps, Houlihan Lokey, long entrenched competitors that do valuations in that space, because we can't do it better, cheaper, faster and with better results for our customers.</p><p>We're also intensely focused on partnerships. These can be complicated, because sometimes your partnerships are with your competitors. You're distributing data through their terminals. You're buying data from them and using it to create a new product that we sell elsewhere. A great example would be partnering with MSCI or RiskMetrics to put our leading data sets into their analytics tools so the customers get best-of-breed from both. Will we compete against them on the analytics one day? Yes, I believe we will. And when that day comes, we'll revisit it, and we'll then capture both pieces of that market. But between now and then, we'll make sure our data set stays at the forefront, and we'll partner with them in order to offer customers best-of-breed solution that increases the opportunity for our firm.</p><p>Our processing business. So many of the analysts in this room have probably, at many times across the last few years, looked at our processing business and talked about it as one facing regulatory headwinds or focusing on the particular volumes in that business in any given period.</p><p>I guess, my thought today would be to shift your focus around that business and get you to start thinking about it a little bit differently. These are important and critical networks. Almost all market participants in these spaces are tied into our platform, either directly or indirectly. If you're transacting in derivatives, loans, FX, you're connected to one of our platforms. That's a very powerful platform. Markets will be up and down. There'll be periods of higher volume, periods of lower volume. But our mission is not to predict or to drive volume. A lot of that is beyond our control. But our mission is to make sure that we continually expand those platforms deeper into customer workflows, providing them more and more services, helping them take out costs at their own firms so there's less that they need to do and more that we can automate the platform to do for them, driving down their per-transaction cost but giving us the opportunity to deliver more to them for the same value. That's how that platform grows.</p><p>We've got a bunch of key initiatives across our processing businesses. Loans is an interesting one to talk about. In the loan space, we process about 98%, 99% of all loan trades. We process them. We've looked at the functionalities in this market and said, \"What else can we do for these customers?\" Many customers have their own teams that actually engage in all the paperwork and process necessary in order to transfer a loan from one institution to another. We can outsource that entirely and take over that entire process for them. It's been a great area of growth for us.</p><p>The loan transaction platform itself. This is a place, if you've read about it or are involved in this industry, you know this is a prime area for the application of blockchain. Any kind of transaction or securities processing, prime area for application of blockchain or distributed ledger technologies. That's something for us, as the leader in the space who understands the workflows, has the deep industry expertise, to figure out how can you actually apply a technology to something that people are already doing and have invested tremendous dollars to make work, right? We are the ones positioned well to help deliver forward a new technology, a more efficient way, a more capable platform that can do even more for those customers. And that's exactly where we concentrate our efforts, around new technologies like that.</p><p>We're looking at the broader FX workflow. FX is a huge market, highly fragmented. No one has yet really tied together FX pre-trade, post-trade workflows. We're working on it. And we're working with customers to find which pieces we can pull together to offer an efficient and effective solution for them.</p><p>Okay. Let me talk to you a little bit about our solutions businesses. So this is a quite diverse set of businesses, and I'm going talk about a few of them. And I know when I get back to the office tomorrow, I'm going to get many comments from those who run the businesses that I didn't talk about today, as to why we're not interested in those businesses anymore. That is not the case. But there are 12 reflected on this slide. There are actually more than that, so if I took you through all of them, we'd be here for quite a while.</p><p>But let me talk about a few of them. What do they have in common? Okay. What they have in common is they take the vast set of proprietary content that we have or other data sets that our customers need to use and they help customers make sense of it. Right? Help them make a decision. Help them understand what is actually in their firm. How do they comply with the regulation? That's what our solutions business does.</p><p>So think about things like our CTI Tax offering. This is the leading system for collecting, understanding all of the tax compliance requirements that a firm may face. Our corporate actions service, processing the many changes in corporate issuers so that a firm understands what has happened in a particular issue -- issuer of whose security that they hold. Think about our -- think about our enterprise data management platform, I mentioned it earlier, award-winning for many years. Now customers can take that on an enterprise-deployed basis, an installed piece of software or use it in a hosted application, where all the data that comes into that firm, all the different prices of securities, reference data around those securities can be collected into one place, you understand the provenance of that data, where it came from, who's changed it, who's touched it. And then distribute it out through that firm, know where it's gone, who's using it for what, and you create what's called a golden record. So you know that when you quote a price through your firm, using the same price all the time. You're not using 4 different prices from 4 different sources.</p><p>Think about our Markit Digital business. Right? This is a world-leading web design building and hosting business. You might not know Markit Digital, but you definitely know Charles Schwab, you definitely know Fidelity, you know TD Ameritrade, you know Merrill Edge. You know E*TRADE. When you log in to many of those online brokerages, you're actually logging in to us. We manage the entire front end and all of the data that sits behind it.</p><p>Counterparty Manager. Not a name that would be obvious -- be obvious to probably anyone in the room as to what it does. So when people trade derivatives, they enter into something called a standard ISDA agreement, right? It's just an underlying master agreement that says, \"Here's the rules on which the stuff we agreed to is going to work.\" Things happen in the world, and industry convention of how certain events are treated can change. And the industry agrees, \"Okay, we're going to change that.\" But then you have hundreds of market participants, all of whom have that standard ISDA agreement in place, and you have to go out and revise that agreement for all of them. We created a product called ISDA Amend, which allowed all of the players in that market through one electronic platform to update the form of ISDA that they had in place with each other. It's the kind of solution that comes from -- the product originally was designed to do some different things, but that's the kind of solution that we build for our customers by understanding the markets that they work in.</p><p>So like our other product areas, our solutions businesses do fall into 2 groups. There are quite large, established market-leading businesses, right? Many of the ones I mentioned before. WSO is a loan portfolio management system. The leading system used by, if not all, virtually all loan market participants. We also have emerging opportunities, right? We have places where we see tremendous opportunity and a real -- tremendous opportunity financially for us to grow something that's valuable, but also tremendous opportunity for our customers to take a process that they're doing internally, each one of them separately at significant cost, and for us to do it once centrally at a much lower cost to each customer and a much higher level of quality across the group. Right? KY3P is a good example of that. I think -- again, there's a demo out, hopefully, you all got a chance to see it. This is taking vendor management away from each individual institution going out to each individual vendor separately, going with their cyber questionnaire and their due diligence process, and us finding the way to do it once at a best-of-breed, best-in-class way, and deliver it out to all of the institutions that are engaged with that vendor. It's great for the vendor. It's great for the institutions that are engaging those vendors. I'm going to skip some of the others, and I'm just going to come down to that bottom right corner, because I think it's interesting. And Lance talked about it earlier, and actually I think everybody that's been on the stage has talked about it.</p><p>This new -- the new-generation data infrastructure and analytics. And here again, I think of it in 2 very important prongs. Prong 1 is a little less exciting, a little less headline-grabbing, but actually not that much less exciting. Prong 1 is doing things in a new way and understanding how to apply technology to data sets. We have enormous proprietary data sets. But the application of machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data technologies. Right? for us, the ability to ingest, process and then deliver out to our customers data in the most efficient, most technologically advanced way. It cuts costs dramatically for us internally and in terms of what we can afford our customers. It allows us to integrate extremely quickly into any system that our customers are using, and I think gives us that competitive edge.</p><p>The second, maybe the more headline-grabbing. Imagine taking all of this proprietary data set that we have. Again, as Lance has described, think about the location and travel of ships. The level of oil production in the world. Economic forecasting. Some of you may have seen the ECR demonstration out there, where for every 500 square miles on the globe, we have an assessment of political, economic and terrorist activity risk. Movements in currency. The supply chain in the automotive industry, credit spreads in companies that operate in those space, the pricing of credit instruments for the companies that operate in that space. Put it all in one place, build analytics against it, let customers see what's in that data and that can be useful for them in their decision-making. That's a very, very powerful combination of information when you think about how each of those pieces could affect the other. That's the power and the scale of the IHS Markit merger and our vision of what comes forward.</p><p>Okay. I will wrap up. I still have no cool pictures of airplanes or cars or iPhones being taken apart. They are coming, though, I promise, right after the break. But I do have a very fun set of businesses that I work with. And what makes them the most fun is I do think that our best opportunities are still in front of us.</p><p>How are we going to do it? We're going to continue to innovate and improve these products. Where we are the leading product, we're going to increase our lead. Right? And we're going to increase our lead by making those products even better, giving a deeper data set, having a more flexible commercial model, doing things for the customer that's important for them and understanding where their pain points are. We're going to not ignore what's happening outside the company, right? The trends that we see in the marketplace, we do think they're very favorable, and we think it's up to us to get aggressively in front of those wins and let them help drive us.</p><p>We're going to harness the power of technology. I can't mention Yaacov. I guess I just did, because it's been too many times. But it is worth mentioning. And it's not just Yaacov. It's a team of hundreds of incredible technologists, and between 15 and 30 years of experience, understanding how to apply technology to the kinds of complex data sets. I mean, many of our data sets are not just numbers. These can be quite unstructured data sets. But understanding how to apply expertise to those data sets and deliver something to customers that they've never really seen before.</p><p>And of course, last and most important, staying close to those customers, right? We've worked very hard and very long to build a set of relationships that I do think takes decades to build. We're going to continue to leverage that. And I'd hope, 10 years from now, we're standing here, and that list of 3,000 is -- the list of 50,000 is 100,000, and the depths of relationships we have with those customers as a trusted partner is even greater.</p><p>With that, I think you're all entitled to a break.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: 15-minute break.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: If we can get seated, we'll get back at it with Jonathan in 2 minutes.</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: Great. Okay, listen, we'll welcome you back again. Hope you had a great break. I'm now going to kick off the second part of our show today and cover now the next 2 segments, our resources followed by consolidated markets and solutions. And I'll kick it off with an overview of resources. So the couple key -- as I kick off and talk to you about resources. A couple key things that I'd love to leave you with. One is we have an incredibly strong position with our information, our analytics and our insight across the entire energy value chain. So we're extremely well positioned. Now if you peel back the road of energy the last 3 years, it's been a very Dickinsonian tale of 2 cities. And within our downstream and power markets, it's been a great story. You've seen strong, high single-digit organic growth rates. However, that's being dwarfed and impacted by challenges, by the macro challenges in our larger segment upstream. So we'll go ahead and talk through what we've seen particularly in the upstream segment. Now the good news is, as we see the stabilization taking place right now in the upstream markets and, as Jerre mentioned, with the CapEx spend and upstream beginning to come back, it gives us a lot of confidence that we'll see this segment, which has historically been an incredible driver of growth, return to once again being a contributor to organic growth.</p><p>So this is a very brief and extremely simple overview of the energy industry, and I'll break it into 3 buckets. So it starts with upstream, this green box on the left. That's all the activities around exploring and developing and producing hydrocarbon assets. The next section is the chemicals and oil refining, which we'll call downstream for today, and that is the production of those crude oil into either oil-refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel oil, jet fuel oil or production into chemical products, both chemical commodities and high-value chemical specialty products. And then the third piece is power markets around here, around power generation and then other sources of fuel into power generation such as coal and renewables. So we'll break it into, again, upstream, downstream and power.</p><p>This is a real quick chart, just kind of our secret decoder ring. Because in the past, we talked about resources being made up of energy, chemicals and OPIS. And just to map it, our chemicals and our OPIS solutions, OPIS is our pricing solutions around refined oil products, those map into downstream energy, which is the bulk of our business, maps across the entire energy value chain. But again, my focus today is going to be talking about upstream, downstream and power. And primarily focus on upstream, because that's where a lot of the dynamics are taking place right now.</p><p>So this is the story in Resources segment the last few years. And again, just as a reminder, historically, this has been a tremendous driver of growth for IHS Markit over the years. That has not been the case the last 3 years.</p><p>Now the chart on the right really explains why. And while we've had very strong growth and performance in our relatively small power segment and our downstream segment's been growing very high single digits, that has been counteracted by the challenges caused by the macro conditions, which I think we're all aware of, this impacted our upstream business.</p><p>Now the one thing I will say, and we'll show this in a little bit. While -- when you look at the upstream business, on an absolute basis, it certainly hasn't performed how we would like it to. It's has come down, but it has been remarkably resilient. And we'll show you in a while the chart of what's happened to CapEx and then the relatively lower impact it's had on our upstream business. The other thing I'll call out is the impact we've had on our contribution margin and even during a time of challenging negative organic revenue growth in this segment, we still have managed to drive EBITDA margin. And just a quick comment on that because I do sometimes get questions on this. There's often -- or there can be a concern, is this -- are we cutting too much? Or is this -- are these costs going to flow back in as revenue comes back into upstream?</p><p>And so I'll break it down into these 3 levers. The first lever we pulled was around driving internal efficiencies within our energy business. And that was primarily around using lower-cost centers, best-cost centers, it was around using more technology to drive efficiency improvements, delayering in our business, primarily affected our support of our subscription products. And as that recovers, we would expect very minimal, if any, additional investment there.</p><p>The second bucket is around the savings we've seen from our corporate services and our reduction in corporate cost, really, as a result of the merger of Markit and IHS coming together. That, of course, we're going to bank that and pocket that. The only piece which I would see some slight additional investment would be around our one-times. This is primarily our consulting and, to a degree, the implementation services -- or rather software products. As the demand for those came down, we did take out capacity. As the demand goes up, and we are seeing signs right now of consulting demand indeed going back up, we likely will need a little more cost coming back in. But to give an order of magnitude, that's less than 10% of the total revenues across resources.</p><p>So quick thing, looking across the value chain. We are in an incredibly strong position and truly are the leading provider of information, analytics and insight and research across the value chain. And when I look at this chart, there are 2 things I would want to point out and really leave with you. The first is, within a segment such as upstream, we start with the world's leading technical database, and I'll explain that in a few slides, incredibly strong foundational information and proprietary data. And that then feeds and leverages into our analytic tools and into our insight, research and consulting solutions. So just within that upstream bucket, we had an extremely strong position. Now the other thing I will call out is our way that we're able to truly, uniquely connect the entire value chain. All the way from upstream to downstream and to power and also into those end markets. And that example I gave on the great project that Dan Yergin is leading with reinventing the wheel. No one, no one else is able to connect the dots like we are across the value chain of energy.</p><p>So we have great set of assets and capabilities that support this industry. It starts with people, over 1,500 dedicated energy experts. They range from people like Dan, who is one of our most uber, uber, uber experts that we have in the world of energy. Also includes one of our data experts sitting in Bangalore, the petroleum engineer who is ingesting all the raw content we have on the technical information, using our tools to enhance it, cleanse it, collate it and create the leading energy database in the world. So incredible set of colleagues. We have almost everyone in the world of energy. Any large company in the world of energy is likely to be a client of IHS Markit. 49 of the largest 50, as -- Jerre, as you said in your remarks, the only one we don't have is the national oil company of Iran. We're not going to have them. All the large independents, all the large refiners, and here in North America, jobbers, people who buy and sell refined oil products. So incredibly, incredibly deep customer relationships. And supporting that are just, again, an incredible set of assets, ranging from our data assets to our analytical assets to our insight and research.</p><p>And I'm going to talk on this slide. Now this is my other favorite slide I have in the world of IHS Markit. And it may look a little bit complicated, but I love this slide because it really explains what we do for the industry and why what we do is so absolutely critical for our clients. And I'm guessing not all of you are petroleum engineers or reservoir engineers. So before I dive into this, I'm going to give a different analogy. We're getting close to summertime. Many of us will go on to a vacation with their family, friends or loved ones, and we might go to a new place. So I imagine, when you head off to that new place, you want a map. You want to know where you're going. You think about the city. You want to know where the roads are. You want to know where the hotels are you're going to stay at, where the restaurants are, where the attractions are. You may even want some insight to know which are the good restaurants, you may use TripAdvisor; which are the good hotels. Now imagine a world where that didn't exist. Imagine you're going to visit Timbuktu and you know absolutely nothing about that place and there's no information about that place. That would not be a happy world for you as a traveler. We provide the similar type of map and insight underground for the geologists and geoscientists who explore, develop and produce hydrocarbon assets.</p><p>Now to give you an idea why this is so important. This is why, again, I love this slide, this technicolor slide. The layers going across here are an example of geologic layers underground. The cracks, for example, those are cracks and fissures and fractures you might find underground. And this is important for a geologist, the geoscientist, because hydrocarbons are trapped at different points of those layers and fractures. And we provide the map that help energy companies know where those are. So imagine now that you're drilling a new well. This is an offshore well, maybe in deepwater. That's a $1 billion dollar investment. You want to make sure you're using our database to know you are drilling appropriately here where the hydrocarbons are and not drilling over here and missing it. As you're developing that well and going down, there's an example right here, and moving to horizontal drilling, you want our knowledge and data and insight to know where to begin to shift that horizontal well to, again, best maximize the asset that you're developing. And finally, as you're producing that asset, and as that well begins to deplete, you need the knowledge or the understanding of what that asset looks like underground to know what type of sand to use, what volume of chemicals to use, so on and so forth, to maximize the production from that very, very expensive and valuable asset. So it truly is mission-critical information.</p><p>Second takeaway is, why are we so proud of our database? We've been doing this for decades and decades and decades. We have, by far, the world's largest and most comprehensive database on technical energy information. We've been building it, again, for decades and decades. And one of the things that I love most about this database and this information, the information never ever gets old. The information from that well log drilled in Western Pennsylvania 100 years ago is as important and valuable today as a well log drilled in the Permian Basin yesterday. It never gets old. We have the best. So if you are exploring, producing or developing assets or thinking about investing in areas that have assets, you absolutely need this content. And we have the world's best by far.</p><p>So I'll give just a couple of examples, because I think I've already given an example of how a technical person might use this content. I'll give another real-life example. We had -- for upstream strategy, we had a client come to us a couple years ago. Their board had asked them to develop a 10-year plan, and that board had set targets. Had set production targets, had set targets on the amount of reserves they wanted that company to have. But that executive team looked at their own assets, did their own projections, knew what they could develop from those assets, and they knew there was a gap. They're a client of ours and using our Vantage tool connected to our technical database tool and our other insight. They were able to identify, based upon the type of technology that they had, the type of assets around the world that were applicable to that technology, the ownership of those assets, so people whom they knew they could deal with, they were able to build a bridge and take that back to the board and say, here is how we're going to bridge that gap and meet those 10-year production targets.</p><p>Another example I'll give on the other spectrum, and we had a demo here from OPIS, which, again, is our pricing service of unrefined fuel products. If you're a jobber in North America, your job is to buy and deliver gasoline, diesel fuels. You're buying things at a terminal, at a refinery terminal, a refinery rack or terminal. You're then taking that gasoline product, delivering it to a service station. You're often entering a long-term contract, and you want to make sure you're pricing it at an appropriate market price. You need a benchmark. They're using our OPIS benchmark in their contracts to price and execute contracts. And one thing is we can't prove this, but our OPIS team believes it, is that almost every gallon of refined fuel in North America at some point in its life cycle is bought or sold using an OPIS benchmark.</p><p>Now moving on to upstream. I'm going to talk about the challenging world we've lived in the last couple of years. This shows the oil price since 2013. Now [a call out] for 4 phases over this. The first was in 2013, oil price up above $100 a barrel. One thing I will call out there, that was largely hidden, even at those high prices, our clients were facing significant profitability challenges driven by excessive costs in the supply chain and inefficiencies in the supply chain. But that was Phase 1. Phase 2 in 2014 as production from North America, driven by unconventional production, came onstream. We saw supply begin to ramp up, oil prices began to come on down. I think about that as the $65-ish time era for oil prices. Then the next phase started on Thanksgiving Day of 2014. And it was a momentous day in the world of oil and gas. That was the day that OPEC announced they were going to stop being OPEC. They were going to allow markets to decide the price of oil. They were going to stop regulating production, and that started phase 3, all the way through '15 into Q1 of '16, when it was the complete capitulation of oil prices. And I remember being with Dan at CERAWeek in early Q1 of 2016. It was not a happy place to be. We had to take all sharp objects away from the facility to keep our clients from killing themselves. It was a very, very challenging time.</p><p>But now we've entered phase 4. And phase 4 is all about stability. And what we're seeing right now, what we ourselves are forecasting is oil price hovering in the s$50 this year and next year. And it's that stability is what the industry needs. Now oil prices are always interesting. It catches a lot of headlines. This is what really mattered -- matters and matter to us. This shows the CapEx in upstream E&amp;P. And from 2014 to 2016, you see what happened. A massive and unprecedented collapse in CapEx spending. Essentially was cut in half over a 2-year period.</p><p>So these were tough times, weren't fun times. So if that all sounds like bad news, it was bad news. It was a very challenging time for our clients and for our industry. But this is the good news. This shows CapEx spend and what we're forecasting to see the next few years. And what we're seeing, we're already seeing evidence of it right now, is a very slow and steady recovery in CapEx. And what you'll see is -- hope you can see on this chart, is that blue line in the middle, the growth there, that's the CapEx being invested into North America, primarily unconventionals, and that's what's driving a lot of this recovery.</p><p>And 3 things I would call out in particular that gives us some confidence on this recovery. The first is we're seeing, again, stable oil prices. And we don't -- the industry doesn't need $100 a barrel, it needs stability in the oil prices. Number two we're seeing is much lower cost. And in the blood-letting of the last 2 years through both extremely strong cost rationalization and enhanced use of technology, the energy industry has become much, much more efficient. So when we looked at the marginal cost back in 2013, 2014 here in North America, and unconventionals, we're looking at marginal cost up in the 60s or higher for producing unconventionals. Now we're looking at it in the 40s, 50s, in some cases, 30s. There's been a massive amount of efficiency driven into upstream markets. And the final piece is a long-term issue. The industry under-invested the last couple of years. Now it had to. Companies were fighting for their lives, but they did under-invest. And at our CERAWeek event this year had a chance to, on the Monday event, we had a great panel led by Dan, and we had the head of OPEC and the head of IEA up on this panel. It's a great panel. Because you think about OPEC kind of representing all the producing nations of this world, IEA representing all that consumers, the consuming nations of this world. Always fun to get them together. And what was interesting, as I watched them speak, is the common thread they had is that the industry must start investing again, or we're going to face a supply challenge in a couple years' time. And that was a common theme certainly from CERAWeek this year, and we're seeing that happen right now. So we see the CapEx again slowly but consistently improving over the next few years.</p><p>So now I'm going to talk quickly and a little bit about what happened to our clients, what we saw with our client base the last few years and what we're seeing now with the turnaround and the recovery. So I broke it in 2 buckets. I'll talk first about the core energy industry. So NOCs are national oil companies; IOCs, integrated oil companies, large independents and small independents. Now as the market came down, obviously, there are 2 things we saw, one not surprising, one relatively new for us this year or this cycle. On the not-surprising side, so we saw the usual stuff. We saw all discretionary spend either canceled or postponed as much as possible. So that, to us, affects our one-time businesses, our consulting, software sales, software maintenance. We saw the small independents, and this is very much a North America phenomena, we saw them leave. And this is what they do. When the market comes down, they go to Cabo for 2 years, they take time off. I mean, I have a buddy of mine in Denver. He's a small independent. He went to Vegas for 2 years. Literally went to Vegas for 2 years. So we saw that happen. So that is pretty typical.</p><p>Now what we saw that was unusual, and speaks to the depth of this downturn last year, is what happened with the larger players. And these are players, these independents, NOCs -- now NOCs know everything they need to know about their home country. But as they look to invest overseas in other countries, that's where they come to us. And with IOCs, we saw them retrench out of regions completely.</p><p>And while you certainly need our information and data and analytics, if you're operating or thinking about operating into a region, if you pull out completely, you don't need it. And that's where we saw the effect on our database to a degree we haven't seen in the past.</p><p>Now as the market recovers, what are we seeing? First, we're seeing the usual stuff. We're seeing -- my friend in Las Vegas, he's back in the game. He is a happy customer of IHS Markit once again. We're seeing an increase in consulting and one-times are coming back slowly. And we're seeing some hints around what the larger player's to do. Now the thing we focus on as our #1 leading indicator when it comes to this market coming out of this downturn is what is happening with our subscription base for our energy information data.</p><p>And that has been in a progressive decline in the last 8-plus quarters. This quarter, Q2, is the quarter we're finally seeing it stabilize. And what we're seeing with our pipeline and hear from customers, we expect to see a recovery in our subspace the second half to the year. You'll see that in revenue next year because it's a subscription product, but we are seeing the early signs of that.</p><p>And the other thing I'll mention is financial markets. And, how did they do in the downturn? As an industry, they did great. If you were an investment bank helping your client, your distressed client dispose of assets; if you were a commercial bank helping your client restructure the balance sheet; if you were a private equity firm playing the long game, buying distressed assets, this was a very, very active market. And the good news for us is our products focused on these markets, such as Performance Evaluator, which we had in the lobby today, they did great. They grew quite well in this market. The problem for us is, during this downturn, we didn't, at that point, have [Shane]. We didn't have the relationships that the market team has brought to our energy team. And so we really didn't enjoy the benefit of that segment. Financial markets to us, less than 5% of our total revenue within resources.</p><p>The great news is, we expect that market to continue to do very, very well, and we now have the benefit of all the relationships that Shane and Adam and Lance and their teams bring to support growth and accelerate the penetration in that segment.</p><p>Couple of things on -- I won't go into this in great detail other than to say it is -- even as we were very mindful of managing cost and managing margin as we came down, we still continue to invest. And I suspect, Todd, he could verify this, I think Vantage was probably our second largest investment -- single-product investment the last 3 years, because we do see and we do believe in the long-term health and benefit of this industry. In fact, I was going with Randy, we were doing a review -- Randy, our CTO of our energy software products, a few weeks ago. And coming out of it, listened to customer feedback. We looked at each other. And Randy came from [Kingdom] so he knows these assets extremely well. He said, \"These assets have never been in better shape.\" He said, \"No, they're the best they've been in the last 3 to 4 years.\" So we are very well positioned. As that recovery happens in upstream, coupled with the continued growth and investment we're seeing with our downstream products, we're going to be well positioned to enjoy the tailwinds that the recovery will provide.</p><p>So as we look at the recovery, again, what we've talked about is a return to strong mid-single-digit organic growth. And I think about it in terms of 2 lenses. One is what has to happen with downstream, with upstream. With downstream -- in fact, I really haven't given them enough credit. It has been a great performer for us the last few years, growing, again at high single-digit organic rates. There's a great external market there with CapEx flowing in to downstream assets. We have the right product set, the right information. We expect to continue to see the performance and the growth from that segment. And then, in addition, with everything I've discussed with upstream, with the stabilization and the moderate recovery -- we don't need the wild swing back. We're not going to see the wild spring back with upstream. But with the moderate recovery, the use of our enhanced products and the leverage of the great relationships that we now have in financial services, those are going to drive the growth. So in summary, for resources, we feel that we know the worst is behind us. We feel very good, very good about the path to recovery, driven by the fundamentals of the external market. And coming back, again, to the critical underlying world-leading assets that we have to support this industry.</p><p>So with that, I'm going to pivot and will cover now our last segment, consolidated markets and solutions.</p><p>So there's 2 key things on, I'll call it, CMS. Two key things on CMS. One is it's different from the other businesses that Adam and I support and that is truly end market-agnostic. We sell the CMS products into every single end market out there including financial services, including transportation, including resources. The second thing looking at the financial profile, it is a very steady Eddie low to mid-single-digit organic grower, extremely predictable with improving margins, and we'll talk about what's driving that.</p><p>So quick overview of the segment. Three different business lines: Our product design business line, which provides technical reference and knowledge management tools; our second is technology that provides component information, electronic component information and then market research and forecasting around technology products; and finally, our economic and country risk team, which, as you might imagine, has economic and country risk analysis.</p><p>Quick thing looking at the profile. So I made the statement that CMS is a very steady organic grower. And there you see this weird revenue graph over here. It bears some explanation. There is some noise in this numbers. Within our product design segment, we have a biannual product called the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code. It's a great book. Wonderful stocking stuffer for your family as it comes around. That's a biannual product, about $10 million every year, that shows up in the odd years. So '15, '17, '19, we'll get a one-time blip for that. We had some acquisitions showing up in 2015. And then also, in 2016, we went through a concerted effort to convert many of our report transactional products in our technology group from being one-time, one-off sale reports into bundling it into an ongoing subscription package. Great thing to do. We're very successful with that conversion, increases the quality of our revenue, but does cause a one-time drop in revenue as we go through that conversion. But believe me, it's a very steady single-digit organic grower.</p><p>Other thing I would call out is the margin here. We've improved this. This segment is structurally lower margin than our other segments. And that's driven by the content we have and product design, which is our largest business line. For the most part, it's third party content that we're aggregating together, bundling and reselling, and we have to pay a royalty rate on that content. So that does cause a structural dip. That being said, the teams have done a remarkable job of improving the margin from this segment, and they're continuing down the path of getting the segment up into the 30s level.</p><p>So now I'm going to move on to our largest business line within CMS, which is product design. So quick thing. So first, who do we serve? We serve technical people. It could be engineers, it could be architects, it could be civil engineer, electric engineer, sustainability engineer. Odds are, if you meet someone with the word engineer in their job title, they very likely are a customer, user or prospect for our product design solutions. And we serve engineers across a multitude of different end markets.</p><p>Now one commonality across all these technical disciplines and all these industries is the challenge and complexity around managing knowledge. And I'll call out a couple of stats here. This first one, the 40% to 50%, that is the amount of time a typical engineer, which is a high-cost position, amount of time that engineer spends just searching for technical information. In other words, that's time that, that engineer has not spent actually doing engineering work, not doing the higher-value work. Second thing I would call out is the top left, 40%, that is the growth of technical information every single year. So this challenge and complexity around gathering technical content is only getting more challenging.</p><p>And the final thing I would point out is 10 years. And that's the time period over which most senior engineers will retire and leave the workforce. And for the most part, engineers and companies are managing knowledge by keeping it in people's head. So for those engineers, they're the ones who know where they found that technical document, what type of engineering process was done, what mistakes, root cause analysis was done here and how they solved it. That's all sitting in their heads, and it's going to walk out the door when they retire. So significant challenge for our engineering communities.</p><p>Looking at our assets, I'll call out 3 things. The first are experts. Now this little fun fact, our product design team is the historical origin of legacy IHS. So we have been serving this market for almost 60 years now. Deep level of expertise around managing technical content. We have also an incredible collection of content, now this is largely third-party content, but it includes content from over 370 standard development organizations. These are organizations like ASTM, ISO, API, organizations like that. It includes organizations or content from over 10,000 technical books. And as a result, we have incredible amount of content, almost 2 million standards, almost 2 million patents that reside in the online knowledge library that we maintain for our clients.</p><p>The third piece, which we're moving into, and have moved into is around technology. And those are the tools that really enable the efficient access, management and usage of this technical content, and that's highlighted by the Engineer's Workbench, which we've rolled out the last couple of years.</p><p>So a couple of things here. I think you'll probably get a feel for how engineers use this. I'll give an example that actually might bring it home for all of us, because I think we all travel. And we've all had that experience where you board an airplane, you sit down, you're ready to go, you want to get home to your families, and suddenly, you see some activity in the front cockpit and you see the people with the orange vest get on the airplane. The dreaded maintenance workers. Then you hear the announcement from the pilot saying, \"I'm sorry. A warning light has come on. We're going to look into it.\" And you know you could be there for hours and hours. Now what happens? Behind the scenes, what happens is those maintenance workers come on. And if they look at the problem, if they've had experience, if it's simple, they can fix it there and then.</p><p>If it's not simple, where if they haven't had a experience, they have to call into the headquarters to reach back into the maintenance HQ and they help diagnose the root cause analysis. And for a typical wide-body jet, there are over 30 different manuals that they have to go to, to help identify and solve that problem. Now with our engineer's workbench, combined with that technical content, we're able to bring that all together, and so that headquarters can say describe the problem, they enter the problem, boom, it pops up here are the 6 possible causes, here is a root cause analysis you should do to allow them to quickly, quickly resolve that problem. This is a new combination that we've recently launched we're piloting with several airlines right now. But I'll tell you, as a consumer, a heavy consumer of airline travel, I can't wait till this is out there, everywhere. Quick thing on the market opportunities, now to cover this briefly, but I first focus on the stable, that is the market from the historical legacy and core of our product design team, that's around the specs and standards market, about $1 billion. And then we have growth and emerging. And this allows us as we see additional opportunities for additional content, and in particular, additional tools that help manage and deliver that content. And if you look at the growth profile of this, the core market that we're in right now is fairly stable. It grows 2% to 5%. Really, think about that being driven by GDP, maybe the number of engineers in the world, but fairly steady. The markets we're moving into are higher, higher growth. There are also higher margins. As you move, there you will see some benefit. The only caution I'll say is the vast majority of our revenue today, it still sits within that stable market and likely will continue for a few years to come. We do continue to innovate the product and the key theme and the key message within product design in the last few years has been the continued execution and roll out of our engineer's workbench, which again brings together all the content with the additional tools on top of it. Hopefully, you had a chance to see it today. That will continue to roll out to be the engine of growth, important for our clients, as it drives efficiency; important for our content partners, as it helps maximize the penetration of the content; and of course, important for us, as it drives revenue and margin growth. So just to wrap up here for product design, 3 drivers of growth: first and foremost, our largest portion of our business around the stable specs and standards that will just continue to grow at a very, very steady rate. We'll enhance that with additional content through examples such as our knowledge collection and then the additional growth levers around the roll out of Engineering Workbench.</p><p>I'm now going to just briefly wrap up with our final 2 business lines. So first with technology, 3 core capabilities within technology are components and supply chain intelligence, our market analysis for technology products, both on Consumer Markets as well as industrial markets; and finally, analytics driven by the RootMetrics acquisition that we did focus on the telecom industry. And just to give one example of what we have here, within our components capabilities, we have the largest database of electronic components in the world. We track over $500 million different components, for each one of those components, over 40 different attributes, [to be where is it] produce, the size, number of prongs it has, the material on it, so on, so forth. Incredibly important and useful for both product planning, for procurement purposes, for competitive reasons also. On the financial profile, this has been an interesting one. It has been a low single-digit grower for us, but it has been improving in the last couple of years. Likewise, it had been in lower margins. Those margins have improved dramatically in the last couple of years. Key drivers here, first, is we continue to leverage the technology into our other end markets. And again, think about when I discuss automotive and the role of technology in automotive end-markets, how important this capability is into that end market. We've largely gone through the conversion of the 1x from -- again, one-time, one-off reports into bundled subscription packages. That will drive both much more predictable growth and also lower our cost of sales. And again, with Adam and Shane and his team, this becomes something we can penetrate into financial markets.</p><p>I'll tell you a quick story. Last Saturday morning, I was at the field, watching my 14-year-old son play flag football and the phone rang. And it was a guy who ran a technology-based private equity firm and he got my number through a friend of a friend. And they were in the process of selling a company, one of their portfolio companies, and they desperately needed 1 of our -- 4 of our market forecast reports. And he called me because he needed right there, right then, couldn't wait till Monday, and it had kind of tracked me down through his network, so we of course closed the sale, got it all done. But to me, this is an example of how little we have done in the financial markets. This is someone who sought us out, sought me down personally, reached out to me on a Saturday. And when I think about the relationships we have through legacy market, through our financial markets team, this is the type of products and solutions that we can accelerate our growth into that sector.</p><p>Finally, I'm going to wrap with really our coolest business line, which is economics and country risk. Couple of things on this. First, it is the only business line that clearly describe what it does. It is economic analysis, country risk analysis, and it does it at the global level, the country level, the regional level, subregional level and industry level. It is absolutely foundational for all the research and forecasting that we do across all of our end markets. And my favorite little fact about this is IHS Markit -- at IHS Markit, we have more economists on our staff than any organization in the world apart from the Word Bank and the IMF. So we're strong #3. These people were so much fun to hang got within 2008, 2009, you have no idea. There's a great set of capabilities. And this has been a rock solid performer growing kind of mid- to low single digits organically, but this more than anything else we have, we see the opportunities with Adam and Shane and their team to further penetrate financial markets with this capability.</p><p>So with that, I'm going to wrap up on CMS and pass it over to Todd in a second here. So again, the key themes with CMS, think of it as a very solid, very predictable performer. We expect to continue to leverage these capabilities that we have across all of our end markets. And with that, let me welcome Todd. As he comes up, Todd and I joined within 3 weeks of each other 12 years ago.</p><p>TODD S. HYATT, CFO AND EVP, IHS MARKIT LTD.: 13.</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: 13 years ago?</p><p>TODD S. HYATT: 13 years ago.</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: Within 3 weeks. It's great to have you up here.</p><p>TODD S. HYATT: Great to be here, Jonathan. Great job.</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: Thank you.</p><p>TODD S. HYATT: You know Jonathan ran the Leadville Trail 100 race. I paced him for 28 miles of it. But I got to tell you, 2 segments of this presentation, that's a marathon activity, so very well done. Great set up by the business leaders, walking through the assets that we have, the market position, the businesses, products, customer relationships. We are very well positioned as a company. The future strategy that Lance laid out -- I guess, I get the easy part because I get to go through the financial profile, the financial model and also our capital allocation strategy. So with that, let's get started. This is a slide that I think people who have been to this Investor Day have seen before. It's the virtuous cycle. It's the business model. And we have a great business model. Markit had a great business model. You put them together, it is a very strong model. Starts with the top line. It's anchored with recurring revenue growth, resilient revenue, a must-have product offerings, deep customer relationships, that provides a level of consistency and stability to our operations. We also convert revenue at a very high rate into profit. So high margin generation, \"build once sell many times\" model, substantial level of operating leverage. And Lance talked about the mid-40s margin target over the next 4 to 5 years. And so we have a lot of runway in terms of the margin opportunity as a company. We're a very strong cash converter. We convert cash in the mid-60s relative to adjusted EBITDA, and that provides the substantial level of capital and flexibility in terms of our ability to invest in the business, to return capital to shareholders and support the future growth operations of the company. So great foundational business model. We bring the 2 companies together, merge the companies, and we've now created additional levers, additional opportunities to drive higher combined growth and return. And both Jerre and Lance hit on this, but I'll hit on it again. We now have 3 scaled verticals in very attractive end markets. When we look at those end markets, a high propensity to consume information and very deep customer relationships in those end markets. Also, a level of diversity in terms of the revenue that provides the ability to drive growth in different business cycles. In terms of synergies, and Jerre talked about the synergies in some detail, but revenue, expense, the tax synergy as well. So we go through those synergies, we've targeted $100 million exiting year 3 and a lot of progress in a very short period of time, relative to revenue synergies. We have a building pipeline. We have engaged teams, I think, with the legacy market, Account Manager program, we have an organizational layer that brings us deep relationships into financial services. So good progress in terms of revenue synergies. From an expense synergy standpoint, we targeted $125 million by year 3. As Jerre said, we're ahead of the year 1 target. We've been very aggressive in terms of expense synergies. And as Lance said, this provides us the financial flexibility that we need to both drive margin and also invest in the future strategy of the company, very important points. The tax rate. We have a very efficient tax structure. Pre-merger, both of the legacy companies had adjusted tax rates, 29%, 30%. The combined company adjusted tax rate, low to mid-'20s. Real economics that we bring to the company in terms of our capital. So we move to the capital substantial level of scale. We now generate capacity of over $1.2 billion a year. Importantly, we have tax-efficient access to capital on a global basis, once again, provides a substantial level of flexibility. And then as we move to return, we now have the ability to both support the future growth opportunities of the company, invest in future acquisitions and also return capital to shareholders. And we saw that with the $2.2 billion buyback commitment that we made for 2017 and 2018 at the time of the merger. So in terms of revenue, starting with the top line, and Jerre had this slide in his deck as well. But it is important to look at this and see just the consistency of the revenue delivery. And this looks at the combined profile of the 2 companies for the last 5 years, 11% total annualized revenue growth, a good mix of acquisitive and organic growth. And really, the linchpin of this, as I said earlier, is the recurring revenue. So 84% of our revenue is recurring. Generally, renewal relationships, they renew at a very high level. And they provide customer relationships that give us opportunity to drive deeper penetration of other products. When we look at the organic revenue growth, we see 5% to 6% for 2012 through 2014 and organic revenue moderated in '15 and '16, really because of 2 factors. And Jonathan talked about this at length, the energy market headwinds. And also in that period of time, in legacy market, we had the derivative processing headwinds as well. Having said that, Adam talked about the business opportunity that we have around processing because of the connectivity that we have within that franchise. Jonathan talked about energy, and I'll talk a little bit more about it in a moment, but starting to see stabilization in energy. Another view of revenue. This is a segment view. And when we look at segments, think of customers. Because these segments, the 3 scaled segments, deep customer relationships, the statistics Jerre provided, but we have 85% of the Fortune 500 are customers. 2/3 of our revenue comes from top 1,000 customers. So while we don't have massive concentration in a single customer, we have a great profile of customers. And these large relationships provide us opportunity to drive further sell of additional products into existing relationships that we have. I thought Adam did a great job of talking about the way we nurture and build our relationships with customers, but very important component of our strategy. Look over the 3 years, Jerre went through this. We're basically at the long-term target in every segment other than Resources. So Resources, 3% annual decline over the last 3 years. I'll talk more about that in a moment, but bottom line in terms of simple math is, in a stable market, coupled with the investments that we're making, a very clear opportunity to be at the long-term growth target and drive to the top end of that target. Won't spend long on this chart, but this is a good summary chart of everything that Adam and Jonathan talked about. They both did a terrific job of doing a pretty deep dive on each of their segments. This lays it out on a single chart, but financials anchored by information, the pricing reference data, transportation, innovation and automotive, 80% of that segment, I'll talk more about resources in a moment, and then CMS really anchored by this very stable not very exciting product design business. But I think we are doing interesting things in that area that will drive future growth. So I would be remiss without talking about energy. Because over the last 2 years, I have been asked thousands of questions about energy. Jonathan did -- he did a great job going through this, but I'll probably reiterate much of what he said. But we have confidence in the growth of our energy business. And that confidence is really based on several factors. Starts with the fact that we have a great energy franchise. Assets that are high-quality assets, best in market and critical to energy operations, the well and production data, a must have for exploration, development and production. We have a research and advisory franchise, thought leadership position in energy that's as good as anyone. We see that every year with the CERAWeek event, Jamie and Dan's event, but very impressive. So very strong thought leadership position. The energy franchise historically has been a very strong consistent grower. So at the very top right-hand side of the chart, this shows energy growth from 2008 on an annual basis. If we were to chart this from time of IHS IPO through 2008, the growth rates would be high single, low double digits. But what we saw was 2008, 2009, the very sharp decline with the Great Recession, but as Jerre said before, think of that as a \"V\". So it went down, came back up. In 2011, '12, '13, we saw energy performing at the high single, low double-digit range for that period of time. Then the downturn that we've seen -- and this downturn has been more of a U. And I think we've consistently talked about it as a U, and I know Jerre has in multiple meetings that we've been at. And so we see certainly a more impactful downturn and impact on our business. Importantly though, when you look at the negative growth rates, the negative 5 and the negative 11 for '15 and '16 performing much better than the energy industry. So we see the energy industry down 36%, down 20%. So it speaks to the resilience of the business. And now what we see is, we see stability. And we see stability in terms of the pricing of energy, which Jonathan talked about, the price per barrel in stabilizing, in the mid- to upper-50s as we move to 2018, but in the low 50s at this point in time. And importantly, we see the capital spending. So upper left-hand side of the chart shows the capital spending, same information that Jonathan had, see capital spending going up in '17, going up again in '18. And then the final factor is we've cycled through our customer accounts. We've cycled through our customer accounts multiple times. We have clear line of sight and visibility into our customers. And these strategic changes that they've made, that Jonathan spoke about, is they adjusted their coverage. They adjusted their investment. Those have really essentially been absorbed by us at this point in time. So on the Q1 call, we called the bottom of energy from our perspective. We expect to see a flat, subbase or net sells activity level in Q2. We expect modest growth in the back half of the year, and that really positions us to have positive energy growth as we move into 2018. So let's move to margin expansion, and this is part of our value story. We have runway to drive margin. When we look at 2016, on a reported basis, margin, 36.1%; on a combined, put both companies together and come up with a normalized margin, 37.3%, so we have runway into the mid-40s. That provides a substantial value lever for the company. For the current year, we've guided to 300 points of margin expansion on a reported basis, over 200 points on a normalized basis. And as we reported Q1, we were on track to that target, and we feel good about how we're positioned to deliver to that target for the year. Longer term, when we think about margin, we have an ability to drive into the mid-40s. And because of the operating leverage from the business model and also the synergies that we have -- and that will provide the ability to deliver margin expansion and also invest in the business. So left-hand side of the chart really shows the relationship between revenue growth and cost and its impact on margin. So this 4% to 6% revenue growth level and maintaining a cost structure at a 2%-type cost increase level, we drive to the 100 points of margin expansion. So that's sort of a natural element of the model. I get questions from investors, and they say, what's the most important determinant of margin? It's revenue growth, right. And this shows that there is a natural ability for the model to deliver margin, as we see revenue growth. And that's because we have substantial operating leverage. And there's not a significant level of incremental cost that's required to drive additional revenue growth. We also have a number of levers that we've been executing relative to the cost structures. These were things, I think, that both companies were doing premerger. But as part of the merger, as part of the synergy, they really have become programs in the company. So the best cost locations, very important part of what we're doing to create a better cost footprint. In terms of the infrastructure investments, we talked about the salesforce.com, the workday implementations, those are going to let us be more efficient in terms of our self support organizations, our sales organization and in terms of how we provide support to our employees throughout the company. The shared services facilities, we've consolidated 20-plus locations, substantial cost from that. We have more opportunities in front of us. And I got to tell you, I was in the New York office earlier this week, the energy level, when you bring these people together, it really creates more than the cost savings. It actually creates business momentum. Product platform, so Yaacov got a lot of callouts earlier today. I'll give a callout to Randy Harvey, our CTO. Because as Yaacov is doing all of the cool stuff on the innovation, Randy is going to be taking cost out through product platforms and through the data ingest systems as the CTO, and then continued management simplification and delayering. So I say this often, but at the end of the day, it's all about cash. We're a great cash flow converter. So we can maintain a mid-60s cash flow conversion rate. In 2016, cash conversion was 50% reported, significant level of merger and acquisition-related costs, 64% on a normalized basis. We've guided the high-50s to low-60s for this year. We'll have some additional acquisition-related cost this year. But on the right, I've laid out the consumers of cash and our ability to manage those items. So the primary usage of cash between adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow is capital spend. This year 7% to 8% of revenue, a bit elevated from what we would expect to see in the future, given investments that we're making in facilities and infrastructure. So we'll bring that down a 0.5% or 1% over time. So stay within this level that you see on the chart. Interest, this is operating within our current leverage structure. We'll maintain interest at this level, a very efficient tax structure for the company. Best way to think about cash tax is our cash tax should correlate with GAAP tax. Think of it as being GAAP tax plus 20% to 25%. So big, big difference being that the amortization or purchase price intangibles isn't deductible for cash tax purposes. But we'll maintain cash tax at the 6% to 7% level. And then working capital, we actually generate cash as we grow the business. Also, very focused on the share count, very aggressive on the buyback and very focused on managing dilution. We want to drive higher adjusted earnings and higher free cash flow per share. So this chart illustrates at the committed buyback level, the share count for 2017 and for 2018. So for '17, we've guided to the 413 million to 417 million. For 2018, we would expect to see share count below 400 million shares. In terms of dilution, we're managing our stock-based comp. We're bringing down the level of RSUs to 1% of outstanding shares in 2018, which will reduce that level to 4 million. We're also focused on managing the legacy market options. So we recognized that as our share price goes up, there is dilution from the options. And we've been aggressively buying back in order to offset that dilutive impact. And over time, as those options are exercised, we'll see the dilutive impact start to reduce. In terms of guidance, we're reaffirming 2017 guidance at a top line organic revenue of 2% to 4%; adjusted EBITDA, $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion; margin at the midpoint, 39.4%; adjusted EPS, $2.02 to $2.08. Do expect to see interest expense elevated a bit from this guidance range, given the aggressiveness that we've been moving forward with the buyback and also the capital market debt offering in Q1, but fully expect to manage within the adjusted EPS range.</p><p>So moving to the capital strategy and return. And this is a fun area to talk about. But in terms of the financial policy, the postmerge financial policy is consistent really with the historic approach of both companies. We are going to maintain gross leverage at 2x to 3x target range. We'll operate more toward the higher end of that, given our aggressiveness around the buyback. To the extent that we exceed that leverage for strategic opportunity at some point in the future, we would rapidly delever. We'll balance acquisitions and share repurchase within the stated leverage range. As we said at the time of the merger, we're limiting acquisitions to focus on successful integration, so some bolt-on activity. But over the next year-and-a-half, we're building out the combined company. We'll execute on the $2.2 billion buyback. And then 2019 forward, we do intend to have a recurring annual share buyback level of $500 million at a minimum. We don't have a common dividend, don't anticipate one in the current planning horizon. And we'll continue to develop and maintain diversified funding and ensure we have sufficient liquidity to execute the strategy. When I look at this policy, it really allows us to effectively use our balance sheet, minimize our cost to capital, but also maintain a relatively low-risk profile as a company. As we look at the capital capacity, over the next 3 years and the capital allocation, we've laid out the capital capacity that will generate. And then in the green, we laid out the buyback levels that I talked about. We'll have substantial additional capacity up to the 2.9x level, so that does give us flexibility. And it's always good to have flexibility when we think about the capital structure. Longer term, in terms of the priorities, as I said, we'll execute the $500 million minimum annual buyback. And in terms of acquisitions, the focus is going to be on assets within existing end markets. I think you've got a good understanding today of why that's the case. We like these end markets. We are well positioned. We have great assets, great customer relationships. There are certain areas that we want to build out in our existing markets, and those are best going to be built out through these bolt-on-type assets, and as I said, up to the $500 million purchase price. As we think about acquisitions, we'll be a disciplined acquirer. So the most important criteria is the strategic fit, business model alignment. We want businesses with recurring revenue models and resilient revenue models. As I said, focused on the current end markets -- so we want to enhance the competitive position and also assets that will allow us to drive future growth within our existing verticals. So using OPIS, as an example, which IHS acquired premerger last year, brought us great downstream pricing capability, gave us better diversity in our energy markets, give us a pricing capability that we could use across our other energy assets and also a pricing position that we can, at some point, expand into the future in other commodities. So those are the types of deals we want to do. In terms of financial criteria, it needs to be immediately accretive to revenue growth. We want to acquire high growing assets, accretive to adjusted EBITDA within 2 years, and then we'll compare it to the buyback, we want EPS accretion to be better than a buyback by year 3. Return metrics, heavy focus on an ROIC cash return metric. So we want the ROIC on acquired assets to be at or above the company's WACC within 3 years. Another way to think about that is a -- it's essentially a nominal EVA breakeven by year 5. The key point here is we want -- we will build the business case for acquired assets and we want clear line of sight to delivery of financial performance that's going to be accretive to our return. So certainly IRR, [NPV], still relevant. We'll run the 10-year models, we do the terminal value. But to the extent we're delivering at this level, provides us a high level of confidence that when we look at the valuation on the more traditional IRR or NPV , we'll have a very attractive asset.</p><p>Just quickly, healthy balance sheet, solid credit ratings. We are investment grade with Fitch, high noninvestment grade with Moody's and S&amp;P, similar to -- same as IHS premerger. Really, all this changed as we now have greater scale: investment grade like credit profile and our credit facility, investment-grade covenants.</p><p>Substantial liquidity. After the Capital Market transactions in Q1, we have $1.3 billion of available liquidity. That gives us flexibility to execute our forward strategy. So that's a great place to be and a well-diversified capital structure. We have a great bank group, seen many of them in the audience today. We always appreciate the support of the bank group. And we have 2 debt offerings that are trading very well. So as we step back from it, this is a simple strategy, simple and focused. And we have a lot of levers that are going to allow us to be successful and drive the long-term financial objectives and shareholder return. In terms of the strategy, Lance laid out the technology product development, the innovation. When I think about it, it's really something we both companies historically have been doing. It's about taking assets that we have, these great information assets we have, these market positions we have and building new revenue streams from those assets. So the examples, Vantage, Performance Evaluator, the bond franchise, the vehicle history report asset being used to build used-car listings. That's something we've done. So what we're talking about doing now is let's bring some technology and let's bring some structure to how we go about doing this. And that's going to let us drive consistently to this 4% to 6%. And as Lance said, we want to be at the upper end of that, and certainly aspire to move beyond that. At that revenue level, the business model works great. We have operating leverage. We have cost synergies. So we can drive margin expansion. We have this mid-60s cash conversion. So we can move margins into the mid-40s. We can maintain the cash conversion at the mid-60s level. And then from a structural perspective, substantial level of investment capacity, tax efficient structure, that gives us the flexibility to both return capital to shareholders and continue to invest in the business. And those things will support then this double-digit adjusted EPS growth. So with that, Jerre? Pass it back.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Thank you. If I can get Jonathan and Lance and Adam up here. We'll open up for questions. I would ask you to raise your hand, and then we've got to get to mic to you. So that takes care of the next 2.5 hours, the questions up. But we need to get mics to the folks. Okay, right there, Tim. What I'll do is quarterback, and we'll get the experts to answer.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>PETER PERRY APPERT, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: So actually, Jerre, I wanted to address this directly to Lance, if I could, because you've been deep in the weeds here in the last year, I think, in terms of working the synergies, and therefore, probably have strong opinions on the portfolio and the business. I'm wondering if you've got any thoughts in terms of whether there is need for further fine tuning in the portfolio? And I'm thinking specifically one of the things that sort of came out of the session today is that the CMS business is slower growth, lower in margin. Does it make sense to stay in that business, that's #1. And then #2...</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: One at a time, Peter. Okay, Lance, please? That's a great question.</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Thanks, Peter. Yes, definitely as a team, we're going to look at all the businesses across the firm. The presentation we showed you today is a 4% to 6% organic growth target based on the businesses we have. And we've made no decision whatsoever for any divestitures. So today, as we laid out, that's our businesses and what we feel we can perform from those businesses.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Great. Second question and last one Peter.</p><p>PETER PERRY APPERT: Okay. This is easy for Todd. I'm wondering if the double-digit earnings growth target trumps the possibility of dilution, near-term dilutions, from acquisitions as you get back into the acquisition market?</p><p>TODD S. HYATT: Peter, our objective would be to deliver double-digit irrespective of potential acquisition profiles. Acquisitions will typically be accretive from an adjusted EPS perspective. The question -- the point is that they're not typically going to be as accretive as buyback in the near term. So this is why I talked about the 3-year accretion test for acquisitions. But I think if we see an asset that makes sense and fits into the portfolio at this bolt-on level, we'll be able to manage within the less accretion than we would get from a buyback.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Great question. Thank you. Over here.</p><p>WILLIAM A. WARMINGTON, MD AND SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. So you've talked about margin expansion and in other different ways this morning and this afternoon. And I wanted to ask about how much additional investment you need to make into the business to help drive that mid-single-digit organic revenue growth? I know you did great on Slide 130, but I'm talking about specifically what you're thinking about in terms of incremental margin? How we should look at that?</p><p>TODD S. HYATT: I think, Bill, at the 4% to 6%, that range, pretty limited investment required to get into that range. I mean, we laid out the performance of the segments, and really in a normal environment, if you chart pencil energy in, and even at a low single-digit level, you'll see that we'll move into that range pretty rapidly. I think that the investments will be balanced with the delivery of the margin. But the key point here is that, and Lance talked about this, we have levers that are available to us. And we have levers that come through the merger in terms of room that we can create from a cost structure standpoint. So our objective would be to support some level of investment and deliver to the 100 points.</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: What we said yesterday when we were going through this, Lance and I said, everybody needs to remember in the room. This is a very good company today. And we will get to that upper end of the 4% to 6%. And the way we'll do it is enhancing investments. Lance and I have talked about that a lot. So to me, that's almost an insurance policy to drive up to the upper level.</p><p>WILLIAM A. WARMINGTON: And one follow-up for Lance.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: So with the folks that are holding the mics, that are passing them around, make sure we take them back, eventually.</p><p>WILLIAM A. WARMINGTON: Lance mentioned the importance of retention and the potential positive impact that would have on the business. And so I wanted to ask if you had any specific retention targets, in terms of how you think about over the next couple of years? And then whether there are some implied retention improvements in that mid-40s EBITDA margin target?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Right. So currently, we operate in the low-90s, which is a great place to be. We want to stay there, so that's first thing. But we also want to use technology to monitor and look at the customer experience. And so if we can see any changes in the customer experience prerenewal, then we can make sure we're on top of that. And if we could move retention up by 1 percentage point, that's a great outcome. And so the key thing is, use technology across the entire client experience and make sure as the retention and the renewal comes into play, that we do retain; and if we can retain more, that will be great, but we are at a good level at the low-90s.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Thanks. Next question. Tim, right there.</p><p>ANDREW CHARLES STEINERMAN, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan. I'm going to ask my whole question upfront, 2-part question. Todd, you just mentioned when resources gets to low single-digit organic, the whole company will move into the low end of the 4%, 6% or 4%. Do you anticipate that happening next year, given what you are seeing this year? Part 2, Lance, what will it take to get to 6% or better?</p><p>TODD S. HYATT: Yes, the answer is yes. I mean, the subbase, the way the subbase plays out is -- and we laid out in our forward guidance for this year, the expectation around a flat subbase for this year. So a flat subbase for this year means we would exit the year at an organic revenue growth for subs that would basically be 0. And so as we move into next year, and once again, you can build out the waterfall on this, but the positive subperformance we expect to see in the second half of the year coupled with performance in the following year will then drive positive revenue. We also expect the nonsubbusiness much smaller part, but we do expect the nonsubbusiness to perform positively as well.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Lance?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Great. So first off, 4% to 6%, for us, as a leadership team, we feel is a great long-term objective for us. And I think it would be very pleased operating at 4%, 5% or 6%. If we operate above that, it's because the market conditions are strong in all of our segments. We've made the strategic and targeted investments and some of them are paying off. And that we have that opportunity and we know we have the opportunity to outperform. But we really want a group of shareholders that are investing in us because we have a long-term objective of 4% to 6%. We can expand margins. We can do bolt-on acquisitions. We can inspire our people and really commit to a long term that's going to produce that double-digit earnings per share growth.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Great. Thanks. Back there.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD &amp; CO., RESEARCH DIVISION: Joe Foresi from Cantor. So revenue synergies are expected to go up above 10x in 3 years. What's the biggest factor there? And also, how do you get the analytics business up and running?</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: You start that, and then let's have Shane pick up on the first part of the 2.</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Come on up, Shane. So I think the important thing when you're building any business, you start off with building a pipeline of opportunity. And I think what was great today as we started to share with you that pipeline is diverse, it's across ECR, it's across energy, Performance Evaluator, Vantage, you saw both of those products being presented out today. You are seeing that, we're introducing the legacy IHS products more rapidly into the financial market customer base, where we've got a really strong presence. So it's all about building the pipeline, which you saw is happening today, executing on the sales at an accelerated pace. And we feel confident that the $100 million is a good number for 2019. Shane?</p><p>SHANE AKEROYD, GLOBAL HEAD OF ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT, HEAD OF ASIA PACIFIC REGION AND EVP, IHS MARKIT LTD.: Yes, I think, in terms of the synergies, I mean, when we were going through the premerger exercise with BCG, we looked at a lot of existing businesses we had, development businesses and categorized a bunch of areas where we thought synergies were going to come from. I think what's been happening since then is, first of all, we've been getting to know each other, getting to know the businesses, so that's been a kind of learning exercise. I think the second area was really going out and understanding some of those business cases and validating the deals. And I think Jerre put up some numbers there for 2016 and 2017, so we've definitely seen that. The ideas that we had get validated--invalidated, and over a period, we're learning more about kind of where the areas of focus on the growth areas are going to come from. We've also looked at pipeline. I don't think we give out pipeline statistics, but we've got a lot of visibility there. And Jerre mentioned pipeline growth, and it has been very, very significant. The types of customers that we're dealing with as well as having that accelerated pipeline, accelerated deals getting done, we're dealing with some marquee names, and I think that's very much again validating what we are doing. And in terms of the rest of the confidence, I think I'll steal a phrase that someone has used from Yaacov, we know what good looks like. And I think we're spending a lot of time on this. We can see all of these real things happening. And I think experience across the teams lead us to be very confident.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Thanks, Shane. Next question.</p><p>SHLOMO H. ROSENBAUM, VP, STIFEL, NICOLAUS &amp; COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Lance, I just wanted to ask you, it seems like a little bit of a change in the tone in terms of a step up in new product innovation. You just mentioned on the call, it seems like there's a little bit more of a focus there and that's a clear value driver in terms of a company, in terms of sustainable new product innovation. Is there some way that we're going to be gauge that you really being more successful in that area versus some pricing versus market improvement? And then if you don't mind I have just one to ask Jerre, are you really retiring at the end of the year?</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: I'll answer that one in a minute, but let's get -- And I'll be happy to. Let's get Lance to start and Jonathan and Adam should answer this, because this is a great question.</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: So I think new product development, it's critical. And in today -- in a world of rapidly changing technology, we need to make sure that we are also developing products and services with our content to deliver to our customers. And I guess if I walked around the exhibits today, starting outside the door with Performance Evaluator and Vantage, those are new products that have been developed internally. And I spent time with Raoul on Performance Evaluator before the presentation, and we talked how can we extend that and expand the product development. Rounding the corner, you add IHS Connect and new online sales. You then moved into ECR, and I was talking to Maria, who is in the room, and we talked about extending the ECR base into being a broader economic country-risk product to monitor private equity investments, a service that PE like to buy and present to their board. Heading down, you had KY3P with the team. You had Paul presenting on FRTB, brand-new products developed internally in the last 24 months. Keep on going around, you had new digital advertising product used for personalization by Schwab and E-TRADE and being leveraged out into our broader customer base. But personalization and technology, we need it in our own products. So imagine us pulling that in to personalize our experience to our customers. Keep going around, you had more product development with the maritime folks and the MINT product that you hadn't seen before. This is expanding and generating the trade and the tracking tools and looking at some real-time visible maritime tracking. You kept coming up, you had Steve Had, who is presenting on digital advertising and automotive. Thinking about the car in the garage and how it impacts media and buying in many other products. Thinking about placement in the gaming platforms and advertising for the OEMs, very great growth area. Not sure if he shared his growth figures, but he had some slides, he shared with me. Coming to the next one, you had our VPaC product. You came -- over in the corner, I missed the new Engineering Workbench. How many new products can we develop at one time. So this company is all about new product development. But new product development, on a base of great products, filling out white spaces, expanding into our customers, our teams are the ones that can share that with you. I think we're doing an absolutely fantastic job.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Adam, Jonathan, quick?</p><p>ADAM J. KANSLER: Very little to add to that. To answer your question how will you know if we're innovating, I'd say come back next year to Investor Day and the year after and ask about what the new product innovations are at that point. And you'll probably get a nice long list like you just heard of new innovations and things we've launched or started to build since the last one. And then sort of measure us over that 3- to 5-year period, see if we've delivered that organic growth that we've described on a long-term target. Those 2, together, are going to tell you that we are innovating.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: Very hard to follow-up on Lance's comments there. But I have 2 examples I would give. One is -- in my 2 largest markets, automotive and energy. First, within energy, even in the last couple of years, the 2 areas of [indiscernible] have grown have been Vantage and Performance Evaluator, 2 of our new innovative products. I'll look over at automotive. When we acquired the legacy Polk business from -- R.L. Polk, and I think you have been around [it] and so you know the story, that was a business in decline. The growth being driven in automotive has really been around the analytic innovative products to be put on top of that core database. That's been the story of growth, and we'll see that growth come in the future.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: And 2 quick comments, and I'll answer your other question. We spent over $200 million a year on development today, I'm not sure everybody knows that reporting into Randy. And of that, 60-plus percent is new, 40 is maintenance. The more we do, what we're talking about and the quicker we get to the solutions Yaacov is working with us for, the more we'll move that from 60-40 up to 75-25, which will give us even more opportunities. But Lance said really well, the answer is with me, I have 239 days and about 4.5 hours to go. And if you look at my face, I'm getting younger. If you look at Lance's face, so the answer is yes.</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Thanks, Jerre.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Next question.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK, DIRECTOR AND LEAD RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Manav from Barclays. My first question is just around the M&amp;A strategy. I was hoping you could just clarify things a bit in terms of that $500 million number. I think you said the next 1.5 years, that's the max maybe of the combined purchase price individual, and then after the 1.5 years, what happens there? And then the second question is for Adam and Lance, just on the financial side of things. Obviously, lot of the customers, banks, everyone, they're facing a lot of headwinds. I know you characterize that as an opportunity. But in the near term, are you feeling any of that pain? And do you see that continuing for some time?</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: On the acquisition...</p><p>TODD S. HYATT: On the acquisition, $500 million is the -- up to $500 million is a longer-term thought, Manav. I mean, that's the level of acquisitions that we want to play at. That's -- these businesses that can fit into existing segments and add capability and growth opportunities within those segments. In terms of capital allocation in the near term, as I said, we've effectively paused acquisition activity other than relatively small bolt-ons, as we integrate the companies and exercise the $2.2 billion buyback.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Great. Do you want to start, Adam, and then Jonathan will pick up.</p><p>ADAM J. KANSLER: Sure. So headwinds that banks are facing. They've been in a headwind environment for quite a while, really since 2008, and we talked about it a lot. If I was going to describe the current market environment. I'd actually say the headwinds are quite diminished from where they had been at previous times. While we regularly read about pressures banks are facing to take out cost and reduce their internal cost structures, if you looked at the most recent earnings reports from a lot of the financials, in the areas where we serve most, think about fixed income trading, many of the financial firms are reporting record results. So I do see that regulatory optimism that I mentioned earlier and I see a little bit of a shift in the wind and some increased activity in some of the primary markets we serve. Where banks continue to face pressure for cost, again, that's a place where we're pretty comfortable to play. The deeper we can get into those workflows, take processes out of bank, take them out of financial institutions, make their operations more efficient, that's all opportunity for us.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Jonathan, you want to pick up, and then Lance will wrap it up.</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: [What some financial markets], I think Lance covered it well.</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: So I would just say one first thing on the acquisitions. Bolt-ons to us mean that we can grow the acquisition target faster than it can grow by itself. There may be some cost synergies, but also we want to drive synergies across our company. So we see opportunities for small bolt-on acquisitions around the opportunities of the space we are in and those we'll look at. But they are going to be small. We're going to do what we said we're going to do. We've laid out a clear commitment today. That's what we will be focused on. On the -- one of the things I'd say about headwinds in financial markets. Think about the size and scope of the asset management, hedge fund, growing alternative asset classes and the needs of those market participants that have filled a lot of the void that the larger financial market participants may have vacated. And we're seeing the likes of the largest asset managers be equally concerned about cost. And as soon as you're concerned about costs, you start to consider third parties like IHS Markit to step in and help you with your order management software, help you with your regulatory and compliance needs, help you manage your data with our data management tools, help you with your analytics and meeting compliance with our regulatory and analytics tools. So the community may have faced headwinds, some of that headwinds has shifted now into other parts of the financial markets. But those financial market participants are equally calling out for our help. We see that as a great opportunity for us to grow into.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Jonathan, quick, anything on headwinds with you. You got rid of your worst ones.</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: I got rid of my -- my big bad headwind has now turned into a tailwind, we hope. Really, the only headwind we see across the markets that I serve, it's potentially around the [SARs], flapping out of SARs in the automotive industry and the slowdown there. When I look at automotive, the vast majority of our automotive business and solutions today are focused more on that last Chevron, which was the aftermarket used car sales, recall services, things like that. The headwinds we'll see there -- a; we have solutions that help address our clients to help them through those headwinds. However, I think it will certainly as automotive OEMs, if they are facing financial challenges, it will make it slightly more challenging for us to penetrate new products and solutions.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Thank you. Next question.</p><p>ANJANEYA K. SINGH, SENIOR ANALYST, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Anj Singh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. I've got 2 questions. One for Jerre and Lance, and one for Jonathan. So Jerre and Lance, analytics has been a constant theme today. It's been for a few years for the legacy IHS. I think, maybe 2 years ago, you guys spoke to about 25% of your revenue coming from analytics, aspirations to get to 35%, 40% over time. So where are you on that journey? What is your aspiration now? And what have been the biggest hurdles to growing that? Has it been the investments in the people, as one of your earlier slides called out, just trying to think of the achievable opportunity here?</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Great. You start, Lance, and I'll pick up. Great question. Thank you.</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Okay. Again a question about availability of technology and tools and us using the tools and using analytics to do really 2 things in our company. So we see 1 great opportunity that supports those mid-40s margin targets is to use analytics to analyze the data that we have, that we ingest, that we then build into our platforms to deliver to our customers. And so we see efficiency gains there, and we've got to use analytics to get to those efficiency gains, some of it through machine learning, deep learning, AI. The second thing though that we see is the ability to use analytics to enhance existing products, but also to create new products. And some of the analytics come from a new phrase that was coined recently, quantimental investment, where you're taking multiple data sets and putting them together to provide a result. It might be a combination of our trade data with financial data, maritime data with satellite imagery to put together a new form of prediction or analysis. And our customers, whether they're building strategy, effecting policy, making investment or decisions or sale decisions, understanding the risks of their current investments are willing to buy and package up subscriptions based around the analysis that we can provide them on our existing proprietary datasets, but also the combination with others. And it's a lot of what, I know Yaacov wants to join in here. Because he's been mentioned a lot of times. But Yaacov is doing a lot of that R&amp;D for us around the analytics space and has a steep, deep analytics background. And I think maybe you want to talk about 1 or 2 of the exciting things you're working on, in terms of POCs to give some credence to the question.</p><p>YAACOV MUTNIKAS, EVP OF FINANCIAL MARKET TECHNOLOGIES, IHS MARKIT LTD.: Okay. So essentially we've got a pretty robust, in my view, plan in terms of integrating our data, our key data assets into, [what] I think of what we have probably heard in the [indiscernible] data lake. And in that context, we've got, not only a way of ingesting the data and distributing the data, but we also understand how data is related to each other. And so when Lance was talking about advanced analytics, we can combine data and fuse it together,</p><p>so -- which can have a very comprehensive view how everything fits together and what are the nuances between the data, how they kind of correlate with each other, their dependencies and, of course, based on that, we can do predictive analytics in a very fast way. The key to that is not only how the -- how sophisticated those analytics are, but also how quickly we can get to initial results and deliver them to our clients.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Next question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I have one more for Jonathan. So on the Transportation business, particularly as it relates to autos, clearly it's been an impressive grower for the past few years. Your outlooks for it continue at this clip. Is there an opportunity to replicate what's worked so well for autos to your other segments? I guess, what I'm trying to ask is, how much of the success in the segment is due to the peculiarities of the end market versus your acquisition of high-quality businesses like Polk versus internal execution? And if there are best practices, let's say, like the new product flywheel that you talked about, can that be applied more broadly?</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: Great question. And first you put your finger on few of the drivers that caused that great outcome, the people, the capabilities, a supportive market, but also this idea of flywheel of innovation. And I do think that the team there, in particular, is one that has in their DNA this innovation machine built-in, and that is something that we are looking to replicate across our other teams. Now when I look at where can we replicate that, it takes that combination of the underlying assets, a market need and a team. We certainly are building that team ethos. When I look to other markets that I support, energy is the next obvious place to have that, given the depth and quantity and diversity of underlying assets that we have. And then hopefully we'll have a supportive market coming out of this the next few years.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Great question, great answer. Thank you. Next?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I'm wondering what kind of market share gains you all think you're going to gain over the next couple of years. So if you look at -- in Lance's slides, you had BCG telling you, you operate in a 5% growth market, the midpoint of your organic growth range is 5%, implying no market share gains. Trying to reconcile that with the history of 2 companies that did gain market share and lots of talk around innovation. Why would those not result in you gaining market share?</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: That -- we talked about that yesterday. So, Lance, give them a...</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: No, it's a good question. And, I guess, I hope it gives you comfort in the conservative nature of our long-term objectives. We feel it's very important to give you a set of numbers that we can consistently meet and gain your confidence. We're confident in the numbers we put forward. And the market for information and services, of course, is very broad, it encompasses the industries we're in. Whether it's automotive, whether it's energy, financial services. And some of those have an intensity of spending that actually is larger than other industries. So it gives us comfort that we reside in markets that will grow and that information services is a great place to be. Now we need to invest internally, so we have an opportunity and a higher propensity to deliver to the upper end of that range. That's going to come through innovation, protecting the great products that we have and expanding them, widening the gap to competitors and looking for those opportunities that will allow us to accelerate into the top end of our range or even through it. But I think the confidence that we've laid out and that we have as a team should give you comfort that we can produce those solid double-digit EPS growth for many years. And that really is what we want to do as a team. We want to hit singles every day. We don't need home runs. We need to deliver a great plan with great people that we have in the firm and deliver for you shareholders.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Great. Thanks. Right there?</p><p>GARY E. BISBEE, MD OF BUSINESS SERVICES EQUITY RESEARCH, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Gary Bisbee at RBC. I think one theme we heard a lot today was technology, your infrastructure from a tech perspective. You talked about delivering your products through the cloud to clients. You talked about using private cloud to house and analyze your own data. The new third-party software, I guess, that you are implementing. Can you give us a sense of where you are in that process today? What level of investment you need to make? And then importantly, what's the time line to get where you want to be? And is there any risk that if you're doing all of this at the same time, you're integrating the 2 businesses, that there could be some disruption? Or is this planned out and you think a coherent enough strategy that it's likely to be seamless and successful?</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Good. Randy?</p><p>RANDALL P. HARVEY, CTO AND EVP, IHS MARKIT LTD.: No, good question. I think the key thing is -- you asked an awful lot of elements of that. If you think of cloud, cloud is an enabler. And so as we go about this, we're trying to do it in, what I would call, a very logical fashion. So we're tiering some of the applications, we're looking at our strategic applications. A lot of them have been built on the cloud to begin with, so we had lot of cloud initiatives that were going on within the businesses to begin with on the new systems. But then as we start to move these over, one of the key aspects of this is, really, you have to enable them for the cloud. If you want to get the true savings out of the cloud, there's about 3 things that I see that a cloud strategy brings to us. One, it will help in our cost, because if you enable them for the cloud, they are going to provision with the elastic compute. They're going to provision the application. It's going to provision them, then when it's not at peak, it's going to deprovision. If you think of what we have to do today in our infrastructures, we have to build our infrastructure out for peak load. So there is obviously a cost opportunity there. Second thing is, is time to market, Lance talked about that. If you're in a cloud environment from the development standpoint, that means your development teams aren't waiting on somewhat of a fixed infrastructure organization to be able to provision servers for them and provision environments for them. So they can provision those environments on the fly. They can bring it up, they can run it, they can then deprovision it down.</p><p>The other piece that we're looking at when you're talking about private cloud is, there's also a certain set of assets that we have that we probably won't to move to the cloud because they've been around for a long time. They may be on an older technology stack and it's not necessarily a strategic product that we're going to want to move in that direction, because we may already have plans for either consolidating into some other platforms, as Todd talked about earlier. So we see a private cloud as being an opportunity for us to do what we call -- we're actually calling horizontal kind of rollout, where you can start to get some cost savings around how you deploy your clustered databases, how you deploy some of your middleware, those types of things there. So all of that has been somewhat systematically gone through and it's part of the merger of the 2 companies, where we have a plan that we've put together. We first, obviously, had to get through a lot of the integration. So if you think about what's going on in IT organization right now, a ton of integration going on in terms of taking costs out, consolidating data centers, all that. We now are starting down the strategy of after, kind of, the storming and forming and norming is, now how do we start to move these applications along. So we actually have these, if you want to call it tiered approaches of what we're going to do. Hopefully that answers the question. A lot of good opportunities. I'm not saying -- there is one final piece too, is the -- one of the key areas that we think from a growth standpoint is, I keep getting hit with it a lot of -- all the time is, how do we start to potentially allow our customers to commingle some of their data with our data. Cloud provides a great opportunity for us to do that as well, because it's an environment that they're starting to get comfortable with. We can connect into their environments and bring their data together, and it just works out to be -- I think it's going to be a long-term, a much more rapid way to deploy, to develop and to take products to market.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Thanks, Randy. Next question?</p><p>ANDRE BENJAMIN, VP AND LEAD ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Andre Benjamin, Goldman Sachs. So I appreciate the amount of detail you guys put in terms of the addressable markets analyses and the different end markets. My question was particularly in the auto market. You separate current and future opportunities, so I wanted to know are you looking at that more as a need to displace other people that are currently selling those products are those addressing new demand needs that you're going to go after your fair share of a growing market? And then there are 4 buckets there, is there any kind of ranking that we should be thinking of about the lowest hanging fruit of how you're going to go about attacking those?</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Good question.</p><p>JONATHAN GEAR: So again, just on those 2 different buckets, we separated it. The current addressable is where we're currently selling today existing products and gaining revenue. Second, where we're not currently gaining revenue. When we look at those 4 buckets, it's hard to say which -- we're looking right now at [entr\u00e9s] into all 4 of those different areas, we have capabilities into those. Some of those markets are less defined, in terms of there's no existing entrant to displace. In some cases there are multiple entrants, not a single solution, and we're bringing together a comprehensive solution. I think if you look at the myCARFAX app, it's one example how we support the repair market, potentially, and user ratings. That we won where we were competing against hundred different smaller, smaller companies potentially, but no one who brings it all together.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Thank you. Next question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: In an environment where global GDP is flat or down slightly, how do you think IHS' -- or INFO's organic performance is? And then second question, should we expect -- or a normal course operating leverage over the next 1 to 2 years, even while we have still synergies coming in '18 and '19?</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: So I'll take the second part first part.</p><p>TODD S. HYATT: Can you repeat the second piece again?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. Given that there are synergies coming in '18 and '19, should we expect, on top of that, for margins to expand, because there is normal course operating margin expansion?</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Yes, good question.</p><p>TODD S. HYATT: Yes, we'll -- we're going to deliver to the 100 points consistently and do some level of reinvestment into the business. I think as we look at the way the synergies play out, there is an opportunity to upsize margins a bit as we look out at '18 and '19 as we deliver those synergies. But we haven't provided a forward guidance view of 2018 at this point.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: And refresh for the first part of the question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I've got that 1. So we're talking about a world with flat GDP growth. We did suggest that 2% to 3% would be a forecast that we'd probably see over the next several years. But imagine a world where there is no growth. I generally would look for our teams to look for ways in a no-growth world, it means companies are struggling. And when companies are struggling, it means that they are attacking the cost side of their organizations. An information services company with technology as a backbone and an enabler is one that looks to providing solutions to companies, governments, financial market participants, to help them reduce cost when either investment returns aren't there, corporate gains aren't there and it means it's harder for them to deliver results. So yes, we might be at the lower part of our range, but at the same time, we feel confident that in normal market conditions, even low-growth global economies, we can deliver a return to our shareholders.</p><p>JERRE L. STEAD: Thank you for the questions. With that, I'm going to wrap up. We thank you all very much for being here. Never have I enjoyed being part of a team like this team. You got a chance to see a where we're at, where we're going to be and how we're going to get there. This just summarizes what we've said today: leading information, unique proprietary, strong delivery, targeted investments, very confident. Confident and forward performance potential in our strategy provides the opportunity, like Lance just said, to achieve upper ends of growth targets, margins, return capital and produce strong shareholder. So we're in great shape.</p><p>I would close with a quote that I think about as I so much enjoy seeing the progress of this wonderful group of people. \"Progress is not only enhancing what is, but indeed advancing to what will be.\" That's really what we're doing today, and we look forward to delivering great results for years to come. Great people doing great things every day. Thank you, guys. Great job.

I think you'll see me for the rest of the morning here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But to start off here, we have Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO of IHS Markit. So thank you for being here, Lance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LANCE UGGLA, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, IHS MARKIT LTD.: Thank you.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: I'm obviously going to do a fireside chat here. If there any questions in the middle, if you want to interrupt, please, just raise your hand and we're happy to do that.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: So maybe just to kick it off, Lance, it's been about 2 years since the IHS Markit deal came together. You're now running the show on your own. Maybe just some quick, sort of, 2-year thoughts on how you think the deal's going so far.</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Okay. So really, Jerre and I had the fortune -- Jerre Stead, the CEO of IHS when we merged, had the pleasure of meeting and setting out a plan together, including laying out the management team. And really, we did that together. And I think we did it in a way that allowed us to have a really simple transition. And so today, 2 years on, and Jerre transitioning out at the end of last year, the company is in a good trajectory and it's one that we laid out together, so no real big changes. I've just finished a 4-week trip seeing customers and shareholders, we're finishing this up today. And I think we met about 100 customers and shareholders over that 4-week period. So I have a good pulse for our customer base, using our products. The markets we're in are all fairly robust and consistent. Global economies ex some geopolitical risks are in good shape. And I feel we've got a set of shareholders that are now aligned with the story that we've laid out, which is the mid-single-digit growth. We can consistently generate the 100 basis points of margin and deliver double digit earnings growth. And I think if we just stick to that and don't get away from ourselves, we've got a great story.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: And in terms of your customer trip that you just did, I guess, what is the feedback in terms of the value add or the synergy of having the market with the IHS pieces. Was there -- like how do you lay in that discussion with these customers?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Right. Well, I think the -- really, we looked at -- well, first of all, you don't want to end up in a company that's just 3 divisions with no sense of purpose together. So really there's 3 pieces, nonfinancial pieces, that really tie our company together. So the first was the account management layer we put in right across the group. So one company had account management, the other company didn't. We now have an 80-person strong account management team that is allowing us to really start to push the revenue synergies, which are an important part of our transaction. And this is a very, very detailed approach. Weekly reporting goes across all the business entities. And I'd say about 70% of those synergies are all about delivering IHS legacy content into financial market participants, which are great consumers of information and quite large vendors in terms of finding that needle in a haystack to either buy something, sell something, advise on something, develop a proposal on something. The other 30%, data management, credit analysis, other more financial market strengths brought to the corporate customers. So the first thing that pulls us together is that common account management structure, and I work very closely with that team. The second thing that draws us together is starting to pull the data sets together. And I hate to use all the buzzwords, AI, data science, all the things that you're hearing probably in every meeting because really, to me, I just look at it as math and scenarios, using cheap storage and a lot of compute power. And that's the thing that's changed. If I go back 15 years ago, we're using math and scenarios, it just took us all night to run them, and today it's much, much quicker. So the second piece that pulls us together is a common data science team across the whole firm, working on a lot of the new issues -- sorry, new developments and innovations that also drive some revenue synergies of the transaction. And then the third and final place, pull your operational teams together in a way to drive additional cost synergies as well as to just organize yourself long term for incremental margin, as you can use technology to drive further efficiencies. Those are the 3 layers that -- beside shared services, HR, legal, PR, IR, those are the 3 areas where we're really trying to build a single IHS Markit, allowing each of the divisions to use their competitive edge, which is always content and subject matter experts, leveraging technology, producing ideas for our customers. And that's -- it is a real simple formula.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: All right, that's helpful. Maybe if you're going to start on the segment, so if you can start with energy. I think oil price is in the s$70 right now. I believe your guidance was somewhere in the $55 to $60 range, I'm not sure how directly it impacts your guidance. But just some thoughts there. Are you seeing any timely with your customer visits? Are your energy customers, all of a sudden, feeling that much incrementally better? Or how should we think about that?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Right. So -- and you can get most of these interviews online. But this year, our CERAWeek conference, which is a real thought leadership event around the energy markets, it had some 700 to 1,000 more people than the previous year. Its revenues were up double digit, and it really was a great event. And you could feel a shifting optimism. So definitely, there is some optimism around the energy markets and the customers. Our energy business is really split 60:40, 65:35 upstream and mid-downstream. The mid-downstream, which includes chemicals, great business; power; gas; renewables; coal; all our pricing in news assets that would compete against the Platts or an Argus, that grew at 5% to 7% right through the downturn. So if you just think about that piece, very stable, very recurring, lots of data, lots of subject matter experts. And if you put a consistent growth on that, 35%, 40% at 5% to 7%, that's 2% to 3% growth across the division, and we called out low single digits for 2018 based on our $55, $65 oil price. If you go to upstream, upstream definitely has an impact when there's additional CapEx, there's additional use of Markit, IHS Markit services. So we do benefit from a higher energy price, but not -- the swing is not as much as you might feel. And I know, when you're talking to a hedge fund, they look at oil price and think that IHS Markit's a good play. My view is that if you take the downturn where CapEx was slashed 50%-plus percent and look at 2016, '17, legacy IHS was down minus 5%, minus 10% on that division, it's just not the wild swings with energy price. Because really what you're looking at, historically, the retrenchment was, we're not going to be doing any exploration offshore Brazil, we don't need that data set, but we still need all the other data sets we use from IHS Markit. We're trenching from North Sea, we don't need that data set. So as energy companies go back into those marketplaces, they will take additional services and subscriptions, and of course, we'll see a little bit of growth from that. I also think one thing's changed. When the energy company thinks about going back into the North Sea, I think it's a much more well-thought, careful decision versus $100 oil price, where everybody exploring in 3 continents and really a much more expensive chase for energy. I think this time you're going to see a much more careful approach. The profits come at a lower energy price and a lot of the fat's been taken out of the industry. So therefore, when they do take those subscriptions on to go back into offshore Africa, Brazil, North Sea oil sands, I think what you're going to see is a much more consistent and stable revenue stream. And so when I look at that low single digits, I think, \"Hey, that's a great number for '18. It's got upside into '19. And if you're investing in us long term, you know that, that mid-single-digits overall growth can produce double digit earnings growth with the margin expansion.\" And I think that is a really good way to think about our company. Just don't -- you don't need to think that we need to do 4%, 5%, 6% in energy, but if it comes as we go into '19, great, it will set us up well for next year.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: You talked earlier about how the financial customers are great consumers of data, but they're also pretty volatile. And so I think Verisk, in their call, talked about a big ID client, it sounded like it was Deutsche Bank getting out and hurting their business. What's your exposure to financial customers, I guess, with that risk, maybe on the sales side, like the banks or whatever it is?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Yes. I think we've got an opportunity that Wood Mac maybe doesn't have. One, when we merged the 2 companies, the one place where IHS wasn't penetrated was the financial markets on the energy side. And a couple good drivers there. One, you've merged 2 companies, one that has deep financial market presence globally with 5,000-ish customers and a lot of C-Suite access. So definitely we have access to pitch our products, which is always #1. Can you get through the door? Secondly, we have deeper data sets than anybody else in that space. But financial market participants want -- it's not so much the depth of the data, it's the data with the subject matter experts and available to support decision-making and transactions. And so that's an area of the market that we're going after. So we're chasing to get our share of that. And as market participants look at their renewals and their position in that space, I think we have a chance to grow, and we're very focused on building our presence into the financial markets in growing that. So I don't worry about us losing much because our position there is quite small right now.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Got it. And then in terms of the innovation on the energy side, I mean, particularly, we talked about Vantage a lot and Wood Mac, Abertis talked about replatforming their whole business and then investing a lot in their margins. Like is -- but I think the energy margins are low 40s and so how do -- how does that innovation pipeline look like in the energy side?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Yes. So for us, the innovation that we're generating on the energy side -- and again our platform is new. Vantage was a platform that was freshly developed within IHS, and we continue to build that out now as IHS Markit, whereas Wood Mac established older platform probably needs a freshening up. So I think our position and our competitive edge is to leverage the freshness and newness of our platform and develop it with data and data analytics and predictive analytics, scenario analysis, asset valuations, with a much more easy access, great, strong compute power and a little bit of data science as we would say in today's world. And I think that's where we're going to have an opportunity to have ourselves positioned much better with financial market customers looking to value portfolio assets or advise on assets. So I think we have a little bit of upside there. Again, I don't think financial markets for IHS Markit is the game changer in our energy strategy. But I don't see downside there, I see incremental upside.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Got it. We were at the CERAWeek that you mentioned, and there was a clear -- there was a noticeable uptick in the number of financial attendees there, to your point on the synergies. Is there a lot to think about on the reverse? So the market products to IHS customers? Or how do you think about the reverse synergy, I suppose?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Right. Yes. So what I found at CERAWeek was really the first time -- I think IHS Markit, we looked at CERAWeek and said, \"This is a great energy platform.\" But it's also a platform for the company to use and leverage its global position across mobility, technology, financial market participants and energy, and find those places where those intersections existed. So you probably saw when you were there a whole floor of technology and innovation around tech. But what was really interesting is, is the presence of Amazon. So Bill Vass shows up and has a head of energy with him. Diane Greene comes, speaks from Google Cloud. A few weeks later, there's an announcement they've hired a head of energy from BP. Microsoft Azure is there. So we've got the presence of big tech providers. Why are they there? Because they want to host our content and they want the energy companies to select them to host their content, which gives us those future opportunities for our product synergies. So I think on the -- on that side, we saw the intersections of technology, energy, mobility. We had Mary Barra there and some other technical analysts from the financial markets around mobility and looking at the supply and demand characteristics into the power grid from all aspects of energy. And then we saw -- and the connected car and the data needs and then we got the financial market participants. And the financial market participants are there because they want to finance things. They want the customer relationships, and they want to be able to build strategy around that. So we really felt the company coming together as a single unit, working together to get the best out of this energy conference. Now within the financial market product base, legacy Markit did a couple of things really well. 200-plus big financial market data customers, when I say data customers, using our technology just to organize data to give it some providence and to be able to organize themselves to feed the many systems downstream. What's interesting is energy market participants, large ones, are also big consumers of data. They have data across -- well, now with the Internet of Things, you've got a lot of sensors out in the field, producing a lot of data. They buy a lot of data from the marketplace, whether it's from us or others. And you start to have a real organizational challenge to deliver that data into your risk and control systems, and we have a great tech layer for that. We've now sold that, I think, 8 times another 3 or 4 opportunities in the pipeline. And these are $5 million-plus sales, real synergies that are going the other way. We also -- in the energy market downturn, a lot of private company exposure. Private companies need a different type of credit analysis in terms of looking at their portfolio and potential credit losses. And again, being experts in analytics and financial market pricing, we've been able to help there, especially around derivative portfolios and small company credit exposures across the energy landscape, and there's also been synergies there. So a little less going that way, but some nice shoots of progress and ones that give me optimism that we've got a lot more to come. We did reaffirm our $35 million of synergies this year. We said $10 million last-year, we ended the year at a 12 run rate, which is a little bit better in run rate, but in terms of actual, we're a little bit off of the $10 million. I think we said that at the end of last year. But with good momentum as we went into the second half. And this year, we've reaffirmed $35 million, lots of opportunity in the pipeline, and I don't see us missing that at all. 100 is another step up in '19, we haven't said anything about that, but I think we've got great momentum.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: And one of the other opportunities, I think, you had called out early in the call was the MiFID, right? Using the, I guess, the IHS research capabilities to try and take advantage of that. Can you just talk about that positive, but also are you seeing any negatives on the market side of the business?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Well, I think when investment managers start paying for research, it's interesting. I was with a top energy bank and you probably could tell me numbers for Barclays as well, but -- and I said, \"Well, how many real analysts do you have at energy?\" The number might have been 20 analysts. I said \"How many analysts do you think IHS Markit has across our divisions?\" He said, \"I don't know, a couple hundred.\" I said, \"How about 1,700.\" And he went, \"You got to be joking.\" And it's detailed analysis, on every dot of the I, every cross of the T. And it's almost like a firehose of research that comes out of a firm like ours. So does that work for financial market participants in the buy side? No, it needs to be tailored. So the biggest task, I have to say, is packaging the research up, so it can be sold the right way. There's no -- you can't walk in to -- a top $1 trillion asset manager or a $10 billion hedge fund and say, \"Let us have $0.5 million or $1 million for our research package.\" They don't want to spend that. What they want to do is, \"We want to look at your solar tech, we want everything on solar tech.\" That's $50,000 a year, happy as Larry. And you can do those types of sales many times over. But give us all your tech research and it's just way too much. So again, this to me is just great opportunity. So we now have put Adrian Beale in charge of our combined research effort into the buy side. He's ex-Goldman. And we have paired him with actually a buy side research expert from the old Hudson Street to actually package and position the sale of our product. Tom Conigliaro is his name. And they're based in Houston and New York, and they're packaging all the research to sell in. I think MiFID II plays well. One, because we have real specialist. And if somebody's going to pay something, they want to pay for something unique. Subject matter experts, unique content, real specialized data, so I think we got to -- again, it's -- I look at all of this as upside to our business, as usual. And its strategy, it's blocking and tackling, it's doing the things we have to do to be great. And we've got great people doing that. So I think that's showing up in our progress.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Got it. And with the rest of the Markit business, it sounds like the index business is doing well with AUMs going up, volatility is good for processing, the data business is growing, is there anything to call out in that business to keep an eye on other than just more of the same?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Right. Well, I like that some -- I think it was a BCG partner that said to me, \"Half of growth is showing up to the markets you're in and delivering your company.\" And we're lucky we're in good markets right now. So when I look at the index market, whether you look at S&amp;P, McGraw-Hill, you look at LSE and FTSE, you look at MSCI, it's many years of growth, growing into the passive equity markets for ETFs and benchmarks and index plays. What you're seeing over the last few years is that same growth coming to the fixed income asset class, and really, they are the big -- the MSCIs and the McGraw-Hills and the FTSEs of fixed income are ourselves in Bloomberg with the Barclays Agg. So those are the 2 big index players, and we're getting the outsized growth there. And I really think that's many, many years to come. Fixed income's a much bigger asset class. It includes alternatives. It includes loans. It includes a whole bunch of things, where the growth of that marketplace is -- it's just starting. And the percentage of ETFs and passive investment in fixed income versus equities, it's negligible. So I think there's great growth there. That's just one piece though of our franchise. We're not as narrowly focused. So then you start going across, you know it's a good market if you produce a lot of -- and price a lot of indices. In fixed income, you have to produce the data. The data doesn't come from an exchange, so we have a factory. We have to produce those -- the pricing, and of course, the 2 drive growth together and those have been good, strong growers for us. There's still a propensity to outsource costs. Financial markets are always looking at costs. And I think one of the changes that I'm seeing, that I've also seen some good headlines recently that make me believe that we have good upside here as well, is asset managers are feeling cost pressures. And if that's the case, we're the type of firm that helps groups of financial market participants bring their cost structure down and it's an area where we're quite good at. Processing, I hate to say it, it's -- it really is -- it's $170 million or so market serve, negative 5%, plus 5%. It's now not hugely significant over the whole piece but, of course, does have volatility. And parts of volatility, sometimes, come with increased volume and sometimes smaller size. We're paid by the ticket, so potentially, there's some upside there. But equally, we've seen in the past those numbers can be hard to forecast and it really is volume-based. But I think we're in good markets and we're getting our share and maybe sometimes a little extra.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Okay. Before we go into the auto business, maybe -- I'm not sure what the impact would be, but I'm talking about Brexit basically. You're headquartered here. You live here. Do you see any impact a couple of years later on the business? Or do you have to have backup plans, like all the banks and everyone seem to be doing?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: I'd say there's only -- there's 2 or 3 small impacts I've felt. One, I've felt some people working in London have decided they want to work in Amsterdam, Dublin, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Munich, like we really do have a nice footprint around Europe with great offices and individuals feel any -- compelled to work in any of our continental offices, so be it. In today's modern world, that's not an issue. So -- but that's a handful of people. We have no reason why we have to. We offer services that don't require a financial passporting and, therefore, we can operate and sell our products from wherever we'd like. So I don't feel any pressure. I definitely feel that currency and the total cost of employment here in the U.K. looks a little lower vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis other big global centers now just because of where the currency is at the moment. Whatever, it's 1.35. And that -- that's a bit of a benefit and that doesn't hurt us, but because we have a big cost base here and we sell in -- mainly in U.S. dollars. So I guess -- I just -- hey, I'm here. I love being here. I think this is a great city to live in. I don't want to live anywhere else. And I think Brexit's -- this is a long term -- a long game that plays out over many, many years. And yes, it's going to have some little short-term impacts, but I don't see anybody changing course.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Okay, that's fair. So maybe we can just switch to the auto business. It's been your best performing division for quite some time. Maybe just a quick 1-minute on what data and what you own in the auto business because I think people understand energy, I think they knew Markit pretty well because you were a public company before. But maybe just a quick brief on what's the core of the auto and why you're growing high single or double digits in there?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Right. What was interesting is, is on this road show somebody asked me if I was going to leave IHS Markit. I guess you would -- you'd -- and you could have one division, what would it be? Would it be financial markets because that's where you came from and know it best or would it be automotive because it has such great growth? I said, \"No, no, in fact, it'd be energy.\" And he looked at me and go, \"Why would it be energy?\" I guess, what I'd say with energy is deepest customer relationships of any franchise I've ever seen. It really is C-Suite access everywhere. And that puts you in a place to do business. And so therefore, I look at our energy franchise and I go, wow, what an exciting franchise, plus it's a real exciting market. And I don't come from an energy background but exploration, changes in demands on power grids, people wanting to be fresh and renewable and out of coal, and we work in both those areas. New technologies and solar and wind, hydrogen conversion, all sorts of things going on in the energy space and a lot of demand and we have great assets. Financial markets, hey, we're one of the -- we're a content player, we're not the television set. We're not Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters or FactSet. I look at that, and I go TVs, networks. We're one of the networks. We can plug-in anywhere, and I think we got a great franchise. We -- we've got a very entrepreneurial, a real gritty team, I'd say, that kind of gets in the corners. It's only 15 years old, but it's kind of made a place for itself. And I love that. Automotive, amazing set of diversified assets with real large addressable markets that we're just starting to attack. And it's not SARS. I never have a discussion about SARS. So what are those assets? Answering your question. It's really 6 or 7 assets that you should think about and think about subscription-based not linked to SARS and think about new content creation that's feeding new addressable markets. Those are the 2 things we do. And I wish I could take credit for any of the past acquisitions of Polk, with CARFAX and CARPROOF. Definitely, front and center with Masterminds, but let me tell you how they all come together and why I feel that, that high single digit revenue growth is there for the next 3 to 5 years anyways. So if you go to -- let's start first with the old IHS Automotive, the whole supply chain and OEM forecasting. That's subscription-based. I'd tell you on this trip, I was in to see some of the auto companies. It is deep, strategic relationships where we have large teams working with the OEMs. There's 17 OEMs, and we're engaged in their whole forecasting and building out their plans, and they need us. And our teams are really strong and they've been engaged for a long time. It's subscription-based. It's not tied to auto sales. Good business. We're well positioned there. We then have registration data. That's the old Polk asset. That describes every car in the garage, across the U.S. going back to Henry Ford. Now that asset is very helpful to drive recall. Now recall's a little bit lumpy, but there are regular recalls every year. And when there is one, we have a data set that helps execute that. And because we have such great history, it's really -- it's nicely moated because of the decades of history. So that's a nice combination. And then we built out, again off the registration data, a whole admissions -- this product called VPaC, again, subscription basis, it helps the OEMs report into the regulatory bodies total admissions. So that's a set of businesses. Subscription has a bit of price, well positioned. Now you get to the other bits. So CARFAX, deep vehicle history reporting, just met $20 billion records. It's one of those things where we see all of our friends talking about their kids, their neighbors, themselves building their new app and they say, \"I'm going to build this great travel app. And if I build this app and I get thousands of people coming. And those people are going to be describing themselves, and of course, we're going to create data.\" CARFAX with vehicle history reporting and 65 million CARFAX users, they have that. Vehicle history reporting was the foundation of CARFAX. So you'd start off and you go, \"Yes, but it must be maturing.\" It is maturing in terms of that piece of the business, but subsequently, CARFAX said, \"Let's go into the used car listing business. Okay. And used car listings will be the one chasing the Autotraders, the Cars.com and everybody. And we'll fully integrate vehicle history reporting with used car listings. Double digit growth market for us.\" Next, geez, we know everything about used cars and value of used cars, the accident history on them, we've got everything on the cars. I wonder if lenders and insurers would like that data, double digit growth market. We know all the dealers and service lane is a great place, we should think about that in the future around myCARFAX. So park that for a moment. You then get our acquisition of Masterminds. Masterminds on the dealer floor with only a thousand dealers compared to tens of thousands of dealers that CARFAX has full penetration as well with CARPROOF in Canada, full penetration. So again, introduction and activity is half the sales process. Get on the floor, get a chance to sell something. So Masterminds, we're growing from 1,000 rooftops to 5,000, 10,000, larger. And then like CARFAX, we'll take it to Canada, take it to Europe and have nice growth parameters. But Masterminds is a small, light AI tool, working on the dealer floor to help retention. So sales for keep, retain customers and get them into another. You're in a Mercedes, get you in another Mercedes. Now what do we have that nobody else has? We got this other data set called registration data over here. The registration data describes all the customers. If Manav and I are the Mercedes dealers, then the front row will have Mercedes and everybody else has Audis, BMWs and Lexus. We now know who all you are, that allows us to do what's called conquest and go after, not just retention of these customers but conquest of others, growth engine for our assets. And then the final growth engine with a big -- and that's -- those are big, addressable markets when you lay out the numbers against them. And it's all kind of used car activities. So we've got new car subscriptions, used car growth, not so much SARS-related. So the final bit is, is that the registration data now plays into a new media component, which is large growth, which is the digital marketing. And the digital marketing to go after incentives and to go after those advertising dollars, which are billions, that we have the feed that allows us to target the right ad at the right person because we have the detail of the car in the garage and the second car in the garage, which is very descriptive. So our digital ad revenues are growing off of our registration data. When I couple all that together, I can't find a nonhigh single digit, whether it's 7, 8, 9, 10. My view is, is we can't be that detailed, but I think high single digits there, mid-single digits in financial markets and low single digits in energy, that's something I can say confidently and that's kind of what we're doing. And if anything, people would say, \"You're at the higher end of that. What's next?\" I say, \"Just -- it's half a year. Let's focus on the base story and then grow from there.\"</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Right. So last question in just a minute or so we have left is capital allocation. OPIS was a good deal. AMM sounds like it's a good deal, but I would say they were more midsize-ish. Like is that more of what we should expect or our ambition's greater than that?</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: I think we've said -- one thing I would say is don't expect any transformational deal. You're not going to wake up and see some big merger of equals or anything transformational. And I think that's a story that I'm very confident that we've got so much to do with what we're doing, finishing the integration, getting things done. I've said bolt-on acquisitions, both Jerre and I said those will be part of our course where we see accretive to revenue growth or also opportunity for costs or a combination of both. I will do some bolt-ons and bolt-ons are smaller. And then we're going to always look at the assets we have and make sure that the assets we have are consistent with the 4% to 6% growth story. And of course, over time, we want to shift that growth story -- well, either maintain that growth story with a strong foundation on the lower side of it with opportunity to invest and grow above it or any changes in that portfolio should be accretive to our top line growth. And there, there's addressable markets around all our businesses, of course, we'd like to grow into and those are the types of assets we would always look up.</p><p>MANAV SHIV PATNAIK: Got it. Well, we'll just leave it there in the interest of time. So thank you so much, Lance, for being here. Appreciate it.</p><p>LANCE UGGLA: Thanks. Thanks, Manav.

Yet those vibrations were intermittent and not actually captured or recorded by the snap shot of data that his own aircraft's systems were sending back to Earth every two hours using conventional aerospace technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The result: nobody on the ground was seeing on their computers what the pilots were seeing in the cockpit.</p><p>Now, iJet Technologies Inc., the emerging Seattle company that Schramm leads as chief executive, hopes that will change as the world enters the e-enabled airplane era.</p><p>iJet has developed its own special software, to be installed onboard airliners, to help connect with ground-based systems to monitor and improve an airline's operational efficiency.</p><p>\"We are e-enabling legacy airplanes like Boeing 757s, 737s and Airbus A320s, but our products can also add value even on new aircraft, as well,\" said Schramm, a Delta Air Lines pilot who also has an MBA from Emory University.</p><p>iJet's is not your typical technology startup: its small team of skilled software developers are working side by side with veteran aerospace professionals and pilots to develop its solutions.</p><p>\"Lots of Navy pilots like to say they are pilots during Friday night at the Officers Club, but in my experience not all Navy pilots like being pilots when you have a 2:30 a.m. launch into nasty weather in your fifth month of being gone from home. Early-stage companies are somewhat the same,\" Schramm said. \"They sound cool in the bar and to friends, but they are really not the right place for a lot of folks, so make good choices (on hires) early and correct them fast if you're wrong.\"</p><p>iJet has already has scored a contract coup. Its first customer is Icelandair, an internationally respected though smaller national airline.</p><p>iJet has also snared a second airline customer, whose identity remains under wraps.</p><p>\"Our aim is to enter the market with an innovative early adopter like Icelandair. We're very fortunate that they've chosen to work with us,\" Schramm said.</p><p>Icelandair has made headlines for innovative deals before, such as a partnership with Icelandic music stars Sigur R\u00f3s, who debuted her \"Valtari\" album exclusively onboard Icelandair's planes months before her album was released in stores, and Bj\u00f6rk, whose 2011 \"Biophilia\" album was also released on Icelandair jets.</p><p>Already, Schramm says development tests have shown Icelandair managers on the ground at the airline's hub, Keflav\u00edk International Airport in Iceland, can monitor, in real time, all kinds of data points involving one of its jets as the aircraft sits at the gate at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, including whether its doors are open or closed or its engines are on or off.</p><p>The software, offered on a subscription model, monitors a lot more and also offers predictive analytics.</p><p>\"Real time aircraft data over IP links opens up new opportunities to provide operational insight to airline operators,\" Schramm said. \"Real time data can help managers decide to make costly diversions (to repair an aircraft experiencing trouble) or to allow jets to complete their flights.\"</p><p>Icelandair is in the final stages of implementing the iJet technology. That must wait until the airline's Icelandic regulators give their blessing, Schramm said.</p><p>Competition is emerging fast in this market.</p><p>A small venture firm based in Calgary, Alberta, called Flyth Aerospace Solutions, offers in flight software to airlines with an off-the-shelf product somewhat similar to iJet's, but it uses far more expensive Iridium satellite communications.</p><p>A second, much larger firm, Los-Angeles-based Global Eagle Entertainment, has also been moving fast, buying Emerging Market Communications Inc. of Miramar, Florida, for $550 million in May. EMC offers global satellite-based and broadband services to private and government customers in the aviation and maritime (yachts and ferries) markets.</p><p>As iJet tries to grow its business, Schramm says it may explore partnerships with other companies, such as aerospace hardware manufacturers and connectivity providers, to boost sales.</p><p>iJET TECHNOLOGIES INC.</p><p>Created: 2009</p><p>Founders: Jan Petter Roed and Bill Marks</p><p>CEO: John Schramm</p><p>Headquarters: Seattle</p><p>Number of employees: 17</p><p>Revenue:\"None to some.\"</p><p>Major clients: Iceland Air is the early adopter; a second airline, not yet publicly unidentified.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>LESSONS LEARNED</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Any company that starts from zero needs to start with a product.

At the time, I was a mid-level magazine journalist, working in a dark, low-ceilinged office in midtown New York, spending hour upon hour rewriting prose sent in by correspondents from abroad. It was there, in my tiny office strewn with empty coffee cups, that I picked up the phone to a headhunter who told me that a group of London investors were keen to have me join them to build \"scale\" and \"synergy\" in the burgeoning European internet market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was breathless with excitement. In the late 1990s, pretty much anyone under 40 with loads of ambition wanted to be in the dotcom \"space\". The company I was being wooed by was a high-tech incubator called Antfactory, a start-up venture group comprising former investment bankers and emerging market investors, who were looking to scout - wait for it - \"pan-European b-to-c media deals\". In English, that meant internet media businesses that would produce content for consumers across the continent.</p><p>In retrospect, the fact that a bunch of rich guys with very little operational experience were willing to hire a journalist who had never worked in either technology or finance as a partner in their firm, and give her a six-figure salary and thousands of stock options, was clearly the sign of a market top. It didn't feel like it then, though. This was my opportunity to jump on the first dotcom bandwagon. And reader - I did.</p><p>I've thought about this period in my life a lot in recent years, as the technology sector has risen to ever-frothier heights. A record amount of money has been poured into the sector over the past decade. The advent of huge venture funds such as Japan's SoftBank has added fuel to the market. (SoftBank helped push up the value of WeWork, which ultimately pulled its IPO.)</p><p>Shares in once-touted unicorns such as Uber and Lyft have been falling. And yet, the money keeps flowing. One of the Valley's oldest and most respected funds, Bessemer, recently announced a new bucket of money to invest in later-stage start-ups that want to stay private longer, presumably to avoid the fate of WeWork. All this sounds very familiar to me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">At the turn of</emphasis> the millennium, the tech frenzy was still new. Internet usage was becoming the norm as connectivity improved. People were actually excited to use a Yahoo mail address. Amazon wasn't scary but cool, so much so that Jeff Bezos was named Time's 1999 \"Person of the Year\". It was the same year that Americans' online Christmas shopping doubled.</p><p>The tech market was different back then - frothy, yes, but also fresh. In retrospect, though, it also had much of the hype that I have felt in the technology sector over the past couple of years.</p><p>Then, as now, all asset classes had boomed in sync, fuelled by deregulation, loose monetary policy and too much debt. Tax relief had thrown kerosene on a hot market - one of the triggers for the dotcom bubble 1.0 was the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top marginal capital gains tax rate in the US from 28 per cent to 20 per cent, and in turn made more people more interested in becoming speculative investors.</p><p>Just like the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which mainly benefited large corporations, they aided an asset bubble but not much else; and the lion's share of the benefits went to a handful of firms and people.</p><p>Then, as now, too few people were thinking about experience, or long-term value, or even profits. They were looking for highly mobile young tech enthusiasts who could, as Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick would later put it, \"always be hustling\".</p><p>Antfactory's panglossian goal was to become the Idealab of Europe; a place where start-ups would be not only funded but also created and shaped. In those very-far-away-seeming days of \"Cool Britannia\", it somehow managed to persuade a range of companies including Citigroup to give them $US120 million to invest in European dotcom start-ups.</p><p>They found me because I had just written a cover story for Newsweek on Europe's internet boom. \"Europe's Got Net Fever,\" screamed the headline. \"The Symptoms Are Clear - Hot New Companies, Job Offers Featuring Ferraris and a Certain Swagger as Bright Young Businessfolk Stake Their Claims in Cyberspace.\"</p><p>Yes, it's a bit embarrassing to write these words now. If I had thought much about it, I'd have realised I was coming in as the roller-coaster was shifting into free fall. The covers of American news magazines have been proven to be a reliable counter-indicator of what's happening in the markets.</p><p>The slide began a little over a year after that cover. But there was still plenty of time to spin a story of building \"scale\" and \"synergy\" in the as-yet-fragmented European internet market. Unlike the US, which already had a base of 121 million users who spoke the same language and wanted to buy more and more of the same stuff online, Europe was a collection of countries, each with a unique culture and individual internet markets; the euro had only just been introduced. But optimism was the common language.</p><p>Antfactory, its founders touted, as they collected cheques from established investors in the City, would sit in the centre of it, leveraging these wonderful new economies of scale. It would find the best European dotcoms - in travel, in music, in finance, in health - and mash them together, boosting their global presence and stock valuations.</p><p>Exchanges from London to Frankfurt to Paris would compete to take these new companies public. Riches would be had by all. After all, why have six different travel-booking sites (serving France, Italy, Spain, and so on) when you could have one?</p><p>From where I sat, in my dingy Manhattan office, this was an appealing proposition. In the US, the migration from print publications to online was under way. At Newsweek, we were beginning to suspect our world wouldn't be the same for much longer. Free dinner was still served to editorial staff in the wood-panelled penthouse that had once been a conference room for General Motors. But the company had, to the dismay of the old-timers, finally started cutting back on the expense-able (and often excessive) drinking on the nights that we'd go to press. That, too, was the sign of a market shift.</p><p>So were the fortunes of people like Laurel Touby, one of the freelance writers for the last magazine I'd worked for, Working Woman. Laurel had left journalism to start up a networking group for creative types in online media. I remember once saying to her, \"Laurel, you should really give up journalism and start a business.\" She did, growing her informal networking group into mediabistro.com, which cornered the market for media and PR job listings and was later sold for $US23 million. She promptly bought an apartment so stunning it was featured in The New York Times, and became a start-up investor.</p><p>The idea of trading in the punishing demands of reporting to partake of the riches of the internet was certainly on my mind as I considered Antfactory's offer. I loved being a journalist, but it offered a predictable trajectory: write more features, maybe become a senior editor or a columnist, watch my salary inch up by a paltry 2 per cent every year. Antfactory, on the other hand, offered something new and inherently appealing to a business journalist: the chance to get into the game, rather than just write about it. I told the Ants that I'd come to London to discuss the offer.</p><p>The partners, as it turned out, didn't know much more about technology than me. One had worked mostly in entertainment and luxury brands. Two others were London finance guys, including one whose family was big in Greek shipping. I was a good enough reporter to appreciate the shortcomings of the team.</p><p>Still, the idea of being able to waltz into a high-tech incubator as a partner and scout deals at the height of the dotcom boom was exciting. The stock options might actually be worth something. In a worst-case scenario, I told myself, I would go back to journalism knowing a lot more about the tech industry than I did before I worked in it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I moved to London</emphasis> in December 1998 and plunged into the dotcom scene, where I soon encountered the European equivalent of Laurel's brainchild - a networking salon-cum-headhunting site called First Tuesday. It had been founded in part by Nick Denton, a former Financial Times journalist who would eventually go on to start Gawker, and a Silicon Valley transplant named Julie Meyer. Both of them were more businesspeople than technologists. The DNA of the London start-up scene reflected the DNA of the city itself: it was about money and dealmaking.</p><p>Of that, there was plenty. New jobs - and new companies - were being posted on First Tuesday's website every few minutes. At networking events, Denton and Meyer made it easy to see where the money was - potential investors wore red dots on their lapels; the \"talent\" wore green. The reds, who were rarer and inevitably more popular, would often emerge exhausted after fighting off eager greens over cheap wine and snacks. The group claimed that $US100 million worth of deals had been cut in this manner. I didn't really believe them, but I didn't entirely not believe them.</p><p>Either way, one thing was clear: there was money to be made. It was the roaring '90s after all, in London as well as in Silicon Valley. If the 1980s began the age of greed, then the late 1990s cemented it. It was the era of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, who continued much of the market deregulation that had started under Reagan and Thatcher.</p><p>It was a period when the notion of retiring comfortably with a gold watch and a pension began to slip away, replaced by soccer moms reading Money magazine and hoping to become stockpicking millionaires overnight.(My own mother, a first-grade teacher, was - incredibly - dabbling in biotech stocks, an experiment which shaved 30 per cent off her retirement.)</p><p>Antfactory was, essentially, doing the same - dabbling in things nobody knew enough about. But it was clear to me that the people in charge didn't have the experience and insight to pull it off.</p><p>Most of the opportunities we were looking at were copycats of successful start-ups that had already launched, or ill-advised attempts to create internet arms of existing legacy brands. Although the founders kept a deal flow going and the press kept writing naively positive stories about London's homegrown tech incubator, internally the firm was already starting to revert to what it really was - a collection of ex-City bankers looking to make a quick buck.</p><p>When you pull back the lens, that's really what much of the late 1990s/early 2000s dotcom boom was all about. Far away in Silicon Valley, a handful of companies such as Google, Amazon and PayPal were carving out sustainable niches - and then ringfencing those markets. Then there was everyone else.</p><p>As Hal Varian, who would become Google's chief economist, put it in 2001: \"The obvious corollary to winner-take-all is loser gets nothing, and there will inevitably be many more losers than winners.\"</p><p>True enough. But the frenzy of financial activity was being fuelled by more than just your typical market forces. In retrospect, it reflected the increasingly tight links between the world's financial capitals and tech hubs, and the halls of power in places like Washington and Brussels. The tech industry had lobbied successfully in the 1990s against new accounting standards that would have forced companies to mark the value of options on their books.</p><p>Today, companies such as Apple and Google can take advantage of ultra-low interest rates (which themselves were a response to the 2008 crisis) to issue loads of bonds on the US debt markets and then use the proceeds to pay back the richest shareholders in the form of tax preferential buybacks and dividends, further increasing the wealth divide.</p><p>Back in early 2000, a different problem was emerging - the dotcom boom was turning to bust. The value of the Nasdaq index peaked on March 10 2000. On March 20, Barron's ran a cover story entitled \"Burning Up: Warning - Internet Companies Are Running Out of Cash, Fast.\" It's incredible how similar it seems to the negative sentiment around tech today.</p><p>Then, as now, companies were starting to issue reversals of revenue statements, and investors began to realise that many previously lauded start-ups were more style than substance. Once the Fed decided to raise interest rates, the die was cast. The \"easy money\" had officially run out. Or at least until it was time to reflate the market and create tech bubble 2.0.</p><p>By September 2001, Antfactory's investors had lost patience with the leadership, and demanded they return a $US120 million cash pile and wind down the firm. I often think about those disastrous years and wonder what has changed in the tech world - and what hasn't.</p><p>Today's tech market is so much more developed, with vastly better infrastructure and game-changing innovations such as ubiquitous smartphones. We are only just beginning to move into artificial intelligence, the internet of things, 5G and other areas that many businesses are counting on to propel revenue growth in the future. Certainly, it is harder for companies to receive funding just by sticking \".com\" behind their names.</p><p>Still, there are many things about the current economy that remind me of my time in London. Then, as now, we were in the late stages of a credit cycle, with too much money chasing too little value.</p><p>Investors who were counting on a spate of hot IPOs to buoy the late stage of a boom market were disappointed. Back then, the infamous Pets.com went out of business nine months after its IPO.</p><p>The turning point this time may be Uber's IPO on May 10, one of the most anticipated in history but, in the end, a dismal failure. It marked a top in tech stocks that simply don't make any money, despite their size and disruptive power. Shares in any number of once-hot companies, like Lyft or Slack, have slumped. WeWork has, of course, cancelled its IPO, and seems to be bringing property prices in New York and London down with it.</p><p>It's only the beginning of what I suspect will be a long fall for Big Tech. From 2008 onwards, Silicon Valley took the place of Wall Street as the global hub of corporate wealth and power, creating the world's first trillion-dollar business, growing companies with more users than the planet's largest countries, and reshaping everything from our brains to our elections.</p><p>But just as finance faced an existential crisis a decade ago, so Big Tech is facing one now. The US-China trade and tech war is leading to a \"splinternet,\" which will make it much more difficult for digital giants to grow. There are calls from regulators and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to clamp down on the size and power of the sector.</p><p>I never made any money from those Antfactory shares. In fact, demoralised by listening to people try to make nothing sound like something, I left the company several months before it went bust. But I learnt a few things about bubbles along the way.</p><p>Rana Foroohar is the author of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Dont-Be-Evil-Case-Against/dp/0241427908\">Don't Be Evil: The Case Against Big Tech</url> (Allen Lane) which is published on November 5.</p><p>Bubble trouble: losers in the first dotcom crash</p><p>Pets.com</p><p>Pets.com ballooned from a tiny San Francisco-based start-up in August 1998 to a publicly traded company in February 2000, raising an impressive $US82 million at its IPO, before being put down nine months later due to a faulty business model that underestimated shipping costs and sold most of its goods at a fraction of cost. By November 2000, its stock had plummeted from a high of $US14 per share to a low of 22 cents. Thanks to its excessive marketing spend, which included commissioning a 36ft balloon version of its canine mascot at the 1999 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Pets.com became the most publicised victim of the dotcom bubble.</p><p>Boo.com</p><p>In an industry where timing is everything, Boo.com, Britain's first high-profile internet casualty, was arguably 10 years too early. Launched in the autumn of 1999 by Swedish poetry critic Ernst Malmsten and former model Kajsa Leander, Boo.com aspired to be the go-to site for sports fashion, replete with virtual shop assistant named \"Miss Boo\". It secured investment from the likes of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, and Fortune magazine proclaimed it one of Europe's coolest companies before it had sold a single item. Its ambition was immense - instead of launching in one country, it decided to start with 18 - but its customers' slow dial-up connections and its own lavish spending helped to derail the duo's ambitions. Boo.com burnt through $US135 million of venture capital in just 18 months and was liquidated in May 2000.</p><p>Kozmo</p><p>Founded in New York in 1998 by young investment bankers Joseph Park and Yong Kang, Kozmo tapped into the irresistible business of instant gratification and was a harbinger of high-speed service unicorns Uber and Deliveroo. The company promised free one-hour delivery of games, DVDs, music, magazines, books, food and even cups of Starbucks coffee in several major cities in the US - for no delivery fee. Despite raising $US280 million in capital, and proving popular with college students and yuppies, the company buckled under the weight of its ambitious plans and expansion, failing to turn a profit and eventually closing in April 2001. In March 2018 it relaunched under new ownership with a more realistic focus on the bulk deliveries of groceries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Madeleine Pollard</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520195977</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBT-8BB1-JBJ7-N4K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2910\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

At the time, I was a mid-level magazine journalist, working in a dark, low-ceilinged office in midtown New York, spending hours upon hours rewriting prose sent in by correspondents from abroad. It was there, in my tiny office strewn with empty coffee cups, that I picked up the phone to a headhunter who told me that a group of London investors were keen to have me join them to build \u201cscale\u201d and \u201csynergy\u201d in the burgeoning European internet market.</p><p>I was breathless with excitement. In the late 1990s, pretty much anyone under 40 with loads of ambition wanted to be in the dotcom \u201cspace\u201d. The company I was being wooed by was a high-tech incubator called Antfactory, a start-up venture group comprising former investment bankers and emerging market investors, looking to scout \u2014 wait for it \u2014 \u201cpan-European b-to-c media deals\u201d. In English, that meant internet media businesses that would produce content for consumers across the continent.</p><p>In retrospect, the fact that a bunch of rich guys with very little operational experience were willing to hire a journalist who had never worked in either technology or finance as a partner in their firm, and give her a six-figure salary and thousands of stock options, was clearly the sign of a market top.

One of the Valley\u2019s oldest and most respected funds, Bessemer, recently announced a new bucket of money to invest in later-stage start-ups that want to stay private longer, presumably to avoid the fate of WeWork. All this sounds very familiar to me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">At the turn of</emphasis> the millennium, the tech frenzy was still new. Internet usage was becoming the norm as connectivity improved. People were actually excited to use a Yahoo mail address. Amazon wasn\u2019t scary but cool, so much so that Jeff Bezos was named Time\u2019s 1999 \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d. It was the same year that Americans\u2019 online Christmas shopping doubled.</p><p>The tech market was different back then \u2014 frothy, yes, but also fresh. In retrospect, though, it also had much of the hype that I have felt in the technology sector over the past couple of years. Then, as now, all asset classes had boomed in sync, fuelled by deregulation, loose monetary policy and too much debt. Tax relief had thrown kerosene on a hot market \u2014 one of the triggers for the dotcom bubble 1.0 was the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top marginal capital gains tax rate in the US from 28 per cent to 20 per cent, and in turn made more people more interested in becoming speculative investors. Just like the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which mainly benefited large corporations, they aided an asset bubble but not much else; and the lion\u2019s share of the benefits went to a handful of firms and people.</p><p>Then, as now, too few people were thinking about experience, or long-term value, or even profits. They were looking for highly mobile young tech enthusiasts who could, as Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick would later put it, \u201calways be hustling\u201d. Antfactory\u2019s Panglossian goal was to become the Idealab of Europe; a place where start-ups would be not only funded but also created and shaped. In those very far-away-seeming days of \u201cCool Britannia\u201d, it somehow managed to persuade a range of companies including Citigroup to give them $120m to invest in European dotcom start-ups.</p><p>They found me because I had just written a cover story for Newsweek on Europe\u2019s internet boom. \u201cEurope\u2019s Got Net Fever,\u201d screamed the headline. \u201cThe Symptoms Are Clear\u2014Hot New Companies, Job Offers Featuring Ferraris and a Certain Swagger as Bright Young Businessfolk Stake Their Claims in Cyberspace.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to write these words now. If I had thought much about it, I\u2019d have realised I was coming in as the roller-coaster was shifting into free fall. The covers of American news magazines have been proven to be a reliable counter-indicator of what\u2019s happening in the markets.</p><p>The slide began a little over a year after that cover. But there was still plenty of time to spin a story of building \u201cscale\u201d and \u201csynergy\u201d in the as-yet-fragmented European internet market. Unlike the US, which already had a base of 121m users who spoke the same language and wanted to buy more and more of the same stuff online, Europe was a collection of countries, each with a unique culture and individual internet markets; the euro had only just been introduced. But optimism was the common language.</p><p>Antfactory, its founders touted, as they collected cheques from established investors in the City, would sit in the centre of it, leveraging these wonderful new economies of scale. It would find the best European dotcoms \u2014 in travel, in music, in finance, in health \u2014 and mash them together, boosting their global presence and stock valuations. Exchanges from London to Frankfurt to Paris would compete to take these new companies public. Riches would be had by all. After all, why have six different travel-booking sites (serving France, Italy, Spain, and so on) when you could have one?</p><p>From where I sat, in my dingy Manhattan office, this was an appealing proposition. In the US, the migration from print publications to online was under way. At Newsweek, we were beginning to suspect our world wouldn\u2019t be the same for much longer. Free dinner was still served to editorial staff in the wood-panelled penthouse that had once been a conference room for General Motors. But the company had, to the dismay of the old-timers, finally started cutting back on the expense-able (and often excessive) drinking on the nights that we\u2019d go to press. That, too, was the sign of a market shift.</p><p>So were the fortunes of people like Laurel Touby, one of the freelance writers for the last magazine I\u2019d worked for, Working Woman. Laurel had left journalism to start up a networking group for creative types in online media. I remember once saying to her, \u201cLaurel, you should really give up journalism and start a business.\u201d She did, growing her informal networking group into mediabistro.com, which cornered the market for media and PR job listings and was later sold for $23m. She promptly bought an apartment so stunning it was featured in The New York Times, and became a start-up investor.</p><p>The idea of trading in the punishing demands of reporting to partake of the riches of the internet was certainly on my mind as I considered Antfactory\u2019s offer. I loved being a journalist, but it offered a predictable trajectory: write more features, maybe become a senior editor or a columnist, watch my salary inch up by a paltry 2 per cent every year. Antfactory, on the other hand, offered something new and inherently appealing to a business journalist: the chance to get into the game, rather than just write about it. I told the Ants that I\u2019d come to London to discuss the offer.</p><p>The partners, as it turned out, didn\u2019t know much more about technology than me. One had worked mostly in entertainment and luxury brands. Two others were London finance guys, including one whose family was big in Greek shipping. I was a good enough reporter to appreciate the shortcomings of the team. Still, the idea of being able to waltz into a high-tech incubator as a partner and scout deals at the height of the dotcom boom was exciting. The stock options might actually be worth something. In a worst-case scenario, I told myself, I would go back to journalism knowing a lot more about the tech industry than I did before I worked in it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I moved to London</emphasis> in December 1999 and plunged into the dotcom scene, where I soon encountered the European equivalent of Laurel\u2019s brainchild \u2014 a networking salon-cum-headhunting site called First Tuesday. It had been founded in part by Nick Denton, a former Financial Times journalist who would eventually go on to start Gawker, and a Silicon Valley transplant named Julie Meyer. Both of them were more businesspeople than technologists. The DNA of the London start-up scene reflected the DNA of the city itself: it was about money and dealmaking.</p><p>Of that, there was plenty. New jobs \u2014 and new companies \u2014 were being posted on First Tuesday\u2019s website every few minutes. At networking events, Denton and Meyer made it easy to see where the money was \u2014 potential investors wore red dots on their lapels; the \u201ctalent\u201d wore green. The reds, who were rarer and inevitably more popular, would often emerge exhausted after fighting off eager greens over cheap wine and snacks. The group claimed that $100m worth of deals had been cut in this manner. I didn\u2019t really believe them, but I didn\u2019t entirely <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not </emphasis>believe them.</p><p>Either way, one thing was clear: there was money to be made. It was the roaring \u201990s after all, in London as well as in Silicon Valley. If the 1980s began the age of greed, then the late 1990s cemented it. It was the era of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, who continued much of the market deregulation that had started under Reagan and Thatcher. It was a period when the notion of retiring comfortably with a gold watch and a pension began to slip away, replaced by soccer moms reading Money magazine and hoping to become stockpicking millionaires overnight.(My own mother, a first grade teacher, was \u2014 incredibly \u2014 dabbling in biotech stocks, an experiment which shaved 30 per cent off her retirement.)</p><p>Antfactory was, essentially, doing the same \u2014 dabbling in things nobody knew enough about. But it was clear to me that the people in charge didn\u2019t have the experience and insight to pull it off. Most of the opportunities we were looking at were copycats of successful start-ups that had already launched, or ill-advised attempts to create internet arms of existing legacy brands. Although the founders kept a deal flow going and the press kept writing naively positive stories about London\u2019s homegrown tech incubator, internally the firm was already starting to revert to what it really was \u2014 a collection of ex-City bankers looking to make a quick buck.</p><p>When you pull back the lens, that\u2019s really what much of the late 1990s/early 2000s dotcom boom was all about. Far away in Silicon Valley, a handful of companies such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/d6b12f0c-bf3f-4045-a07b-1e4e49103fd6\">Google</url>, Amazon and PayPal were carving out sustainable niches \u2014 and then ringfencing those markets. Then there was everyone else. As Hal Varian, who would become Google\u2019s chief economist, put it in 2001: \u201cThe obvious corollary to winner-take-all is loser gets nothing, and there will inevitably be many more losers than winners.\u201d</p><p>True enough. But the frenzy of financial activity was being fuelled by more than just your typical market forces. In retrospect, it reflected the increasingly tight links between the world\u2019s financial capitals and tech hubs, and the halls of power in places like Washington and Brussels. The tech industry had lobbied successfully in the 1990s against new accounting standards that would have forced companies to mark the value of options on their books. Today, companies such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/a39a4558-f562-4dca-8774-000246e6eebe\">Apple</url> and Google can take advantage of ultra-low interest rates (which themselves were a response to the 2008 crisis) to issue loads of bonds on the US debt markets and then use the proceeds to pay back the richest shareholders in the form of tax preferential buybacks and dividends, further increasing the wealth divide.</p><p>Back in early 2000, a different problem was emerging \u2014 the dotcom boom was turning to bust. The value of the Nasdaq index peaked on March 10 2000. On March 20, Barron\u2019s ran a cover story entitled \u201cBurning Up: Warning\u2014Internet Companies Are Running Out of Cash, Fast.\u201d It\u2019s incredible how similar it seems to the negative sentiment around tech today. Then, as now, companies were starting to issue reversals of revenue statements, and investors began to realise that many previously lauded start-ups were more style than substance. Once the Fed decided to raise interest rates, the die was cast. The \u201ceasy money\u201d had officially run out. Or at least until it was time to reflate the market and create tech bubble 2.0.</p><p>By September 2001, Antfactory\u2019s investors had lost patience with the leadership, and demanded they return a $120m cash pile and wind down the firm. I often think about those disastrous years and wonder what has changed in the tech world \u2014 and what hasn\u2019t. Today\u2019s tech market is so much more developed, with vastly better infrastructure and game-changing innovations such as ubiquitous smartphones. We are only just beginning to move into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/artificial-intelligence\"> artificial intelligence</url>, the internet of things, 5G and other areas that many businesses are counting on to propel revenue growth in the future. Certainly, it is harder for companies to receive funding just by sticking \u201c.com\u201d behind their names.</p><p>Still, there are many things about the current economy that remind me of my time in London. Then, as now, we were in the late stages of a credit cycle, with too much money chasing too little value. Investors who were counting on a spate of hot IPOs to buoy the late stage of a boom market were disappointed. Back then, the infamous Pets.com went out of business nine months after its IPO. The turning point this time may be Uber\u2019s IPO on May 10, one of the most anticipated in history but, in the end, a dismal failure. It marked a top in tech stocks that simply don\u2019t make any money, despite their size and disruptive power. Shares in any number of once hot companies, like Lyft or Slack, have slumped. WeWork has, of course, cancelled its IPO, and seems to be bringing property prices in New York and London down with it.</p><p>It\u2019s only the beginning of what I suspect will be a long fall for Big Tech. From 2008 onwards, Silicon Valley took the place of Wall Street as the global hub of corporate wealth and power, creating the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar business, growing companies with more users than the planet\u2019s largest countries, and reshaping everything from our brains to our elections. But just as finance faced an existential crisis a decade ago, so Big Tech is facing one now. The US-China trade and tech war is leading to a \u201csplinternet,\u201d which will make it much more difficult for digital giants to grow. There are calls from regulators and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to clamp down on the size and power of the sector.</p><p>I never made any money from those Antfactory shares. In fact, demoralised by listening to people try to make nothing sound like something, I left the company several months before it wound down as an incubator with a large sum returned to investors, and an investment banking business and some portfolio assets sold off. But I learnt a few things about bubbles along the way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rana Foroohar is the FT\u2019s global business columnist.

Pets.com ballooned from a tiny San Francisco-based start-up in August 1998 to a publicly traded company in February 2000, raising an impressive $82m at its IPO, before being put down nine months later due to a faulty business model that underestimated shipping costs and sold most of its goods at a fraction of cost. By November 2000, its stock had plummeted from a high of $14 per share to a low of 22 cents. Thanks to its excessive marketing spend, which included commissioning a 36ft balloon version of its canine mascot at the 1999 Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Pets.com became the most publicised victim of the dotcom bubble.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boo.com</emphasis></p><p>In an industry where timing is everything, Boo.com, Britain\u2019s first high-profile internet casualty, was arguably 10 years too early. Launched in the autumn of 1999 by Swedish poetry critic Ernst Malmsten and former model Kajsa Leander, Boo.com aspired to be the go-to site for sports fashion, replete with virtual shop assistant named \u201cMiss Boo\u201d. It secured investment from the likes of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, and Fortune magazine proclaimed it one of Europe\u2019s coolest companies before it had sold a single item. Its ambition was immense \u2014 instead of launching in one country, it decided to start with 18 \u2014 but its customers\u2019 slow dial-up connections and its own lavish spending helped to derail the duo\u2019s ambitions. Boo.com burnt through $135m of venture capital in just 18 months and was liquidated in May 2000.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kozmo</emphasis></p><p>Founded in New York in 1998 by young investment bankers Joseph Park and Yong Kang, Kozmo tapped into the irresistible business of instant gratification and was a harbinger of high-speed service unicorns Uber and Deliveroo. The company promised free one-hour delivery of games, DVDs, music, magazines, books, food and even cups of Starbucks coffee in several major cities in the US \u2014 for no delivery fee. Despite raising $280m in capital, and proving popular with college students and yuppies, the company buckled under the weight of its ambitious plans and expansion, failing to turn a profit and eventually closing in April 2001. In March 2018 it relaunched under new ownership with a more realistic focus on the bulk deliveries of groceries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"> @FTLifeArts</url> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

View original post here[2]. We can imagine Mark Zuckerberg, sitting ensconced in his bunker inside Facebook HQ, reading every new story about his one-time friend and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes' campaign to force the breakup of Facebook, the company Zuckerberg worked so hard to build. 'How ungrateful,' Zuckerberg probably thinks to himself. That's because Hughes has emerged as what the Washington Post[3] characterized as \"one of [Facebook's] biggest problems.\" It started with a sweeping New York Times op-ed[4], where Hughes declared that Facebook 'should be broken up' and that while he still thinks Mark Zuckerberg is \"a good, moral person\", as Chairman and CEO of Facebook, Zuckerberg has too much power. </p><p> While Facebook gladly paid $5 billion to settle allegations of privacy violations with the FTC, the company is firmly opposed to any kind of anti-monopoly actions. Its argument is simple: Since consumers use social media apps that aren't controlled by Facebook (think Twitter and LinkedIn), it's clear that Facebook doesn't have a monopoly. And when asked about the status of his friendship with Zuckerberg after going public with his allegations, Hughes joked that Zuckerberg probably no longer considers him a friend. The decision to publicly oppose Facebook in the op-ed was a difficult one, he said.  'I knew I would lose some friends over it. And that's okay because some things are that important,' he said. 'But it's been nice on the other side of it, too, to have the argument out there, to speak my mind about what I think and believe.'  In a story about Hughes' campaign to undermine the company he helped create, a company that netted him a fortune ($500 million at the time he cashed out his stake). Hughes left Facebook in 2007 to volunteer for the campaign of then-Senator Barack Obama. But now, according to WaPo[5], Hughes has been making the rounds on Capitol Hill, visiting dozens of lawmakers and regulators at the DOJ and FTC, and presenting a 39-slide PowerPoint deck that he purportedly made himself outlining his argument about Facebook being a monopoly. Hughes' argument depends on the vast user base of Facebook and Instagram, and the company's acquisitiveness, which helps to stifle competition by discouraging challengers. Facebook's wealth and power and massive user base have pushed it into monopoly territory, and its acquisitions of rivals have squashed competition. More than 2.7 billion people use Facebook or its other platforms, which include Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp, at least once a month, Facebook said Wednesday.  \"I hope that my speaking out provides cover to a lot of other folks, whether former employees or current ones, to express ambivalence or concern about what's going on,\" Hughes said in an interview Thursday. \"And I think there's a lot to be concerned about.\"  The former Facebook spokesman is also trying to convince other ex-employees with reservations about the company's largess to speak out. But the fact that a former executive are making these criticisms is a huge boon for trust-busters. It threatens not just Facebook, but the other tech giants of Silicon Valley. Hughes has effectively become the most effective lobbyist for the 'break up Facebook' crowd, and he's doing all of this work for free. And that's bad news for Facebook, because breaking up big tech has become a bipartisan issue, embraced by President Trump and Dems like Elizabeth Warren. To be sure, Hughes isn't the only former Facebook executive or early investor to criticize the company: Sean Parker and Robert McNamee and other former senior executives have also criticized Facebook over its business practices, but they haven't been lobbying for breaking up Facebook. Hughes has reportedly been a useful resource for anti-trust lawyers who have been working on a new argument for breaking up Facebook. Soon after, Hughes was contacted by two prominent antitrust scholars, Scott Hemphill of New York University School of Law and Tim Wu of Columbia Law School. The two academics and longtime collaborators had been developing an argument for breaking up Facebook in the form of the slide presentation. To them, the purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp represented a 'plain-vanilla violation of antitrust law, just low-hanging fruit,' Wu said in an interview. They began to pitch lawmakers and regulators together.  Academics and lawmakers who have worked with Hughes say he has helped explain the motivations and viewpoints of key players at Facebook, including Zuckerberg - although Hughes says he has no specific insider knowledge. They say Hughes can frame the business practices of present-day Silicon Valley in ways that jibe with largely untested antitrust laws that were written for major oil and rail companies decades ago.  [...]  Hughes's feedback shaped the scholars' case, as he helped them understand how executives in Silicon Valley think about competition \u2014 it tends to be measured by viral growth rather than by size, said Hemphill, the New York University professor. At the time, the two professors were working on a roadshow, which they asked Hughes to join.  Rhode Island Congressman David Cicilline say Hughes has helped inform his views about whether Facebook might be a monopoly. \"The thing that stuck with mewas he focused on Facebook's revenue as a true measure of its role in the marketplace,' Cicilline recalled. \"Facebook captures over 80 percent of all global social media revenue and controls 58 percent of the U.S. social media market. That's significant.\"  So, how will Zuckerberg counter Hughes? The company has hired an army of lobbyists in the wake of its twin scandals, data privacy violations and its failure to stamp out fake accounts. But given his resources, Hughes is going to be a difficult critic to discredit and stamp out.

Now he's in the hot seat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In September, Google's parent company Alphabet refused to send its chief executive Larry Page or Pichai to testify before a Senate intelligence committee hearing. So U.S. senators set out a chair bearing Google's name and repeatedly took shots at the internet giant for being a no-show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Tuesday, Pichai will embark on a peacemaking mission in Washington with his first-ever appearance before Congress. He'll likely face the bipartisan backlash that has battered the internet giant's rivals like Facebook for months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We recognize the important role of governments, including this committee, in setting rules for the development and use of technology,\" Pichai will say, according to testimony posted Monday on the House Judiciary Committee's website.</p><p> The hearing before the House Judiciary Committee marks the beginning of a new political reality for Pichai, an engineer by training who grew up in Chennai, India, and is far more at home on Google's Mountain View, California, campus than on Capitol Hill. Once a darling of the Obama administration, Google is facing tougher scrutiny of its business practices and new threats of regulation from the Trump administration.</p><p> Lawmakers have held hearings in recent months discussing the need for stronger federal protections regulating the collection of people's personal online information. State attorneys general have also discussed alleged antitrust violations and Republican allegations of censorship of conservative voices.</p><p> Though the possibility of legislation to curb the power of tech companies still remains slim, with regulation-shy Republicans controlling the Senate, public statements from Democrats have increasingly put Google and others on the defensive.</p><p> Expected to top the agenda of Tuesday's hearing,\"Transparency &amp; Accountability: Examining Google and Its Data Collection, Use and Filtering Practices\": Republican allegations of bias against conservatives in search results.</p><p> In his prepared testimony, Pichai tackled the allegations head on.</p><p> \"I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests,\" Pichai wrote. \"We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions \u2013 and we have no shortage of them among our own employees.\"</p><p> He also painted Google as a company that supports privacy legislation (\"We have invested an enormous amount of work over the years to bring choice, transparency, and control to our users\") and a company that has deep American roots, in anticipation of questions over Google's possible plans to re-enter the China search market with a product that censors results sensitive to Beijing.</p><p>Google abandoned that market in 2010 over concerns about censorship and government intrusion. A number of House Judiciary Committee members sent a letter to Pichai earlier this year demanding more information on the project codenamed Dragonfly. Facing a revolt from employees, Pichai has said Google has not yet decided whether to move forward with the search product.</p><p> Other topics will likely include Google's handling of user data and its handling of sexual harassment cases. More than 20,000 employees walked off the job in November to protest revelations in a New York Times article that the company quietly paid out millions to male executives accused of misconduct.</p><p> \"Online technology is now an integral part of most Americans' modern lifestyle. It has globalized society and made it possible for people to connect across continents, explore vast amounts of information, and share meaningful dialogue with friends. However, the technology behind online services like social media and Internet search engines can also be used to suppress particular viewpoints and manipulate public opinion,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in a statement. \"Americans put their trust in big tech companies to honor freedom of speech and champion open dialogue, and it is Congress' responsibility to the American people to make sure these tech giants are transparent and accountable in their practices.\"</p><p> More: Google CEO Sundar Pichai to testify before Congress, answer questions on conservative bias</p><p> More: Google CEO Sundar Pichai bound for Washington as Trump takes aim at search engine</p><p> Until now, the internet giant has largely avoided heavy scrutiny from Washington even as concerns mount over its dominance of the search business around the world and the spread of disinformation and conspiracy theories on its YouTube video service.</p><p> That changed a few months ago when Google refused to send Page or Pichai, offering up Kent Walker, its top lawyer. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, rejected that offer. Instead, lawmakers grilled Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about Russian election meddling, online privacy and political bias on tech platforms and then cranked up public criticism of Google.</p><p> A trip to Capitol Hill was hastily arranged. Pichai, 46, met with lawmakers from both parties, including a sit down with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, and agreed to appear before Congress.</p><p> Since then, Pichai has been working to solidify relationships with GOP lawmakers and conservative groups. Last week, he took part in a White House business roundtable that included other tech leaders such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Oracle co-chief executive Safra Catz.</p><p> President Donald Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, have accused Silicon Valley companies of liberal bias that has led to the suppression and censorship of conservative voices. In August, Trump claimed search results for \"Trump News\" were \"RIGGED, for me &amp; others, so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD.\" Google has repeatedly denied any political bias in Internet search results.</p><p> McCarthy had also chastised Google for search results, tweeting that results that incorrectly said the ideology of the California Republican Party included \"Nazism\" were a \"disgrace.\" Google blamed \"vandalism\" at Wikipedia.</p><p> More: 'Fake social,' 'fake search' are the new 'fake news' as Trump attacks tech ahead of midterms</p><p> More: Trump says Google ignored his State of the Union address; Google disagrees</p><p> In his prepared testimony, Pichai emphasized the political diversity of Google employees. \"Some of our Googlers are former servicemen and women who have risked much in defense of our country. Some are civil libertarians who fiercely defend freedom of expression. Some are parents who worry about the role technology plays in our households. Some\u2014like me\u2014are immigrants to this country, profoundly grateful for the freedoms and opportunities it offers. Some of us are many of these things,\" he wrote.</p><p> Censorship charges have been raised in multiple hearings on Capitol Hill against Silicon Valley tech companies. A recent poll from the Media Research Center conducted by McLaughlin &amp; Associates found that 65 percent of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies intentionally censor the political right.</p><p> Until recently, lawmakers had focused their criticism on Facebook, after a series of privacy blunders and the unchecked spread of online propaganda by Russia agents during and after the 2016 presidential election.

Now he's in the hot seat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In September, Google's parent company Alphabet refused to send its chief executive Larry Page or Pichai to testify before a Senate intelligence committee hearing. So U.S. senators set out a chair bearing Google's name and repeatedly took shots at the internet giant for being a no-show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Tuesday, Pichai will embark on a peacemaking mission in Washington with his first-ever appearance before Congress. He'll likely face the bipartisan backlash that has battered the internet giant's rivals like Facebook for months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We recognize the important role of governments, including this committee, in setting rules for the development and use of technology,\" Pichai will say, according to testimony posted Monday on the House Judiciary Committee's website.</p><p> The hearing before the House Judiciary Committee marks the beginning of a new political reality for Pichai, an engineer by training who grew up in Chennai, India, and is far more at home on Google's Mountain View, California, campus than on Capitol Hill. Once a darling of the Obama administration, Google is facing tougher scrutiny of its business practices and new threats of regulation from the Trump administration.</p><p> Lawmakers have held hearings in recent months discussing the need for stronger federal protections regulating the collection of people's personal online information. State attorneys general have also discussed alleged antitrust violations and Republican allegations of censorship of conservative voices.</p><p> Though the possibility of legislation to curb the power of tech companies still remains slim, with regulation-shy Republicans controlling the Senate, public statements from Democrats have increasingly put Google and others on the defensive.</p><p> Expected to top the agenda of Tuesday's hearing,\"Transparency &amp; Accountability: Examining Google and Its Data Collection, Use and Filtering Practices\": Republican allegations of bias against conservatives in search results.</p><p> In his prepared testimony, Pichai tackled the allegations head on.</p><p> \"I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests,\" Pichai wrote. \"We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions \u2013 and we have no shortage of them among our own employees.\"</p><p> He also painted Google as a company that supports privacy legislation (\"We have invested an enormous amount of work over the years to bring choice, transparency, and control to our users\") and a company that has deep American roots, in anticipation of questions over Google's possible plans to re-enter the China search market with a product that censors results sensitive to Beijing.</p><p>Google abandoned that market in 2010 over concerns about censorship and government intrusion. A number of House Judiciary Committee members sent a letter to Pichai earlier this year demanding more information on the project codenamed Dragonfly. Facing a revolt from employees, Pichai has said Google has not yet decided whether to move forward with the search product.</p><p> Other topics will likely include Google's handling of user data and its handling of sexual harassment cases. More than 20,000 employees walked off the job in November to protest revelations in a New York Times article that the company quietly paid out millions to male executives accused of misconduct.</p><p> \"Online technology is now an integral part of most Americans' modern lifestyle. It has globalized society and made it possible for people to connect across continents, explore vast amounts of information, and share meaningful dialogue with friends. However, the technology behind online services like social media and Internet search engines can also be used to suppress particular viewpoints and manipulate public opinion,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in a statement. \"Americans put their trust in big tech companies to honor freedom of speech and champion open dialogue, and it is Congress' responsibility to the American people to make sure these tech giants are transparent and accountable in their practices.\"</p><p> More: Google CEO Sundar Pichai to testify before Congress, answer questions on conservative bias</p><p> More: Google CEO Sundar Pichai bound for Washington as Trump takes aim at search engine</p><p> Until now, the internet giant has largely avoided heavy scrutiny from Washington even as concerns mount over its dominance of the search business around the world and the spread of disinformation and conspiracy theories on its YouTube video service.</p><p> That changed a few months ago when Google refused to send Page or Pichai, offering up Kent Walker, its top lawyer. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, rejected that offer. Instead, lawmakers grilled Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about Russian election meddling, online privacy and political bias on tech platforms and then cranked up public criticism of Google.</p><p> A trip to Capitol Hill was hastily arranged. Pichai, 46, met with lawmakers from both parties, including a sit down with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, and agreed to appear before Congress.</p><p> Since then, Pichai has been working to solidify relationships with GOP lawmakers and conservative groups. Last week, he took part in a White House business roundtable that included other tech leaders such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Oracle co-chief executive Safra Catz.</p><p> President Donald Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, have accused Silicon Valley companies of liberal bias that has led to the suppression and censorship of conservative voices. In August, Trump claimed search results for \"Trump News\" were \"RIGGED, for me &amp; others, so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD.\" Google has repeatedly denied any political bias in Internet search results.</p><p> McCarthy had also chastised Google for search results, tweeting that results that incorrectly said the ideology of the California Republican Party included \"Nazism\" were a \"disgrace.\" Google blamed \"vandalism\" at Wikipedia.</p><p> More: 'Fake social,' 'fake search' are the new 'fake news' as Trump attacks tech ahead of midterms</p><p> More: Trump says Google ignored his State of the Union address; Google disagrees</p><p> In his prepared testimony, Pichai emphasized the political diversity of Google employees. \"Some of our Googlers are former servicemen and women who have risked much in defense of our country. Some are civil libertarians who fiercely defend freedom of expression. Some are parents who worry about the role technology plays in our households. Some\u2014like me\u2014are immigrants to this country, profoundly grateful for the freedoms and opportunities it offers. Some of us are many of these things,\" he wrote.</p><p> Censorship charges have been raised in multiple hearings on Capitol Hill against Silicon Valley tech companies. A recent poll from the Media Research Center conducted by McLaughlin &amp; Associates found that 65 percent of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies intentionally censor the political right.</p><p> Until recently, lawmakers had focused their criticism on Facebook, after a series of privacy blunders and the unchecked spread of online propaganda by Russia agents during and after the 2016 presidential election. CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill in April.</p><p>Google was frequently mentioned during a meeting earlier this year with then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and state law enforcement officials exploring potential antitrust and data privacy investigations.</p><p> Reports that Google employees debated ways to alter search results after the 2016 presidential election and an internal video obtained by right-wing news site Breitbart showing executives of Alphabet expressing dismay at the outcome of the presidential election added fuel to charges by the political right that Google is biased against conservatives.</p><p> \"Recent reports suggest Google might not be wielding its vast power impartially. Its business practices may have been affected by political bias. Additionally, reports claim the company is compromising its core principles by complying with repressive censorship mandates from China,\" McCarthy said in a statement. \"Mr. Pichai's scheduled appearance in front of the House Judiciary Committee is another important step to restoring public trust in Google and all the companies that shape the internet.\"</p><p> This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'I lead this company without political bias,' Google CEO Sundar Pichai to testify before Congress</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-634294e5d725f17a453ca887395c6bc16e302555</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5FFB38D3AE NWBKMD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY1-KDP1-JBCN-439G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1455\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Herald-Mail.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Rousseau, Hobbes, Spinoza, Kant, Mill et Marx ont \u00e9labor\u00e9 des points de vue sur la politique et l'\u00e9thique qui ont travers\u00e9 les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations. Ces philosophes avaient des opinions extr\u00eamement diff\u00e9rentes, mais aucun n'\u00e9tait motiv\u00e9 par le profit et les recettes trimestrielles. Ils se pr\u00e9occupaient uniquement de proposer des id\u00e9es sur l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, la libert\u00e9, la solidarit\u00e9 et la possibilit\u00e9 d'une vie meilleure pour tous.</p><p>D\u00e9sormais, ce sont les manifestes des Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg, Jobs et Brin qui orientent le d\u00e9veloppement des institutions et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Plus encore, c'est leur technologie elle-m\u00eame qui fa\u00e7onne notre monde. Nous avons \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 identifier les externalit\u00e9s n\u00e9gatives \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle globale, ainsi que les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes sociaux et moraux d'un monde dans lequel des milliards d'individus utilisent leurs appareils connect\u00e9s plusieurs heures par jour.</p><p>La situation n'est pas tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente de la lente destruction de nos \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes mondiaux. C'est rien de moins qu'une trag\u00e9die des communs num\u00e9riques et une d\u00e9composition du tissu de nos mondes sociaux. Les penseurs Lessig, Zuboff, Rushkoff, Morozov, Harari et beaucoup d'autres ont point\u00e9 les inqui\u00e9tudes que font na\u00eetre les mod\u00e8les commerciaux extractifs, le capitalisme de surveillance et l'exploitation fond\u00e9e sur les donn\u00e9es.</p><p> Les cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9elles de nos actes </p><p>Hormis ce contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9vident, la technologie a un impact insidieux sur l'univers de notre vie connect\u00e9e: la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 du mal. Comme il se pr\u00e9sente aujourd'hui, le monde en ligne sape la morale telle qu'elle s'est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e au cours du temps. C'est le point le plus probl\u00e9matique, car toute une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration mondiale est en train de grandir en ligne. Or, ce monde encourage la propagation de la radicalisation, du terrorisme, des \u00abfake news\u00bb, de la misogynie, des discours de haine, du racisme, du harc\u00e8lement, de l'usurpation d'identit\u00e9, de l'intimidation en ligne, de la pornographie infantile et des abus sexuels sur enfants, etc.</p><p>Le monde en ligne contribue \u00e0 faire oublier les principes moraux qui dictent notre comportement, \u00e0 masquer les cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9elles de nos actes sur des personnes r\u00e9elles du monde r\u00e9el, \u00e0 encourager chacun \u00e0 se construire une r\u00e9putation en repoussant toujours plus loin les limites de la m\u00e9chancet\u00e9 et de la cruaut\u00e9, \u00e0 r\u00e9ifier les individus, \u00e0 les inciter \u00e0 se livrer \u00e0 une comparaison effr\u00e9n\u00e9e entre eux et les autres. Les plates-formes de m\u00e9dias sociaux tels que YouTube, Twitter et Facebook sont des outils spectaculaires, mais ce sont aussi de v\u00e9ritables machines \u00e0 fum\u00e9e morale qui g\u00e9n\u00e8rent un brouillard dans lequel beaucoup perdent leurs rep\u00e8res et sombrent dans les eaux boueuses des chambres d'\u00e9cho et de la propagande.</p><p>Un m\u00e9lange toxique de m\u00e9canismes et de propensions contribue \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ce brouillard moral: algorithmes, mod\u00e8les commerciaux des plates-formes en ligne, rassemblement de personnes d'opinions identiques, bulles de filtrage, effondrement des fronti\u00e8res priv\u00e9-public, r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle, comportement addictif, anonymat apparent et personnalisation.</p><p>La nouvelle technologie num\u00e9rique s'accompagne en outre d'une large \u00absouplesse interpr\u00e9tative\u00bb. Comme ces environnements sont nouveaux, les normes et les attitudes qu'ils impliquent ne sont pas encore solidement \u00e9tablies, et les utilisateurs ignorent la nature et les objectifs de la technologie. Ce qui veut dire que nous sommes de plus en plus amen\u00e9s \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer notre conduite comme relativement inoffensive et autoris\u00e9e. Les mondes sociaux en ligne ont r\u00e9pandu partout la souplesse interpr\u00e9tative.</p><p> Boussole morale </p><p>Les militaires utilisent l'expression \u00abbrouillard de la guerre\u00bb pour qualifier les circonstances dans lesquelles il devient extr\u00eamement difficile d'appliquer nos r\u00e8gles morales - comme, par exemple, d\u00e9terminer qui est innocent et qui peut \u00eatre cibl\u00e9 quand il est impossible de distinguer l'ami de l'ennemi. De nombreuses situations sont capables d'\u00abembrouiller\u00bb notre boussole morale, et les actuels mondes sociaux en ligne en offrent d'innombrables et spectaculaires exemples.</p><p>La t\u00e2che qui nous incombe n'est donc pas seulement d'accro\u00eetre les efforts de r\u00e9gulation chaque fois que nous d\u00e9couvrons de nouvelles violations de nos valeurs sur les r\u00e9seaux en ligne. Elle consiste aussi \u00e0 mieux comprendre comment les conditions de ces univers \u00abembrouillent\u00bb la compr\u00e9hension morale, \u00e0 \u00e9radiquer (l\u00e0 o\u00f9 c'est possible) les sources m\u00eames de ce brouillard moral et \u00e0 concevoir de meilleures fa\u00e7ons d'en \u00e9viter les \u00e9cueils.</p><p>Au XXIesi\u00e8cle, il serait parfaitement gratuit de parler de d\u00e9mocratie, d'autonomie, de vie priv\u00e9e et de redevabilit\u00e9 sans r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont nous pouvons int\u00e9grer ces valeurs et ces id\u00e9aux moraux dans notre monde num\u00e9rique. L'\u00e9thique doit intervenir dans la conception m\u00eame du codage informatique, des algorithmes et des infrastructures, sous peine de perdre sa pertinence et de devenir obsol\u00e8te.</p><p>(Traduit de l'anglais par Gilles Berton.)</p><p>Jeroen van den Hovenoccupe la chaire \u00e9thique et technologie \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de technologie de Delft (Pays-Bas).

But for years John Deere has been selling tractors that practically drive themselves for use on farms in America's heartland, where there are few pesky pedestrians or federal rules to get in the way. </p><p>For a glimpse at the future, meet Jason Poole, a 34-year-old crop consultant from Kansas. After a long day of meetings earlier this month and driving five hours across the state to watch his little girl's softball game, he was still able to run his John Deere tractor until 2 a.m. thanks to technology that left most of the driving up to a computer. </p><p>The land is hilly on Poole's family farm, so he drives the first curved row manually to teach the layout to his tractor's guidance system and handles the turns himself. But after that, he takes his hands off the steering wheel and allows the tractor to finish. </p><p>\"We kind of laugh when we see news stories about self-driving cars, because we've had that for years,\" Poole said. </p><p>And the advancements being rolled out on the farm could soon show up next door: Your neighbor can already replace his lawn mower with the John Deere equivalent of a Roomba robotic vacuum for his yard. </p><p>The self-driving technology being sold by John Deere and some of its competitors are less technically complex than the fully driverless cars that big tech companies and car manufacturers are working on. And for now, the tractors are still supposed to have a driver behind the wheel - even if they never touch it. </p><p>But they've already started to transform farming in America and abroad: John Deere is selling auto-steering and other self-guidance tech in more than 100 countries, said Cory Reed, vice president of the company's Intelligent Solutions Group. </p><p>\"John Deere is the largest operator of autonomous vehicles,\" said Catherine J.K. Sandoval, a California public utilities commissioner at a recent event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>Some farmers aren't shy about their enthusiasm for the tech - even uploading videos showing it off online. One appears to show a tractor hauling a planter making a tightly choreographed turn without a driver in the cab. In another, the driver takes pictures, throws paper airplanes and balances a water bottle on his nose before appearing to nod off while the tractor keeps working his field. </p><p>The systems come with their own risks, including concerns that they could be hacked. But because farm-equipment makers operate almost exclusively on private land, they've been able to bring products to market much quicker than consumer automakers - and without the same level of regulatory scrutiny. </p><p>There are no federal rules specifically addressing self-driving tech for tractors, largely because farm equipment is designed for use in fields where it doesn't pose the same level of risk to other vehicles or people as a self-driving vehicle on a public road. The closest thing to national regulations are safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but the agency does not have any rules directly aimed at self-driving technology. </p><p>That lack of regulations is one reason that the future reached the farm first. But another is pure necessity: There's a labor crunch in rural America - young people move to the cities, leaving the average age of U.S. farmers at 58, according to the Department of Agriculture. Similar forces are pushing self-driving tech into other industrial sectors at a pace that outstrips the consumer market. Earlier this year, the first self-driving semi-truck licensed to drive on public roads in the United States made its debut in Nevada with a splashy press show. And self-driving trucks are already being rolled out for mining and oil operations in remote parts of the world. </p><p>The success of self-driving tech in agriculture could serve as a guiding post for carmakers who are now trying to figure out how to move similar technologies onto U.S. streets. </p><p>Tractor makers started exploring the possibility of putting software in the driver's seat decades ago. At first, they used satellite technology to help farmers plot courses that they could drive manually. About 15 years ago John Deere started using similar systems to guide the tractors automatically, Reed said. </p><p>Crops are generally planted in one long row after another - and farmers want to make sure they use up all their land. Before auto-steering, that often meant a few feet would get reworked in every row. But with modern technology, that overlap can be reduced to less than an inch so it takes fewer passes to cover each field - saving farmers time and money. </p><p>Tractor-buyers today can pile on modular systems that give computers more and more control over operations. You start with a basic satellite guidance system and a touchscreen interface, but from there the options are almost endless. Some add-ons let the tractor make very precise turns without the driver even touching the steering wheel. Others uses radio base-stations set up around fields to provide even more accurate navigation than satellites. </p><p>And John Deere isn't the only company selling this kind of tech; its main competitor, Case IH, markets similar systems as do a slew of lesser-known companies. Some are going even further than modifying existing tractor designs: The aptly named Autonomous Tractor Corp. designed a fully autonomous tractor prototype that looks like a golden boxy tank, but without a seat for a driver. </p><p>The systems are pricey: Outfitting a new tractor with top-of-the-line auto-steering, navigation and guidance tech could cost upwards of $20,000, Reed said. There are also activation and subscriptions fees if farmers want to use the company's satellite or radio signals. </p><p>And there are risks to reliance on software. Poole said that one neighbor using self-driving technology downloaded a software update that disabled his tractor for a week in the middle of planting season this spring. If a system is working, farmers will often hold off on updates rather than risk complications, he said. </p><p>Those gaps could raise added cybersecurity risks. John Deere takes this issue seriously, Reed said, and encrypts its systems to protect them from hackers. </p><p>Still, issues like digital security fears, along with more traditional physical safety concerns, make it hard for consumer automakers to get their self-driving vehicles past various regulators and on to public roads. But tractor makers have shown that much of the technology needed to fulfill the promise of autonomous vehicles is already here. </p><p>\"All of the things we're doing on the farm will find their way into the consumer market in the coming years,\" Reed said.</p><p><br/>In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-UON5921190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GBJ-TH11-DXCW-D3YP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>July 1, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>National</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

It is now part of everyday life and developing at such a speed that legislators and governments are struggling to keep up.</p><p>We have just started using a Google Home device in the Umunna household. It\u2019s a smart speaker similar to Amazon Alexa that answers your questions, gets the news, plays songs, and enables you to control other apps, (like Spotify), hands free, using your own voice. We weren\u2019t really following yesterday\u2019s Wimbledon men\u2019s final so during the match I asked Google Home and it told me what the current score was.</p><p>According to a report from this January, almost a quarter (21 per cent) of adults in the US now own a smart speaker with the figures rising, and here in the UK we seem to be following the same trend. At the very least, policymakers need to be consistent in their approach to the ever increasing tech usage \u2013 but this is not the case at present.</p><p>One example is the US authorities. On the one hand, they seem keen to ensure that the enormous tech companies play by the rules and contribute to the common good. So at the end of last week the US Federal Trade Commission (which performs much the same functions as the UK\u2019s Consumer and Markets Authority) reportedly approved a $5bn (\u00a34bn) settlement with Facebook over allegations that the latter had inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now defunct Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.</p><p>On the other hand, in a knee-jerk response coloured by economic nationalism, Donald Trump has threatened to hit French goods with extra tariffs in retaliation for the French government announcing last week the imposition of a 3 per cent levy on large, mostly US, digital companies\u2019 local revenues.</p><p>President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s administration in Paris is of the view that the tech companies are paying little or no tax. The French tech tax will apply to tech companies with global sales of over \u20ac750m (\u00a3673m) which make more than \u20ac25m (\u00a322m) in France.</p><p>The advent of new technologies, the rise of automation, artificial intelligence and digitisation has brought many benefits, facilitating better and more efficient methods of communication, knowledge acquisition, working, shopping, spending our leisure time, travelling and generally organising our lives. It has the potential to revolutionise public services.</p><p>But the advent of the new super-tech platforms in particular has concentrated power and wealth in the hands of a small number of people, new technologies are being used to facilitate abuse, crime and terrorism and to enable foreign powers to challenge our democratic processes and national security.

It is now part of everyday life and developing at such a speed that legislators and governments are struggling to keep up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have just started using a Google Home device in the Umunna household. It's a smart speaker similar to Amazon Alexa that answers your questions, gets the news, plays songs, and enables you to control other apps, (like Spotify), hands free, using your own voice. We weren't really following yesterday's Wimbledon men's final so during the match I asked Google Home and it told me what the current score was.</p><p>According to </p><p>a report from this January</p><p>, almost a quarter (21 per cent) of adults in the US now own a smart speaker with the figures rising, and </p><p>here in the UK</p><p> we seem to be following the same trend. At the very least, policymakers need to be consistent in their approach to the ever increasing tech usage - but this is not the case at present.</p><p>One example is the US authorities. On the one hand, they seem keen to ensure that the enormous tech companies play by the rules and contribute to the common good. So at the end of last week the US Federal Trade Commission (which performs much the same functions as the UK's Consumer and Markets Authority) reportedly approved a</p><p>$5bn (\u00a34bn) settlement with Facebook</p><p> over allegations that the latter had inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now defunct Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.</p><p>On the other hand, in a knee-jerk response coloured by economic nationalism,</p><p>Donald</p><p>Trump</p><p> has threatened to hit French goods with extra tariffs in retaliation for the French government announcing last week the imposition of a 3 per cent levy on large, mostly US, digital companies' local revenues.</p><p>President Emmanuel Macron's administration in Paris is of the view that the tech companies are paying little or no tax. The French tech tax will apply to tech companies with global sales of over (EURO)750m (\u00a3673m) which make more than (EURO)25m (\u00a322m) in France.</p><p>The advent of new technologies, the rise of automation, artificial intelligence and digitisation has brought many benefits, facilitating better and more efficient methods of communication, knowledge acquisition, working, shopping, spending our leisure time, travelling and generally organising our lives. It has the potential to revolutionise public services.</p><p>But the advent of the new super-tech platforms in particular has concentrated power and wealth in the hands of a small number of people, new technologies are being used to facilitate abuse, crime and terrorism and to enable foreign powers to challenge our democratic processes and national security.One need only look at the increasing amount of police time and resources taken up with dealing with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/british-police-cybercrime-hacking\">cybercrime and online fraud</url>, to see the downside</p><p>Vast quantities of our personal data is now held by others, not necessarily within our control, and public policy and legal frameworks are struggling to keep pace.

Mark Zuckerberg lui-m\u00eame appelle ces jours-ci \u00e0 davantage de r\u00e9gulation des r\u00e9seaux sociaux.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pour am\u00e9liorer le contr\u00f4le par la puissance publique, certains, telle Hannah Fry, math\u00e9maticienne \u00e0 University College of London, qui vient de publier un livre sur les donn\u00e9es et algorithmes (Hello World: How to be human in the age of the machine. Penguin, 2018) sugg\u00e8rent d'instaurer une autorit\u00e9 r\u00e9gulatrice des algorithmes, sur le mod\u00e8le de l'Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament et des produits de sant\u00e9, ou de la Food and Drug Administration des Etats-Unis.</p><p>Une telle proposition m\u00e9rite attention car elle sugg\u00e8re que les algorithmes - aujourd'hui principalement ceux des r\u00e9seaux sociaux mais demain tous ceux regroup\u00e9 sous le terme d'\u00ab<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/festival/article/2018/10/25/yoshua-bengio-l-intelligence-artificielle-doit-etre-utilisee-en-accord-avec-des-principes-moraux_5374152_4415198.html?xtmc=intelligence_artificielle_dangers&amp;xtcr=16\">intelligence artificielle</url>\u00bb - pr\u00e9sentent un potentiel de dangerosit\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 avant commercialisation.</p><p> Une agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des algorithmes? </p><p>Selon cette analogie, les algorithmes apportent un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice mais peuvent avoir des effets secondaires n\u00e9fastes (enfermement dans des bulles informationnelles, comportements addictifs, effondrement des pratiques d\u00e9mocratiques\u2026). Une agence ind\u00e9pendante pourrait les analyser \u00abex ante\u00bb pour, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, autoriser leur d\u00e9ploiement, leur mise sur le march\u00e9. Il s'agit donc pour Hannah Fry d'aller au-del\u00e0 des propositions d'Elizabeth Warren et de Margrethe Vestager d'une mise en concurrence et d'une surveillance par une autorit\u00e9, telle la Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libert\u00e9s (Cnil), mais de contr\u00f4le administratif pr\u00e9alable.</p><p>Cette proposition, aussi int\u00e9ressante qu'elle apparaisse a priori, oublie un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel: les algorithmes ne sont pas uniquement des objets scientifiques (math\u00e9matiques ou informatiques) \u00e9valuables a priori, mais ils doivent \u00eatre analys\u00e9s dans un cadre de sciences sociales via leur impact \u00e0 moyen terme. Sans avoir les cons\u00e9quences dramatiques de Skynet dans la saga des films Terminator, tout algorithme social - une recette visant \u00e0 obtenir un r\u00e9sultat (un comportement) en utilisant certains ingr\u00e9dients (stimuli) - \u00e9chappe par construction \u00e0 son concepteur.</p><p>L'algorithme n'est qu'une m\u00e9thode nouvelle pour un but ancien. En effet le principe m\u00eame de toute politique publique est d'influencer les comportements des individus. L'histoire est en ce sens parsem\u00e9e de nos \u00e9checs. Dans le champ \u00e9conomique, depuis la cr\u00e9ation de l'Insee puis le d\u00e9veloppement des m\u00e9thodes de sondages, l'Etat et les entreprises priv\u00e9es disposent de donn\u00e9es et de statistiques pour analyser le comportement des citoyens et consommateurs afin de le modifier dans le but d'obtenir un r\u00e9sultat sp\u00e9cifique (croissance \u00e9conomique, r\u00e9duction de la pauvret\u00e9, augmentation des ventes\u2026).</p><p>Toutefois, d\u00e8s qu'il s'agit d'influencer des \u00eatres humains, le comportement de ces derniers \u00e9volue en r\u00e9action aux influences subies: nous sommes comme des machines qui changeraient de forme, de mode de fonctionnement, d\u00e8s qu'on essaie de nous actionner.</p><p> Tenir compte des r\u00e9actions humaines </p><p>En sciences sociales tout stimulus modifie non seulement l'individu qu'il touche mais aussi le contexte dans lequel il op\u00e8re. Imaginons qu'on analyse le comportement d'\u00eatres humains et qu'on le mod\u00e9lise via un algorithme. Lorsqu'on essaie d'utiliser cet algorithme pour influencer l'individu, ce dernier se retrouve dans un nouveau contexte (puisqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent quelqu'un t\u00e2che de modifier ses comportements habituels) qui va donc entra\u00eener de nouvelles r\u00e9actions qui peuvent potentiellement rendre l'algorithme inefficace voire contre-productif.</p><p>Il existe par exemple une controverse sur internet: les compagnies a\u00e9riennes utilisent-elles les historiques de recherche enregistr\u00e9s via des \u00abcookies\u00bb pour augmenter les prix propos\u00e9s? Lorsque ce d\u00e9bat est apparu il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, de nombreux internautes ont modifi\u00e9 leurs recherches de vols afin de perturber les cookies et d'obtenir, au contraire des pr\u00e9visions algorithmiques, des prix plus faibles.</p><p>Les sciences sociales et \u00e9conomiques \u00e9tudient depuis longtemps cette influence r\u00e9ciproque entre l'individu et son environnement et, dans ce contexte, la question de la mod\u00e9lisation et du contr\u00f4le. Ainsi la question importante n'est pas de savoir si un algorithme est nuisible: comme une recette, il est con\u00e7u dans un but pr\u00e9cis et fonctionne en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral tr\u00e8s bien \u00e0 court terme.</p><p>Toutefois, ce n'est qu'une recette partielle qui n'utilise que certains ingr\u00e9dients: lorsqu'il s'agit d'obtenir des \u00ablikes\u00bb sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, les notions de v\u00e9racit\u00e9 ou de qualit\u00e9 sont absentes des algorithmes actuels car seule la popularit\u00e9 est prise en compte, ce qui entra\u00eene la d\u00e9sinformation observ\u00e9e ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Ainsi l'algorithme atteint son but \u00e0 court terme, mais son impact \u00e0 moyen terme (polarisation de l'information, manque d'informations contradictoires et de hi\u00e9rarchisation) n'est pas de son ressort.</p><p>La dimension humaine n'est pas suffisamment prise en compte dans les algorithmes issus des sciences de l'ing\u00e9nieur o\u00f9 les individus sont vus comme des bo\u00eetes noires: on ne per\u00e7oit pas leur pens\u00e9e, mais on en mesure le r\u00e9sultat via leurs actions. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9 les humains r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent aux influences qu'on essaie d'exercer sur eux et peuvent les contrecarrer.</p><p> Assurer la soutenabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme </p><p>Dans un tel contexte, il semble illusoire pour une autorit\u00e9 administrative de contr\u00f4ler a priori les outils d'intelligence artificielle car leurs cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 moyen terme sont presqu'impr\u00e9visibles tant est grand le nombre d'acteurs ayant une influence. Peut-\u00eatre une r\u00e9ponse ad\u00e9quate est-elle \u00e0 chercher dans un autre contexte que celui des m\u00e9dicaments: celui du contr\u00f4le de l'inflation.</p><p>En effet, les politiques publiques t\u00e2chent depuis longtemps d'\u00e9viter les \u00e9cueils li\u00e9s \u00e0 une inflation trop importante (l'hyperinflation source d'instabilit\u00e9s politiques dans les ann\u00e9es 1920) ou trop faible (la d\u00e9flation source d'appauvrissement dans les ann\u00e9es 1930). L'objectif optimal est une inflation mod\u00e9r\u00e9e mais celle-ci forme un \u00e9quilibre instable, r\u00e9sultat de d\u00e9cisions individuelles de millions d'individus et d'entreprises, d\u00e9cisions qui elles-m\u00eames sont le fruit des perceptions que les individus ont de leur environnement (pass\u00e9, pr\u00e9sent et avenir) et des d\u00e9cisions d'autrui (concurrents, fournisseurs, clients\u2026).</p><p>Apr\u00e8s avoir pens\u00e9 que l'Etat pouvait directement contr\u00f4ler les prix (par exemple le prix du pain jusque dans les ann\u00e9es 1980) ou les outils de la politique, le consensus depuis trente ans est que l'agence en charge du contr\u00f4le, la banque centrale, m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre compl\u00e8tement ind\u00e9pendante et en pleine possession des outils, non de contr\u00f4le direct des prix individuels, mais de d\u00e9cision (via les taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat) et de supervision des grands op\u00e9rateurs de march\u00e9 (les banques et institutions financi\u00e8res).</p><p>Dans le cadre de cette ind\u00e9pendance, le r\u00f4le de l'Etat est uniquement de fixer les objectifs de la politique mon\u00e9taire (une inflation faible et, dans certains pays, le plein-emploi). L'ind\u00e9pendance des banques centrales permet d'ancrer la confiance dans la poursuite des objectifs de moyen terme, sans que des consid\u00e9rations politiciennes de court terme (lors des \u00e9lections par exemple) n'entrent en jeu. On voit par exemple ces jours-ci comment Donald Trump essaie d'ailleurs de revenir sur ce statu quo en mena\u00e7ant de remplacer le pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9serve f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pour influencer sa politique en pr\u00e9vision des prochaines \u00e9lections pr\u00e9sidentielles.</p><p>Dans le contexte du contr\u00f4le des algorithmes d'intelligence artificielle, une agence ind\u00e9pendante pourrait superviser directement les \u00abBig Tech\u00bb en imposant certains algorithmes de base. Elle pourrait par exemple d\u00e9tenir la supervision des algorithmes \u00abessentiels\u00bb, la capacit\u00e9 de les modifier et obtenir des mesures quotidiennes d'impact (comme la Banque centrale impose aux banques priv\u00e9es d'\u00e9quilibrer leurs comptes aupr\u00e8s d'elle chaque soir).

As iPhone In Canada first reported, Apple has filed a notice of opposition against a meal planning app called Prepear for using a pear logo which is pear-shaped and pear-green. In a Change.org petition , Prepear lamented that, \u201cApple has opposed dozens of other trademark applications filed by small businesses with fruit related logos,\u201d which have since been altered or replaced, because, \u201cmost small businesses cannot afford the tens of thousands of dollars it would cost to fight Apple.\u201d                         Apple thought of fruit in 1976, and you can\u2019t have it back.   The Apple lawyers are fearsome, we know, and will battle government regulators no matter how long and arduous the path to victory . No fruit has escaped them : just over the past few months, they pursued apple-shaped diamond pendants , apple-flavored   vape juice , and the Appleton, Wisconsin school district . They\u2019ve tried to stop a digital music company attempting to brand itself as \u201cFranki Pineapple\u201d (the logo for which resembles a grenade ), arguing that , \u201cwhile the word \u2018apple\u2019 and \u2018pineapple\u2019 do not have the same meaning, they are both the names of fruits, and thus convey a similar commercial impression.\u201d       In its notice of opposition against Prepear, Apple particularly takes issue with Prepear\u2019s fruit-branded focus on health \u2014 exactly like Apple. \u201cOne of the categories highlighted on Apple\u2019s Health app is Nutrition,\u201d they offer, as one example, noting also that the Apple Watch monitors heart rates, and Apple provides software for healthcare providers. On top of consumers\u2019 immediate association between Apple and health, Prepear\u2019s pear, they argue, is likely to recall the Apple logo because just look at it.   \u201cApplicant\u2019s Mark consists of a minimalistic fruit design with a right-angled leaf, which readily calls to mind Apple\u2019s famous Apple Logo and creates a similar commercial impression, as shown in the following side-by-side comparison:\u201d        Image: From Apple\u2019s notice of opposition   In short, the above pear is certain to baffle consumers. \u201cThe Apple Marks are so famous and instantly recognisable that the similarities in Applicant\u2019s Mark will overshadow any differences and cause the ordinary consumer to believe that Applicant is related to, affiliated with or endorsed by Apple.\u201d What if some disappointed consumer comes to Prepear to buy an overpriced laptop and leaves empty-handed? Think of the reputational damages!   It\u2019s a leap for me, but after inspecting Apple\u2019s long history of filings, one can imagine how Apple might be blinded by its own fruit. Last year, they reportedly filed an objection against Norway\u2019s Progress Party for using an apple, against Banana Computer and Banana Mobile , and Pear Technologies , which also branded itself with a pear.   In their Change.org petition , Prepear, which claims to have only five staffers, says that the thousands of dollars wasted on litigation has already forced one layoff \u2014 but they\u2019re not taking this lying down. \u201cWe feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple\u2019s aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo,\u201d they write. \u201cWe are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.\u201d The Change.org petition, which currently has over 26,000 signatures, asks that Apple drop its \u201cfrivolous litigation\u201d and \u201cstop big tech companies from abusing their position of power by going after small businesses like ours who are already struggling due to the affects [sic] of Covid-19.\u201d   Can you tell an apple from a pear?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42808048744</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JS-N6G1-F07F-851K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Gizmodo Australia</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Trademark Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUY4QzQ2QTdDQjY1NEFGMjlGQjMwMTYzM0FDN0IxRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDE4NjA4N0ExMTM4NDgzMDlFREY5NDY0NDdFRTY2QjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUY4QzQ2QTdDQjY1NEFGMjlGQjMwMTYzM0FDN0IxRTA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTgxRjVGMURBODk3NDgyRTlEQkE3QjNCRDUyNkZGQ0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkU5RkYyMDBGQzlCNEVEM0IzNkNEQjIzMzlBM0MzNTI</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM5MjE1NjcxRDA2NEJGREJDQUI5MkMwNkJEOUVGODA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODNCNDg3MzU3NkEyNEQzMDhDRjhGRDM0RUU4QjU5QkU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001317</classCode><className>PETITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000394</classCode><className>COOKING &amp;

Sounds exactly like the conversations they\u2019re having in the U.S.! Except in modest statements to the press and not tweetstorms , human trafficking bills , tarmac press conferences , and executive orders.                         Breton told the Financial Times that the EU would like to adopt regulation that sounds like a more legitimate, straightforward path to accomplish what Trump is attempting with the ByteDance/TikTok \u201cdeal\u201d (or shakedown, depending on your take). Only in dire cases, Breton says, the EU might resort to forcing tech monopolies to break up or sell their European assets altogether. It seems to be framed less about blah blah \u201cnational security\u201d \u2014 a legitimate concern, but not the one meaningfully addressed by the proposed TikTok deal \u2014 and more consistent with the EU\u2019s existing incremental antitrust regulation.       It\u2019s unclear how that\u2019ll be implemented, but Breton said that proposed legislation will be ready by the end of the year. Gizmodo has reached out to Breton for more details and will update the post if we hear back.       Breton also says European regulators are thinking about the longterm preservation of free speech. (Wild!) He wants to deal with illegal content and disinformation without dismantling the liability shield for online intermediaries ensured by the 2000 E-Commerce Directive. Shielding platforms from liability is incredibly important, and EU regulators understand this; \u201cThe safe harbour of the liability exemption will stay,\u201d Breton told the Financial Times. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s accepted by everyone.\u201d As a European Parliament report noted earlier this year, they might reform it by further clarifying mechanisms to remove already-forbidden illegal content.   U.S. lawmakers\u2019 war over moderation, on the other hand, involves firebombing liability exemptions. Legislators on both sides of the aisle want to dismantle Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which prevents online platforms from being treated as publishers and therefore free from liability over user-submitted content hosted on their platforms. (Among other reasons, Republicans would like to modify it in order to grant them more power to troll, and Democrats would like to hold Republicans accountable for lying.)   The Financial Times also mentions \u201ctougher sanctions\u201d on companies that make it impossible to migrate data to other platforms (Facebook). Breton also floated the idea of a \u201crating system\u201d that would show companies\u2019 track record on moderating disinformation and paying taxes, for which EU and member countries have pursued Amazon , Google , and Apple .   What do they think when they look at us? Sometimes I wonder.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43130844679</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-D6F1-F07F-808H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Gizmodo Australia</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Safe Harbour Holdings PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>SHH</className><className>LON</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: JE00BF03FZ36</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Video game developer Epic\u2019s massively popular \u201c battle royale \u201d game Fortnite was removed from Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store last week.   Android players can still download the game directly via the Epic Games mobile app, but for Apple iOS users the decision means no new downloads. Currently installed versions of the game will still work, but iOS players will be unable to update the game and participate in the next season of Fortnite, beginning on August 27.   The boot from Apple and Google was in response to Epic\u2019s implementation of a direct in-app payment system, designed to circumvent Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s own payment systems and their 30 per cent fee charged on in-app purchases and app sales . Epic\u2019s move is a clear violation of Apple\u2019s rules for app monetisation.  Epic taking charge  Following Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s removal of Fortnite from their app stores, Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in Californian courts, followed by another against Google .   The game develoepr also launched the hashtag #FreeFortnite and aired an in-game parody of Apple\u2019s famous \u201c1984\u201d ad which, at the time it was released, was Apple\u2019s own response to IBM\u2019s dominance of the computing industry.       The parody renders the ad in Fortnite\u2019s graphical style, but retains its original symbolism of oppression and control. Epic, valued at US$17 billion , is attempting to portray itself as Apple did back in 1984: as an underdog facing down a corporate behemoth.  What\u2019s at stake in this show of platform power?  The fight escalated this week, with Apple threatening to terminate Epic\u2019s enrolment in the Apple Developer Program should it not resolve its breach of Apple\u2019s policy.   Membership in the program is required for creating and distributing iOS software. Losing its enrolment wouldn\u2019t just affect Epic, or Fortnite, but potentially anyone using Epic\u2019s widely adopted Unreal Engine game development technology.   Considering there are more than a billion users of Android and iOS based mobile devices, these punitive responses (particularly from Apple) are being characterised by many as anti-competitive and monopolistic, including by Epic\u2019s chief executive Tim Sweeney.   In the past, other companies such as Spotify , Microsoft and Amazon have also protested Apple\u2019s 30 per cent fee and strict control over the App Store. But none has so brazenly attacked Apple in the public sphere.   Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s response to this saga has highlighted the power of big tech platforms. As in the case of app stores, these platforms are enclosed and tightly regulated systems. You must play by the owner\u2019s rules, or you\u2019re expelled.   In this case, Apple and Google know their app stores \u2013 where millions of users download their apps \u2013 are crucial to the financial success of developers on their platform.   As such they can exert their power over developers, who don\u2019t really have anywhere else to go.       According to Fortnite\u2019s Twitter account, more than 12 million concurrent players got online for an event earlier this year. Shutterstock  Reminiscent of antitrust charges against Microsoft in the 1990s , critics of Apple and Google have described the tech behemoths as anti-competitive monopolies charging an unreasonable 30 per cent transaction fee.   This falls to 15 per cent in the case of subscription-based apps but only after an initial year of Apple charging the 30 per cent fee. For perspective, PayPal only charges 2.9 per cent of the value of each transaction.  What does Epic want?  Epic argues the mobile games market should be more like the PC market. For instance, Microsoft and Apple don\u2019t get to charge a percentage on every transaction we make through our computers just because they developed the operating system.   Given the speed with which Epic responded to Apple\u2019s ban, it appears Epic anticipated it and was prepared for this outcome.   Is Epic\u2019s lawsuit ultimately aiming to renegotiate the percentage of app store cuts?   Maybe Epic believes it\u2019s in a strong enough position to push back against Apple and Google, given Fortnite\u2019s massive popularity and revenues, as well as the uptake of and value created by software using the Unreal Engine.   Or perhaps, given Apple\u2019s previous pre-emptive bans of Google Stadia and Microsoft xCloud, Epic believes Apple has overplayed its hand.       The mobile games industry is a massive source of revenue for app store operators. Perhaps Epic is banking on Apple and Google eventually deciding gaming is too lucrative to cast aside, and hoping they will succumb to renegotiating fees.  Epic will probably be fine  Epic claims, in the long run, it\u2019s doing this for everyone.   If it can force Apple to reduce the 30 per cent fee, or launch an alternative game store on iOS with lower fees, developers will have to sell fewer game copies to make a profit. According to Epic, this means more games for everyone.   But it\u2019s also an opportunity for Epic to amplify its platform power by more aggressively expanding its games store into the mobile marketplace.   Regardless of what happens now, don\u2019t feel too sorry for Epic. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most profitable video game developers and a platform owner in its own right (although at 12 per cent it takes a smaller app store cut than Apple).   While Android players can still access Fortnite, only iOS players who already have the game installed will be able to keep playing. Alternatively, they may have to shell out thousands for a secondhand iPhone with Fortnite installed.   And whether or not iOS players will experience much of the upcoming season \u2013 that will be determined by Epic\u2019s next move.

On a recent weekend, one of the last truly warm days of early fall, the location was full of upmarket customers -- families with strollers, Gen Z-ers in knockoff Supreme streetwear -- enjoying the popular cheese tea. On the front facade, right by the door, an illustration of a hand holding a phone displayed a two-dimensional bar code, or QR code. ''Scan the code to avoid lines,'' a sign read.</p><p>The scene was far removed from the days 18 months earlier, when HeyTea, one of the hottest brands in China, was infamous for its long lines. Stories on WeChat, the ubiquitous Chinese social media and messaging app, of customers waiting two, three, four hours for a cup of tea only served to stoke greater demand. ''I think that curiosity, the desire to wait in line because everyone else is doing it, it speaks to something fundamental in human nature,'' says Peilin Chan, HeyTea's chief technology officer. Yet as much as the shop had benefited from the viral marketing, Chan knew it was also unsustainable if HeyTea wanted to become anything more than a pop-culture gimmick. Customers were hiring people to stand in line for them (a practice known as daigou, or '''substitute buying''). Long delivery times were spoiling the quality of its teas. Complaints were starting to flood in online. </p><p>  To solve the problem, Chan turned to the same platform that made it too big to live with. In early 2017, WeChat announced a new feature called miniprograms. Such apps are part of WeChat and don't need to be downloaded, allowing anyone to set up a digital storefront within WeChat. Chan could have created a regular mobile app, but the integration with WeChat Pay, the platform's mobile payment service, made billing easy, and most important, customers were already there. ''At the time, we just thought that the miniprogram provided a pretty good user experience,'' Chan says. The resulting miniprogram, called HeyTea Go, is opened by scanning a QR code and lets customers place orders without having to stand in line. Simultaneously, it created technological opportunities for the company, like online marketing and the collection of data about its patrons. Chan describes the adoption of the platform as -- in what has been the case for hundreds of thousands of other businesses in China -- ''the starting point of our digital transformation.''</p><p>  Slim and energetic, with the pompadour of a Korean boy-bander, Chan was born in Guangdong, part of a post-'90s generation of Chinese kids who grew up as China was transitioning from pre- to post-internet society. In 2008, the year Chan went off to college, if you ordered something online, he says, the courier would hand over your purchase, and you would hand over a wad of cash. Download speeds were slow across the country, and few people in smaller, remote cities had access to the internet. Over the next decade, Chan watched as his country went through a digital transformation as impressive as the construction boom that filled its urban skylines. E-commerce exploded. Mobile payment apps made cash obsolete.</p><p>  One app in particular would come to dominate Chan's life: WeChat. Developed by Tencent, a social media giant, WeChat got its start as a chat app before evolving into a superapp. Today it has more than a billion monthly active users and -- according to a 2018 report by WalktheChat, a WeChat marketing company -- hosts roughly 34 percent of all Chinese data traffic. It is a social network, a payments system, a communication medium and, perhaps most ambitious, the infrastructure for businesses like HeyTea. WeChat's first foray into this marketplace came in 2012, with the introduction of ''official accounts,'' which resemble Facebook Pages. In early 2017, it introduced miniprograms.</p><p>  In the two years since then, businesses have created more than a million of them, equal to half the number of iOS apps available in Apple's App Store. They come from global conglomerates like McDonald's and Tesla and from local businesses like restaurants, hair salons and gyms. All of them are drawn in by the gravitational pull of WeChat's enormous number of users and its standardized software infrastructure. It resembles the European Union in the way it has evolved into a market ecosystem: Miniprogram developers benefit from a common currency (WeChat's mobile payment system), an identification system (WeChat's login and password) and greatly lowered barriers to trade and movement (easy integration with any number of other services on WeChat). Because miniprograms run inside WeChat, businesses' customers don't have to sign up, log in or add their credit card numbers.</p><p>Offline businesses looking to move online have long faced a list of challenges like payment processing and analytics. Small- and medium-size businesses in particular have struggled against ambitious tech behemoths like Amazon. But with miniprograms, some of the biggest beneficiaries are local businesses that depend on foot traffic. By scanning a QR code, customers beam details about their physical situation -- I'm at a HeyTea and drinking this particular cheese tea -- back to the miniprogram. Such data, which connect users' offline behavior with their online profiles, can then help drive product decisions. In HeyTea's case, the miniprogram gave the company access to information about the popularity of tea flavors and customer churn. By targeting new teas appropriately and cutting down on lines, HeyTea was able to ''level up'' in a way that a similar-size business in the United States would have had a tough time doing: Within six months of the debut of HeyTea Go, it tripled the rate at which repeat customers bought drinks.</p><p>  Miniprograms aren't do-everything miracles, of course -- they languish without good marketing, can be slow and still require development resources. They also tie the businesses tightly to WeChat, which may eventually work against their financial and strategic interests. But their success in China provides a fascinating look into an alternative vision of the mobile internet, one that is integrated across multiple dimensions and that is in essence a single large market. What sorts of innovations does that engender? What sorts of tensions does that create? Is it a better architecture than our Western one, in which each business has its own mobile app, existing in isolation, downloaded but idle for large chunks of the day?</p><p>  The longstanding consensus about the Chinese internet is that it ''decoupled'' from the rest of the world 10 years ago, and that for every American tech company there is an equivalent in China. While this is largely true for applications used by consumers -- the ride-sharing apps and search engines and social media sites -- in reality, the two internets have yet to fully disengage from each other. Android, made by Google, and iOS, made by Apple, are still the two dominant mobile operating systems in China. Programming frameworks like React (made by Facebook) and languages like Java and Python have been adopted enthusiastically by Chinese developers. Until now, this kind of infrastructural innovation has flowed mostly from the West to China.</p><p>  The so-called WeChat model may be the first time things are going in reverse. Even as the tensions between China and the United States remain strained, with much of the antagonism focused on intellectual property in technology, American tech companies have found in the WeChat internet a lot to admire -- and emulate. In 2017, Google introduced ''Instant Apps,'' and last year Instagram unveiled shopping and payments initiatives. Mark Zuckerberg's directive earlier this year to integrate Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram suggests superapplike ambitions. Given the political environment in the West, with big tech facing regulatory and antitrust scrutiny, the WeChat model is unlikely to be imported wholesale. But elements of its design are sure to show up in the West. Whether because of the appeal of mobile payments, or its use of QR codes, or the sheer convenience of not having to keep track of your 100th password, the WeChat model offers some undeniable improvements. The age of the mobile internet dawned in 2008 with the opening of the Apple App Store and has lasted more than a decade; the WeChat internet is almost certainly a glimpse of what comes next.</p><p>  If you're a 30-year-old office worker living in a smaller city in China today, your day might go something like this: You wake up in the morning and check your mobile phone, possibly an iPhone but more likely a late-model Xiaomi or Huawei Android that nevertheless has all the latest camera filters. You scroll through the Facebook News Feed-like Moments feature on WeChat and post a couple messages to the WeChat group chats you belong to. For breakfast, you get a jianbing, or crepe, from the vendor downstairs, and you pay with WeChat Pay. On your commute to work you check out Jinri Toutiao, an A.I.-driven news-aggregation app that recommends several articles on how to combat your acid reflux. That reminds you that you should probably see the doctor, a process that used to involve a full day of running around the hospital and waiting in lines (a familiar routine known as guahao) and then paying for prescriptions. Luckily, you can now get through all that virtually on WeChat, and even pay your medical bill there.</p><p>  Finally, you get to work. The job is in sales for a midsize manufacturer, and because there's no real separation between work life and personal life in China, and because no one uses email, all your communication with clients takes place over WeChat. On your break you swipe through Kuaishou, a short-video app, and check Weibo, the Chinese Twitter. You pay your utilities bill on WeChat and book train tickets through the China Railway miniprogram so you can go home to visit your parents for the new year. You see that a neighbor has sent your apartment complex's WeChat group the link to a special deal on imported soy sauce -- 70 percent off! -- available on Pinduoduo, a social e-commerce app that offers deep discounts on bulk purchases that you split with your friends. (You go in on the deal.) After work, you go to dinner at a restaurant in the neighborhood, where you order using the restaurant's miniprogram. When you get home, you read some new posts from your favorite ''key opinion leaders'' on WeChat, then are suckered into buying a zit-zapping machine on Taobao. You check the number of steps you walked today using the WeRun app before getting in bed. (Fewer than 10,000, alas.)</p><p>  To spend any amount of time in China today is to understand why it's said that people ''live on WeChat'' -- but when it was first founded in 2011, in Guangzhou, WeChat was just a messaging app. ''The country was really lacking one standard communication platform, which in the U.S., I think, is still email,'' says Connie Chan, a general partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. ''WeChat was something that was built for mobile specifically,'' she says. ''It wasn't just taking a P.C. platform and moving it to mobile -- and as a result you saw a number of mobile-friendly features from very early days: the QR code, the voice message.''</p><p>WeChat grew slowly at first, and then explosively. Its early days coincided with a major demographic shift in Chinese internet users: As the price of a smartphone in China dropped significantly this decade, internet access became available to hundreds of millions of laobaixing, or ordinary folks, in China's interior. For many of these users, the mobile phone was their introduction to the internet. Unused to downloading other apps, they spent almost all their online time on WeChat, posting photos to Moments and chatting with their friends. Then, in 2012, the introduction of gongzhong hao, or official accounts, brought businesses and media personalities into the mix. For Chinese consumers, official accounts meant that spending time on WeChat was no longer simply a leisure diversion; the platform was also a place for commerce. Official accounts allowed Chines business to leapfrog, technologically speaking, the traditional website, putting customers within reach of a direct message.</p><p>  The final ingredient would come during the Chinese New Year in 2014, when WeChat introduced a virtual ''red envelope'' that could be sent to friends. This internet-age update on the Chinese tradition of gifting hongbao full of cash to family and friends transcended the holiday to become a full-fledged mobile payment service, WeChat Pay. The subsequent competition between WeChat Pay and Alibaba's Alipay precipitated China's transformation into a cashless society. By scanning a QR code either displayed on a phone or printed on a piece of paper, customers could now pay merchants without cash or a credit card.</p><p>  Having secured the two foundational needs of any digital society -- identity and payments -- the WeChat ecosystem flourished throughout the mid-2010s. Businesses like Air China expanded their official accounts into de facto websites. Fashion bloggers and writers made money from whatever they posted on their official accounts through donation buttons, which were plugged into WeChat Pay. While it was long-accepted wisdom in Silicon Valley that internet consumers would not pay for content, it turns out that when you make it easy for readers to make payments in small sums, they will.</p><p>  In WeChat's early years, the government allowed it to grow essentially unfettered; unlike in the United States, which is coming to see big tech as a colossus that needs to be knocked down, the Chinese government saw tech companies as economic engines to be harnessed. ''In the U.S., as a politician, you answer to citizens, so you want to work on issues that get you the most number of votes,'' says Yuechen Zhao, a partner at GSR Ventures. ''In China, you answer to the level above you, and because there's this huge push for tech, there's a lot more incentive for officials to look at how they can integrate tech into their city or how they can integrate tech into public services.'' As WeChat grew, it made more and more sense for various public health care, education and transportation services to piggyback on the platform, either as official accounts or miniprograms. And in the Chinese political system, where a state directive can cut through the protests of any particular corporation or individual, implementation was more straightforward. The result -- a deeply integrated and extremely useful WeChat internet -- is one that is difficult to imagine in a democratic West.</p><p>  In February, I met with Sergi de Pablo Quesada, a Barcelona-born expat who runs a miniprogram-development venture called Out1N, in Shanghai. Unlike HeyTea, most small- and medium-size businesses don't have the engineering resources to build their own miniprograms. Instead, they contract the making of a miniprogram to a third party, which typically charges around $2,000 or $3,000. De Pablo Quesada, 30, isn't an engineer by background, but he coded several of his own mobile apps before starting Out1N. What he discovered was that miniprograms are at once analogous to and yet fundamentally different from native mobile apps. Native applications, like most of the apps used in the United States, are built directly on the mobile operating system (iOS or Android), which is the layer of software that interfaces with the hardware. WeChat miniprograms, on the other hand, are built on top of WeChat, an application itself built on top of the operating system.</p><p>  As Apple does with its iOS operating system, WeChat provides a bundle of coding tools known as a software developer's kit, or S.D.K., which helps programmers develop applications for specific platforms. These tools will typically include a code editor, which is sort of like Microsoft Word for programmers (it's where the code itself is written); a compiler, which translates the human-readable code to machine-readable assembly language; and an emulator, which shows what the application will look like to the end user. The S.D.K. also provides a set of hooks, called an application programming interface (A.P.I.), that connect a miniprogram to WeChat's payments and login infrastructure. So if you're a third-party developer -- say, HeyTea -- you can download the WeChatS.D.K. onto your computer, launch the editor, have your software engineers write the code to run your miniprogram, compile it, visualize it, rinse and repeat. When the miniprogram has been completed, the developer sends the entire miniprogram to WeChat for approval.</p><p>  Aside from some differences in coding languages and procedures, the process resembles that of making a regular app. But being a level removed from the operating system yields some benefits: Miniprogram developers do not have to make something for both iOS and Android, or decide between the two; they can just work with WeChat. Instead of having to figure out which of the top 10 Android stores to publish to -- Google's exit from China in 2010 created an enormous vacuum that was filled by hundreds of different app stores, set up by phone manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi, carriers like China Mobile and tech giants like Baidu and Tencent -- you can just publish to WeChat. If you imagine the miniprogram as a painting, then WeChat provides canvas, brushes and wall space.</p><p>  It does not provide promotion. ''Not every business that wants to sell through miniprograms succeeds,'' de Pablo Quesada says. The ones that do typically rely on marketing by influencers or brick-and-mortar stores, like HeyTea, that can publicize their online services. Because there isn't an official miniprogram store, getting exposure for one is a challenge. Nevertheless, de Pablo Quesada says that his business is booming. He has built miniprograms for, among others, clients who need to automatically generate price quotes as well as for retailers like popular bakeries.</p><p>  Last April, in Shanghai, I met Wang Guanchun, the 35-year-old chief executive of Laiye, the maker of A.I.-powered virtual assistants, including Xiaolai, which is available as both an official account and a miniprogram on WeChat. He started the company in 2015 when he noticed that traditional services like financial management and real estate, and not just ride-sharing and food delivery, were increasingly moving online within WeChat. ''In this kind of environment, a virtual assistant would be able to expand beyond just random conversation, or a simple search,'' he told me. It would be able to complete actual tasks for users.</p><p>  While Xiaolai shares similarities with Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant, its work is easier, in some ways. Alexa and Assistant struggle to take action in the physical world -- book a taxi, order food, make a restaurant reservation or doctor's appointment. Every one of these ''skills'' has an existing incumbent (Uber, Zocdoc) with which a virtual assistant needs to be integrated.</p><p>  I can ask Xiaolai, on the other hand, to book plane tickets to Nanjing on June 3, and it will directly conduct a search on Air China's WeChat miniprogram, confirm the timetables and make the purchase with WeChat Pay. Contrast this setup with Google's Duplex, a conversational A.I. that was released to great fanfare last year. Duplex is an impressive feat of text-to-speech machine learning, an A.I. that can carry on real-time phone calls with a human on the other end being none the wiser. But in China, there wouldn't be a human on the other end; there would be a WeChat miniprogram. When Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, introduced Duplex, he noted that 60 percent of small businesses in the United States still didn't have an online booking system. Duplex, in other words, is predicated on the inevitability of phone calls. Xiaolai is predicated on their obsolescence.</p><p>  The WeChat marketplace is not without its drawbacks. A perennial debate in tech has raged over the benefits and costs of consolidation. When I talk to businesses that are developing WeChat miniprograms, they acknowledge that the platform is feudalistic, binding them ever closer to Tencent, at the expense of their own independence. ''But what can we do about it?'' HeyTea's Chan asks, pointing out that traditional mobile apps, too, are built on real estate owned by tech giants -- the operating system.</p><p>  Even in the West, the trend in recent years has been toward fewer large companies. Leveraging their size, their cash reserves, their ability to attract the best engineering talent and make innovations deeper in the computing stack, the breadth and depth of their user bases and product offerings, they've made incursions further and further afield. In the mobile internet in particular, the tollbooth operators are Apple and Google. The two companies have the power to accept or decline submissions to their respective app stores -- and more subtly, by publishing the S.D.K.s, they control the technical specifications of the mobile apps themselves. With miniprograms, WeChat assumes a similar role: Developers are now designing miniprograms that fulfill WeChat's requirements and that are subject to its approval. It has the power and privilege to police who gets access to a billion customers.</p><p>  While WeChat hasn't thus far shown the tendency to block or shut down miniprograms without cause, it's easy to envision a future in which WeChat looks to squeeze money from the enormous marketplace it has built and begins taking a cut of every miniprogram transaction. That would make it like the Apple and Android app stores, which keep 30 percent of first-year revenues from paid apps. At that point, businesses that had spent years building up traffic to their miniprograms would have little recourse. The more prescient miniprogram users today, then, like HeyTea, often see miniprograms as training wheels for their own apps.</p><p>  The connected WeChat internet also brings a unique set of privacy and security issues. Christopher Balding, a former professor of economics at the Peking University HSBC School of Business in Shenzhen, cites examples of businesses selling on the black market customers' personal information gleaned from WeChat. ''A lot of stores, if you scan the QR code, it just starts sucking up enormous amounts of data,'' he said, ''You could probably go to a corner shop that sells noodles and say, Hey, I want to buy some data.'' Some of this data will end up in the hands of internet fraudsters.</p><p>  Given various official data-privacy crackdowns currently going on, a lot of it will also end up captured by the government's own surveillance efforts. As WeChat has grown, the government has developed increasingly sophisticated techniques to use it as a way to pry into citizens' private lives while also muzzling its potential as a political town hall. New regulations issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China in September 2017, for instance, hold WeChat chat group administrators liable for politically sensitive or pornographic messages in the groups they manage -- in effect creating a system of grass-roots censorship. ''They can control WeChat without having to kill it,'' says Bill Bishop, a well-known China analyst, adding, ''That's what's so fascinating -- the regulators are really smart.''</p><p>  The dark side of the WeChat internet is that all the factors that have made it such a vibrant ecosystem -- the identity and payments data, the user engagement -- also make it an incredibly dangerous tool. Mobile payments provide an easily traceable financial trail; China's incipient ''social credit'' scoring system may end up analyzing users' payment records and online activity in order to determine eligibility for various social and financial services. As the Chinese internet becomes the WeChat internet, WeChat will increasingly be treated as a public utility, subject to more and more direct interference. This is the cost that Chinese companies have always paid, but the WeChat internet arguably exacerbates it: By consolidating user activity that was previously divided among different online sites, or conducted offline, onto a single platform and onto miniprograms, they've made users even easier pickings.</p><p>  In Shanghai this fall, I met with Thibault Genaitay, the 30-year-old head of China operations at Le Wagon, a French-founded coding boot camp with three locations in the country. Two years ago, at the very beginning of the miniprogram era, Le Wagon began investing in the miniprogram ecosystem -- testing its coding framework and adding miniprogram-focused lectures to its courses. Today many of its alumni are miniprogram developers helping foreign brands expand their WeChat presence, and Le Wagon finds itself liaising between an international market eager to access WeChat's audience and a WeChat with increasingly international ambitions. ''Tencent is pushing very hard for miniprograms to have traction abroad,'' Genaitay told me. ''They're hosting hackathons in Singapore and Europe. They want to have third-party providers working in conjunction with merchants to develop miniprograms, mainly for Chinese consumers abroad.'' He added, ''We're talking about the diaspora of millions of WeChat users outside of China, that's their first angle.''</p><p>  In many ways, it's an inopportune time for an international expansion by a Chinese company. United States-China relations are at their lowest point since the Cold War. Technology has become tinged by nationalism. The shaky d\u00e9tente between Apple and WeChat -- miniprograms cut out the Apple App Store and make WeChat the only app you need on your phone -- is unlikely to hold forever, and as has happened to Huawei, strategic and political currents will probably end up forcing Tencent onto its own operating system.</p><p>  Yet in other ways, the time is finally right. In 2013, when it tried to expand internationally, WeChat lost out to WhatsApp, a messaging app with similar functionality but perhaps greater cultural appeal. Today, though, WeChat is no longer just a messaging app: It's also the world's biggest marketplace. For foreign companies that want to sell their products to Chinese consumers, miniprograms offer a shortcut through an otherwise byzantine array of middlemen, distributors and import partners. As de Pablo Quesada puts it: ''It gives small businesses the opportunity to not only sell to Chinese tourists when they are in New York City, but then to be able to sustain the relationship once they go back to China. Because you have a miniprogram, you can see if your favorite painter in New York has painted anything new; you can buy it right there and have it sent back to China. That's one of the biggest revolutions about miniprograms -- that it enables you to sell to any Chinese person that has WeChat, which is basically everyone.''</p><p>  Now American technology is following China's lead. The recently introduced WhatsApp Business, a platform for local businesses to provide information and communicate with their customers, bears striking similarities to miniprograms and has been gathering momentum in Mexico and India. Mark Zuckerberg's public references earlier this year to ''the digital equivalent of the living room'' and ''secure payments'' echo much of what already exists on WeChat. Through Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, its marquee acquisitions, Facebook is the American tech company that comes closest to WeChat: It's a messaging app, a social network and an e-commerce platform. Like WeChat, Facebook Pages and Instagram consolidate numerous businesses under one roof. You can imagine an Instagram where each account is a storefront, sort of like a miniprogram, where users might be able to make and show off their purchases without ever leaving the app.</p><p>  The gradual convergence toward the connected WeChat model speaks to a profound change in dynamic between Western and Chinese internet technologies. For decades, the online infrastructure -- from design to programming languages to wireless protocols -- came from the West. These sorts of innovations, often given away free or not immediately profitable, nevertheless bestow upon their makers a sort of soft power. They transcend cultural differences and help bridge them. For the first time, a Chinese concept is taking on that role. With WeChat miniprograms, we're seeing a technology copied not to China, but from China.</p><p>  The ramifications of such a shift are subtle and pervasive, and many of them are most likely still to be realized. My conversation with Genaitay eventually turned to ByteDance, the creator of Jinri Toutiao and the short-form video platform TikTok, which has become the first Chinese-made product to cross over into Western internet consciousness. ByteDance is perhaps the hottest start-up in the world today, with a $78 billion valuation, and is increasing its efforts to move into productivity and search. It is a part of a younger generation of Chinese companies now reaching maturity, helmed by millennial founders and hungry for recognition in the outside world. It, too, is testing miniprograms. ''If I was ByteDance -- because they already have TikTok overseas, they can have an edge,'' Genaitay said. ''If they can successfully create a miniprogram ecosystem on Douyin'' -- the Chinese version of TikTok -- ''they could easily replicate it to TikTok.'' They could, in other words, challenge WeChat by becoming a full-service app.</p><p>  Genaitay emphasized that, if you set aside its technology, ByteDance's small-app efforts are still at an early stage, and it remains to be seen whether the company can open up what is currently a closed ecosystem accessible only to official brands. Indeed, miniprograms of the style we've come to expect on WeChat seem an odd fit with the world of TikTok, which is quirky and surreal rather than commercial. But if ByteDance can pull that off, it might be a revelation. Whatever it is that takes place when Chinese-style superapp-dom meets the American teenager, it sounds like the future of the internet.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY MAURIZIO CATTELAN</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p> PIERPAOLO FERRARI) (MM60-MM61)               </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-160733191117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHP-K1X1-DXY4-X4MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5029\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/magazine/imagine-an-app-that-does-everything.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/magazine/imagine-an-app-that-does-everything.html</url><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 17, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Demand the resignation of Facebook's CEO today. This week audio leaked to The Verge revealed[1] Facebook CEO Mark Zuckergberg's fears of an Elizabeth Warren presidency: 'You have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us?</p><p> Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.' Imagine, for a second, if the CEO of the largest social network in human history said something like this about Donald Trump. The right   which wants to hold a congressional hearing every time a Diamond and Silk post doesn't get enough likes would explode. They'd demand Zuckerberg self-deport or, at least, resign. And their fury would be somewhat understandable given the massive power Facebook has to influence our elections and a simple fact few people understand: No agency or regulator is watching the content standards of Facebook   which will be one of the largest, if not the single largest, seller of political ads for the upcoming presidential election year. 'Facebook is regulating itself content-wise, at least here in the U.S.,' says Harold Feld[2], Senior Vice President, Public Knowledge[3]. The marginal changes Zuckerberg's baby has made since its site was used as a staging ground for foreign interference in 2016 election mean you may not be able to spend Rubles to buy U.S. political ads on the site. But, as Judd Legum's Popular Information[4] newsletter continually documents, Facebook is doing far too little, if anything, to restrain the propaganda that explodes across the site, often directly from the Trump campaign.The Trump campaign is flooding the zone w/a Facebook ad whose central claim has been ruled FALSE by Facebook's third-party fact-checkers Facebook says the ad DOESN'T VIOLATE ITS POLICIES because political ads are exempt from fact-checking Details here   <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/4aTevXJIwr\">https://t.co/4aTevXJIwr</url>[5] pic.twitter.com/xc2g6EL2uX[6]   Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 3, 2019[7]We don't know how good Facebook is at swinging voters but there's a reason the Trump campaign has already spent as much as $2 million on the site[8] with ads trying to fend off impeachment. 'Studies have found that with just 10 'likes' an algorithm can predict a person's personality traits better than can a co-worker; with 150, it can do better than a family member; and with 300, better than a spouse,' writes George Riedel[9]. And Rachel Bitecofer[10]   the political scientist behind the most accurate prediction of the 2018 elections and one of the most promising predictions Democrats[11] can hope to hear for 2020   keeps trying to warn anyone who wants Trump gone that if the president defies her prediction and wins it will be because Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, found a way 'grow the electorate on a mass scale using one of the hardest to mobilize demos.' And the tool that will make that epic reshaping of the election possible? Facebook. 'That is the future of political marketing,' Parscale said, in a speech from the key swing state of Romania[12]. Trump's campaign has found ways to stoke exploit nearly all of the worst vulnerabilities in our society   racial division, gender resentment, the ability to spread propaganda virally through social media. Our assumptions that these ills will be cured by the market or time have failed us. That's why Warren, like Bernie Sanders, has a plan for the break-up of Facebook[13]. And like many of her plans, it lays out an aggressive treatment plan for a cancer that has largely been been allowed to metastasize for decades. In The Case for the Digital Platform Act[14], Harold Feld makes the case for legislation that could lay the groundwork for reining in big tech   and possibly regulating political ads online the way we do on other mediums. 'Just as the Communications Act imposes certain obligations on broadcast political advertising, and the FCC used to do more by rule, an agency created under my proposed framework should have the power to decide whether this would be permissible,' Feld says. 'But the First Amendment cuts both ways, here. Congress (through an agency so empowered) has an interest in maintaining the integrity of elections, including prohibiting information that is completely false and cannot be characterized as opinion.' Of course, there will be no effort to take any serious look at how social media   or any aspect of our election infrastructure   can be gamed until Donald Trump is out of the White House and Mitch McConnell is no longer the Majority Leader of the Senate. Republicans remain intent on using Facebook to maintain their power and the money and pressure they apply to the site will make sure that they can do it without any regard for the truth. Democrats need to recognize that Trump isn't the only corrosive threat to our democracy we face.

Demand the resignation of Facebook's CEO today. This week audio leaked to The Verge revealed[1] Facebook CEO Mark Zuckergberg's fears of an Elizabeth Warren presidency: 'You have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us?</p><p> Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.' Imagine, for a second, if the CEO of the largest social network in human history said something like this about Donald Trump. The right \u2014 which wants to hold a congressional hearing every time a Diamond and Silk post doesn't get enough likes would explode. They'd demand Zuckerberg self-deport or, at least, resign. And their fury would be somewhat understandable given the massive power Facebook has to influence our elections and a simple fact few people understand: No agency or regulator is watching the content standards of Facebook \u2014 which will be one of the largest, if not the single largest, seller of political ads for the upcoming presidential election year. 'Facebook is regulating itself content-wise, at least here in the U.S.,' says Harold Feld[2], Senior Vice President, Public Knowledge[3]. The marginal changes Zuckerberg's baby has made since its site was used as a staging ground for foreign interference in 2016 election mean you may not be able to spend Rubles to buy U.S. political ads on the site. But, as Judd Legum's Popular Information[4] newsletter continually documents, Facebook is doing far too little, if anything, to restrain the propaganda that explodes across the site, often directly from the Trump campaign.The Trump campaign is flooding the zone w/a Facebook ad whose central claim has been ruled FALSE by Facebook's third-party fact-checkers Facebook says the ad DOESN'T VIOLATE ITS POLICIES because political ads are exempt from fact-checking Details here \ufe0f <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/4aTevXJIwr\">https://t.co/4aTevXJIwr</url>[5] pic.twitter.com/xc2g6EL2uX[6] \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 3, 2019[7]We don't know how good Facebook is at swinging voters but there's a reason the Trump campaign has already spent as much as $2 million on the site[8] with ads trying to fend off impeachment. 'Studies have found that with just 10 'likes' an algorithm can predict a person's personality traits better than can a co-worker; with 150, it can do better than a family member; and with 300, better than a spouse,' writes George Riedel[9]. And Rachel Bitecofer[10] \u2014 the political scientist behind the most accurate prediction of the 2018 elections and one of the most promising predictions Democrats[11] can hope to hear for 2020 \u2014 keeps trying to warn anyone who wants Trump gone that if the president defies her prediction and wins it will be because Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, found a way 'grow the electorate on a mass scale using one of the hardest to mobilize demos.' And the tool that will make that epic reshaping of the election possible? Facebook. 'That is the future of political marketing,' Parscale said, in a speech from the key swing state of Romania[12]. Trump's campaign has found ways to stoke exploit nearly all of the worst vulnerabilities in our society \u2014 racial division, gender resentment, the ability to spread propaganda virally through social media. Our assumptions that these ills will be cured by the market or time have failed us. That's why Warren, like Bernie Sanders, has a plan for the break-up of Facebook[13]. And like many of her plans, it lays out an aggressive treatment plan for a cancer that has largely been been allowed to metastasize for decades. In The Case for the Digital Platform Act[14], Harold Feld makes the case for legislation that could lay the groundwork for reining in big tech \u2014 and possibly regulating political ads online the way we do on other mediums. 'Just as the Communications Act imposes certain obligations on broadcast political advertising, and the FCC used to do more by rule, an agency created under my proposed framework should have the power to decide whether this would be permissible,' Feld says. 'But the First Amendment cuts both ways, here. Congress (through an agency so empowered) has an interest in maintaining the integrity of elections, including prohibiting information that is completely false and cannot be characterized as opinion.' Of course, there will be no effort to take any serious look at how social media \u2014 or any aspect of our election infrastructure \u2014 can be gamed until Donald Trump is out of the White House and Mitch McConnell is no longer the Majority Leader of the Senate. Republicans remain intent on using Facebook to maintain their power and the money and pressure they apply to the site will make sure that they can do it without any regard for the truth. Democrats need to recognize that Trump isn't the only corrosive threat to our democracy we face. All of the 2020 candidates need to come together and demand Zuckerberg resign now before he can sway the election to Trump, again. This probably happen, but it will make the case that there may be costs to allowing your business to be co-opted by the most obviously corrupt president in American history.

It wasn't on purpose. Without going into the gory details, I was anxious and also bored waiting for Louie to arrive, and was texting about a new conference idea. When I suddenly had to get an epidural and was rushed into an emergency C-section, I wasn't focusing on the fact that the BlackBerry was still in my hand. So there it was, buzzing away, encased in plastic during the whole procedure, since the scrubbed-in staff couldn't touch it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Kara, you really have to do something about your tech problem,\" joked my doctor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yes, I know. I am awful. But bear with me when I tell you this was not the worst thing ever.</p><p>During a recent interview at SXSW, Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner of competition for the European Union \u2014 the regulator who is the scourge of Facebook, Google, Facebook, Apple and more \u2014 asked me a surprising question.</p><p>\"What is the good life?\"</p><p>The good life, Vestager said, is not \"the same thing as a convenient life. I think a convenient life can be extremely boring if you're never challenged with any hardship of everyday life.\"</p><p>She was talking about the way we have shifted to valuing convenience as the ultimate good over what is actually good for us. It's the not surprising result of the twitchy, I-want-it-now, mobile-phone-addled life in which everything is just a click away.</p><p>Finding a balance</p><p>But I don't think throwing our phones out the window is the solution. Instead, we have to find a way to balance what is good with what is convenient, even as tech companies do as much as possible to hook us.</p><p>On this topic, there's lately been a lot of hand-wringing. Some are warning that we don't yet know the consequences of being addicted to our devices. Others are pondering whether the overuse of screens is a class issue, in which the poor are trapped in cyberspace and the rich can afford not to be jacked into the matrix 24/7. And what is the price we pay in cohesion, as we opt to stare relentlessly at our phones instead of engaging in person? Will there ever be an end to the tweet-dissing that coarsens our civic discourse? What does it mean that so much of the important information citizens of a working democracy need to know has mutated into blink-and-you'll-miss-it memes?</p><p>All of this is about the fact that we are now contending with a culture of convenience that does not differentiate very much between getting news in a form that is \"snackable\" (my least favourite media word ever), having a bottle of ketchup delivered to your door in the middle of the night even if it sucks up too many resources and getting a car on demand at the lowest price even if it requires paying drivers less and less.</p><p>The top techie Marc Andreessen once said that software is eating the world. The fact of the matter is, we are eating software and becoming unhealthy and obese doing it. That was the real point Vestager was making in the interview, which was ostensibly about competition and how to rein in big tech companies with her too-small bag of remedies, such as passing strict laws about how they need to run the platforms that have become a free-for-all. By this I mean both that their services are free and freewheeling and that this freedom comes at a high cost to society.</p><p>So perhaps it's not surprising that she sees the unbridled power of the big tech companies as part of a bigger issue. We have to have a discussion\" she said, \"about inequality.\"</p><p>\"And in that, competition or enforcement is only a tiny part of that answer. But it's as if we're not having this discussion,\" she said, referring to all manner of apps that bring us stuff immediately. \"We just talk about convenience, 'Oh, it will be convenient that my fridge is always full'.\"</p><p>Kevin Roose, in a recent column for this paper titled Do Not Disturb: How I Ditched My Phone and Unbroke My Brain, chronicled the price of tech addiction.</p><p>Species-level environmental shock</p><p>\"Unlike alcohol or opioids, phones aren't an addictive substance so much as a species-level environmental shock,\" he wrote.</p><p>\"I've been a heavy phone user for my entire adult life. But sometime last year, I crossed the invisible line into problem territory. My symptoms were all the typical ones: I found myself incapable of reading books, watching full-length movies or having long uninterrupted conversations. Social media made me angry and anxious, and even the digital spaces I once found soothing (group texts, podcasts, YouTube k-holes) weren't helping.\"</p><p>A species-level environmental shock? That's a big statement, and it's true. The most profound experiment in human communications in all of our history is taking place right now. But while the downsides of continuous partial attention have been made abundantly clear, we shouldn't forget that the concept of instant communications is profound., and the ability to be in touch at an important time is both convenient and good</p><p>As technology morphs and improves, the terrible things about it (being pecked to death by email, texts or tweets) are always shifting back and forth with the great things (the joy of surprising emails, texts or tweets). Taking a cue from Roose's piece, I looked hard at my own screen time, which adds up to about seven hours a day. I guess that sounds like a lot. But very little of that time is frittered away.</p><p>Mostly, I send what I consider important messages into the ether and I get them back; I read The New York Times and Washington Post, as I always have; I use Slack to talk to my co-workers, and that's certainly useful; I check my Google calendar to find out where I should be; I write ideas and notes for columns and podcasts and more; and, best of all these days, I rent scooters.</p><p>All convenient and good, for the most part, which is the balance I think we all have to find as tech keeps eating the world.</p><p>\u2014 New York Times News Service</p><p>Kara Swisher, editor at large for the technology news website Recode and producer of the Recode Decode podcast and Code Conference, is a contributing opinion writer.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/96/155525404775.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/96/155525404775.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-142406662</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWF-GS11-JDJN-620W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1033\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

But something can be convenient and good for you at the same time.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was holding my mobile device \u2014 at the time, the feature-challenged BlackBerry RIM 850 \u2014 when my first son was born. It wasn\u2019t on purpose. Without going into the gory details, I was anxious and also bored waiting for Louie to arrive, and was texting about a new conference idea. When I suddenly had to get an epidural and was rushed in for an emergency C-section, I wasn\u2019t focusing on the Blackberry that was still in my hand. So there it was, buzzing away, encased in plastic during the whole procedure, since the scrubbed-in staff couldn\u2019t touch it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cKara, you really have to do something about your tech problem,\u201d joked my doctor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yes, I know. I\u2019m awful. But bear with me when I tell you that this was not the worst thing ever.</p><p>During <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2019/3/18/18270522/margrethe-vestager-europe-competition-commissioner-recode-decode-kara-swisher-podcast-interview-sxsw\">a recent interview at SXSW</url>, <person><nameText>Margrethe Vestager, </nameText></person>the commissioner of competition for the European Union \u2014 the regulator who is the scourge of Facebook, Google, Facebook, Apple and more \u2014 asked me a surprising question.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the good life?\u201d</p><p>The good life, Ms. Vestager said, is not \u201cthe same thing as a convenient life. I think a convenient life can be extremely boring if you\u2019re never challenged with any hardship of everyday life.\u201d</p><p>She was talking about the way we have shifted to valuing convenience as the ultimate good over what is actually good for us. It\u2019s the not surprising result of the twitchy, I-want-it-now, mobile-phone-addled life in which everything is just a click away.</p><p>But I don\u2019t think throwing our phones out the window is the solution. Instead, we have to find a way to balance what is good with what is convenient, even as tech companies do as much as possible to hook us.</p><p>On this topic, there has lately been a lot of hand-wringing. Some are warning that we don\u2019t yet know the consequences of being addicted to our devices. Others are pondering whether the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/sunday-review/human-contact-luxury-screens.html\">overuse of screens is a class issue</url>, in which the poor are trapped in cyberspace and the rich can afford not to be jacked into the matrix 24/7. And what is the price we pay in cohesion, as we opt to stare relentlessly at our phones instead of engaging in person? Will there ever be an end to the tweet-dissing that coarsens our civic discourse? What does it mean that so much of the important information citizens of a working democracy need to know has mutated into blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it memes?</p><p>All of this is about the fact that we are now contending with a culture of convenience that does not differentiate very much between getting news in a form that is \u201csnackable\u201d (my least favorite media word ever), having a bottle of ketchup delivered to your door in the middle of the night even if it sucks up too many resources, and getting a car on demand at the lowest price even if it requires paying drivers less and less.</p><p>The top techie Marc Andreessen once said that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460\">software is eating the world</url>. The fact of the matter is, we are eating software and becoming unhealthy and obese doing it.</p><p>That was the real point Ms. Vestager was making in the interview, which was ostensibly about competition and how to rein in big tech companies with her too-small bag of remedies, such as passing strict laws about how they need to run the platforms that have become a free-for-all. By this I mean both that their services are free and freewheeling and that this freedom comes at a high cost to society.</p><p>So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that she sees the unbridled power of the big tech companies as part of a bigger issue. \u201cWe have to have a discussion\u201d she said, \u201cabout inequality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in that, competition or enforcement is only a tiny part of that answer. But it\u2019s as if we\u2019re not having this discussion,\u201d she said, referring to all manner of apps that bring us stuff immediately. \u201cWe just talk about convenience, \u2018Oh, it will be convenient that my fridge is always full.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Kevin Roose, in a recent column for this paper titled \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/business/cell-phone-addiction.html\">Do Not Disturb: How I Ditched My Phone and Unbroke My Brain</url>,\u201d chronicled the price of tech addiction.</p><p>\u201cUnlike alcohol or opioids, phones aren\u2019t an addictive substance so much as a species-level environmental shock,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve been a heavy phone user for my entire adult life. But sometime last year, I crossed the invisible line into problem territory. My symptoms were all the typical ones: I found myself incapable of reading books, watching full-length movies or having long uninterrupted conversations. Social media made me angry and anxious, and even the digital spaces I once found soothing (group texts, podcasts, YouTube k-holes) weren\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>A species-level environmental shock? That\u2019s a big statement, and it\u2019s true. The most profound experiment in human communications in all of our history is taking place right now.</p><p>But while the downsides of continuous partial attention have been made abundantly clear, we shouldn\u2019t forget that the concept of instant communications is profound, and the ability to be in touch at an important time is both convenient and good.</p><p>As technology morphs and improves, the terrible things about it (being pecked to death by email, texts or tweets) are always shifting back and forth with the great things (the joy of surprising emails, texts or tweets).</p><p>Taking a cue from Mr. Roose\u2019s piece, I looked hard at my own screen time, which adds up to about seven hours a day. I guess that sounds like a lot. But very little of that time is frittered away. </p><p>Mostly, I send what I consider important messages into the ether and I get them back; I read The New York Times and The Washington Post, as I always have; I use Slack to talk to my co-workers, and that\u2019s certainly useful; I check my Google calendar to find out where I should be; I write ideas and notes for columns and podcasts and more; and, best of all these days, I rent scooters.</p><p>All convenient and good, for the most part, which is the balance I think we all have to find as tech keeps eating the world.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

I'm awful. But bear with me when I tell you that this was not the worst thing ever.</p><p>  During a recent interview at SXSW, <person><nameText>Margrethe Vestager, </nameText></person>the commissioner of competition for the European Union -- the regulator who is the scourge of Facebook, Google, Facebook, Apple and more -- asked me a surprising question.</p><p>  ''What is the good life?''</p><p>  The good life, Ms. Vestager said, is not ''the same thing as a convenient life. I think a convenient life can be extremely boring if you're never challenged with any hardship of everyday life.''</p><p>  She was talking about the way we have shifted to valuing convenience as the ultimate good over what is actually good for us. It's the not surprising result of the twitchy, I-want-it-now, mobile-phone-addled life in which everything is just a click away.</p><p>  But I don't think throwing our phones out the window is the solution. Instead, we have to find a way to balance what is good with what is convenient, even as tech companies do as much as possible to hook us.</p><p>  On this topic, there has lately been a lot of hand-wringing. Some are warning that we don't yet know the consequences of being addicted to our devices. Others are pondering whether the overuse of screens is a class issue, in which the poor are trapped in cyberspace and the rich can afford not to be jacked into the matrix 24/7. And what is the price we pay in cohesion, as we opt to stare relentlessly at our phones instead of engaging in person? Will there ever be an end to the tweet-dissing that coarsens our civic discourse? What does it mean that so much of the important information citizens of a working democracy need to know has mutated into blink-and-you'll-miss-it memes?</p><p>  All of this is about the fact that we are now contending with a culture of convenience that does not differentiate very much between getting news in a form that is ''snackable'' (my least favorite media word ever), having a bottle of ketchup delivered to your door in the middle of the night even if it sucks up too many resources, and getting a car on demand at the lowest price even if it requires paying drivers less and less.</p><p>  The top techie Marc Andreessen once said that software is eating the world. The fact of the matter is, we are eating software and becoming unhealthy and obese doing it.</p><p>  That was the real point Ms. Vestager was making in the interview, which was ostensibly about competition and how to rein in big tech companies with her too-small bag of remedies, such as passing strict laws about how they need to run the platforms that have become a free-for-all. By this I mean both that their services are free and freewheeling and that this freedom comes at a high cost to society.</p><p>  So perhaps it's not surprising that she sees the unbridled power of the big tech companies as part of a bigger issue. ''We have to have a discussion'' she said, ''about inequality.''</p><p>  ''And in that, competition or enforcement is only a tiny part of that answer. But it's as if we're not having this discussion,'' she said, referring to all manner of apps that bring us stuff immediately. ''We just talk about convenience, 'Oh, it will be convenient that my fridge is always full.'''</p><p>  Kevin Roose, in a recent column for this paper titled ''Do Not Disturb: How I Ditched My Phone and Unbroke My Brain,'' chronicled the price of tech addiction.</p><p>  ''Unlike alcohol or opioids, phones aren't an addictive substance so much as a species-level environmental shock,'' he wrote. ''I've been a heavy phone user for my entire adult life. But sometime last year, I crossed the invisible line into problem territory. My symptoms were all the typical ones: I found myself incapable of reading books, watching full-length movies or having long uninterrupted conversations. Social media made me angry and anxious, and even the digital spaces I once found soothing (group texts, podcasts, YouTube k-holes) weren't helping.''</p><p>  A species-level environmental shock? That's a big statement, and it's true. The most profound experiment in human communications in all of our history is taking place right now.</p><p>  But while the downsides of continuous partial attention have been made abundantly clear, we shouldn't forget that the concept of instant communications is profound, and the ability to be in touch at an important time is both convenient and good.</p><p>  As technology morphs and improves, the terrible things about it (being pecked to death by email, texts or tweets) are always shifting back and forth with the great things (the joy of surprising emails, texts or tweets).</p><p>  Taking a cue from Mr. Roose's piece, I looked hard at my own screen time, which adds up to about seven hours a day. I guess that sounds like a lot. But very little of that time is frittered away.</p><p>  Mostly, I send what I consider important messages into the ether and I get them back; I read The New York Times and The Washington Post, as I always have; I use Slack to talk to my co-workers, and that's certainly useful; I check my Google calendar to find out where I should be; I write ideas and notes for columns and podcasts and more; and, best of all these days, I rent scooters.</p><p>  All convenient and good, for the most part, which is the balance I think we all have to find as tech keeps eating the world.</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Altman says YC -which has backed Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe and boasts of a portfolio of companies valued at $85 billion -has no doubt that India will support a number of important and huge tech startups in the long term. He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America.Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?</p><p>We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up</p><p>an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does</p><p>converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very longterm view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p><p>So, are we out of the bubble territory?</p><p>Bubblesare an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble. Similarly , in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely 'Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.</p><p>Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?</p><p>It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years.One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company .</p><p>Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why?</p><p>One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are -it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Poli</p><p>tically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates. The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need</p><p>SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing?</p><p>I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!</p><p>What's your take on what happened over at Uber?</p><p>That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this</p><p>a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.</p><p>You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself?</p><p>I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say , a million jobs came as a result of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car. In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here. In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017 there will be some startup that will create five jobs. You have this effect with technology -we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure.</p><p>Tell us what you think of</p><p>idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earlier-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.</p><p>You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed?I'm not a fan of going pub</p><p>I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.</p><p>When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO?</p><p>They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would.They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.</p><p>How do you see the impact of tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google on young startups?</p><p>That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech</p><p>industry -you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough. That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there. On the other hand, there are times when it's worked, like it did for Snapchat.</p><p>But Facebook's got it right with their acquisitions...</p><p>You could argue that Facebook has slipped up by letting WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat emerge. But on the other hand, you can say it's pretty impressive how right they have been about identifying the really big new social media platforms and buying them. At the time, everyone thought it was crazy .I remember when they were acquiring Instagram for $1 billion, everyone was shocked.But now it looks like the most brilliant move in the history of Facebook.</p><p>What are your views on these powerful tech majors being regulated by Washington?</p><p>Idon't know exactly when Washington should regulate a company , it's a hard question. But at some point it has to and that's why there are antitrust laws, it's for a reason. So I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on that. It's the job of the company to be as big and successful as it can and it's the job of the government to say , 'Oh, that's too much'.</p><p>What about the issue of Russia meddling with the US elections and the heat on Google, Facebook and Twitter?</p><p>Who knows what happened, but in general there would be more of that. The internet is going to be the central battle ground for influencing hearts and minds, so we do regulation there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_185_07112017019030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8J-2781-DXJR-H13R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Altman says YC -which has backed Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe and boasts of a portfolio of companies valued at $85 billion -has no doubt that India will support a number of important and huge tech startups in the long term. He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America.Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?</p><p>We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up</p><p>an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does</p><p>converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very longterm view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p><p>So, are we out of the bubble territory?</p><p>Bubbles are an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble. Similarly , in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely 'Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.</p><p>Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?</p><p>It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years.One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company .</p><p>Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why?</p><p>One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are -it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Poli</p><p>tically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates. The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.</p><p>You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself?</p><p>I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say , a million jobs came as aresult of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car. In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here. In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017 there will be some startup that will create five jobs.You have this effect with technology -we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure.</p><p>Tell us what you think of</p><p>SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing?</p><p>I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!</p><p>What's your take on what happened over at Uber?</p><p>That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earli</p><p>er-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.</p><p>You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed?</p><p>I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.</p><p>When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO?</p><p>They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would. They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.</p><p>How do you see the impact of tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google on young startups?</p><p>That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech</p><p>industry -you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough. That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there. On the other hand, there are times when it's worked, like it did for Snapchat.</p><p>But Facebook's got it right with their acquisitions...</p><p>You could argue that Facebook has slipped up by letting WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat emerge. But on the other hand, you can say it's pretty impressive how right they have been about identifying the really big new social media platforms and buying them. At the time, everyone thought it was crazy .I remember when they were acquiring Instagram for $1 billion, everyone was shocked.But now it looks like the most brilliant move in the history of Facebook.</p><p>What are your views on these powerful tech majors being regulated by Washington?</p><p>Idon't know exactly when Washington should regulate a company , it's a hard question. But at some point it has to and that's why there are antitrust laws, it's for a reason. So I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on that.It's the job of the company to be as big and successful as it can and it's the job of the government to say , 'Oh, that's too much'.</p><p>What about the issue of Russia meddling with the US elections and the heat on Google, Facebook and Twitter?</p><p>Who knows what happened, but in general there would be more of that. The internet is going to be the central battle ground for influencing hearts and minds, so we do regulation there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_158_07112017017030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8J-2781-DXJR-H1H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Altman says YC -which has backed Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe and boasts of a portfolio of companies valued at $85 billion -has no doubt that India will support a number of important and huge tech startups in the long term. He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America.Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?</p><p>We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up</p><p>an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does</p><p>converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very longterm view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p><p>So, are we out of the bubble territory?</p><p>Bubbles are an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble. Similarly , in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely 'Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.</p><p>Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?</p><p>It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years.One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company .</p><p>Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why?</p><p>One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are -it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Poli</p><p>tically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates. The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.</p><p>You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself?</p><p>I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say , a million jobs came as aresult of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car. In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here. In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017 there will be some startup that will create five jobs.You have this effect with technology -we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure.</p><p>Tell us what you think of</p><p>SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing?</p><p>I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!</p><p>What's your take on what happened over at Uber?</p><p>That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earli</p><p>er-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.</p><p>You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed?</p><p>I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.</p><p>When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO?</p><p>They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would. They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.</p><p>How do you see the impact of tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google on young startups?</p><p>That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech</p><p>industry -you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough. That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there. On the other hand, there are times when it's worked, like it did for Snapchat.</p><p>But Facebook's got it right with their acquisitions...</p><p>You could argue that Facebook has slipped up by letting WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat emerge. But on the other hand, you can say it's pretty impressi ve how right they have been about identifying the really big new social media platforms and buying them. At the time, everyone thought it was crazy .I remember when they were acquiring Instagram for $1 billion, everyone was shocked.But now it looks like the most brilliant move in the history of Facebook.</p><p>What are your views on these powerful tech majors being regulated by Washington?</p><p>Idon't know exactly when Washington should regulate a company , it's a hard question. But at some point it has to and that's why there are antitrust laws, it's for a reason. So I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on that.It's the job of the company to be as big and successful as it can and it's the job of the government to say , 'Oh, that's too much'.</p><p>What about the issue of Russia meddling with the US elections and the heat on Google, Facebook and Twitter?</p><p>Who knows what happened, but in general there would be more of that. The internet is going to be the central battle ground for influencing hearts and minds, so we do regulation there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_142_07112017015030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8J-2781-DXJR-H1KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very longterm view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p><p>So, are we out of the bubble territory?</p><p>Bubblesare an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble. Similarly , in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely 'Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.</p><p>Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?</p><p>It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years.One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company .</p><p>Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why?</p><p>One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are -it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Poli</p><p>tically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates. The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need</p><p>SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing?</p><p>I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!</p><p>What's your take on what happened over at Uber?</p><p>That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this</p><p>a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.</p><p>You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself?</p><p>I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say , a million jobs came as a result of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car. In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here. In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017 there will be some startup that will create five jobs. You have this effect with technology -we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure.</p><p>Tell us what you think of</p><p>idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earlier-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.</p><p>You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed?I'm not a fan of going pub</p><p>I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.</p><p>When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO?</p><p>They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would.They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.</p><p>How do you see the impact of tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google on young startups?</p><p>That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech</p><p>industry -you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough. That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there. On the other hand, there are times when it's worked, like it did for Snapchat.</p><p>But Facebook's got it right with their acquisitions...</p><p>You could argue that Facebook has slipped up by letting WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat emerge. But on the other hand, you can say it's pretty impressive how right they have been about identifying the really big new social media platforms and buying them. At the time, everyone thought it was crazy .I remember when they were acquiring Instagram for $1 billion, everyone was shocked.But now it looks like the most brilliant move in the history of Facebook.</p><p>What are your views on these powerful tech majors being regulated by Washington?</p><p>Idon't know exactly when Washington should regulate a company , it's a hard question. But at some point it has to and that's why there are antitrust laws, it's for a reason. So I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on that. It's the job of the company to be as big and successful as it can and it's the job of the government to say , 'Oh, that's too much'.</p><p>What about the issue of Russia meddling with the US elections and the heat on Google, Facebook and Twitter?</p><p>Who knows what happened, but in general there would be more of that. The internet is going to be the central battle ground for influencing hearts and minds, so we do regulation there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_185_07112017019030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PWV-PT01-JB3N-T1WG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Altman says YC -which has backed Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe and boasts of a portfolio of companies valued at $85 billion -has no doubt that India will support a number of important and huge tech startups in the long term. He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America.Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?</p><p>We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up</p><p>an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does</p><p>converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India.

Altman says YC -which has backed Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe and boasts of a portfolio of companies valued at $85 billion -has no doubt that India will support a number of important and huge tech startups in the long term. He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America.Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?</p><p>We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up</p><p>an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does</p><p>converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very longterm view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p><p>So, are we out of the bubble territory?</p><p>Bubbles are an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble. Similarly , in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely 'Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.</p><p>Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?</p><p>It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years.One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company .</p><p>Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why?</p><p>One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are -it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Poli</p><p>tically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates. The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.</p><p>You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself?</p><p>I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say , a million jobs came as aresult of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car. In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here. In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017 there will be some startup that will create five jobs.You have this effect with technology -we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure.</p><p>Tell us what you think of</p><p>SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing?</p><p>I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!</p><p>What's your take on what happened over at Uber?</p><p>That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earli</p><p>er-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.</p><p>You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed?</p><p>I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.</p><p>When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO?</p><p>They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would. They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.</p><p>How do you see the impact of tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google on young startups?</p><p>That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech</p><p>industry -you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough. That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there. On the other hand, there are times when it's worked, like it did for Snapchat.</p><p>But Facebook's got it right with their acquisitions...</p><p>You could argue that Facebook has slipped up by letting WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat emerge. But on the other hand, you can say it's pretty impressive how right they have been about identifying the really big new social media platforms and buying them. At the time, everyone thought it was crazy .I remember when they were acquiring Instagram for $1 billion, everyone was shocked.But now it looks like the most brilliant move in the history of Facebook.</p><p>What are your views on these powerful tech majors being regulated by Washington?</p><p>Idon't know exactly when Washington should regulate a company , it's a hard question. But at some point it has to and that's why there are antitrust laws, it's for a reason. So I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on that.It's the job of the company to be as big and successful as it can and it's the job of the government to say , 'Oh, that's too much'.</p><p>What about the issue of Russia meddling with the US elections and the heat on Google, Facebook and Twitter?</p><p>Who knows what happened, but in general there would be more of that. The internet is going to be the central battle ground for influencing hearts and minds, so we do regulation there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_127_07112017013030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PWV-PT01-JB3N-T1NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Altman says YC -which has backed Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe and boasts of a portfolio of companies valued at $85 billion -has no doubt that India will support a number of important and huge tech startups in the long term. He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America.Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?</p><p>We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up</p><p>an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does</p><p>converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very longterm view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p><p>So, are we out of the bubble territory?</p><p>Bubbles are an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble. Similarly , in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely 'Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.</p><p>Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?</p><p>It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years.One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company .</p><p>Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why?</p><p>One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are -it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Poli</p><p>tically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates. The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.</p><p>You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself?</p><p>I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say , a million jobs came as aresult of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car. In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here. In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017 there will be some startup that will create five jobs.You have this effect with technology -we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure.</p><p>Tell us what you think of</p><p>SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing?</p><p>I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!</p><p>What's your take on what happened over at Uber?</p><p>That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earli</p><p>er-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.</p><p>You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed?</p><p>I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.</p><p>When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO?</p><p>They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would. They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.</p><p>How do you see the impact of tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google on young startups?</p><p>That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech</p><p>industry -you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough. That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there.

We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography , that perpetuates in the local community and then people say , 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'.</p><p>Will you look at setting up</p><p>an India outpost?</p><p>Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.</p><p>Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?</p><p>I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish.There are very few longterm investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.</p><p>So what's wrong with the tech investing class?</p><p>It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.</p><p>When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...</p><p>We try and not get caught up in what other investors do.The way I look at investing is that, on any given day , what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does</p><p>converge to reality . We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very longterm view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.</p><p>You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?</p><p>I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die.But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.</p><p>So, are we out of the bubble territory?</p><p>Bubblesare an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble. Similarly , in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely 'Yes'.So we will just ride the waves.</p><p>In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...</p><p>Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.</p><p>Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?</p><p>It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years.One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company .</p><p>Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why?</p><p>One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are -it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Poli</p><p>tically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates. The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need</p><p>SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing?</p><p>I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!</p><p>What's your take on what happened over at Uber?</p><p>That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this</p><p>a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.</p><p>You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself?</p><p>I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say , a million jobs came as a result of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car. In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here. In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017 there will be some startup that will create five jobs. You have this effect with technology -we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure.</p><p>Tell us what you think of</p><p>idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earlier-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.</p><p>You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed?I'm not a fan of going pub</p><p>I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.</p><p>When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO?</p><p>They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would.They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.</p><p>How do you see the impact of tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google on young startups?</p><p>That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech</p><p>industry -you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough. That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there. On the other hand, there are times when it's worked, like it did for Snapchat.</p><p>But Facebook's got it right with their acquisitions...</p><p>You could argue that Facebook has slipped up by letting WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat emerge. But on the other hand, you can say it's pretty impressive how right they have been about identifying the really big new social media platforms and buying them. At the time, everyone thought it was crazy .I remember when they were acquiring Instagram for $1 billion, everyone was shocked.But now it looks like the most brilliant move in the history of Facebook.</p><p>What are your views on these powerful tech majors being regulated by Washington?</p><p>Idon't know exactly when Washington should regulate a company , it's a hard question. But at some point it has to and that's why there are antitrust laws, it's for a reason. So I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on that. It's the job of the company to be as big and successful as it can and it's the job of the government to say , 'Oh, that's too much'.</p><p>What about the issue of Russia meddling with the US elections and the heat on Google, Facebook and Twitter?</p><p>Who knows what happened, but in general there would be more of that. The internet is going to be the central battle ground for influencing hearts and minds, so we do regulation there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_185_07112017019030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PX3-H4F1-JB3N-T4DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.
