Those words from FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai bring home the reality of a recent decision that has been largely buried under the latest Hillary scandal, the GOP's little heads-up letter to the Ayatollah and the foreign policy crises surrounding ISIS and Iran. But it is a decision that will insidiously affect every single American.</p><p><br/> Innocently couched in the term 'net neutrality,' the FCC decision to 'level the playing field' on internet service threatens to do what socialism always does - improve the lot of the few at the expense of the many, impede the free market and grant the federal government broad new powers.<br/> Of course, we are assured that, new regulations aside, if you like your internet, you can keep your internet. And that is about as true as when it was originally said about your health insurance policy in the wake of 'we have to pass it [1]so you can find out what's in it'.<br/> In what can only be fairly described as a breathtaking power grab, the FCC has given us Obamanet. So now is the time to wax nostalgic about the heady early days of the internet and the free market pioneers who turned it into an indispensable vehicle for the entire world. Because Barack Obama has tried to make certain those days are gone forever.<br/> Indeed, one of the things that made the astounding scope of the internet possible is that it was left free from government meddling for so much of its young life. If you try, in many (most) places in these United States to start a new business, you face innumerable hurdles of regulation and government interference. How many government offices do you think you have to visit, call, write, petition and pay to, say, start a restaurant? Does that obstacle course make for greater or fewer choices for the dining public? We know the answer is fewer. But starting a website or web-based business has until now been free from many of these hassles, and as such, activity has soared. This benefits both seller and buyer, making both richer, and that's why it's a no-brainer that such exchanges should be encouraged rather than discouraged, protected rather than hobbled.<br/> So what did the FCC do? I mean, you haven't gotten a notice from the new federal internet police when visiting your favorite website. You can still buy your books and most everything else from Amazon, and your music from Apple, so where's the trouble? Well, the FCC, in a straight party line decision, voted[2] 3-2 to incorporate the internet into its content and distribution regulation web. Under the new rules[3], the 'FCC officials would   no longer classify the Internet as an 'information service' but a 'telecommunications service' subject to Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.'<br/> That may not seem like such a big deal until you find out what it allows them to do. This reclassification empowers the FCC to govern the internet and internet companies as they would a utility company. As per the dissenting FCC Commissioner Pai's statement[4] on the new rule, '[i]t seizes unilateral authority to regulate Internet conduct, to direct where Internet service providers (ISPs) make their investments, and to determine what service plans will be available to the American public. This is a radical departure from the bipartisan, market oriented policies that have served us so well for the last two decades. '<br/> The reason for such a radical change in policy is simply stated by Commissioner Pai - 'We are flip-flopping for one reason and one reason alone. President Obama told us to do so. On November 10, President Obama asked the FCC to implement his plan for regulating the Internet, one that favors government regulation over marketplace competition. As has been widely reported in the press, the FCC has been scrambling ever since to figure out a way to do just that.'<br/> Hard and fast rules are effective if you want a simple system of laws and rules to follow. If, however, you want to exploit the rules for your own gain, to limit competition, and to help your friends and punish your enemies, then you need more rules and regulations - the more the better, and the more nebulous the better.<br/> The Wall St. Journal's Gordon Crovitz has done a great job discussing[5] how these rules will be used to limit competition, harming consumers in favor of companies who can exploit the rules in their favor:<br/> Competitors could have objected to the 'fast lane' that Amazon got from Sprint [6]at the launch of the Kindle to ensure speedy e-book downloads. The FCC could have blocked Apple from integrating Internet access into the iPhone. Activists could have objected to AOL bundling access to The Wall Street Journal in its early dial-up service.<br/> Among the first targets of the FCC's 'unjust and unreasonable' test are mobile-phone contracts that offer unlimited video or music. Netflix[7],the biggest lobbyist for utility regulation, could be regulated for how it uses encryption to deliver its content.<br/> Unlike mere profit-seeking companies, you see, utilities must act in the 'public good.' So who gets to determine what is good for the public? The simple answer is that Barack Obama and his friends at the FCC will decide what's good. This will inevitably lead to tech companies funneling even more campaign cash to the people promoting and enforcing these regulations, revolving door consultancies and the soft corruption of board seats and speaking fees.<br/> The very regulation itself is a double bonus for Obama - in addition to the increase in power, he can provide a simple payoff to large tech companies who support increased regulation to thwart competition. Per the Washington Post[8], 'The affinity between the White House and the tech industry has enriched Obama's campaigns through donations, and it has presented lucrative opportunities for staffers who leave for the private sector.' That piece goes on to document the veritable panoply of Obama insiders who are now the beneficiaries of sweetheart deals at big tech companies.<br/> This President makes sport of punishing his enemies and rewarding his friends, allies and those who have paid for protection. These current rules will allow him to do more of the same. Then, after he leaves office, the rules can continue in place for the next administration to do the same - the left ignores this political reality at their own peril.<br/> Lest we need say it again, the reason to limit executive power is because we know from centuries of politics that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. We can only hope that will bear out via legislative and judicial attempts now underway to restrict these new rules that threaten to turn our vibrant internet into just another victim of a power-hungry government trying to regulate everything that's not nailed down.<br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-05TLiiLU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-05TLiiLU</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/02/26/fcc-formally-approves-net-neutrality-proposal-in-straight-party-line-vote/\">http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/02/26/fcc-formally-approves-net-neutrality-proposal-in-straight-party-line-vote/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/26/fcc-approves-sweeping-internet-regulation-plan-obama-accused-meddling/\">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/02/26/fcc-approves-sweeping-internet-regulation-plan-obama-accused-meddling/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0226/DOC-332260A5.pdf\">http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0226/DOC-332260A5.pdf</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/l-gordon-crovitz-from-internet-to-obamanet-1424644324\">http://www.wsj.com/articles/l-gordon-crovitz-from-internet-to-obamanet-1424644324</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/S\">http://quotes.wsj.com/S</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/NFLX\">http://quotes.wsj.com/NFLX</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/as-obama-nears-close-of-his-tenure-commitment-to-silicon-valley-is-clear/2015/02/27/3bee8088-bc8e-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/as-obama-nears-close-of-his-tenure-commitment-to-silicon-valley-is-clear/2015/02/27/3bee8088-bc8e-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCNBLG-BEAD11562814266046195047754137</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BEAD-115628</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FHY-M921-DXKX-00X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401995</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1294\"/><timeReceived>3:03 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>State Capital Newsfeed <br/>Bearing Drift( Virginia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>March 17, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Policy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Featured</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Columns</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

I hope you enjoy this episode of Cyber Space with John Carlin in conversation with Alex Stamos.    John Carlin :                  From CAFE. Welcome to Cyber Space. I\u2019m your host, John Carlin. Today marks the official launch of this podcast. Every other Friday we\u2019ll be exploring the key issues at the intersection of tech, law and policy. I\u2019ll be joined by a range of guests who\u2019ve made an impact in the world of cybersecurity. My guest this week is Alex Stamos. He served as the chief security officer at Facebook when he led an investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.    He was previously the chief information security officer at Yahoo, where he dealt with a number of major cyber attacks from nation state actors. Today he teaches at Stanford and leads the university\u2019s internet observatory. He also recently took on a role with Zoom, helping the company with security challenges brought on by its exponential growth during the pandemic. There is much to discuss and I\u2019m thrilled to have Alex Stamos on this program.    Welcome Alex. Great to be talking to you again. And I wanted to start really with your background a little bit. You\u2019ve had a long career in tech, including time as a successful entrepreneur and executive at Yahoo and Facebook. Although as we\u2019ll get into a little bit more, sometimes I wonder if hiring you means instant crisis, but let me just take you back a little bit. Is this the path you envisioned when you majored in electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley?    Alex Stamos :                Not exactly. I was always interested in computer security, but like other security people of my generation, most of the training that we got was very unofficial, I think you would say. There\u2019s really no good way if you\u2019re growing up in the eighties and early nineties to learn about security in a way that\u2019s completely legal and allowed. So, did some things on a Commodore 64, then a PC starting with 300 baud modem and hanging out with friends and the like and back then security stuff was just kind of fun, right? Like going and breaking into BBSs and you know.    So BBS is pre-internet. If you want to hang out with your friends online, you dial into what\u2019s called the bulletin board system. So you dial in with your modem and often people would be interacting asynchronously because a lot of BBSs only had one or two phone lines. So you could go write messages while you\u2019re dialed in, go off, come back 24 hours later to see what people have done.    But also, what was big for kids those days was trading video games and tips on how to crack them and such. And that\u2019s actually how I first learned how to do some reverse engineering, was breaking the copy protection on my Commodore 64 games and learning all that from BBSs.    John Carlin :                  Was there a particular game you remember cracking?    Alex Stamos :                Yes, actually. There\u2019s a really fun game called Red Storm Rising, which was a submarine simulator based the Tom Clancy book. It was the best Commodore 64 game and also very expensive. Got myself a copy of that, but at the time, again, it was just kind of this innocent time when doing this kind of stuff was not incredibly impactful on people\u2019s lives. And technology was just this kind of side thing, right? Like, most of my life did not revolve around tech even for a super nerd. And just kind of amazing to think what has happened since then that now technology plays such a more central part of everybody\u2019s life. Especially somebody who\u2019s interested in it like I was.    John Carlin :                  WarGames. This is 1984, I think around movies starring Matthew Broderick, about a kid who hacks into the Department of Defense and nearly starts a nuclear war, spoiler alert. But did you see it and what impact did it have?    Alex Stamos :                It did. Yeah. I mean the two biggest, most impactful movies for me in the computer space was WarGames, which is exactly the kind of stuff that me and these kids who\u2019d go to this 2,600 meetups. So there\u2019s a magazine called The Hacker Quarterly: 2,600. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it. Do you know where the 2,600 comes from? This is actually a quiz I give my students.    John Carlin :                  I do not.    Alex Stamos :                There was a man named Captain Crunch, actually, who I believe also went to Berkeley, but back in the sixties, who figured out that the whistle in the Captain Crunch cereal box made a perfect 2,600 Hertz tone, which turns out to be the tone by which the local AT&amp;T office would signal the long distance switch. If you use that whistle, you could then steal long distance calls.    So anyway, this is exactly the kind of stuff that we\u2019d talk about and WarGames. He is what\u2019s now called war dialing, which is, he just goes through and dials a bunch of phone numbers until he finds computers. And that\u2019s the exactly kind of thing that a bunch of kids would do in those days. Again, with no malicious purpose, just as see what was out there and what was hanging out. And it was a pretty good time. The other movie that really had impact on me was Sneakers, right? Which is the Robert Redford movie in which he and a bunch of his friends have a company that are professional hackers and they get paid to fix stuff which effectively became a career goal of mine that I was able to fulfill a little bit later.    John Carlin :                  For those, you know, it\u2019s pandemic time, at home looking for something to watch, it\u2019s a good time to rewatch both those movies and Sneakers has an incredible cast. Not just Robert Redford.    Alex Stamos :                Right, right, it\u2019s Dan Aykroyd, David Strathairn and James Earl Jones makes a cameo as you pretty much, right? And as a high up guy in the National Security establishment.    John Carlin :                  It was pre National Security Division, but I\u2019ll take it even though I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the best messaging for it. The WarGames, I always find it an interesting one. I know we\u2019ve talked about this before, because in addition to influencing a young Alex Stamos , it also for president Reagan caused him to ask the question, \u201cCould this happen to us?\u201d Apparently it was really the beginnings of the first government programs when the answer was, \u201cYes, it could happen to us and we\u2019re not really prepared for it.\u201d    Alex Stamos :                Yeah. It\u2019s interesting and that whole time is like looking back, the relationship between teenage hackers and the government was very complicated and weird, right? Some guys I ended up working with later were part of a group called MOD, Masters Of Destruction, which was like a pro hacking group in New York that the secret service, I think, called the greatest cyber terrorist in the world or something. They turned out to be all these kids that go to the same school in the Upper East Side.    John Carlin :                  Which we\u2019ll get to it later. But the recent Twitter hack, I think you still have that phenomenon going on.    Alex Stamos :                Right. Well, but I mean, this is the difference now, right? Like if you\u2019re 17 and you have these skills and you don\u2019t very carefully stay on the beaten path, you will end up in a very dark place. I think that\u2019s actually \u2026 there\u2019s so many more options for young people now. There\u2019s good options. You can participate in online hacking clubs. Like just yesterday, I did a webcast with a thing called Hack Club, which is like this international group of teenagers that are interested in computer security and they all participate in capture the flag competitions. They participate in official bug bounties.    John Carlin :                  Oh, let\u2019s take a step back. Explain what capture the flag competition is.    Alex Stamos :                A capture the flag or a CTF is a competition where you have an artificial network set up and you compete to break into computers and to get the flag, which is usually a file that sits on the computer. That\u2019s kind of an artificial game and it\u2019s something that I actually used to participate a lot in. I\u2019m too old now. I\u2019d have to be in the seniors division of hacking if I did that.    John Carlin :                  They should make that.    Alex Stamos :                They should.    John Carlin :                  They should make that.    Alex Stamos :                They should be, right. [crosstalk] Just like with swimming, they call it masters, right? Like that just means old. You know, if you\u2019re a young person and you want to learn to hack, you can be part of a competition. Schools can have teams now, like at some high schools, it is a varsity sport to do hacking, which I think is incredible and awesome and a great opportunity.    Then if you want to go up against real systems and not in these artificial play lands, you can go up against companies that have announced, \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to hack us and we will pay you.\u201d And so there\u2019s all these great opportunities for students, but there\u2019s also a huge downside, which is if you fall into effectively the wrong crowd, you will get pulled into a criminal underground that didn\u2019t really exist when I was coming up.    John Carlin :                  We\u2019ve talked a little bit about the fork in the road for current kids, where you can go down the path of being paid by companies to find vulnerabilities so that they can fix them and essentially getting paid for gaming, which is the capture the flag or bug bounty programs. And then on the other hand, that there\u2019s this dark criminal underworld where you can also end up getting paid, and kids end up faced with a choice or exploring one path or the other. What would you say, which experience helped shape your thinking about technology and policy and put you, I think on the path of a law abiding citizen?    Alex Stamos :                A mostly law abiding citizen.    John Carlin :                  Mostly.    Alex Stamos :                Yeah. I mean, I was very fortunate in my childhood. So I had very supportive parents. Grew up in a very stable household in suburban Sacramento. Went to a good public high school, was able to get good grades and go to Berkeley. And so there was none of those things that maybe other kids pushed them off the path. Plus we\u2019re a immigrant family, Stamatopoulos, and I had a grandfather, [Andrew Rawkus 00:09:25], [Andreas Ruckus 00:09:24] from Cyprus who had really kind of nailed into me the importance of education. That was his big thing.    He had left Cypress, he had a fifth grade education because he was the oldest boy in the family and had been pulled out of school to work on the family farm. And so, when you\u2019re the grandson of a literal goat herder, there\u2019s that kind of immigrant expectations on your shoulder. That helped and I had that opportunity. I could go to Cal and I could take real classes.    There wasn\u2019t a lot you could study in security. There\u2019s only one security class in the late nineties there. This is actually an interesting kind of mirror image of what\u2019s going on right now around trust and safety, which is the same problem. But at the time you couldn\u2019t go to a university and learn a lot about security. So I took a graduate class by [David Faulkner 00:10:07], a really famous now professor, at the time he was like a brand new professor, just gotten his PhD. And then was able to get a good job and do this stuff professionally.    John Carlin :                  So you get out of Berkeley and you end up just three years later, co-founding iSEC Partners, a security consulting firm that ends up becoming a really big success. And as you\u2019re saying, there was barely any coursework. It sounds like you went and found the one course that you could find at Berkeley. How\u2019d you end up in the security space?    Alex Stamos :                I mean, it was always something I was interested in doing professionally. I mean the nice thing about going \u2026 and I do always recommend to young people, if you have the ability to go get a real computer science or electrical engineering education, it is still incredibly important for security. Now, some of the best hackers I know dropped out of school, didn\u2019t go to school. But if it is an opportunity for you, it is still important because security is about breaking the layers of abstraction in a system, right? Like the computers are so incredibly complex that even the people that program them have basic assumptions about how they work. It turns out those basic assumptions are often false. They\u2019re good enough to go build something that works. They\u2019re not good enough to build something that works securely. And so studying computers down to the lowest level can often be a really good skill.    But yeah, I graduated in the dot bomb, right after the collapse of the dotcom industry. I had a job offer at a company called LoudCloud, which was Marc Andreessen\u2019s company after Netscape. It was really the first cloud computing company. It was a cloud computing company that predated all the technology that makes cloud computing profitable now. It was just a little ahead of its time and I graduated into that and they ended up pulling back my job offer. Then I have a very distinct memory of doing this trip through Europe with my sister, for my post college trip and being in the basement of the train station in Florence, Italy, and logging into a web cafe.    So here I am now, looking back, I\u2019m like, wait. So I went into like this random computer in this train station in Italy and I typed in my password to get my email, but that\u2019s how you did it. And then them saying like, \u201cOh, because we are legally required under our PCI, our credit card requirements to have a security engineer, we\u2019re going to have to give you your job,\u201d which is like, it was great to get an email. It was like, \u201cWe are required to hire you. So we\u2019re going to roll eyes, actually follow through.\u201d But that was a great experience and did some other stuff. I worked for a company called [Adstake] which was kind of a consulting company famously full of ex hackers and a fascinating group of people.    John Carlin :                  Just to pause though for a second, that\u2019s an example of, so there\u2019s essentially a public private regulation that says there\u2019s certain ways you need to protect credit card information in the PCI rules. And, but for that, you would not have gotten your first job in security?    Alex Stamos :                Yeah, I think so. It wasn\u2019t called PCI just to be \u2026 you\u2019re going to get email at the time. I forget exactly what it was called. Like before the payment card industry council existed, there were some other security standard from the credit card industry, but yes, it was only because they had a regulatory requirement to have somebody with this title, that I eventually got the job.    John Carlin :                  So I expect you to be thankful throughout this for regulation.    Alex Stamos :                Oh yes, exactly. Well, I guess we\u2019ll get to that part. I\u2019m definitely pro-regulation, I just think it should be tied to reality. But yeah and so I worked at Adstake, which is a consultancy [inaudible 00:00:13:20].    John Carlin :                  What year was this roughly?    Alex Stamos :                I was 25. This is 2004. So Adstake gets bought by Symantec and a bunch of friends and I were like, we don\u2019t want to go sell antivirus for Symantec. That was not our plan. So we ended up going and starting our own company and it was an incredible experience. I mean, we bootstrapped it. We all threw a couple of grand in to buy our first laptops. The first data center was the closet. My wife and I had just gotten married. We moved into a place in the sunset district of San Francisco so it was nice and cool.    So I literally had a stack of computers in the closet and then just opened the window for ventilation. She called it the door of din because we had these machines running continuously in the closet under her shoes. We started this company and it turned into something pretty great. We were just really well timed because all of us were specialists in application security. And this is the time in the 2004 timeframe when the thrust of security interest inside of corporations was switching from what we call network security, which is mapping out networks, getting past firewalls, using vulnerabilities in software that you buy from somebody else, like an Oracle or Microsoft, to software security about the software that companies build themselves.    And so we were just pretty well positioned for that. Then we made some good bets, like we got into mobile security very early, and that turned out to be a really good bet. Be in the right place at the right time is a pretty important thing.    John Carlin :                  So you\u2019re sitting there in your one bedroom with the floor shaking from the door of din and you managed to pull off getting some heavy hitting clients, which I think you explain, including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon. And it sounds like some of that is your right place, right time, great expertise, but how\u2019d you pull that off? How\u2019d you get them to trust someone working out of essentially his basement?    Alex Stamos :                Well, all of us had worked as consultants before for Adstake, so a couple of those relationships were preexisting, probably the most important was Microsoft. I had done at that point, a lot of work at Microsoft for Adstake. This is right after the famous letter from Bill Gates out to the entire company. The trustworthy computing memo, where he said, \u201cWe as a company are going to pivot to build software that is more secure and more trustworthy.\u201d    Speaker 1:                    Well, there\u2019s a lot of invention that has to take place. Take, for example, the issue of privacy. That holds a lot of people back from using the internet. How do you describe to a user, say when they provide their credit card or they do a transaction, how do you describe to them in a simple way how that information is going to be used? So that, say when they come back to that site, it\u2019ll be customized for their use that\u2019s to their benefit.    But unless you can come up with a way of describing it and really assuring them, then people will always under-use what\u2019s possible on the internet. Privacy is a perfect example of something that we need brilliant work, and it\u2019s not just man hours. Take the idea of you get email that interrupts you. Some email is super important and you should be interrupted and other email you should get when you\u2019re not busy-    Speaker 2:                    And some you shouldn\u2019t get.    Speaker 1:                    \u2026 And some email you should never get.    Speaker 2:                    Exactly.    Speaker 1:                    And why can\u2019t the computer do that? Well, it\u2019s not just man hours to solve that problem. We have, I think, brilliant people on it, but it\u2019s not like they can write down, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s 500 hours of work.\u201d They\u2019ve got to invent. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s a research topic.    Alex Stamos :                A big part of that was then Microsoft hiring outside hackers to come in and help them fix stuff. And I had done a bunch of that work already, and then the day of the announcement that Symantec was buying this company, Microsoft kicked all the consultants off because they were already in some kind of antitrust lawsuit or something with Symantec. And so there was this opportunity of they knew us, we gave them a huge discount. This is an opportunity for them to pick up some talent cheaply and it worked out really well.    So Microsoft was kind of our cornerstone client for awhile, but then, we built a reputation and the other thing we did is we did a lot of public research and that\u2019s, I think still an important thing for new consultants and new security experts starting out, is to get out there and do original research in new kinds of vulnerabilities, new classes of issues. And then go talk about them publicly, preferably in an ethical way, in a way that actually helps things. So we did a lot of that and that was a really good marketing and sales strategy for us.    John Carlin :                  And our paths overlapped in a way, although we didn\u2019t meet, but with the Aurora attacks. Maybe we can just spend a moment reminding our listeners, could you explain the Aurora attacks and what happened?    Alex Stamos :                We\u2019re talking about early 2010. Our company was doing lots of work for Google. They had originally brought us in to work on the ship software. So, Google had made that transition from being a web only company to shipping operating systems and they had known that we had done a lot of work for Microsoft on operating system security. And it\u2019s actually quite a different model of the kinds of things you do.    So we were doing a lot of work for Google. We were also doing a decent amount of instant response work for companies that had been broken into, and I get a call from the Google folks and go over. And they explained to me that they had uncovered a breach into Google that had lasted for quite a long time. In investigating that, they had found a commanding control system that was behind a dynamic DNS name, and they had gone and taken that over and pointed it at their own computer.    When they did so, their goal was to find all of the infected machines inside of the Google network. But what they found was that there was over 20 other companies that had been hacked too by the same campaign, and that they had traced it back now that they had control of that intermediate system, to China. They believed that this was related to the Chinese military.    Speaker 3:                    Late last year a student group that criticizes China\u2019s rule in Tibet, learned false emails were being sent in their name. And some of their email accounts provided by Google had been hacked.    Speaker 4:                    I was extremely startled and I couldn\u2019t believe that someone, an unknown stranger could hack into my account so easily.    Speaker 3:                    Last week Google traced the sabotage back to China and says the break-ins were part of a pattern of cyber attacks on human rights activists who criticized China.    John Carlin :                  And pausing there just for a sec, can you recall another prior to that case where a company of the size, scale, reputation of Google publicly accused China and its government of hacking?    Alex Stamos :                No, this was a landmark moment for a number of reasons. Like you said, yes, Google comes out and they publicly admit that they\u2019d been hacked, which was very avant-garde, for people to proactively say that at the time. It was seen as shameful if you had been attacked. And so they one, publicly come out with that. Two, that it was against the entire tech industry, right? Like everybody at this point had heard about Chinese attacks against defense contractors and government agencies and defense industrial base, but to go against a huge chunk of Silicon Valley all at once, this was kind of the first public knowledge of that. Yes, and the fact that they provided attribution was a totally new thing.    John Carlin :                  And then they not only say it originates in China, they threatened to pull out of the country. And what\u2019s your view of both that thread and what actually happened?    Alex Stamos :                The relationship between the United States and China is obviously incredibly complex. From my perspective, the People\u2019s Republic is the place that Silicon Valley ethics go to die. That you have these companies that are very high minded in their corporate missions, in the statements they make and the way they relate to democracies, that then when it comes to China, the combination of the skill of the Chinese government in manipulating companies and gaining leverage, the amount of ef \u2026    PART 1 OF 4 ENDS [00:21:04]    Alex Stamos :                -And gaining leverage. The amount of effort the Chinese put into hacking and infiltration, and then the overall economic importance of the country is this combination that for whatever reason companies often forget all of the things they have said in other places, and they act in a way that\u2019s completely contrary to their corporate mission. At this time, Google had a search engine that was available in mainland China that was censored. Now at the time, Google made the argument and it\u2019s not a horrible argument, that it\u2019s better for Google to exist than nothing. I think this was seen by them as if they\u2019re going to cooperate with the Chinese on Chinese law openly, to have the PRC then turn their intelligence agencies against the inside network of Google was just a step too far, and that they were going to cut off official.    My understanding is they turned off that censored version and then the PRC blocked the rest of Google\u2019s product via the Great Firewall. There\u2019s been this uncomfortable relationship between Google and China since then. Whereas, China is still incredibly important to Google because that\u2019s where most Android phones are built. Google\u2019s Android operating system is very popular there. It powers the vast majority of phones, although often in an unofficial capacity in a way that\u2019s not licensed from Google. There\u2019s this real complicated back and forth that has continued since then. I think at the time it was a very big statement, and I thought it was also one of the last times I can think of a big tech company really standing up to China publicly.    John Carlin :                  Let me take a step back. We\u2019ve covered a decent span of time now, and you had a quote when you were speaking at the Newton Lecture Series dividing our time into different eras, comparing 2001 where very compared to now few people had Internet access.    Alex Stamos :                Security\u2019s gone from being a fun game to a basic life safety issue. In 2001, I don\u2019t know what the number is, but somebody can probably look it up while we sit up here. One, in 2001, you couldn\u2019t automatically solve bar bets like that by just looking at your phone. You look it up later. Also, a billion had Internet access, or 700 million people, or something like that. I think at some in 1999 there was like 100 million people had Internet access. For those people, the Internet was a fun thing where they could do some research, do some reading, and now the Internet is a critical part of the lives of close to three billion people. If security\u2019s gone from something, when the Morris Worm happened and the entire Internet shut down, nobody died. That would not be true today if the Internet just stopped working, or if we had a worm that infected 90% of Internet-connected devices. People would die, or people would lose their jobs, or there\u2019d be mass chaos.    So, security\u2019s gone from something that\u2019s just kind of fun to something that\u2019s responsibility. That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be fun when you do it, but you have to sometimes step back and be like, \u201cOh man, actually you are having a real impact.\u201d    John Carlin :                  Then you referred to, for prosecutors and law enforcement, a case that\u2019s always discussed: the Morris Worm, which is really the first time attempted to apply criminal law to an intrusion. This was a self-propagating code in 1988 that shut down the Internet. You said that when the Morris Worm happened, the entire Internet shut down and nobody died. That would not be true today if the Internet just stopped working, or if we had a worm that infected 90% of Internet connections, people would die or people would lose their jobs, or there would be mass chaos.    Explain that quote a little bit, and where you think we are now compared to where we were when it comes to Internet-related threats.    Alex Stamos :                Yeah, in that speech I was kind of talking about the progression of our professional of people who work in computer security, or cyber security as you guys say in DC, or information security as we say on the west coast, as yo, first a hobby, then a job just like any other IT job that is important to support things that people are doing, but not super critical to effectively becoming a priesthood, that security has become this thing that underlies a huge chunk of our lives. It\u2019s because of the success of the insertion of technology into every aspect of people\u2019s lives top to bottom that the same people might be doing the same things, but the importance of what we do around us has completely changed.    Yes, I was using the Morris Worm as a great example because that was a worm, as you pointed out, that was amazingly advanced for the time. It had multiple payloads, it could infect multiple different incompatible computer architectures, and it infected a big chunk of then-nascent Internet. It was a story among IT people in universities, but nobody died. There was no actual impact. Because of the way we have inserted technology into everybody\u2019s lives, that is not true anymore. From my perspective, the tech industry overall, we\u2019re really, really good at making technology useful for people to the point of where they start to rely upon it, but then we\u2019re not very good at making that technology trustworthy for them.    There\u2019re multiple levels to that. There\u2019s the traditional security issue, there\u2019s kind of the privacy issues which are about how you decide to gather up data and use it, and then there\u2019s also what you might call the \u201ctrust and safety issues\u201d, which is we build these technologies where bad things can happen, and we often do so first. We get them important first, and then we figure out how can people abuse them later. I think that\u2019s a fundamental problem in the structure of how we build technology in Silicon Valley, is that all of the thinking about the downsides happens way too late in the process, and it makes it very difficult to fix it up.    John Carlin :                  After working at Yahoo, and then had one of the biggest thefts ever, maybe the biggest theft ever of email-related information by Russian criminals linked to and taking taskings from the Russian state, you then move to Facebook and are there as you\u2019re confronting an unprecedented attempt to manipulate the way individuals are thinking using social media. Now you\u2019re at Stanford. Tell me a little bit about what you\u2019re doing at Stanford, and how you\u2019re working to tackle some of the problems that you\u2019ve observed and confront firsthand in your different industry jobs.    Alex Stamos :                I\u2019m trying to do a couple of things at Stanford. One is, our team is doing research in the misuse of the Internet, that I\u2019m trying to hit the sweet spot between it being done in a timely manner and being quantitative and qualitatively supportable enough to really inject a better level of accuracy into the discussion of these abuses. Specifically in the disinformation world, unfortunately since 2016 there has been a belief among people that- and by \u201cpeople\u201d I mean really just kind of mostly the US media- that any kind of disinformation activity is immediately impactful and can have all of these downstream impacts that are maybe immeasurable, and therefore that you should do almost anything to stop it.    That\u2019s not how we can handle any kind of abuse. We have to really understand how do these abuses work, what kind of impact does it have so that we can calibrate what our responses to it are. There\u2019s a lot of good academic groups doing this kind of work. The problem is the majority of them are publisher parish kind of models where they have to be in peer review journals and the like, so you\u2019re talking about maybe something coming out a year or two afterwards. We\u2019ve built this team to be able to do in the short-term what is more much journalistic work of here\u2019s us exploring and uncovering a Russian disinformation campaign in Africa and getting it taken down. So, we have impact immediately. That then can turn into a political science journal paper a year or two later by the PhDs who were on that team.    One of our goals is to try to just kind of inject a little more realism into the discussion of these abuses. The second is to expand the discussion of what should be considered the responsibility of tech companies beyond the traditional information security into all of these other areas. There\u2019s a parallel here, as I\u2019ve talked about, of where we were in the late \u201990s/early 2000s in security, which security was this super specialized field that was off in the corner, that was something you did last, that was not deeply integrated into the product\u2019s life cycle, and that didn\u2019t have an academic component and wasn\u2019t training undergrads.    That\u2019s where I feel like we are on the broader trust and safety issue. When I talk about trust and safety, we\u2019re talking about abuses of technology, which is generally the technically correct use of a technology to cause harm without any hacking or violation of the rules of the system. Hacking is usually about making a computer do something it doesn\u2019t want to do. Abuse is making the computer do exactly what it is built to do, but the outcome of that is somebody gets hurt.    One of the things we\u2019re trying to do is we\u2019re trying to make that part of undergraduate education, and we\u2019re doing that by I\u2019m teaching a class at Stanford called Trust and Safety Engineering, and my lectures are about all those other things that aren\u2019t really hacking. We have a lecture on hate speech, bullying and harassment. We talk about suicide and self-harm, and suicide clusters online, and people encouraging each other to commit suicide. We have two lectures on child sexual abuse, which I know you\u2019ve dealt with, but most people who haven\u2019t worked in trust and safety or law enforcement have never been exposed to the true horror of what actually happens online every day for children. We\u2019re talking about terrorism and the like.    We\u2019re putting that class together. We\u2019re going to make it free. We\u2019re writing the textbook. The book will also be free. There will be a paper copy, but you\u2019ll be able to get it free online. The goal is to kind of capture all of this stuff that we know about, how do the products we\u2019ve built, how they\u2019ve been abused in the past so that the next generation can make at least different mistakes than my generation.    John Carlin :                  This is so important. I know working on my book and going back to early criminal cases [inaudible], I was just shocked by how many mistakes were repeated because people were not learning a lesson. Some of the same tactics and techniques, going back to our earlier conversation, that were prevalent in the 80s are still successful here in 2020.    Alex Stamos :                Yeah, right. We had this problem in security. It\u2019s less of a problem in traditional information security now because you have enough people whose career is around security and they\u2019ve studied this stuff in the past. What you really need is companies that build these products need to have somebody on staff that has some kind of tribal knowledge of all of the things that have happened before, and then can look at what they are doing right now and then synthesize, \u201cOh, this is how it affects us.\u201d That\u2019s a real problem. One of the reasons I\u2019m doing it at Stanford is that there\u2019s probably no university in the world that has more responsibility than the current state of Silicon Valley than Stanford.    The university keeps on graduating out these 22 year olds, mostly men, who come out and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I have an idea. I\u2019m going to make an app where you can take photos and then anonymously send those photos to an infinite number of women. What could possibly go wrong?\u201d    John Carlin :                  What could go wrong? Yes, I think-    Alex Stamos :                Right? Well, here\u2019s the list.    John Carlin :                  Let me move to a real life case that you\u2019re working on. Here we are. We\u2019re in a pandemic. Everyone\u2019s working from home. Schools are suddenly teaching classes from home, meaning kids are using some services to have video chats in a way they never have before, along with employees. And you have Zoom, which the example, a company that was relatively small, and just explodes in terms of usage. I know they\u2019ve publicly brought you on as a consultant. I\u2019m wondering in terms of tribal knowledge, to use your phrase, it seems like Zoom is being exploited in many of the ways that one could predict. Although, the explosion in its users from 10 million to over 200 million in a period of couple of months, I think that was a little harder to predict, right?    Alex Stamos :                That\u2019s right. Yeah, there\u2019s really two totally different issues with Zoom. Like you said, they brought me on as a consultant, so full disclosure, I\u2019m a paid consultant for the CEO of Zoom. I got that job because I was tweeting about\u2026 This is the first time Twitter\u2019s been good for my career, but I was tweeting about the mistakes Zoom had made, and how I\u2019d seen this pattern at companies before, and how effectively Zoom now needed to speed run in six months what Microsoft and Facebook did over years and years, that they had this need to build up.    I ended up the next day getting a call from the CEO. He had called around some friends, found my cellphone number from a joint friend, and we had this long discussion about all the things they could do. I sent him this nice big email, and then he ends up announcing that they\u2019re going to do a bunch of the stuff that we had discussed. I thought, one, that was somewhat from my previous CISO jobs, it was somewhat unique to have a CEO who put security first. That was a unique experience for me, to see a CEO who\u2019s that. It became clear that they saw this as both an existential issue as well as a potential form of longterm committed advantage over their other companies.    If you want a company to care about security, safety, trust and privacy, then you want them to see it as a positive competitive advantage and a moat they can build. That\u2019s the way to get invested. Anyway, there\u2019s two classes of issues with Zoom. One is, the traditional security problems. Zoom had a bunch of bugs in their [inaudible] and such. The truth is, generally most of the bugs are the kinds of things you\u2019d find in mid-size enterprise companies all the time, from my consulting days. If we went into any successful but not household name enterprise company and looked at their software, that\u2019s the exact stuff we\u2019d find: local privilege escalation, some remote code execution, using old libraries and stuff like that.    John Carlin :                  Let me just walk through that little bit for the audience, who\u2019s mixed in background. You\u2019re saying this is what you should expect essentially from a lot of mid-sized companies, and the problems included things like the way that Zoom was installed, it took over admin privileges, which means the highest privilege that you could have on a user\u2019s computer so you could get root access. You could control the computer. That would allow someone who wanted to abuse it, to use your term, to put in bad programs without the user\u2019s knowledge, including the type of scheme we\u2019ve both seen a lot of, which is taking over webcams or microphones.    Then it also was found earlier that it was sending data to Facebook even if you weren\u2019t logged into a Facebook account, and routing some traffic through China unbeknownst to users. Then there were encryption issues where the default encryption, and this probably the more complicated one and we can talk about it, but the default is not to end in crypt, which means that messages in transit could be vulnerable. Finally, the one that I think got the most publicity, in part because it has a good name, was Zoom bombing, where people were finding open meetings to join and then they were flashing pornography or other things in front kids, et cetera. That got a lot of media attention.    I focused on those and wanted to walk through what some of the issues were, because I think you made an important and provocative point, which is yeah, this got exposed because Zoom grew so quickly, but this is actually business as usual, if I\u2019m hearing it right, for a lot of medium-sized companies.    Alex Stamos :                Right. That last part, Zoom bombing, is a totally different problem. That\u2019s kind of my point. On that core security issues, yes you said this is what we expect. Unfortunately, our expectations for software of enterprise security are way too poor. We should expect better. The truth is, there\u2019s a massive disparity between the top 10 tech companies that people can name, and the 10,000 X companies that build the software that all of our lives run on, perhaps unbeknownst to us.    Zoom used to be in that second category, in that the people before COVID who knew about Zoom were CIOs and enterprise video conferencing teams, and the folks who would go out and do a bake off between webex, and BlueJeans, and Microsoft Teams and Zoom, and then make a decision in a kind of enterprise bake off. It wasn\u2019t a product that people were using every day. Yes, those kinds of products often have these problems if you\u2019re not part of a Google, a Microsoft, or a company that has thousands of security engineers based upon\u2026 That generally comes for those big companies because they had an existential issue.    For Microsoft, that came in the early 2000s with the Trustworthy Competing Memo. With Google, it came after the Aurora. The Aurora tax we were talking about caused a huge amount of investment by Google and security, but the vast majority of companies don\u2019t. So, this doesn\u2019t mean Zoom shouldn\u2019t have done that. They should have invested more in security earlier, but solving those problems is a little more pedestrian because what you have to do there is you have to build up a good team, you have to improve your software development life cycle so that security is built into multiple parts of the security life cycle. You have to be able to hand outside bug reports more efficiently.    That\u2019s all the kind of stuff that I\u2019ve been working on with them. They have a new CISO, they have a new Head of Applications Security, they\u2019re building up their Application Security team, they\u2019ve fixed up their bug [inaudible] in a bunch of ways. There\u2019s still work to be done there, but that\u2019s kind of traditional info stack. The other issue they\u2019re facing is much closer to the one I was talking about, about the class, the trust and safety issue, which is that when Zoom went because of COVID from being mostly an enterprise product that was provisioned, and bought, and managed by IT professionals to something that Mrs. Smith for her fourth grade class would just go get a Zoom account and then all of a sudden move a bunch of children onto Zoom.    That is not what the product was built for. That is the safety issue, which is turns out that Zoom bombing or the meeting disruption problem, almost everything you needed to prevent that from happening existed in Zoom at the beginning of this year. It\u2019s just people didn\u2019t know it was there. Some of that stuff was buried in different IT settings. Some of it was available to consumers, but not in the normal interface.    John Carlin :                  We\u2019ve talked about that a lot, in a lot of different context for companies, but this goes to whether or not you should have security by default, essentially, right?    Alex Stamos :                Right, and the core problem that Zoom faced on this was they offer a freemium product. They offer a self-service you can put a credit card product, and then they offer an enterprise product. Almost all of their money is made on the enterprise product. It\u2019s made by selling a bank 100,000 seats. If you sell a bank 100,000 seats, that bank is going to use single sign on, they\u2019re going to have their IT team go and set all the little bits in the interface to make the default secure. They\u2019re going to do all the right things.    One thing Zoom did, was they did add all these free accounts to schools so they\u2019ve kind of created this problem for themselves. All of the sudden, they gave all these accounts to schools where you might have the one IT person who might be a volunteer parent or might be part-time one of the teachers, who just was totally slammed, did not know how to use the product, didn\u2019t know any of the stuff. By default, it did not walk them through \u201cThis is what you should be thinking.\u201d So the other issue for the schools especially, but a number of other institutions like churches and such, is they didn\u2019t have communication links set up to securely communicate out when this incredible transition started happening in March.    This happened at our kids\u2019 school, where they actually started just putting the links to Zoom meetings on the public website and the public calendar because there was no other good way to kind of get it in front of people. So, you have then all of these people who are home and bored, and malicious, who would go and do things like scan the Internet, scan through Twitter and Facebook, and look for anything that looks like a Zoom link and then go trade that in private groups in Discord, private groups on Facebook, WhatsApp channels and the like, and they would trade these links and back and forth, and they would disrupt them, jump in and hopefully do something like just be annoying, and in the worst cases do things like show illegal child exploitation content.    This is kind of the core issue for Zoom was that a lot of their product management was focused on the space for which they made money, which is what you generally see from enterprise products, was the-    Alex Stamos :                \u2026 made money, which is what you generally see from enterprise products, was the security features built for enterprises and becoming kind of a household consumer product overnight completely changed what their focus had to be. And so the work there, fortunately, because a lot of these features existed, was mostly about redesigning the interface and redesigning the user experience so that when you set up an account, by default, the settings are much more restrictive, and you have to turn them down and putting in the interface if something bad happens to make it much easier.    It used to be very hard to report that something bad happened. Now it\u2019s much easier to say, \u201cThis person did something bad. I want them kicked out. I want them reported to Zoom.\u201d And then they had to build up their trust and safety team with the people who investigate that stuff and then work with law enforcement.    John Carlin :                  To break it down a little bit, yeah, so number one, you have a product that kind of races to market, and a company\u2019s building out, and it has security flaws in it. I mean, there was a Princeton professor who characterized Zoom and said, \u201cLet\u2019s make this simple: Zoom is malware.\u201d And there he was referring, I think, to security flaws that would allow you to get access to things like the ability to use someone\u2019s webcam or microphone without their permission, so that\u2019s one bucket.    Alex Stamos :                So I know that professor. I think he massively overstated that. Things like local privilege escalation, so there was something like three or four New York Times articles that mentioned Zoom\u2019s installer having local privilege escalation on OS 10. Every time there\u2019s a dot release of Mac OS, there\u2019s a dozen local privilege escalation bugs. So yes, [crosstalk] bugs.    John Carlin :                  Well, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to push on a little bit is, taking it up a level, what do we do in terms of policy so that \u2026 Because this is one example that got well-publicized because the company exploded overnight, and so a lot of press attention, but to your point, there is thousands and thousands of other companies who have similar issues. What do we need to change the default so that security is there before it arrives and needs to be fixed on the consumer\u2019s computer?    Alex Stamos :                It\u2019s really tough. I think, I mean, the first is one of the problems we have in the computer security world is you hear about a handful of the failures like this that are public because people know about it. The vast majority of security failures are secret.    This week, a bunch of companies are going to get broken into. The information that gets stolen is not going to touch the PII definitions of SB1386 and the other state laws that require the disclosure of breaches that touch personal information.    John Carlin :                  You\u2019re saying the PII is personal identifiable information and that a lot of the laws are really triggered around whether someone gets things like your name plus your social security number, but that\u2019s not the issue here.    Alex Stamos :                That\u2019s right. And you and I have both worked a bunch of cases where companies have had important information taken, but it\u2019s not personal information, so therefore they don\u2019t have a disclosure requirement. And kind of culturally and legally, nobody is encouraged to admit \u2026 like Google did back in 2010 \u2026 nobody\u2019s encouraged to admit we had a breach, even if that breach was caught halfway or something. So I think the first thing we need to do is we need to build kind of a cultural and legal permission for people to be honest about these issues.    And the industry, I think, we should continue to look for \u2026 and I\u2019m not the first person to say this, but the industry that does incredibly, technically complex things, and does so safely, and has a culture of continuous improvement is the airline industry. And part of it is regulation; part of it is that they have a regulator that actually understands stuff.    So the National Transportation Safety Board has a level of technical knowledge of how airplanes work in way that there is not a single well institution maybe other than the NSA or Cyber Command in the US government that has the same level of technical knowledge on the InfoSec world. So they have a regulatory structure of people who are real experts, and then they have a culture of continuous improvement.    So obviously, if a plane crashes, there\u2019s a massive NTSB investigation. There\u2019s all this stuff that happens. But even on the close calls \u2026 if something breaks, if there\u2019s a human mistake \u2026 there is a culture of that being filed, that being looked at, that being discussed; and the legal structures to allow that to happen exist in their regulatory structures. I think we need to move to a world much closer to that on the security world side, whereas when these mistakes happen, there is a discussion of what went wrong.    And I\u2019ll use, actually, an example that you brought up. So when I was at Yahoo \u2026 Actually, the biggest breach of Yahoo stuff happened way before I got there, but there was a separate attack a couple of months after I got there that started a couple of months after I got there by a group of hackers working for the FSB, for Russian intelligence, that had broken and at first looked for a targeted set of people related to the near abroad Russian ex-Soviet state oil and gas industry.    But then once we found them, that turned into them trying to grab as many passwords as possible while we kick them out of the network, so this was a small group of pretty good hackers who were able to break in, but there\u2019s a lot of reasons why they were first able to break into Yahoo, and there\u2019s another set of complex reasons of why they were able to stay. It took us weeks and weeks to get rid of them. A lot of those reasons go back basically to the age of the company and a malinvestment insecurity over a decade.    But after this breach comes out, there is a set of lawsuits against Yahoo, as is normal, and I end up, as you can imagine, getting subpoenaed for a bunch of these. And so I ended up and going and having these very long discussions with tons of lawyers in the room, which, for people who haven\u2019t been deposed, I can\u2019t recommend it because you\u2019re sitting there, and the video is looking at you, and everybody\u2019s parsing every single word you said. And then there\u2019s 12 people in the room, and every other person in the room is getting paid to be there except you.    And so you\u2019re sitting there, and they\u2019re asking me all these super detailed questions. They got thousands and thousands of emails and documents, and they\u2019re putting these emails in front of me and these documents in front of me. And through this process of doing this with me and dozens of other people who are involved in these breaches, you can start to build out this idea of, \u201cOkay, what were the root causes that caused the ability for these people to be able to break into Yahoo and then the difficulty in kicking them out?\u201d    Okay, that\u2019s fantastic. That is really useful knowledge because these FSB hackers, a couple of them have been arrested, but the main guy\u2019s actually still at large being protected by Russia.    John Carlin :                  Well, yeah, protected by \u2026 Exactly.    Alex Stamos :                Right, right. Yeah, we can talk about our joint friend Alexei. So it would be super useful for everybody else to understand what happens at a Yahoo. What happened to all of those transcripts, all of those documents, everything? Well, they do a deal where the class action lawyers get $45 million in lawyer fees; a bunch of Yahoo users end up getting free credit monitoring, which makes absolutely no sense for a Yahoo breath, plus a gift card, I think; and then all of that stuff gets sealed up by the court.    So as a society, if you have a failure like that, to make that just then part of what is effectively a legal game just to move money around with some class action attorneys in Florida, and then all of the fact finding is then sealed up and made useless once the money is moved around, that is just the silliest way to try to address an incredibly complex issue. Imagine the 737 Max crashes, and that\u2019s how we handled it, and we have no idea of what actually failed on the 737.    There\u2019s no NTSB report, everything, because Boeing ended up paying off some lawyers in Florida. We would find that ridiculous, and airlines would be much less secure, and so I think that\u2019s one of the core kind of regulatory things we got to do is we\u2019ve got to make the discussion of what went wrong public, and we also have to create a model where people are encouraged to come out when they have a close call or when they have a breach that doesn\u2019t touch PII but maybe touched some kind of intellectual property.    We need to have both a carrot of certain protections, and you\u2019re a better position to have opinion on this, but maybe you have kind of statutory penalties for certain kinds of breaches and such, so it\u2019s not a four year class action lawsuit, but we need to have an encouragement of a carrot, and then you have to have a stick if people keep it secret. And then what I would love to see is there really should be a 400-page report of what happened at Yahoo because then everybody else can read that and be like, \u201cOh man, now I see the things I have to do to prevent it.\u201d    John Carlin :                  Yeah, and famously with Yahoo as well, and we see this, is, according to reporting, this gap between what you\u2019re finding or recommending as Chief Information Security Officer, and what the CEO, who\u2019s facing a lot of pressures about a business that\u2019s losing customers, did in terms of security. And I think you said earlier that in your career, you have not worked for a lot of CEOs for whom security was the top priority.    Alex Stamos :                Right, and there\u2019s also people who have talked about \u2026 and how exactly you calibrate this I think is a little complicated, but I think it\u2019s a good direction \u2026 effectively a [Sarb-Ox] for security where you make the board and you make the CEO liable in personal way for security that they aren\u2019t right now.    John Carlin :                  I know you\u2019re talking about the Sarbanes-Oxley law that essentially said that you have to personally sign as an officer of the company that you\u2019re meeting certain financial controls, essentially. And you\u2019re saying we need some type of law like that that makes CEOs and boards personally accountable for security.    Alex Stamos :                That\u2019s right. Yeah, I think so because what keeps on happening is the compensation structure for CEOs is built only around financial metrics. And so this is just a truism for any industry, but you get what you measure and to the detriment of everything you don\u2019t measure and you don\u2019t bonus. And so if you\u2019re only bonusing based upon the short term financial metrics and not upon the longer term risks, then management is going to go all one way.    And there are companies where security is integral. It\u2019s just it\u2019s extremely rare, honestly. The vast majority of companies, the existence of a CSO is in some ways negative because you\u2019ve created this executive through whom you kind of place all of this risk, but they don\u2019t have the ability to make the decisions that actually bend the risk, and so from my perspective, a CSO shouldn\u2019t be the person who\u2019s the risk manager.    The risk manager is really the CEO and the owners of the different product lines. In a big enough company, it\u2019s not the CEO; it\u2019s the people who own the business who make the real business decisions.    John Carlin :                  So former CSO says CSOs shouldn\u2019t get fired after security incidents.    Alex Stamos :                Well, I didn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m just saying we\u2019re in this weird place where you have this executive whose only job is to think about the downside, but they never have the ability to make kind of the big picture decisions of balancing kind of long term growth against risks.    John Carlin :                  That\u2019s a really important point, in all seriousness, and it\u2019s part of a big change we\u2019ve seen in our lifetimes, just over the last 10, 15 years. First, there really wasn\u2019t a Chief Information Security officer. And then the C in CSO was supposed to indicate that they were in the C-Suite, and in most companies, they\u2019re not really in the C-Suite.    And then even in the C-Suite, what you\u2019re saying is they need to be empowered. And that might require creating by law, if I\u2019m hearing you right, regulatory or other risk that forces a company when doing a rational calculus to prioritize security and give them the authority they need to reach the right risk decisions, not just for the company, but for society.    Alex Stamos :                Yeah. No, you put that much better than me. When a young person asked me, \u201cAlex, how do I become a CSO one day?\u201d my answer is, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The place you want to be is the senior director of security role where you can run a large team; you can have a huge impact; but you\u2019re not seen as having that responsibility, because being a CSO in 2020 is like imagine if you\u2019re a CFO, and Sarbanes-Oxley has passed, but you haven\u2019t invented double entry accounting yet.    And everybody\u2019s allowed to spend whatever money they want, and you can just advise. That\u2019s not how companies work. The CFO moves all the money in a public corporation. You are not allowed to spend 10 cents without some kind of infrastructure they have put in place approving that, but the CSO sits over in the corner and is almost all reactive, and it\u2019s very difficult to even know the decisions that are being made at any moment that are going to accrue a huge amount of security risk.    And that\u2019s the kind of thing that we have to adjust, because you\u2019re right. Every big company has this secret meeting \u2026 it\u2019s not secret, but has this small meeting, usually on Monday mornings at the beginning of the week, usually in the conference room of the CEO, and those are the people who actually run the company. They\u2019re not necessarily all the direct reports to the CEO, but it\u2019s the inner circle, the cabinet of people who are making that decision.    And it is extremely rare to hear about a CSO or really any executive who handles downside risk being in that meeting. And if you\u2019re not in that meeting, then in the end, you\u2019re just there for the clean-up. You\u2019re not able to actually bend the curve.    John Carlin :                  Let\u2019s move actually to Facebook. And I want to do the same divide we did a little bit when talking about Zoom, which is you have a series of issues, and we\u2019ve talked about them with Yahoo that really have to do with the security of a product; and then you have abuse of a product or it being used in ways that you didn\u2019t anticipate.    At Facebook, you had more authority on paper. You had the Chief Security Officer, and while you\u2019re there, you end up encountering, as we talked about a little bit, Russian interference in the 2016 election and seeing a type of meddling that I think we\u2019d seen on smaller scales but really never on a scale like this before, in part because there was never a platform that had this type of impact like Facebook did.    So tell me a little bit what your proposed approach would be to deal with Russian interference and how that differed from the approach of other executives. And also, just going to our conversation, were you in the right meetings or at the table so they had a chance to hear from you?    Alex Stamos :                Yeah, so the vast majority of my job at Facebook was the traditional information security job. And that was actually, in some ways, much easier than it was at Yahoo because Facebook had money. A lot of the core problems at Yahoo is the fact that Yahoo was effectively a dying company by the time I joined. But by the time Marissa took over as CEO, there\u2019s an argument made that nobody could have turned Yahoo around, but whether that\u2019s true or not, by that point, the investment in technology had really stalled out for about a decade.    And that wasn\u2019t true at Facebook. Facebook was at the height and continuing to grow, had all new technology, had built all this stuff internally. When I got to Yahoo, there was a server that hadn\u2019t been rebooted for 10 years, which a bunch of people were really proud of what that meant about the quality of the data center and the fact that it hadn\u2019t lost power in 10 years.    And to me, it was like, \u201cWell, that just means you\u2019re not enforcing any kind of patch policy if you\u2019re not patching for 10 years,\u201d and that was not true at Facebook. There\u2019s much more of a culture of kind of the core security, so that was most of my job, but where I got pulled into the Russia stuff was because one of the things that I inherited and then really grew is we had a threat intelligence team whose entire job it was to look for advanced attackers first attacking the company, so just looking for exactly the kind of attack that the Chinese did against Google, but then also abusing the platform to cause harm.    And coming out of 2016, one of my core beliefs is as a society, we have really messed up by not having the equivalent of a 9/11 commission look at what happened in 2016, because there\u2019s actually this fascinating kind of parallel-    John Carlin :                  Well, there\u2019s this Mueller report.    Alex Stamos :                Right. Yes, I\u2019ve heard of it. I\u2019m in a couple of the footnotes. I think I\u2019m not even in the footnotes. Yes, it\u2019s amazing the things that we do that we think are not going to be that important and then are going to be enshrined in history forever. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re in the same place.    John Carlin :                  Do we need another report, or do we need to mandate that people read the Mueller report, or do you think there\u2019s more information to be discovered?    Alex Stamos :                Well, I think it\u2019s too late now. I think, as you and I know, Robert Mueller\u2019s goal was to understand what happened to look for criminal behavior. The Mueller team did not do kind of a top to bottom analysis of, what are the root causes that allowed this to happen? And that was what the 9/11 commission did after September 11th.    John Carlin :                  And in fact, as a result \u2026 Actually, it wasn\u2019t that commission. It was a different commission, the WMD commission, but the division I led at the Justice Department, National Security Division, was created as one of those.    Alex Stamos :                Oh, really? [crosstalk 00:58:23].    John Carlin :                  Yeah, recommendations, so I take your point, that you need a top to bottom and think about how both government\u2019s structured and how the private sector is structured, and we still haven\u2019t done that.    Alex Stamos :                And we haven\u2019t. And there\u2019s this interesting parallel between 2016 and 9/11, which is the 9/11 report, a lot of it is about the failures of government to communicate internally. And there\u2019s a whole section on the lack of institutionalized imagination, that there weren\u2019t people who were thinking ahead of, what are all the bad things that can happen, and how should we preemptively think about the ways our adversaries might act?    And we have the exact same thing happened in 2016, except in 9/11, the responsibility there was almost completely in the public sector. Protecting our country from terrorists, keeping people from g</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

A chilling tale of how vulnerable we are to cyber threats. Today, technology is completely embedded in every aspect of our lives. Yet, the more apps and devices we use, the less we know about their workings. The biggest risk is ceding control of our lives to Big Tech - the likes of Google, Apple, Amazon. We are sifting through so many versions of truth about these platforms that it is hard to tell the real from the imagined.</p><p>A recent report from a cyber security company reveals that criminals can sell our personal data amounting to our entire digital life for as little as $50. The only way individuals can deal with this organised crime is by increasing their security awareness. The US Congressional hearings with Big Tech leaders such as Sundar Pichai, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg, revealed the depth of ignorance among senators about technologies that have already matured.</p><p>Policy makers and legislators should first learn about technologies before they can start to effectively regulate it in a nuanced manner. Is there any wonder that the UAE has appointed a Minister for Artificial Intelligence? Some countries are training their entire population to gain a competitive edge. Finland has a nationwide programme to educate citizens on Artificial Intelligence through online courses designed for the non-IT populace. The Scandinavian government is preparing the country to compete with China and US for building practical applications of AI. These competencies will allow its citizens to also weigh in on AI policy making.</p><p>From prehistoric times, we have used our versatile abilities to survive and thrive through ecological disruptions. Paleoanthropologists believe that our forefathers survived where their distant cousins the Neanderthals did not, largely because the Homo Sapiens were generalist specialists, who could adapt to and specialise in living in extremely different habitats. Specialist species became extinct as their unique habitats were destroyed.</p><p>Fast forward to the 21st century; almost all professional fields require us to be specialists. Doctors even need to be super specialists to adapt to an ever changing medical landscape. While presenting my views at an event for doctors and surgeons, I wondered why an august gathering of medical specialists had so much interest in information technology. Evidently, they recognised the need to understand and adapt to a digital world. The Renaissance Age was replete with successful polymaths who had expertise in wildly different fields such as art, science, literature, architecture and philosophy.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

The E.U. will grant an extension, but only if they can approve it.  The Fed leaves rates alone.  Further rate hikes seems unlikely this year, and that's why you saw the market go up so sharply at two o'clock.  And Google investors seemingly unnerved by a third anti-trust fine of nearly $2 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Live from London on Wednesday, March the 20th, I'm Richard Quest.  I mean business.</p><p>Good evening, tonight, Brexit developments are coming thick and fast here in London.  Theresa May has asked the E.U. to delay Brexit until June the 30th.  The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk says that might work if the British Parliament signs off on the exit agreement, it's the only one on the table.</p><p>Now here's the crucial piece.  Without an agreement, the U.K. is still going to crash out in nine days' time.  Both sides are grappling with the constraints and intense political pressures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  As Prime Minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the 30th of June.</p><p>DONALD TUSK, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COUNCIL:  In the light of the consultations that I have conducted over the past days, I believe that short extension will be possible, but it will be conditional on the positive votes on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  There was also a three-hour debate in Westminster.  The reality is tonight, the situation is much more tense, bordering on confused and chaotic.  Bianca is outside Houses of Parliament.  So there is the prospect of an extension, a short extension only if Parliament votes for the deal, which they've rejected twice.  What happens now?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  The Prime Minister tries to bring that deal again for a third time with a couple of changes that she's agreed with the E.U. that's mainly around issues that her and Juncker discussed in Strasbourg, which Donald Tusk said today he will be happy to try and come to an agreement with, with the Prime Minister.</p><p>So she will try and bring that deal back for a third time to the House of Commons.  But it failed historically by 230 votes the first time, then by 149 votes and yes, we've heard positive sounds from the DUP, from some Brexiteers who promised never to back that deal saying now, is the time that they're going to support the Prime Minister, but will that be enough?  She's definitely going to need to get Labour MPs on side as well.  Yes --</p><p>QUEST:  Before we get too ahead of ourselves, asking whether who will support it or not?  How is she going to get the deal before the House bearing in mind what Speaker Bercow has ruled that it has to be substantially different.</p><p>NOBILO:  She addressed that very point today when she wrote formally to President Tusk to ask for the extension.  I think the third or fourth paragraph explain that very point saying that she wasn't able to bring the withdrawal agreement and her deal back to the House of Commons without those changes.</p><p>So she asked the E.U. again, if they would be able to provide some supplementary documents in order to qualify to meet John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons' criteria for her to bring it back.  So that's what we're expecting to hear.  But lawmakers I've spoken to are expecting the Prime Minister to give a statement outside Downing Street or inside Downing Street some point later this evening, but we'd expect her to flesh that out and plot the path towards meaningful vote three.</p><p>QUEST:  MV3 is likely to be when?  Next Tuesday or Wednesday?  That way she can go to -- I mean, when would it be?</p><p>NOBILO:  Well, it's meant to be this Tuesday.  I don't think anybody can really guess at this point.  We might get an answer this evening from the Prime Minister, but as you mentioned, we are only nine days off from the date that is enshrined ...</p><p>[15:05:09]</p><p>NOBILO:   ...in British law that Britain is leaving the E.U. so it needs to be soon.  And if the E.U. is only granting that extension to the 30th of June contingent upon Theresa May's deal passing then it has to be some time in the next week.  But I'd expect that we get more details about that later today.</p><p>QUEST:  Bianca, don't go too far away.  We're going to need you when the Prime Minister speaks in just over an hour's time.</p><p>On \"The Express,\" earlier I put into the Conservative MP, Andrew Percy it doesn't matter when the extension ends.  The U.K. Parliament still has to have the withdrawal agreement and the E.U. says there's nothing new on the table.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW PERCY, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, CONSERVATIVE PARTY:  The problem we have in Parliament is we have two different groups of people voting against the withdrawal agreement who both think they're going to get different destinations.  One group thinks they're going to stop Brexit, the other group thinking they're going to get a no-deal Brexit.  Well, they can't both be right.</p><p>But you know, the end of the day, you're absolutely right.  If we don't pass the withdrawal agreement, then we're not going to get this extension and you know, the whole thing is back to where we were at the start of this week of not knowing where we end up.</p><p>QUEST:  Are you hearing from your from your more extreme Brexiteers that they are starting to waver or whether to just hold their nose and vote for the Prime Minister's deal?</p><p>PERCY:  I think some of them have.  I think, look, the fact that the House of Commons voted last week to prevent a no-deal exit means that some of them are clearly fearful that they may not get Brexit altogether.  There are, I'm afraid a hard core amongst them who will be irreconcilable to the Prime Minister's deal on any terms, but similarly there are MPs on the opposition benches who are were remainders in the referendum campaign, who represent very hot heavy leave voting constituencies who do want to bring this to a conclusion as well.</p><p>So I think if they understand that we're now reaching that point where it is going to be this or we potentially could end up with a no-deal, then some of those could come on side.  The problem with this whole debate is as soon as you get somebody at one end of the debate, you lose somebody at the other.  So -- but I do think people's opinions are changing somewhat whether it's enough remains to be seen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Joining me now, John Rentoul, the chief political commentator at \"The Independent\" newspaper.  He is also at Westminster.  Well, I think we could all agree whatever one's political colors that it is an extraordinary mess.  Which way, John, do you see out of it?</p><p>JOHN RENTOUL, CHIEF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, THE INDEPENDENT:  If I knew that I wouldn't -- I wouldn't be here.  I'd be down the bookies.  It's very difficult.  I mean, it's extraordinary to have the nation poised this close to a deadline without people knowing which way it's going to go.</p><p>You know, the Prime Minister seem to say something extraordinary today which is that if she doesn't get her deal through by the 30th of June, she's going to let somebody else sorted out she said, you know, as Prime Minister she would not accept a delay to Brexit longer than the 30th of June.  I don't know who that was designed to frighten though, maybe it was designed to put pressure on Labour MPs who would be horrified by the prospect of Boris Johnson succeeding her as Prime Minister.</p><p>QUEST:  So let's go through this in quick fire.  Brexiteers want Brexit.  They now realize that could be slipping away from them if the U.K. doesn't go for -- if the U.K. goes for a longer extension, so why would they not vote for the Prime Minister?</p><p>RENTOUL:  Well because there's a hard core of conservative MPs, a larger number than I thought there were of Brexiteers against Brexit.  They think the Prime Minister's deal is so bad that it's better to stay in the E.U. and fight for what they call a clean Brexit, a true Brexit in the longer run.  I mean, it's quite an extraordinary puritanical position.  I mean, they would rather be in the E.U. in pure and opposed to it than accept the compromise of the Prime Minister's deal.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  Now that small number could be enough to scupper her next week.  Because if the DUP jump on board and all the other ERG jump on board, then you're really left with, I mean, she has to take everybody and if there are some ideological stronger holdouts, then she's done for.</p><p>RENTOUL:  Well, for every ideological stronghold out, she needs a Labour MP to come across from the opposition to support her.  Now, there are about 30 or 40 Labour MPs who have said that they think Brexit ought to happen, but so far, they haven't done very much about it.</p><p>I mean, there's only been five of them have come over and supported the Prime Minister's deal on previous votes.</p><p>[15:10:01]</p><p>QUEST:  John, do you think there may be a view in the country that somehow we think it's all going to be sorted out somehow at the last minute.  You know so that the people don't actually really believe hand at heart that you'd fall over the cliff because everybody thinks, \"Well, don't worry at the last minute, they'll sort it out.\"</p><p>RENTOUL:  I'm not sure about that.  I come across quite a lot of people who are very frightened about the prospect of, you know, disruptive chaotic no-deal Brexit.  I mean, you know there's talk of people stockpiling food and people are very worried about it.  I mean, a lot of people think that their jobs and their futures maybe at stake, and that's what I think is a bit irresponsible about the way the Parliament is handling it, but you know, I don't particularly blame the Prime Minister because she has to manage an impossible situation.  She's got a Parliament split three ways which represents the British people who are split three ways.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  As this progresses, we look forward to talking to you more about understanding what's happening.</p><p>Tack on a few more billion dollars to Google's bill with the E.U. Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager tells us, she is forcing Google to change its ways and there's some shocking allegations of what's recorded on the black box from last year's Lion Air crash.  The plane should probably never been in the air bearing in mind what happened the previous day.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  The anti-trust hounds in Europe have come once again for Google, and this time the European Commission has ordered Google to pay nearly $2 billion -- $1.7 billion for abusing its dominant position in online advertising.  This is the third time European authorities have levied against Google in as many year.</p><p>Last year, the Commission charged Google for undercutting mobile phone market.  In 2017, it said it hadn't fairly favored its own shopping service.  Google is waiting on an appeal in these cases.  But what's the bill for all of this?  It all stands at $9.3 billion dollars.  So consider this.  The revenue was $137 billion last year.  So it really is somewhat of a drop in the bucket.  The fines amount to just 3% of revenue over the last three years.</p><p>The European Commissioner for Competition is Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>[15:15:10]</p><p>QUEST:  She spoke to Eric McLaughlin and the Commissioner said regardless of the fine, her office is succeeding in forcing Google to change its behavior.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION:  Google only stops when we sent the statement of objection to say, well, we find that these clauses in your contracts, they're illegal.</p><p>So I think it shows that it has an effect.  But of course, you're right to say that one of our obligations is to speed up because we're dealing with fast moving markets.</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Is there an E.U. bias against big tech firms?  I know this was asked in the press conference, but is there that bias there that's been perceived by the media as well as others?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, I think some of the European companies will also get big fines, they would wish for a bias.  But there are no bias.  If you see that fines to the European truck companies, if you see the fines to the cartels that catalyze car parts, you would seems that our aim is pretty simple.  You're more than welcome to do business in Europe.  But you have to follow our rules and not to engage in any illegal behavior.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Is there a problem though, with us tech firms in general, given the lack of regulation in the United States?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, I wouldn't say that as a general measure.  I think that when you're in an Industrial Revolution, as we are right now, well, it takes some time for society and democracy to gain speeds to say, well, this is the direction that we want to take.  This is how we will regulate this market as we have done, you know for a hundred years when first, we regulated the working hours, healthy work places, the children couldn't work pesticides -- so all of that.  It is the societal task in our democracy is to say, \"Well, this is the direction we want you to go,\" also, when we're in a technological revolution.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Do you think the U.S. is doing enough?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, as you can see, I'm quite busy in my day job here in Europe.  So I make no judgment about my U.S. colleagues.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  And do you support moves to break up big tech companies?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, for us here, that would be a measure of very, very last resort, because it is obviously quite the thing to do to say to a private company, you have to divest part of your company, you have to make separate companies.</p><p>So what we doing here is to say, well, with the tools that we have, and actually we are also looking at new tools, we think that we can have competitive markets also in the digital and this is our endeavor, because it is quite far reaching to begin breaking up companies.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Yes, but are these companies too big?  The companies like Amazon, AppleGoogle, they are just these massive companies that are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>VESTAGER:  I don't think that that the size in itself that's the problem.  First, of course, is the problem when we have illegal behavior, but second, and this we think quite a lot about is access to data because they are giants, but they're also giants when it comes to holding data and you need data to innovate.  You need data to feed your algorithm, to feed your artificial intelligence.</p><p>So what we are concerned about is more, how do you get access to all that data that is being created right now, because if you cannot get access, well, the number of competitors may dry out and the number of innovators may dry out as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Jim Cridlin is here.  He is Global Head of Innovation at Mindshare, a global media agency.  This is sort of a technical stuff, but what I've often found with the Commission is that they are actually our watchdog and guardians.  They are the ones pointing out the problems where most of us don't even see them.</p><p>JIM CRIDLIN, GLOBAL HEAD OF INNOVATION, MINDSHARE:  Right.  Exactly.  And I think one of the things that E.U. regulators have gotten angry in the past has been that they thought that people have said, they've been too hard on many of the tech companies.  But I think what you're seeing is actually the E.U. regulators are probably ahead of the curve, right?</p><p>If you look right now, across the world, whether that's in the U.S. where congressional representatives or senators, U.S. presidential candidates are thinking about increased regulation, or even things like GDPR, other places are catching on.</p><p>QUEST:  I guess the problem is, in the U.S., there is a much closer link between the regulators and the politicians who question them and then therefore, here, the link to Margrethe Vestager and then the Commission is somewhat tangential it and it often seems supra national.</p><p>CRIDLIN:  Yes, it is a little bit.  You know, when you look at it in the U.S., many of these tech players, I mean, for example, Facebook has spent billions of dollars building hospitals and schools and places like that inside the U.S. that clearly buys you a lot of goodwill that politicians would look fondly upon.</p><p>[15:20:01]</p><p>QUEST:  But also, those CEOs, get kebab'd in front of Congress.  Now I know that there are hearings in front of the Commission, but they all seem a bit remote and a bit irrelevant.</p><p>CRIDLIN:  Yes.  Well, you know, I think when you look at this fine and particularly from the E.U., right, 1.5 billion euros is a big number.  Now, if you are Google, like any fine is going to be -- it would seem like a lot of money.  In the scheme of things, it's not my judgement, whether it's big or small.</p><p>I think will be interesting now are the knock on effects we see.  Number one, it opens up the possibility for additional lawsuits from those that were affected.  But I think what we're seeing at Mindshare across our clients are they are increasingly asking us questions like, \"Are we over invested in just a handful of digital players?\"  And every time there's a data breach, every time a brand finds its content running in, on or alongside content that it doesn't want to be or there's a fine from a regulator, those concerns about are we over invested in too few players get amplified.</p><p>QUEST:  Finally, briefly, do these fines even matter to Google?</p><p>CRIDLIN:  I think they do.  You know, every time there's an incident like this, we see a familiar pattern where advertisers might pull dollars from investing until Google fixes the issue and let me tell you, every time that happens, a player like Google acts quickly to correct the problem and this kind of thing adds on and on over time.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see, sir.</p><p>CRIDLIN:  Likewise.</p><p>QUEST:  I very much appreciate it.  Thank you.  Ten days after the horrific crash of a Boeing jet in Ethiopia, we're learning stunning new revelations about the Lion Air flight that crashed off Indonesia last year, killing all 189 on board -- people on board.</p><p>Both tragedies involved the Boeing 737 MAX 8 model of the plane.  CNN's Melissa Bell reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This was all that was left of Lion Air Flight 610, which crashed into the Java Sea last October, debris picked through by the families of some of the 189 people who died on board.</p><p>At fault, according to a preliminary report, an automated safety system on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 triggered by a faulty reading from a single sensor.  Reuters reporting that a chilling recording of the cockpit in the last few minutes before the crash shows pilots desperately looking through a handbook to try and figure out how to disable the system that was reportedly forcing the nose of the plane downwards.</p><p>That same plane, according to fresh reporting from Bloomberg, also encountering the very same problem the day before on a flight from Bali to Jakarta, but saved by an extra pilot who happened to be hitching a lift in the cockpit.  News made all the more important by the crash on March 10th of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 that killed 156 people, a flight of the same type of Boeing and, according to preliminary data from the black boxes, one that followed a similar trajectory to the doomed Lion Air flight.</p><p>Those black boxes now being looked into here at the BEA on the outskirts of Paris.  Its former head spoke to CNN about the questions now facing Boeing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEAN-PAUL TROADEC, FORMER PRESIDENT, FRENCH AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY:  The measures taken by Boeing after the first accident were not enough to avoid the second accident.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL (on camera):  `But the questions are not only for Boeing, with the Transportation Department now probing why the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration authorized, certified a system that was based on the readings of a single sensor, with many questions now being asked about how much of that certification process was handed directly to Boeing.  Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  We need to understand exactly what we're talking about.  So have a look at this.  The area of the plane that is relevant is this.  This is the little two tails at the back of a plane.  It's a horizontal stabilizer.  The whole of it.  And moves in a very small area, just a matter of degrees up or down.  And depending on which way it moves, it trims the plane, nose up all those down and the pilots use that as a matter of for the center of gravity and for easier control of the aircraft.</p><p>However, with the MAX, the way the engines are further forward and higher then, well that's where the problem happens because what invariably happens with all of this is the way the -- when the plane sensed something was going wrong that part of the back of the aircraft pushed the nose down and the pilots were unable to do it because what had happened of course, is this part was dominant.  This part was pushing down the nose of the aircraft.</p><p>Pilots are familiar with this concept.  Les Abend for example is a former pilot.  He joins me now from Jacksonville, Florida.  Les, the concept of a runaway stabilizer as it is known, is known to you and other pilots.  Why then in this case, wouldn't they have naturally realized --</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>QUEST:  -- hang on, the nose is being pushed down, we're not doing it.  That's what's the problem?</p><p>LES ABEND, RETIRED 777 PILOT:  Well, you ask a very good question.  And because they didn't get that visceral clue of that trim wheel which, Richard, you're very familiar with, of that of that trim wheel going around.  So they thought it was another situation that they had to analyze.</p><p>So it was very counterintuitive to them that the airplane was wanting to head for the ground and in essence, what was happening the system that you described, it was essentially the telling pilots that it was going to stall and every time they attempted to trim the airplane up, it would reset itself and continue the nose down situation.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, we know from the Lion Air, the previous day of the Lion Air flight, it was a jump seat rider pilot that recognized it, otherwise that plane would have gone down as well.  And why would -- I guess I'm trying to understand, we've now got three sets of pilots flying who did not recognize, and the only one who did is this jump seat pilot.  What do you make of that?</p><p>ABEND:  Well, let's go back to the fact that Boeing didn't even put that in the manuals for these operators that had the system, basically the 737 with this MCAS system that we've all been talking about.  So it starts there.</p><p>These three flights, first of all, the first one that returned safely, that was up at altitude, so that did help the situation, you've got a pilot sitting in the jump seat, something you're very familiar with that has a much broader view of what's happening.  They didn't have a myopic focus and once that plane got on the ground with that problem that was written up as a discrepancy, the mechanics went together and electronically pulled what the faults were for the system and fixed it according to Boeing troubleshooting process.</p><p>So that airplane was going to be released until that problem was fixed.  But apparently it was fixed, at least what we know about at this point in time.  There's no verification of that, of course.  And now you've got the crew --</p><p>QUEST:  If we pull the strands, though, together of what happened here.  I mean, how does two brand new planes fall out the sky with other incidents, and Boeing still tells us they committed to safety.</p><p>ABEND:  You know what, I wish I had a real good answer for you.  I'm very disappointed in Boeing, I've got to admit.  This is not their M.O.  They are very forthright with their systems and this was modified in a sense, as you described earlier in the introduction because of the bigger engines and the way the airplane reacts with these bigger engines.</p><p>So why Boeing did this?  I don't know but the FAA approved it through the certification process.</p><p>QUEST:  Les Abend, thank you for joining us.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p>ABEND:  My pleasure.</p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight, what Donald Tusk's speech tells us about where Brexit goes from here.  We need to see it from the other side now.  The E.U. view.  Erin McLaughlin is Brussels and will be with us after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00]  RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment.  But a thousand days ago, the people of Britain voted to take back control, now the EU seems to be holding all the cards, Brussels side in just a moment.</p><p>And on the Fed's decision day, how much will a slowdown affect America's growing economy? As you and I continue tonight, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.  Helicopter rescues are taking place across Mozambique in the wake of a cyclone Idai.</p><p>It is believed that hundreds of people have died, and some communities completely under water from flooding.  Eight agencies are trying to get food, medicine, and water to more than half a million people.</p><p>New Zealand has begun burying the victims of last week's shooting attack on two mosques.  A father and son immigrants from Syria were the first to be laid to rest.  The police say they believe the gunman was on his way to attack a third mosque when the police rammed his car and brought the attacks to an end.</p><p>President Trump is visiting the state of Ohio today with two possible contenders for the Secretary of Defense.  Sources tell CNN he's inclined to nominate the acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan for the  job.  However, another contender, the Army Secretary Mark Esper also joined the president on Air Force One.</p><p>America's top diplomat is in Israel touting the Trump administration's strong ties  with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Soon after Mike Pompeo landed in Tel Aviv, the White House announced President Trump himself would host Mr. Netanyahu in Washington next week, just days ahead of Israel's elections.</p><p>A dramatic story near Milan in Italy.  Authorities say a school bus driver set his bus on fire with more than 50 children inside.  Police broke down the windows  and got all the children out unharmed.  Local drivers say the driver who is from Senegal was protesting against migrant drowning.</p><p>Breaking developments are moving quickly here in London.  We've learned that Theresa May is to make a statement in about half -- 45 minutes from now.  But as she does so, this is where we stand at the moment.  It's been a thousand days since the Brexit vote.  Nine days are left unless the U.K. and the EU agree an extension.</p><p>The president of the European Council Donald Tusk says that an extension is possible if parliament signs off on the exit agreement with the EU that was  negotiated by Theresa May.</p><p>British lawmakers have rejected it twice.  Keir Starmer is the Labor Party's Brexit spokesman, he says he's afraid the Prime Minister will use any extension to keep pushing her deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEIR STARMER, BRITISH LABOR MP:  This is what I am most concerned about, that the Prime Minister still thinks that the failed strategy of the last two years, namely my deal or no deal, a blink and approach no changes, no room for parliament, should just be pursued for another three month.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes --</p><p>STARMER:  But in other words, all she's going to do is use the three months in  exactly the same way to bring back the deal over and over again, or as many times as she can without breaching the rules of the house and to try to force it through.</p><p>[15:35:00]  That -- I'll just finish this point, if I may.  That is the strategy she's been pursuing throughout these negotiations, and it has failed badly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  So that is the situation Theresa May and indeed the United Kingdom finds themselves in.  Donald Tusk says the PM must ram through a deal that British lawmakers have rejected twice.  Erin McLaughlin is in Brussels.  Erin, we were talking earlier, is Donald Tusk -- is he helping or hindering the Prime Minister by requiring that vote before an extension?</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think that very much depends on who you ask, Richard.  But what was clear that played out  today here in Brussels is he took the ball that Theresa May put into his court earlier this morning with that letter that she wrote requesting an extension until June 30th.</p><p>Took the ball and slammed it back into the court of the United Kingdom, telling Theresa May, you can have a short extension that you want, but you need to get this deal across the line, and you need to do it next week.  Now, the question being, if she fails at that, as looks likely at this point, what next?</p><p>And we're completely in the dark once again, Richard, in terms of what happens next.  Keep in mind that March 29th exit date is enshrined in British law.  It will require an act of parliament that's currently not tabled --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  To reverse it.  So this could be --</p><p>QUEST:  All right --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Seen as playing into the hands of hard Brexiteers.</p><p>QUEST:  All right.  But if she doesn't get it through and the option of a short extension goes, what about the possibility of the long extension? A year, two years for Britain to decide what it wants.  Would Brussels rather that or a no-deal Brexit?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Here's the thing about the long extension, Richard.  Theresa May has to request it.  And that's what they thought she was going to be doing this morning.  That is what the EU had expected, according to a diplomat I was talking to.  That's what David Lidington from her cabinet had imparted to diplomats here in Brussels to expect this morning.  That did not happen.</p><p>Does she have the political clout, the political backing to be able to request --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  A long extension? That is not evident at this point.</p><p>QUEST:  So I am coming to Brussels tomorrow for the council meeting, looking forward to working with you and being with you then.  How annoyed are -- is this  council? How difficult, how fractious is this council going to get?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I think the EU leaders, EU officials here are frustrated time and time again, speaking to diplomats, they tell me they're sick of Brexit.  But the other critical thing I think we heard from Donald Tusk today was the tone.  He's trying to take down the temperature, saying look, the EU wants a solution, they want a way out of this.  They want a constructive approach.  They do not want to be blamed for this mess, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Erin, see you tomorrow.  We'll be with you tomorrow, thank you.  As you and I continue tonight, after the break, the Federal Reserve decision today, it looks like Jerome Powell is sticking to his patient plans.  The rates and the growth  forecast, we'll talk about it after the break.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  OK, you really do need to look at the Dow chart to understand what an unusual day.  We're down very heavily throughout the course of the session, triple-digit losses.  And then, just after the Fed statement and the Fed decision,  the market goes up and it remains up, and then at roughly half an hour ago, for some reason, the market has dropped and we're now down 127.</p><p>When you and I started talking just about 41 minutes ago, the market was actually up, and it looked like it was going to end positive.  But now it seems to be somewhat different.  So after spending much of the session in the red, the stocks  that have been moving today, shares of FedEx have tumbled 3 percent as the firm is warning of a global slowdown after it reported some pretty dismal earnings after the close last night.</p><p>And it comes as the U.S. Fed voted to keep interest rates on hold to maintain its more dovish outlook.  Now, if we look within this, United Health Group is quite a large component of the Dow, so is Goldman Sachs.  Now, they are down heavily, 3.5 percent and 2.5 percent.</p><p>Those are at the positive end are not quite so big, except, of course, for Boeing.  Now, the benchmark rate for the U.S. Fed stays in the range of 2 to 2.25 percent.  Chairman Jay Powell also said the Fed is lowering its growth forecast and indicated no more rate increases are likely to come this year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE, UNITED STATES:  We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a  solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018.  We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate.</p><p>Since last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the world that bear close attention.  Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my colleagues and I will be patient in assessing what if any changes in the stance of policy may be needed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Lindsey Piegza is the chief economist at Stifel, joins me from Las Vegas, good to see you.  So, what's happened today? Why -- I mean, we see the market roar up, very quickly after 2:00, and then go back down again.</p><p>LINDSEY PIEGZA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STIFEL:  Well, there's a couple of things going on.  As expected, the Fed opted to leave rates unchanged.  And we also saw from the famed dot plot, that the Fed doesn't intend to raise rates any additional times in 2019.</p><p>We also heard from the Fed chairman that the U.S. economy is on relatively sound footing.  So initially, this seemed like the perfect combination for the  market.  The Fed not taking any further action, the economy is steady.  And what we do know is that historically, Feds have been willing to continue to tighten  until the weakness in the data is very clear, thus forcing us into rescission.</p><p>This time, it seemed like the Powell Fed was backing off preemptively, giving the economy still room to run.  However, later on, the market started to dig through some of the details of the report from the Fed as well as additional comments from the Fed chairman during the press conference.</p><p>And what we saw was an additional downside risk.  So growing concern within the Fed about the sustainability of the recovery going forward.  Talking about a reduction of global growth, which of course --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>PIEGZA:  Then could translate into deflationary pressures here in the U.S.</p><p>QUEST:  But the Fed has made it clear, I mean, they're using the word patience.  This is the -- this is the new rubric to tell us they're not going to do anything.  They made it clear they're not going to raise rates further this year.  And probably well into next year because -- but from your perspective, just how weak is the U.S. economy?</p><p>[15:45:00]  PIEGZA:  Well, I think right now, the economy is still on steady  footing.  The problem is, going forward, a number of underlying indicators  suggest waning momentum, and the Fed outlined several of them.  We're starting to see business investment lose ground.  We're starting to see a slower pace of spending.</p><p>Remember, we're a consumer-based economy, if the consumer isn't out there  happy and healthy, we can't expect to maintain even this 2-ish percent growth pace going forward.  We also see housing showing signs of weakness.</p><p>So there's a number of different components that are pointing to downward momentum or this downward bias that the Fed pointed to, suggesting that yes, we may see positive growth in 2019, but significantly slower than last year, and the big  question mark is when we turn the page into 2020, are we still able to maintain positive growth or is this where the recession risk starts to rapidly rise?</p><p>QUEST:  Do you believe that a recession is likely?</p><p>PIEGZA:  I do.  I think when we turn the calendar into 2020, the risk of  recession rises above 50 percent.  We do expect momentum to slow noticeably throughout the remaining nine months of the year with growth coming in closer to around 1.5 percent --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>PIEGZA:  In the next year.  So noticeably weaker than what the Fed is projecting around 2.1 percent.</p><p>QUEST:  So what is driving this slowdown? I mean, we keep sort of hearing -- oh, global slowdown, developing countries, emerging markets, European -- obviously, we know the eurozone is in --</p><p>PIEGZA:  Yes --</p><p>QUEST:  Some trouble.  But what's driving it? Why suddenly after several years  for the U.S. of good growth, is there -- is there this concern?</p><p>PIEGZA:  Well, remember, we were already starting to see this downward bias in 2018, even though the annual growth pace for the U.S. was 3 percent, we saw the last nine months losing momentum.  So second quarter at 4 percent, third  quarter at 3 percent, the fourth quarter 2.5 percent.</p><p>So there was this downward trend in activity to begin with as we turn the corner  into 2019.  But to your point, I think one of the biggest concerns from our standpoint is the consumer.  The consumer had very much been reliant on temporary factors for the past several years, including drawing down savings, ramping up credit to above pre-crisis levels --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>PIEGZA:  As well as eating into that lingering wealth effect from earlier years of lower cost energy.  We hadn't seen meaningful gains in wages.  Now, yes, we are starting to see more recently an uptick in earnings, but they're likely to prove very short-lived and are still very isolated throughout pockets of the labor market as opposed to being broad-based across all sectors.</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>PIEGZA:  So if you're looking for a catalyst, I think the consumer is a good place to start.</p><p>QUEST:  Look forward to talking to you again, and when you're in New York, we'll be having you and talking to face-to-face.  Good to see you, thank you Lindsey, thank you.</p><p>PIEGZA:  Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>QUEST:  As we -- as we continue tonight, a bad day for German companies.  Their stock was sharpener after a herbicide scandal.  BMW is issuing a profits  warning, and Deutsche Bank drops, no wonder the Dax was down 1.5 percent.</p><p>[15:50:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  European markets slumped, as fears over Brexit continue to grow.  Just look at that, the Dax was hit particularly hard, tipping 1.6 percent.  There was more bad news out of Germany on Wednesday, it was a veritable potpourri of bad  news.</p><p>Shares of Bayer; the owners of Monsanto plunged over 9 percent after it found that its weed killer contributed to a man's cancer.  And the shares of BMW closed down nearly 5 percent after the car maker issued a profits warning for this year.  We need to understand why they issued a profit warnings and what's happening with the German economy.  Good to have John Defterios with us.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Thank you very much, it's amazing because I was looking back, the Dax has been the worst performing European market over the last 14 months, down better than the 7 percent.  So this is a couple of knocks across the chin here, coming from some blue chips, Richard with Bayer and BMW, no doubt about it.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, Germany is going to have a new leader.  Angela Merkel is going to step down sooner rather than later as she's made that clear.  But there is a feeling the economy is not performing well.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  No, the last time we had a conversation about Europe, it  was about the European Central Bank downgrade to 1.1 percent --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Then the council of experts in Germany came out with a figure  24 hours ago, that is 0.8 percent --</p><p>QUEST:  Why?</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, there's a couple factors here.  I think we have to recognize  it's something you've been covering the front half of the program.  That Brexit is starting to undermine overall European growth, but the other hidden factor and  something I look at more carefully because I being emerging markets editor, is that the exports to China from Germany are slowing down.</p><p>And this is something they relied upon --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  And it's kind of a sleeper, but it's hitting the blue chips of  Germany clearly.</p><p>QUEST:  So when I was talking to my last guest, we were talking about global slowdown, and I'm trying to find the -- I can see the evidence of it, but I can't find the reasons for it.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, I mean, Richard, we're kind of ten years into a very tired  cycle.  But let's take a step back and look at some of the factors behind Bayer for example, today.  This was the largest merger in German history, a $63 billion.  They inherited a nightmare when it comes to Monsanto and the lawsuits.</p><p>They're trying to clean it up, but the fourth quarter loss, for example, while the slowdown was kicking in, in Germany, was $4.5 billion.  It was four times the expected amount, partially because of the lawsuit, but in addition because of the slowdown we see today.</p><p>QUEST:  And that issues -- John, thank you.  That issues on what's happening with Germany we can look at in more detail because shares in Deutsche Bank closed down 3 percent on the Dax, opposition growing to a potential merger with Commerzbank.</p><p>The German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz is pushing for negotiations.  The unions are against the deal.  Stefan Mueller is the CEO of DGWA; the German  institute of asset allocation, he's against the merger and told Julia Chatterley, that Scholz must have a reason for sticking by the banks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEFAN MUELLER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GERMAN INSTITUTE FOR ASSET ALLOCATION:  My concern is that he really knows more than we all, and because of that, the only reason why even a bank like Deutsche Bank, one of the former icons of German economy is following his -- let's call it advice or whatever.</p><p>There must be something in the background that we all don't know that he thinks he has to push that merger with Commerzbank.  You know that Germany owns 15 percent of the Commerzbank, and it seems like this is the only partner that Deutsche Bank can merge with.</p><p>We still think that an European Bank, and large European bank from France or Switzerland which would be the better partner, but facing a lot of issues in the future like the money laundering scandal and also some issues with this  gentleman who actually lives in Penn Ave 1600 in Washington seem to be two huge risks within Deutsche Bank for other partners in the future.</p><p>So they don't know what may happen with Deutsche Bank in the future.  So they are not open for merger talks, so Commerzbank has to do it.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN:  So basically what you're saying is, these are two inherently weak banks at this moment, but this is a bailout, a rescue for Deutsche Bank?</p><p>[15:55:00]  MUELLER:  I think so, yes.  They don't merge because of -- I think some of the parts becomes a real good bank.  I think that the real risk is that without that, let's call it merger, and without that merger, Deutsche Bank is definitely too weak to come back to somehow strength that the bank had in the past.</p><p>And the risk that somebody else takes it over and maybe slice it or the bank is running into huge issues is too high.  I mean, the German economy itself is large and strong, and we need a German bank that is representing our economy, our huge companies Steven Stein(ph), Lufthansa, Allianz, you all know them in the world.</p><p>It can't be that especially the U.S. investment banks control our corporate business here.  So we need a huge corporate bank, and Deutsche Bank alone can't do that in the future any longer.  And I think therefore Mr. Scholz is acting here now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Right, when we come back, we're awaiting the British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is going to make a statement in Downing Street sometime in the next half hour.  We're not sure what she's going to say, but bearing in mind the precarious situation for Brexit, we're expecting something important.</p><p>But then the last time she came into Downing Street, we thought that too.  Anyway, stay with me on the other side of this break, we will have what Theresa May says.  This is CNN.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2194662859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVX-FV81-DY0W-425V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7363\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

The E.U. will grant an extension, but only if they can approve it. The Fed leaves rates alone. Further rate hikes seems unlikely this year, and that's why you saw the market go up so sharply at two o'clock. And Google investors seemingly unnerved by a third anti-trust fine of nearly $2 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Live from London on Wednesday, March the 20th, I'm Richard Quest. I mean business.</p><p>Good evening, tonight, Brexit developments are coming thick and fast here in London. Theresa May has asked the E.U. to delay Brexit until June the 30th. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk says that might work if the British Parliament signs off on the exit agreement, it's the only one on the table.</p><p>Now here's the crucial piece. Without an agreement, the U.K. is still going to crash out in nine days' time. Both sides are grappling with the constraints and intense political pressures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: As Prime Minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the 30th of June.</p><p>DONALD TUSK, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COUNCIL: In the light of the consultations that I have conducted over the past days, I believe that short extension will be possible, but it will be conditional on the positive votes on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: There was also a three-hour debate in Westminster. The reality is tonight, the situation is much more tense, bordering on confused and chaotic. Bianca is outside Houses of Parliament. So there is the prospect of an extension, a short extension only if Parliament votes for the deal, which they've rejected twice. What happens now?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The Prime Minister tries to bring that deal again for a third time with a couple of changes that she's agreed with the E.U. that's mainly around issues that her and Juncker discussed in Strasbourg, which Donald Tusk said today he will be happy to try and come to an agreement with, with the Prime Minister.</p><p>So she will try and bring that deal back for a third time to the House of Commons. But it failed historically by 230 votes the first time, then by 149 votes and yes, we've heard positive sounds from the DUP, from some Brexiteers who promised never to back that deal saying now, is the time that they're going to support the Prime Minister, but will that be enough? She's definitely going to need to get Labour MPs on side as well. Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Before we get too ahead of ourselves, asking whether who will support it or not? How is she going to get the deal before the House bearing in mind what Speaker Bercow has ruled that it has to be substantially different.</p><p>NOBILO: She addressed that very point today when she wrote formally to President Tusk to ask for the extension. I think the third or fourth paragraph explain that very point saying that she wasn't able to bring the withdrawal agreement and her deal back to the House of Commons without those changes.</p><p>So she asked the E.U. again, if they would be able to provide some supplementary documents in order to qualify to meet John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons' criteria for her to bring it back. So that's what we're expecting to hear. But lawmakers I've spoken to are expecting the Prime Minister to give a statement outside Downing Street or inside Downing Street some point later this evening, but we'd expect her to flesh that out and plot the path towards meaningful vote three.</p><p>QUEST: MV3 is likely to be when? Next Tuesday or Wednesday? That way she can go to -- I mean, when would it be?</p><p>NOBILO: Well, it's meant to be this Tuesday. I don't think anybody can really guess at this point. We might get an answer this evening from the Prime Minister, but as you mentioned, we are only nine days off from the date that is enshrined ...</p><p>[15:05:09]</p><p>NOBILO: ...in British law that Britain is leaving the E.U. so it needs to be soon. And if the E.U. is only granting that extension to the 30th of June contingent upon Theresa May's deal passing then it has to be some time in the next week. But I'd expect that we get more details about that later today.</p><p>QUEST: Bianca, don't go too far away. We're going to need you when the Prime Minister speaks in just over an hour's time.</p><p>On \"The Express,\" earlier I put into the Conservative MP, Andrew Percy it doesn't matter when the extension ends. The U.K. Parliament still has to have the withdrawal agreement and the E.U. says there's nothing new on the table.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW PERCY, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, CONSERVATIVE PARTY: The problem we have in Parliament is we have two different groups of people voting against the withdrawal agreement who both think they're going to get different destinations. One group thinks they're going to stop Brexit, the other group thinking they're going to get a no-deal Brexit. Well, they can't both be right.</p><p>But you know, the end of the day, you're absolutely right. If we don't pass the withdrawal agreement, then we're not going to get this extension and you know, the whole thing is back to where we were at the start of this week of not knowing where we end up.</p><p>QUEST: Are you hearing from your from your more extreme Brexiteers that they are starting to waver or whether to just hold their nose and vote for the Prime Minister's deal?</p><p>PERCY: I think some of them have. I think, look, the fact that the House of Commons voted last week to prevent a no-deal exit means that some of them are clearly fearful that they may not get Brexit altogether. There are, I'm afraid a hard core amongst them who will be irreconcilable to the Prime Minister's deal on any terms, but similarly there are MPs on the opposition benches who are were remainders in the referendum campaign, who represent very hot heavy leave voting constituencies who do want to bring this to a conclusion as well.</p><p>So I think if they understand that we're now reaching that point where it is going to be this or we potentially could end up with a no-deal, then some of those could come on side. The problem with this whole debate is as soon as you get somebody at one end of the debate, you lose somebody at the other. So -- but I do think people's opinions are changing somewhat whether it's enough remains to be seen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Joining me now, John Rentoul, the chief political commentator at \"The Independent\" newspaper. He is also at Westminster. Well, I think we could all agree whatever one's political colors that it is an extraordinary mess. Which way, John, do you see out of it?</p><p>JOHN RENTOUL, CHIEF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, THE INDEPENDENT: If I knew that I wouldn't -- I wouldn't be here. I'd be down the bookies. It's very difficult. I mean, it's extraordinary to have the nation poised this close to a deadline without people knowing which way it's going to go.</p><p>You know, the Prime Minister seem to say something extraordinary today which is that if she doesn't get her deal through by the 30th of June, she's going to let somebody else sorted out she said, you know, as Prime Minister she would not accept a delay to Brexit longer than the 30th of June. I don't know who that was designed to frighten though, maybe it was designed to put pressure on Labour MPs who would be horrified by the prospect of Boris Johnson succeeding her as Prime Minister.</p><p>QUEST: So let's go through this in quick fire. Brexiteers want Brexit. They now realize that could be slipping away from them if the U.K. doesn't go for -- if the U.K. goes for a longer extension, so why would they not vote for the Prime Minister?</p><p>RENTOUL: Well because there's a hard core of conservative MPs, a larger number than I thought there were of Brexiteers against Brexit. They think the Prime Minister's deal is so bad that it's better to stay in the E.U. and fight for what they call a clean Brexit, a true Brexit in the longer run. I mean, it's quite an extraordinary puritanical position. I mean, they would rather be in the E.U. in pure and opposed to it than accept the compromise of the Prime Minister's deal.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Now that small number could be enough to scupper her next week. Because if the DUP jump on board and all the other ERG jump on board, then you're really left with, I mean, she has to take everybody and if there are some ideological stronger holdouts, then she's done for.</p><p>RENTOUL: Well, for every ideological stronghold out, she needs a Labour MP to come across from the opposition to support her. Now, there are about 30 or 40 Labour MPs who have said that they think Brexit ought to happen, but so far, they haven't done very much about it.</p><p>I mean, there's only been five of them have come over and supported the Prime Minister's deal on previous votes.</p><p>[15:10:01]</p><p>QUEST: John, do you think there may be a view in the country that somehow we think it's all going to be sorted out somehow at the last minute. You know so that the people don't actually really believe hand at heart that you'd fall over the cliff because everybody thinks, \"Well, don't worry at the last minute, they'll sort it out.\"</p><p>RENTOUL: I'm not sure about that. I come across quite a lot of people who are very frightened about the prospect of, you know, disruptive chaotic no- deal Brexit. I mean, you know there's talk of people stockpiling food and people are very worried about it. I mean, a lot of people think that their jobs and their futures maybe at stake, and that's what I think is a bit irresponsible about the way the Parliament is handling it, but you know, I don't particularly blame the Prime Minister because she has to manage an impossible situation. She's got a Parliament split three ways which represents the British people who are split three ways.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Thank you. As this progresses, we look forward to talking to you more about understanding what's happening.</p><p>Tack on a few more billion dollars to Google's bill with the E.U. Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager tells us, she is forcing Google to change its ways and there's some shocking allegations of what's recorded on the black box from last year's Lion Air crash. The plane should probably never been in the air bearing in mind what happened the previous day.</p><p>QUEST: The anti-trust hounds in Europe have come once again for Google, and this time the European Commission has ordered Google to pay nearly $2 billion -- $1.7 billion for abusing its dominant position in online advertising. This is the third time European authorities have levied against Google in as many year.</p><p>Last year, the Commission charged Google for undercutting mobile phone market. In 2017, it said it hadn't fairly favored its own shopping service. Google is waiting on an appeal in these cases. But what's the bill for all of this? It all stands at $9.3 billion dollars. So consider this. The revenue was $137 billion last year. So it really is somewhat of a drop in the bucket. The fines amount to just 3% of revenue over the last three years.</p><p>The European Commissioner for Competition is Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>[15:15:10]</p><p>QUEST: She spoke to Eric McLaughlin and the Commissioner said regardless of the fine, her office is succeeding in forcing Google to change its behavior.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION: Google only stops when we sent the statement of objection to say, well, we find that these clauses in your contracts, they're illegal.</p><p>So I think it shows that it has an effect. But of course, you're right to say that one of our obligations is to speed up because we're dealing with fast moving markets.</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Is there an E.U. bias against big tech firms? I know this was asked in the press conference, but is there that bias there that's been perceived by the media as well as others?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, I think some of the European companies will also get big fines, they would wish for a bias. But there are no bias. If you see that fines to the European truck companies, if you see the fines to the cartels that catalyze car parts, you would seems that our aim is pretty simple. You're more than welcome to do business in Europe. But you have to follow our rules and not to engage in any illegal behavior.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Is there a problem though, with us tech firms in general, given the lack of regulation in the United States?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, I wouldn't say that as a general measure. I think that when you're in an Industrial Revolution, as we are right now, well, it takes some time for society and democracy to gain speeds to say, well, this is the direction that we want to take. This is how we will regulate this market as we have done, you know for a hundred years when first, we regulated the working hours, healthy work places, the children couldn't work pesticides -- so all of that. It is the societal task in our democracy is to say, \"Well, this is the direction we want you to go,\" also, when we're in a technological revolution.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Do you think the U.S. is doing enough?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, as you can see, I'm quite busy in my day job here in Europe. So I make no judgment about my U.S. colleagues.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: And do you support moves to break up big tech companies?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, for us here, that would be a measure of very, very last resort, because it is obviously quite the thing to do to say to a private company, you have to divest part of your company, you have to make separate companies.</p><p>So what we doing here is to say, well, with the tools that we have, and actually we are also looking at new tools, we think that we can have competitive markets also in the digital and this is our endeavor, because it is quite far reaching to begin breaking up companies.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, but are these companies too big? The companies like Amazon, AppleGoogle, they are just these massive companies that are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>VESTAGER: I don't think that that the size in itself that's the problem. First, of course, is the problem when we have illegal behavior, but second, and this we think quite a lot about is access to data because they are giants, but they're also giants when it comes to holding data and you need data to innovate. You need data to feed your algorithm, to feed your artificial intelligence.</p><p>So what we are concerned about is more, how do you get access to all that data that is being created right now, because if you cannot get access, well, the number of competitors may dry out and the number of innovators may dry out as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jim Cridlin is here. He is Global Head of Innovation at Mindshare, a global media agency. This is sort of a technical stuff, but what I've often found with the Commission is that they are actually our watchdog and guardians. They are the ones pointing out the problems where most of us don't even see them.</p><p>JIM CRIDLIN, GLOBAL HEAD OF INNOVATION, MINDSHARE: Right. Exactly. And I think one of the things that E.U. regulators have gotten angry in the past has been that they thought that people have said, they've been too hard on many of the tech companies. But I think what you're seeing is actually the E.U. regulators are probably ahead of the curve, right?</p><p>If you look right now, across the world, whether that's in the U.S. where congressional representatives or senators, U.S. presidential candidates are thinking about increased regulation, or even things like GDPR, other places are catching on.</p><p>QUEST: I guess the problem is, in the U.S., there is a much closer link between the regulators and the politicians who question them and then therefore, here, the link to Margrethe Vestager and then the Commission is somewhat tangential it and it often seems supra national.</p><p>CRIDLIN: Yes, it is a little bit. You know, when you look at it in the U.S., many of these tech players, I mean, for example, Facebook has spent billions of dollars building hospitals and schools and places like that inside the U.S. that clearly buys you a lot of goodwill that politicians would look fondly upon.</p><p>[15:20:01]</p><p>QUEST: But also, those CEOs, get kebab'd in front of Congress. Now I know that there are hearings in front of the Commission, but they all seem a bit remote and a bit irrelevant.</p><p>CRIDLIN: Yes. Well, you know, I think when you look at this fine and particularly from the E.U., right, 1.5 billion euros is a big number. Now, if you are Google, like any fine is going to be -- it would seem like a lot of money. In the scheme of things, it's not my judgement, whether it's big or small.</p><p>I think will be interesting now are the knock on effects we see. Number one, it opens up the possibility for additional lawsuits from those that were affected. But I think what we're seeing at Mindshare across our clients are they are increasingly asking us questions like, \"Are we over invested in just a handful of digital players?\" And every time there's a data breach, every time a brand finds its content running in, on or alongside content that it doesn't want to be or there's a fine from a regulator, those concerns about are we over invested in too few players get amplified.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, briefly, do these fines even matter to Google?</p><p>CRIDLIN: I think they do. You know, every time there's an incident like this, we see a familiar pattern where advertisers might pull dollars from investing until Google fixes the issue and let me tell you, every time that happens, a player like Google acts quickly to correct the problem and this kind of thing adds on and on over time.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see, sir.</p><p>CRIDLIN: Likewise.</p><p>QUEST: I very much appreciate it. Thank you. Ten days after the horrific crash of a Boeing jet in Ethiopia, we're learning stunning new revelations about the Lion Air flight that crashed off Indonesia last year, killing all 189 on board -- people on board.</p><p>Both tragedies involved the Boeing 737 MAX 8 model of the plane. CNN's Melissa Bell reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This was all that was left of Lion Air Flight 610, which crashed into the Java Sea last October, debris picked through by the families of some of the 189 people who died on board.</p><p>At fault, according to a preliminary report, an automated safety system on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 triggered by a faulty reading from a single sensor. Reuters reporting that a chilling recording of the cockpit in the last few minutes before the crash shows pilots desperately looking through a handbook to try and figure out how to disable the system that was reportedly forcing the nose of the plane downwards.</p><p>That same plane, according to fresh reporting from Bloomberg, also encountering the very same problem the day before on a flight from Bali to Jakarta, but saved by an extra pilot who happened to be hitching a lift in the cockpit. News made all the more important by the crash on March 10th of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 that killed 156 people, a flight of the same type of Boeing and, according to preliminary data from the black boxes, one that followed a similar trajectory to the doomed Lion Air flight.</p><p>Those black boxes now being looked into here at the BEA on the outskirts of Paris. Its former head spoke to CNN about the questions now facing Boeing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEAN-PAUL TROADEC, FORMER PRESIDENT, FRENCH AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY: The measures taken by Boeing after the first accident were not enough to avoid the second accident.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL (on camera): `But the questions are not only for Boeing, with the Transportation Department now probing why the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration authorized, certified a system that was based on the readings of a single sensor, with many questions now being asked about how much of that certification process was handed directly to Boeing. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: We need to understand exactly what we're talking about. So have a look at this. The area of the plane that is relevant is this. This is the little two tails at the back of a plane. It's a horizontal stabilizer. The whole of it. And moves in a very small area, just a matter of degrees up or down. And depending on which way it moves, it trims the plane, nose up all those down and the pilots use that as a matter of for the center of gravity and for easier control of the aircraft.</p><p>However, with the MAX, the way the engines are further forward and higher then, well that's where the problem happens because what invariably happens with all of this is the way the -- when the plane sensed something was going wrong that part of the back of the aircraft pushed the nose down and the pilots were unable to do it because what had happened of course, is this part was dominant. This part was pushing down the nose of the aircraft.</p><p>Pilots are familiar with this concept. Les Abend for example is a former pilot. He joins me now from Jacksonville, Florida. Les, the concept of a runaway stabilizer as it is known, is known to you and other pilots. Why then in this case, wouldn't they have naturally realized --</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>QUEST: -- hang on, the nose is being pushed down, we're not doing it. That's what's the problem?</p><p>LES ABEND, RETIRED 777 PILOT: Well, you ask a very good question. And because they didn't get that visceral clue of that trim wheel which, Richard, you're very familiar with, of that of that trim wheel going around. So they thought it was another situation that they had to analyze.</p><p>So it was very counterintuitive to them that the airplane was wanting to head for the ground and in essence, what was happening the system that you described, it was essentially the telling pilots that it was going to stall and every time they attempted to trim the airplane up, it would reset itself and continue the nose down situation.</p><p>QUEST: Now, we know from the Lion Air, the previous day of the Lion Air flight, it was a jump seat rider pilot that recognized it, otherwise that plane would have gone down as well. And why would -- I guess I'm trying to understand, we've now got three sets of pilots flying who did not recognize, and the only one who did is this jump seat pilot. What do you make of that?</p><p>ABEND: Well, let's go back to the fact that Boeing didn't even put that in the manuals for these operators that had the system, basically the 737 with this MCAS system that we've all been talking about. So it starts there.</p><p>These three flights, first of all, the first one that returned safely, that was up at altitude, so that did help the situation, you've got a pilot sitting in the jump seat, something you're very familiar with that has a much broader view of what's happening. They didn't have a myopic focus and once that plane got on the ground with that problem that was written up as a discrepancy, the mechanics went together and electronically pulled what the faults were for the system and fixed it according to Boeing troubleshooting process.</p><p>So that airplane was going to be released until that problem was fixed. But apparently it was fixed, at least what we know about at this point in time. There's no verification of that, of course. And now you've got the crew --</p><p>QUEST: If we pull the strands, though, together of what happened here. I mean, how does two brand new planes fall out the sky with other incidents, and Boeing still tells us they committed to safety.</p><p>ABEND: You know what, I wish I had a real good answer for you. I'm very disappointed in Boeing, I've got to admit. This is not their M.O. They are very forthright with their systems and this was modified in a sense, as you described earlier in the introduction because of the bigger engines and the way the airplane reacts with these bigger engines.</p><p>So why Boeing did this? I don't know but the FAA approved it through the certification process.</p><p>QUEST: Les Abend, thank you for joining us. I appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>ABEND: My pleasure.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, what Donald Tusk's speech tells us about where Brexit goes from here. We need to see it from the other side now. The E.U. view. Erin McLaughlin is Brussels and will be with us after the break.</p><p>[15:30:00] RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. But a thousand days ago, the people of Britain voted to take back control, now the EU seems to be holding all the cards, Brussels side in just a moment.</p><p>And on the Fed's decision day, how much will a slowdown affect America's growing economy? As you and I continue tonight, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first. Helicopter rescues are taking place across Mozambique in the wake of a cyclone Idai.</p><p>It is believed that hundreds of people have died, and some communities completely under water from flooding. Eight agencies are trying to get food, medicine, and water to more than half a million people.</p><p>New Zealand has begun burying the victims of last week's shooting attack on two mosques. A father and son immigrants from Syria were the first to be laid to rest. The police say they believe the gunman was on his way to attack a third mosque when the police rammed his car and brought the attacks to an end.</p><p>President Trump is visiting the state of Ohio today with two possible contenders for the Secretary of Defense. Sources tell CNN he's inclined to nominate the acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan for the job. However, another contender, the Army Secretary Mark Esper also joined the president on Air Force One.</p><p>America's top diplomat is in Israel touting the Trump administration's strong ties with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Soon after Mike Pompeo landed in Tel Aviv, the White House announced President Trump himself would host Mr. Netanyahu in Washington next week, just days ahead of Israel's elections.</p><p>A dramatic story near Milan in Italy. Authorities say a school bus driver set his bus on fire with more than 50 children inside. Police broke down the windows and got all the children out unharmed. Local drivers say the driver who is from Senegal was protesting against migrant drowning.</p><p>Breaking developments are moving quickly here in London. We've learned that Theresa May is to make a statement in about half -- 45 minutes from now. But as she does so, this is where we stand at the moment. It's been a thousand days since the Brexit vote. Nine days are left unless the U.K. and the EU agree an extension.</p><p>The president of the European Council Donald Tusk says that an extension is possible if parliament signs off on the exit agreement with the EU that was negotiated by Theresa May.</p><p>British lawmakers have rejected it twice. Keir Starmer is the Labor Party's Brexit spokesman, he says he's afraid the Prime Minister will use any extension to keep pushing her deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEIR STARMER, BRITISH LABOR MP: This is what I am most concerned about, that the Prime Minister still thinks that the failed strategy of the last two years, namely my deal or no deal, a blink and approach no changes, no room for parliament, should just be pursued for another three month.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes --</p><p>STARMER: But in other words, all she's going to do is use the three months in exactly the same way to bring back the deal over and over again, or as many times as she can without breaching the rules of the house and to try to force it through.</p><p>[15:35:00] That -- I'll just finish this point, if I may. That is the strategy she's been pursuing throughout these negotiations, and it has failed badly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So that is the situation Theresa May and indeed the United Kingdom finds themselves in. Donald Tusk says the PM must ram through a deal that British lawmakers have rejected twice. Erin McLaughlin is in Brussels. Erin, we were talking earlier, is Donald Tusk -- is he helping or hindering the Prime Minister by requiring that vote before an extension?</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think that very much depends on who you ask, Richard. But what was clear that played out today here in Brussels is he took the ball that Theresa May put into his court earlier this morning with that letter that she wrote requesting an extension until June 30th.</p><p>Took the ball and slammed it back into the court of the United Kingdom, telling Theresa May, you can have a short extension that you want, but you need to get this deal across the line, and you need to do it next week. Now, the question being, if she fails at that, as looks likely at this point, what next?</p><p>And we're completely in the dark once again, Richard, in terms of what happens next. Keep in mind that March 29th exit date is enshrined in British law. It will require an act of parliament that's currently not tabled --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: To reverse it. So this could be --</p><p>QUEST: All right --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Seen as playing into the hands of hard Brexiteers.</p><p>QUEST: All right. But if she doesn't get it through and the option of a short extension goes, what about the possibility of the long extension? A year, two years for Britain to decide what it wants. Would Brussels rather that or a no-deal Brexit?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Here's the thing about the long extension, Richard. Theresa May has to request it. And that's what they thought she was going to be doing this morning. That is what the EU had expected, according to a diplomat I was talking to. That's what David Lidington from her cabinet had imparted to diplomats here in Brussels to expect this morning. That did not happen.</p><p>Does she have the political clout, the political backing to be able to request --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: A long extension? That is not evident at this point.</p><p>QUEST: So I am coming to Brussels tomorrow for the council meeting, looking forward to working with you and being with you then. How annoyed are -- is this council? How difficult, how fractious is this council going to get?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: I think the EU leaders, EU officials here are frustrated time and time again, speaking to diplomats, they tell me they're sick of Brexit. But the other critical thing I think we heard from Donald Tusk today was the tone. He's trying to take down the temperature, saying look, the EU wants a solution, they want a way out of this. They want a constructive approach. They do not want to be blamed for this mess, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Erin, see you tomorrow. We'll be with you tomorrow, thank you. As you and I continue tonight, after the break, the Federal Reserve decision today, it looks like Jerome Powell is sticking to his patient plans. The rates and the growth forecast, we'll talk about it after the break.</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: OK, you really do need to look at the Dow chart to understand what an unusual day. We're down very heavily throughout the course of the session, triple-digit losses. And then, just after the Fed statement and the Fed decision, the market goes up and it remains up, and then at roughly half an hour ago, for some reason, the market has dropped and we're now down 127.</p><p>When you and I started talking just about 41 minutes ago, the market was actually up, and it looked like it was going to end positive. But now it seems to be somewhat different. So after spending much of the session in the red, the stocks that have been moving today, shares of FedEx have tumbled 3 percent as the firm is warning of a global slowdown after it reported some pretty dismal earnings after the close last night.</p><p>And it comes as the U.S. Fed voted to keep interest rates on hold to maintain its more dovish outlook. Now, if we look within this, United Health Group is quite a large component of the Dow, so is Goldman Sachs. Now, they are down heavily, 3.5 percent and 2.5 percent.</p><p>Those are at the positive end are not quite so big, except, of course, for Boeing. Now, the benchmark rate for the U.S. Fed stays in the range of 2 to 2.25 percent. Chairman Jay Powell also said the Fed is lowering its growth forecast and indicated no more rate increases are likely to come this year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE, UNITED STATES: We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018. We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate.</p><p>Since last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the world that bear close attention. Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my colleagues and I will be patient in assessing what if any changes in the stance of policy may be needed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Lindsey Piegza is the chief economist at Stifel, joins me from Las Vegas, good to see you. So, what's happened today? Why -- I mean, we see the market roar up, very quickly after 2:00, and then go back down again.</p><p>LINDSEY PIEGZA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STIFEL: Well, there's a couple of things going on. As expected, the Fed opted to leave rates unchanged. And we also saw from the famed dot plot, that the Fed doesn't intend to raise rates any additional times in 2019.</p><p>We also heard from the Fed chairman that the U.S. economy is on relatively sound footing. So initially, this seemed like the perfect combination for the market. The Fed not taking any further action, the economy is steady. And what we do know is that historically, Feds have been willing to continue to tighten until the weakness in the data is very clear, thus forcing us into rescission.</p><p>This time, it seemed like the Powell Fed was backing off preemptively, giving the economy still room to run. However, later on, the market started to dig through some of the details of the report from the Fed as well as additional comments from the Fed chairman during the press conference.</p><p>And what we saw was an additional downside risk. So growing concern within the Fed about the sustainability of the recovery going forward. Talking about a reduction of global growth, which of course --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>PIEGZA: Then could translate into deflationary pressures here in the U.S.</p><p>QUEST: But the Fed has made it clear, I mean, they're using the word patience. This is the -- this is the new rubric to tell us they're not going to do anything. They made it clear they're not going to raise rates further this year. And probably well into next year because -- but from your perspective, just how weak is the U.S. economy?</p><p>[15:45:00] PIEGZA: Well, I think right now, the economy is still on steady footing. The problem is, going forward, a number of underlying indicators suggest waning momentum, and the Fed outlined several of them. We're starting to see business investment lose ground. We're starting to see a slower pace of spending.</p><p>Remember, we're a consumer-based economy, if the consumer isn't out there happy and healthy, we can't expect to maintain even this 2-ish percent growth pace going forward. We also see housing showing signs of weakness.</p><p>So there's a number of different components that are pointing to downward momentum or this downward bias that the Fed pointed to, suggesting that yes, we may see positive growth in 2019, but significantly slower than last year, and the big question mark is when we turn the page into 2020, are we still able to maintain positive growth or is this where the recession risk starts to rapidly rise?</p><p>QUEST: Do you believe that a recession is likely?</p><p>PIEGZA: I do. I think when we turn the calendar into 2020, the risk of recession rises above 50 percent. We do expect momentum to slow noticeably throughout the remaining nine months of the year with growth coming in closer to around 1.5 percent --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>PIEGZA: In the next year. So noticeably weaker than what the Fed is projecting around 2.1 percent.</p><p>QUEST: So what is driving this slowdown? I mean, we keep sort of hearing - - oh, global slowdown, developing countries, emerging markets, European -- obviously, we know the eurozone is in --</p><p>PIEGZA: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Some trouble. But what's driving it? Why suddenly after several years for the U.S. of good growth, is there -- is there this concern?</p><p>PIEGZA: Well, remember, we were already starting to see this downward bias in 2018, even though the annual growth pace for the U.S. was 3 percent, we saw the last nine months losing momentum. So second quarter at 4 percent, third quarter at 3 percent, the fourth quarter 2.5 percent.</p><p>So there was this downward trend in activity to begin with as we turn the corner into 2019. But to your point, I think one of the biggest concerns from our standpoint is the consumer. The consumer had very much been reliant on temporary factors for the past several years, including drawing down savings, ramping up credit to above pre-crisis levels --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>PIEGZA: As well as eating into that lingering wealth effect from earlier years of lower cost energy. We hadn't seen meaningful gains in wages. Now, yes, we are starting to see more recently an uptick in earnings, but they're likely to prove very short-lived and are still very isolated throughout pockets of the labor market as opposed to being broad-based across all sectors.</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>PIEGZA: So if you're looking for a catalyst, I think the consumer is a good place to start.</p><p>QUEST: Look forward to talking to you again, and when you're in New York, we'll be having you and talking to face-to-face. Good to see you, thank you Lindsey, thank you.</p><p>PIEGZA: Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>QUEST: As we -- as we continue tonight, a bad day for German companies. Their stock was sharpener after a herbicide scandal. BMW is issuing a profits warning, and Deutsche Bank drops, no wonder the Dax was down 1.5 percent.</p><p>[15:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: European markets slumped, as fears over Brexit continue to grow. Just look at that, the Dax was hit particularly hard, tipping 1.6 percent. There was more bad news out of Germany on Wednesday, it was a veritable potpourri of bad news.</p><p>Shares of Bayer; the owners of Monsanto plunged over 9 percent after it found that its weed killer contributed to a man's cancer. And the shares of BMW closed down nearly 5 percent after the car maker issued a profits warning for this year. We need to understand why they issued a profit warnings and what's happening with the German economy. Good to have John Defterios with us.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Thank you very much, it's amazing because I was looking back, the Dax has been the worst performing European market over the last 14 months, down better than the 7 percent. So this is a couple of knocks across the chin here, coming from some blue chips, Richard with Bayer and BMW, no doubt about it.</p><p>QUEST: OK, Germany is going to have a new leader. Angela Merkel is going to step down sooner rather than later as she's made that clear. But there is a feeling the economy is not performing well.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: No, the last time we had a conversation about Europe, it was about the European Central Bank downgrade to 1.1 percent --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Then the council of experts in Germany came out with a figure 24 hours ago, that is 0.8 percent --</p><p>QUEST: Why?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, there's a couple factors here. I think we have to recognize it's something you've been covering the front half of the program. That Brexit is starting to undermine overall European growth, but the other hidden factor and something I look at more carefully because I being emerging markets editor, is that the exports to China from Germany are slowing down.</p><p>And this is something they relied upon --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>DEFTERIOS: And it's kind of a sleeper, but it's hitting the blue chips of Germany clearly.</p><p>QUEST: So when I was talking to my last guest, we were talking about global slowdown, and I'm trying to find the -- I can see the evidence of it, but I can't find the reasons for it.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, I mean, Richard, we're kind of ten years into a very tired cycle. But let's take a step back and look at some of the factors behind Bayer for example, today. This was the largest merger in German history, a $63 billion. They inherited a nightmare when it comes to Monsanto and the lawsuits.</p><p>They're trying to clean it up, but the fourth quarter loss, for example, while the slowdown was kicking in, in Germany, was $4.5 billion. It was four times the expected amount, partially because of the lawsuit, but in addition because of the slowdown we see today.</p><p>QUEST: And that issues -- John, thank you. That issues on what's happening with Germany we can look at in more detail because shares in Deutsche Bank closed down 3 percent on the Dax, opposition growing to a potential merger with Commerzbank.</p><p>The German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz is pushing for negotiations. The unions are against the deal. Stefan Mueller is the CEO of DGWA; the German institute of asset allocation, he's against the merger and told Julia Chatterley, that Scholz must have a reason for sticking by the banks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEFAN MUELLER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GERMAN INSTITUTE FOR ASSET ALLOCATION: My concern is that he really knows more than we all, and because of that, the only reason why even a bank like Deutsche Bank, one of the former icons of German economy is following his -- let's call it advice or whatever.</p><p>There must be something in the background that we all don't know that he thinks he has to push that merger with Commerzbank. You know that Germany owns 15 percent of the Commerzbank, and it seems like this is the only partner that Deutsche Bank can merge with.</p><p>We still think that an European Bank, and large European bank from France or Switzerland which would be the better partner, but facing a lot of issues in the future like the money laundering scandal and also some issues with this gentleman who actually lives in Penn Ave 1600 in Washington seem to be two huge risks within Deutsche Bank for other partners in the future.</p><p>So they don't know what may happen with Deutsche Bank in the future. So they are not open for merger talks, so Commerzbank has to do it.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN: So basically what you're saying is, these are two inherently weak banks at this moment, but this is a bailout, a rescue for Deutsche Bank?</p><p>[15:55:00] MUELLER: I think so, yes. They don't merge because of -- I think some of the parts becomes a real good bank. I think that the real risk is that without that, let's call it merger, and without that merger, Deutsche Bank is definitely too weak to come back to somehow strength that the bank had in the past.</p><p>And the risk that somebody else takes it over and maybe slice it or the bank is running into huge issues is too high. I mean, the German economy itself is large and strong, and we need a German bank that is representing our economy, our huge companies Steven Stein(ph), Lufthansa, Allianz, you all know them in the world.</p><p>It can't be that especially the U.S. investment banks control our corporate business here. So we need a huge corporate bank, and Deutsche Bank alone can't do that in the future any longer. And I think therefore Mr. Scholz is acting here now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Right, when we come back, we're awaiting the British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is going to make a statement in Downing Street sometime in the next half hour. We're not sure what she's going to say, but bearing in mind the precarious situation for Brexit, we're expecting something important.</p><p>But then the last time she came into Downing Street, we thought that too. Anyway, stay with me on the other side of this break, we will have what Theresa May says. This is CNN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019032001cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP9-VMS1-DXH2-60HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7286\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002DLG</classCode><className>FEDEX CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002CBQ</classCode><className>COMMERZBANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS492110 COURIERS &amp;

The E.U. will grant an extension, but only if they can approve it.  The Fed leaves rates alone.  Further rate hikes seems unlikely this year, and that's why you saw the market go up so sharply at two o'clock.  And Google investors seemingly unnerved by a third anti-trust fine of nearly $2 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Live from London on Wednesday, March the 20th, I'm Richard Quest.  I mean business.</p><p>Good evening, tonight, Brexit developments are coming thick and fast here in London.  Theresa May has asked the E.U. to delay Brexit until June the 30th.  The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk says that might work if the British Parliament signs off on the exit agreement, it's the only one on the table.</p><p>Now here's the crucial piece.  Without an agreement, the U.K. is still going to crash out in nine days' time.  Both sides are grappling with the constraints and intense political pressures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  As Prime Minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the 30th of June.</p><p>DONALD TUSK, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COUNCIL:  In the light of the consultations that I have conducted over the past days, I believe that short extension will be possible, but it will be conditional on the positive votes on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  There was also a three-hour debate in Westminster.  The reality is tonight, the situation is much more tense, bordering on confused and chaotic.  Bianca is outside Houses of Parliament.  So there is the prospect of an extension, a short extension only if Parliament votes for the deal, which they've rejected twice.  What happens now?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  The Prime Minister tries to bring that deal again for a third time with a couple of changes that she's agreed with the E.U. that's mainly around issues that her and Juncker discussed in Strasbourg, which Donald Tusk said today he will be happy to try and come to an agreement with, with the Prime Minister.</p><p>So she will try and bring that deal back for a third time to the House of Commons.  But it failed historically by 230 votes the first time, then by 149 votes and yes, we've heard positive sounds from the DUP, from some Brexiteers who promised never to back that deal saying now, is the time that they're going to support the Prime Minister, but will that be enough?  She's definitely going to need to get Labour MPs on side as well.  Yes --</p><p>QUEST:  Before we get too ahead of ourselves, asking whether who will support it or not?  How is she going to get the deal before the House bearing in mind what Speaker Bercow has ruled that it has to be substantially different.</p><p>NOBILO:  She addressed that very point today when she wrote formally to President Tusk to ask for the extension.  I think the third or fourth paragraph explain that very point saying that she wasn't able to bring the withdrawal agreement and her deal back to the House of Commons without those changes.</p><p>So she asked the E.U. again, if they would be able to provide some supplementary documents in order to qualify to meet John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons' criteria for her to bring it back.  So that's what we're expecting to hear.  But lawmakers I've spoken to are expecting the Prime Minister to give a statement outside Downing Street or inside Downing Street some point later this evening, but we'd expect her to flesh that out and plot the path towards meaningful vote three.</p><p>QUEST:  MV3 is likely to be when?  Next Tuesday or Wednesday?  That way she can go to -- I mean, when would it be?</p><p>NOBILO:  Well, it's meant to be this Tuesday.  I don't think anybody can really guess at this point.  We might get an answer this evening from the Prime Minister, but as you mentioned, we are only nine days off from the date that is enshrined ...</p><p>[15:05:09]</p><p>NOBILO:   ...in British law that Britain is leaving the E.U. so it needs to be soon.  And if the E.U. is only granting that extension to the 30th of June contingent upon Theresa May's deal passing then it has to be some time in the next week.  But I'd expect that we get more details about that later today.</p><p>QUEST:  Bianca, don't go too far away.  We're going to need you when the Prime Minister speaks in just over an hour's time.</p><p>On \"The Express,\" earlier I put into the Conservative MP, Andrew Percy it doesn't matter when the extension ends.  The U.K. Parliament still has to have the withdrawal agreement and the E.U. says there's nothing new on the table.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW PERCY, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, CONSERVATIVE PARTY:  The problem we have in Parliament is we have two different groups of people voting against the withdrawal agreement who both think they're going to get different destinations.  One group thinks they're going to stop Brexit, the other group thinking they're going to get a no-deal Brexit.  Well, they can't both be right.</p><p>But you know, the end of the day, you're absolutely right.  If we don't pass the withdrawal agreement, then we're not going to get this extension and you know, the whole thing is back to where we were at the start of this week of not knowing where we end up.</p><p>QUEST:  Are you hearing from your from your more extreme Brexiteers that they are starting to waver or whether to just hold their nose and vote for the Prime Minister's deal?</p><p>PERCY:  I think some of them have.  I think, look, the fact that the House of Commons voted last week to prevent a no-deal exit means that some of them are clearly fearful that they may not get Brexit altogether.  There are, I'm afraid a hard core amongst them who will be irreconcilable to the Prime Minister's deal on any terms, but similarly there are MPs on the opposition benches who are were remainders in the referendum campaign, who represent very hot heavy leave voting constituencies who do want to bring this to a conclusion as well.</p><p>So I think if they understand that we're now reaching that point where it is going to be this or we potentially could end up with a no-deal, then some of those could come on side.  The problem with this whole debate is as soon as you get somebody at one end of the debate, you lose somebody at the other.  So -- but I do think people's opinions are changing somewhat whether it's enough remains to be seen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Joining me now, John Rentoul, the chief political commentator at \"The Independent\" newspaper.  He is also at Westminster.  Well, I think we could all agree whatever one's political colors that it is an extraordinary mess.  Which way, John, do you see out of it?</p><p>JOHN RENTOUL, CHIEF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, THE INDEPENDENT:  If I knew that I wouldn't -- I wouldn't be here.  I'd be down the bookies.  It's very difficult.  I mean, it's extraordinary to have the nation poised this close to a deadline without people knowing which way it's going to go.</p><p>You know, the Prime Minister seem to say something extraordinary today which is that if she doesn't get her deal through by the 30th of June, she's going to let somebody else sorted out she said, you know, as Prime Minister she would not accept a delay to Brexit longer than the 30th of June.  I don't know who that was designed to frighten though, maybe it was designed to put pressure on Labour MPs who would be horrified by the prospect of Boris Johnson succeeding her as Prime Minister.</p><p>QUEST:  So let's go through this in quick fire.  Brexiteers want Brexit.  They now realize that could be slipping away from them if the U.K. doesn't go for -- if the U.K. goes for a longer extension, so why would they not vote for the Prime Minister?</p><p>RENTOUL:  Well because there's a hard core of conservative MPs, a larger number than I thought there were of Brexiteers against Brexit.  They think the Prime Minister's deal is so bad that it's better to stay in the E.U. and fight for what they call a clean Brexit, a true Brexit in the longer run.  I mean, it's quite an extraordinary puritanical position.  I mean, they would rather be in the E.U. in pure and opposed to it than accept the compromise of the Prime Minister's deal.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  Now that small number could be enough to scupper her next week.  Because if the DUP jump on board and all the other ERG jump on board, then you're really left with, I mean, she has to take everybody and if there are some ideological stronger holdouts, then she's done for.</p><p>RENTOUL:  Well, for every ideological stronghold out, she needs a Labour MP to come across from the opposition to support her.  Now, there are about 30 or 40 Labour MPs who have said that they think Brexit ought to happen, but so far, they haven't done very much about it.</p><p>I mean, there's only been five of them have come over and supported the Prime Minister's deal on previous votes.</p><p>[15:10:01]</p><p>QUEST:  John, do you think there may be a view in the country that somehow we think it's all going to be sorted out somehow at the last minute.  You know so that the people don't actually really believe hand at heart that you'd fall over the cliff because everybody thinks, \"Well, don't worry at the last minute, they'll sort it out.\"</p><p>RENTOUL:  I'm not sure about that.  I come across quite a lot of people who are very frightened about the prospect of, you know, disruptive chaotic no-deal Brexit.  I mean, you know there's talk of people stockpiling food and people are very worried about it.  I mean, a lot of people think that their jobs and their futures maybe at stake, and that's what I think is a bit irresponsible about the way the Parliament is handling it, but you know, I don't particularly blame the Prime Minister because she has to manage an impossible situation.  She's got a Parliament split three ways which represents the British people who are split three ways.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  As this progresses, we look forward to talking to you more about understanding what's happening.</p><p>Tack on a few more billion dollars to Google's bill with the E.U. Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager tells us, she is forcing Google to change its ways and there's some shocking allegations of what's recorded on the black box from last year's Lion Air crash.  The plane should probably never been in the air bearing in mind what happened the previous day.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  The anti-trust hounds in Europe have come once again for Google, and this time the European Commission has ordered Google to pay nearly $2 billion -- $1.7 billion for abusing its dominant position in online advertising.  This is the third time European authorities have levied against Google in as many year.</p><p>Last year, the Commission charged Google for undercutting mobile phone market.  In 2017, it said it hadn't fairly favored its own shopping service.  Google is waiting on an appeal in these cases.  But what's the bill for all of this?  It all stands at $9.3 billion dollars.  So consider this.  The revenue was $137 billion last year.  So it really is somewhat of a drop in the bucket.  The fines amount to just 3% of revenue over the last three years.</p><p>The European Commissioner for Competition is Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>[15:15:10]</p><p>QUEST:  She spoke to Eric McLaughlin and the Commissioner said regardless of the fine, her office is succeeding in forcing Google to change its behavior.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION:  Google only stops when we sent the statement of objection to say, well, we find that these clauses in your contracts, they're illegal.</p><p>So I think it shows that it has an effect.  But of course, you're right to say that one of our obligations is to speed up because we're dealing with fast moving markets.</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Is there an E.U. bias against big tech firms?  I know this was asked in the press conference, but is there that bias there that's been perceived by the media as well as others?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, I think some of the European companies will also get big fines, they would wish for a bias.  But there are no bias.  If you see that fines to the European truck companies, if you see the fines to the cartels that catalyze car parts, you would seems that our aim is pretty simple.  You're more than welcome to do business in Europe.  But you have to follow our rules and not to engage in any illegal behavior.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Is there a problem though, with us tech firms in general, given the lack of regulation in the United States?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, I wouldn't say that as a general measure.  I think that when you're in an Industrial Revolution, as we are right now, well, it takes some time for society and democracy to gain speeds to say, well, this is the direction that we want to take.  This is how we will regulate this market as we have done, you know for a hundred years when first, we regulated the working hours, healthy work places, the children couldn't work pesticides -- so all of that.  It is the societal task in our democracy is to say, \"Well, this is the direction we want you to go,\" also, when we're in a technological revolution.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Do you think the U.S. is doing enough?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, as you can see, I'm quite busy in my day job here in Europe.  So I make no judgment about my U.S. colleagues.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  And do you support moves to break up big tech companies?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, for us here, that would be a measure of very, very last resort, because it is obviously quite the thing to do to say to a private company, you have to divest part of your company, you have to make separate companies.</p><p>So what we doing here is to say, well, with the tools that we have, and actually we are also looking at new tools, we think that we can have competitive markets also in the digital and this is our endeavor, because it is quite far reaching to begin breaking up companies.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Yes, but are these companies too big?  The companies like Amazon, AppleGoogle, they are just these massive companies that are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p><p>VESTAGER:  I don't think that that the size in itself that's the problem.  First, of course, is the problem when we have illegal behavior, but second, and this we think quite a lot about is access to data because they are giants, but they're also giants when it comes to holding data and you need data to innovate.  You need data to feed your algorithm, to feed your artificial intelligence.</p><p>So what we are concerned about is more, how do you get access to all that data that is being created right now, because if you cannot get access, well, the number of competitors may dry out and the number of innovators may dry out as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Jim Cridlin is here.  He is Global Head of Innovation at Mindshare, a global media agency.  This is sort of a technical stuff, but what I've often found with the Commission is that they are actually our watchdog and guardians.  They are the ones pointing out the problems where most of us don't even see them.</p><p>JIM CRIDLIN, GLOBAL HEAD OF INNOVATION, MINDSHARE:  Right.  Exactly.  And I think one of the things that E.U. regulators have gotten angry in the past has been that they thought that people have said, they've been too hard on many of the tech companies.  But I think what you're seeing is actually the E.U. regulators are probably ahead of the curve, right?</p><p>If you look right now, across the world, whether that's in the U.S. where congressional representatives or senators, U.S. presidential candidates are thinking about increased regulation, or even things like GDPR, other places are catching on.</p><p>QUEST:  I guess the problem is, in the U.S., there is a much closer link between the regulators and the politicians who question them and then therefore, here, the link to Margrethe Vestager and then the Commission is somewhat tangential it and it often seems supra national.</p><p>CRIDLIN:  Yes, it is a little bit.  You know, when you look at it in the U.S., many of these tech players, I mean, for example, Facebook has spent billions of dollars building hospitals and schools and places like that inside the U.S. that clearly buys you a lot of goodwill that politicians would look fondly upon.</p><p>[15:20:01]</p><p>QUEST:  But also, those CEOs, get kebab'd in front of Congress.  Now I know that there are hearings in front of the Commission, but they all seem a bit remote and a bit irrelevant.</p><p>CRIDLIN:  Yes.  Well, you know, I think when you look at this fine and particularly from the E.U., right, 1.5 billion euros is a big number.  Now, if you are Google, like any fine is going to be -- it would seem like a lot of money.  In the scheme of things, it's not my judgement, whether it's big or small.</p><p>I think will be interesting now are the knock on effects we see.  Number one, it opens up the possibility for additional lawsuits from those that were affected.  But I think what we're seeing at Mindshare across our clients are they are increasingly asking us questions like, \"Are we over invested in just a handful of digital players?\"  And every time there's a data breach, every time a brand finds its content running in, on or alongside content that it doesn't want to be or there's a fine from a regulator, those concerns about are we over invested in too few players get amplified.</p><p>QUEST:  Finally, briefly, do these fines even matter to Google?</p><p>CRIDLIN:  I think they do.  You know, every time there's an incident like this, we see a familiar pattern where advertisers might pull dollars from investing until Google fixes the issue and let me tell you, every time that happens, a player like Google acts quickly to correct the problem and this kind of thing adds on and on over time.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see, sir.</p><p>CRIDLIN:  Likewise.</p><p>QUEST:  I very much appreciate it.  Thank you.  Ten days after the horrific crash of a Boeing jet in Ethiopia, we're learning stunning new revelations about the Lion Air flight that crashed off Indonesia last year, killing all 189 on board -- people on board.</p><p>Both tragedies involved the Boeing 737 MAX 8 model of the plane.  CNN's Melissa Bell reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This was all that was left of Lion Air Flight 610, which crashed into the Java Sea last October, debris picked through by the families of some of the 189 people who died on board.</p><p>At fault, according to a preliminary report, an automated safety system on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 triggered by a faulty reading from a single sensor.  Reuters reporting that a chilling recording of the cockpit in the last few minutes before the crash shows pilots desperately looking through a handbook to try and figure out how to disable the system that was reportedly forcing the nose of the plane downwards.</p><p>That same plane, according to fresh reporting from Bloomberg, also encountering the very same problem the day before on a flight from Bali to Jakarta, but saved by an extra pilot who happened to be hitching a lift in the cockpit.  News made all the more important by the crash on March 10th of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 that killed 156 people, a flight of the same type of Boeing and, according to preliminary data from the black boxes, one that followed a similar trajectory to the doomed Lion Air flight.</p><p>Those black boxes now being looked into here at the BEA on the outskirts of Paris.  Its former head spoke to CNN about the questions now facing Boeing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEAN-PAUL TROADEC, FORMER PRESIDENT, FRENCH AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY:  The measures taken by Boeing after the first accident were not enough to avoid the second accident.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL (on camera):  `But the questions are not only for Boeing, with the Transportation Department now probing why the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration authorized, certified a system that was based on the readings of a single sensor, with many questions now being asked about how much of that certification process was handed directly to Boeing.  Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  We need to understand exactly what we're talking about.  So have a look at this.  The area of the plane that is relevant is this.  This is the little two tails at the back of a plane.  It's a horizontal stabilizer.  The whole of it.  And moves in a very small area, just a matter of degrees up or down.  And depending on which way it moves, it trims the plane, nose up all those down and the pilots use that as a matter of for the center of gravity and for easier control of the aircraft.</p><p>However, with the MAX, the way the engines are further forward and higher then, well that's where the problem happens because what invariably happens with all of this is the way the -- when the plane sensed something was going wrong that part of the back of the aircraft pushed the nose down and the pilots were unable to do it because what had happened of course, is this part was dominant.  This part was pushing down the nose of the aircraft.</p><p>Pilots are familiar with this concept.  Les Abend for example is a former pilot.  He joins me now from Jacksonville, Florida.  Les, the concept of a runaway stabilizer as it is known, is known to you and other pilots.  Why then in this case, wouldn't they have naturally realized --</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>QUEST:  -- hang on, the nose is being pushed down, we're not doing it.  That's what's the problem?</p><p>LES ABEND, RETIRED 777 PILOT:  Well, you ask a very good question.  And because they didn't get that visceral clue of that trim wheel which, Richard, you're very familiar with, of that of that trim wheel going around.  So they thought it was another situation that they had to analyze.</p><p>So it was very counterintuitive to them that the airplane was wanting to head for the ground and in essence, what was happening the system that you described, it was essentially the telling pilots that it was going to stall and every time they attempted to trim the airplane up, it would reset itself and continue the nose down situation.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, we know from the Lion Air, the previous day of the Lion Air flight, it was a jump seat rider pilot that recognized it, otherwise that plane would have gone down as well.  And why would -- I guess I'm trying to understand, we've now got three sets of pilots flying who did not recognize, and the only one who did is this jump seat pilot.  What do you make of that?</p><p>ABEND:  Well, let's go back to the fact that Boeing didn't even put that in the manuals for these operators that had the system, basically the 737 with this MCAS system that we've all been talking about.  So it starts there.</p><p>These three flights, first of all, the first one that returned safely, that was up at altitude, so that did help the situation, you've got a pilot sitting in the jump seat, something you're very familiar with that has a much broader view of what's happening.  They didn't have a myopic focus and once that plane got on the ground with that problem that was written up as a discrepancy, the mechanics went together and electronically pulled what the faults were for the system and fixed it according to Boeing troubleshooting process.</p><p>So that airplane was going to be released until that problem was fixed.  But apparently it was fixed, at least what we know about at this point in time.  There's no verification of that, of course.  And now you've got the crew --</p><p>QUEST:  If we pull the strands, though, together of what happened here.  I mean, how does two brand new planes fall out the sky with other incidents, and Boeing still tells us they committed to safety.</p><p>ABEND:  You know what, I wish I had a real good answer for you.  I'm very disappointed in Boeing, I've got to admit.  This is not their M.O.  They are very forthright with their systems and this was modified in a sense, as you described earlier in the introduction because of the bigger engines and the way the airplane reacts with these bigger engines.</p><p>So why Boeing did this?  I don't know but the FAA approved it through the certification process.</p><p>QUEST:  Les Abend, thank you for joining us.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p>ABEND:  My pleasure.</p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight, what Donald Tusk's speech tells us about where Brexit goes from here.  We need to see it from the other side now.  The E.U. view.  Erin McLaughlin is Brussels and will be with us after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00]  RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment.  But a thousand days ago, the people of Britain voted to take back control, now the EU seems to be holding all the cards, Brussels side in just a moment.</p><p>And on the Fed's decision day, how much will a slowdown affect America's growing economy? As you and I continue tonight, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.  Helicopter rescues are taking place across Mozambique in the wake of a cyclone Idai.</p><p>It is believed that hundreds of people have died, and some communities completely under water from flooding.  Eight agencies are trying to get food, medicine, and water to more than half a million people.</p><p>New Zealand has begun burying the victims of last week's shooting attack on two mosques.  A father and son immigrants from Syria were the first to be laid to rest.  The police say they believe the gunman was on his way to attack a third mosque when the police rammed his car and brought the attacks to an end.</p><p>President Trump is visiting the state of Ohio today with two possible contenders for the Secretary of Defense.  Sources tell CNN he's inclined to nominate the acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan for the  job.  However, another contender, the Army Secretary Mark Esper also joined the president on Air Force One.</p><p>America's top diplomat is in Israel touting the Trump administration's strong ties  with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Soon after Mike Pompeo landed in Tel Aviv, the White House announced President Trump himself would host Mr. Netanyahu in Washington next week, just days ahead of Israel's elections.</p><p>A dramatic story near Milan in Italy.  Authorities say a school bus driver set his bus on fire with more than 50 children inside.  Police broke down the windows  and got all the children out unharmed.  Local drivers say the driver who is from Senegal was protesting against migrant drowning.</p><p>Breaking developments are moving quickly here in London.  We've learned that Theresa May is to make a statement in about half -- 45 minutes from now.  But as she does so, this is where we stand at the moment.  It's been a thousand days since the Brexit vote.  Nine days are left unless the U.K. and the EU agree an extension.</p><p>The president of the European Council Donald Tusk says that an extension is possible if parliament signs off on the exit agreement with the EU that was  negotiated by Theresa May.</p><p>British lawmakers have rejected it twice.  Keir Starmer is the Labor Party's Brexit spokesman, he says he's afraid the Prime Minister will use any extension to keep pushing her deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEIR STARMER, BRITISH LABOR MP:  This is what I am most concerned about, that the Prime Minister still thinks that the failed strategy of the last two years, namely my deal or no deal, a blink and approach no changes, no room for parliament, should just be pursued for another three month.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes --</p><p>STARMER:  But in other words, all she's going to do is use the three months in  exactly the same way to bring back the deal over and over again, or as many times as she can without breaching the rules of the house and to try to force it through.</p><p>[15:35:00]  That -- I'll just finish this point, if I may.  That is the strategy she's been pursuing throughout these negotiations, and it has failed badly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  So that is the situation Theresa May and indeed the United Kingdom finds themselves in.  Donald Tusk says the PM must ram through a deal that British lawmakers have rejected twice.  Erin McLaughlin is in Brussels.  Erin, we were talking earlier, is Donald Tusk -- is he helping or hindering the Prime Minister by requiring that vote before an extension?</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think that very much depends on who you ask, Richard.  But what was clear that played out  today here in Brussels is he took the ball that Theresa May put into his court earlier this morning with that letter that she wrote requesting an extension until June 30th.</p><p>Took the ball and slammed it back into the court of the United Kingdom, telling Theresa May, you can have a short extension that you want, but you need to get this deal across the line, and you need to do it next week.  Now, the question being, if she fails at that, as looks likely at this point, what next?</p><p>And we're completely in the dark once again, Richard, in terms of what happens next.  Keep in mind that March 29th exit date is enshrined in British law.  It will require an act of parliament that's currently not tabled --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  To reverse it.  So this could be --</p><p>QUEST:  All right --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Seen as playing into the hands of hard Brexiteers.</p><p>QUEST:  All right.  But if she doesn't get it through and the option of a short extension goes, what about the possibility of the long extension? A year, two years for Britain to decide what it wants.  Would Brussels rather that or a no-deal Brexit?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Here's the thing about the long extension, Richard.  Theresa May has to request it.  And that's what they thought she was going to be doing this morning.  That is what the EU had expected, according to a diplomat I was talking to.  That's what David Lidington from her cabinet had imparted to diplomats here in Brussels to expect this morning.  That did not happen.</p><p>Does she have the political clout, the political backing to be able to request --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  A long extension? That is not evident at this point.</p><p>QUEST:  So I am coming to Brussels tomorrow for the council meeting, looking forward to working with you and being with you then.  How annoyed are -- is this  council? How difficult, how fractious is this council going to get?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  I think the EU leaders, EU officials here are frustrated time and time again, speaking to diplomats, they tell me they're sick of Brexit.  But the other critical thing I think we heard from Donald Tusk today was the tone.  He's trying to take down the temperature, saying look, the EU wants a solution, they want a way out of this.  They want a constructive approach.  They do not want to be blamed for this mess, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Erin, see you tomorrow.  We'll be with you tomorrow, thank you.  As you and I continue tonight, after the break, the Federal Reserve decision today, it looks like Jerome Powell is sticking to his patient plans.  The rates and the growth  forecast, we'll talk about it after the break.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  OK, you really do need to look at the Dow chart to understand what an unusual day.  We're down very heavily throughout the course of the session, triple-digit losses.  And then, just after the Fed statement and the Fed decision,  the market goes up and it remains up, and then at roughly half an hour ago, for some reason, the market has dropped and we're now down 127.</p><p>When you and I started talking just about 41 minutes ago, the market was actually up, and it looked like it was going to end positive.  But now it seems to be somewhat different.  So after spending much of the session in the red, the stocks  that have been moving today, shares of FedEx have tumbled 3 percent as the firm is warning of a global slowdown after it reported some pretty dismal earnings after the close last night.</p><p>And it comes as the U.S. Fed voted to keep interest rates on hold to maintain its more dovish outlook.  Now, if we look within this, United Health Group is quite a large component of the Dow, so is Goldman Sachs.  Now, they are down heavily, 3.5 percent and 2.5 percent.</p><p>Those are at the positive end are not quite so big, except, of course, for Boeing.  Now, the benchmark rate for the U.S. Fed stays in the range of 2 to 2.25 percent.  Chairman Jay Powell also said the Fed is lowering its growth forecast and indicated no more rate increases are likely to come this year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE, UNITED STATES:  We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a  solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018.  We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate.</p><p>Since last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the world that bear close attention.  Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my colleagues and I will be patient in assessing what if any changes in the stance of policy may be needed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Lindsey Piegza is the chief economist at Stifel, joins me from Las Vegas, good to see you.  So, what's happened today? Why -- I mean, we see the market roar up, very quickly after 2:00, and then go back down again.</p><p>LINDSEY PIEGZA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STIFEL:  Well, there's a couple of things going on.  As expected, the Fed opted to leave rates unchanged.  And we also saw from the famed dot plot, that the Fed doesn't intend to raise rates any additional times in 2019.</p><p>We also heard from the Fed chairman that the U.S. economy is on relatively sound footing.  So initially, this seemed like the perfect combination for the  market.  The Fed not taking any further action, the economy is steady.  And what we do know is that historically, Feds have been willing to continue to tighten  until the weakness in the data is very clear, thus forcing us into rescission.</p><p>This time, it seemed like the Powell Fed was backing off preemptively, giving the economy still room to run.  However, later on, the market started to dig through some of the details of the report from the Fed as well as additional comments from the Fed chairman during the press conference.</p><p>And what we saw was an additional downside risk.  So growing concern within the Fed about the sustainability of the recovery going forward.  Talking about a reduction of global growth, which of course --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>PIEGZA:  Then could translate into deflationary pressures here in the U.S.</p><p>QUEST:  But the Fed has made it clear, I mean, they're using the word patience.  This is the -- this is the new rubric to tell us they're not going to do anything.  They made it clear they're not going to raise rates further this year.  And probably well into next year because -- but from your perspective, just how weak is the U.S. economy?</p><p>[15:45:00]  PIEGZA:  Well, I think right now, the economy is still on steady  footing.  The problem is, going forward, a number of underlying indicators  suggest waning momentum, and the Fed outlined several of them.  We're starting to see business investment lose ground.  We're starting to see a slower pace of spending.</p><p>Remember, we're a consumer-based economy, if the consumer isn't out there  happy and healthy, we can't expect to maintain even this 2-ish percent growth pace going forward.  We also see housing showing signs of weakness.</p><p>So there's a number of different components that are pointing to downward momentum or this downward bias that the Fed pointed to, suggesting that yes, we may see positive growth in 2019, but significantly slower than last year, and the big  question mark is when we turn the page into 2020, are we still able to maintain positive growth or is this where the recession risk starts to rapidly rise?</p><p>QUEST:  Do you believe that a recession is likely?</p><p>PIEGZA:  I do.  I think when we turn the calendar into 2020, the risk of  recession rises above 50 percent.  We do expect momentum to slow noticeably throughout the remaining nine months of the year with growth coming in closer to around 1.5 percent --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>PIEGZA:  In the next year.  So noticeably weaker than what the Fed is projecting around 2.1 percent.</p><p>QUEST:  So what is driving this slowdown? I mean, we keep sort of hearing -- oh, global slowdown, developing countries, emerging markets, European -- obviously, we know the eurozone is in --</p><p>PIEGZA:  Yes --</p><p>QUEST:  Some trouble.  But what's driving it? Why suddenly after several years  for the U.S. of good growth, is there -- is there this concern?</p><p>PIEGZA:  Well, remember, we were already starting to see this downward bias in 2018, even though the annual growth pace for the U.S. was 3 percent, we saw the last nine months losing momentum.  So second quarter at 4 percent, third  quarter at 3 percent, the fourth quarter 2.5 percent.</p><p>So there was this downward trend in activity to begin with as we turn the corner  into 2019.  But to your point, I think one of the biggest concerns from our standpoint is the consumer.  The consumer had very much been reliant on temporary factors for the past several years, including drawing down savings, ramping up credit to above pre-crisis levels --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>PIEGZA:  As well as eating into that lingering wealth effect from earlier years of lower cost energy.  We hadn't seen meaningful gains in wages.  Now, yes, we are starting to see more recently an uptick in earnings, but they're likely to prove very short-lived and are still very isolated throughout pockets of the labor market as opposed to being broad-based across all sectors.</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>PIEGZA:  So if you're looking for a catalyst, I think the consumer is a good place to start.</p><p>QUEST:  Look forward to talking to you again, and when you're in New York, we'll be having you and talking to face-to-face.  Good to see you, thank you Lindsey, thank you.</p><p>PIEGZA:  Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>QUEST:  As we -- as we continue tonight, a bad day for German companies.  Their stock was sharpener after a herbicide scandal.  BMW is issuing a profits  warning, and Deutsche Bank drops, no wonder the Dax was down 1.5 percent.</p><p>[15:50:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  European markets slumped, as fears over Brexit continue to grow.  Just look at that, the Dax was hit particularly hard, tipping 1.6 percent.  There was more bad news out of Germany on Wednesday, it was a veritable potpourri of bad  news.</p><p>Shares of Bayer; the owners of Monsanto plunged over 9 percent after it found that its weed killer contributed to a man's cancer.  And the shares of BMW closed down nearly 5 percent after the car maker issued a profits warning for this year.  We need to understand why they issued a profit warnings and what's happening with the German economy.  Good to have John Defterios with us.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Thank you very much, it's amazing because I was looking back, the Dax has been the worst performing European market over the last 14 months, down better than the 7 percent.  So this is a couple of knocks across the chin here, coming from some blue chips, Richard with Bayer and BMW, no doubt about it.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, Germany is going to have a new leader.  Angela Merkel is going to step down sooner rather than later as she's made that clear.  But there is a feeling the economy is not performing well.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  No, the last time we had a conversation about Europe, it  was about the European Central Bank downgrade to 1.1 percent --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Then the council of experts in Germany came out with a figure  24 hours ago, that is 0.8 percent --</p><p>QUEST:  Why?</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, there's a couple factors here.  I think we have to recognize  it's something you've been covering the front half of the program.  That Brexit is starting to undermine overall European growth, but the other hidden factor and  something I look at more carefully because I being emerging markets editor, is that the exports to China from Germany are slowing down.</p><p>And this is something they relied upon --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  And it's kind of a sleeper, but it's hitting the blue chips of  Germany clearly.</p><p>QUEST:  So when I was talking to my last guest, we were talking about global slowdown, and I'm trying to find the -- I can see the evidence of it, but I can't find the reasons for it.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Well, I mean, Richard, we're kind of ten years into a very tired  cycle.  But let's take a step back and look at some of the factors behind Bayer for example, today.  This was the largest merger in German history, a $63 billion.  They inherited a nightmare when it comes to Monsanto and the lawsuits.</p><p>They're trying to clean it up, but the fourth quarter loss, for example, while the slowdown was kicking in, in Germany, was $4.5 billion.  It was four times the expected amount, partially because of the lawsuit, but in addition because of the slowdown we see today.</p><p>QUEST:  And that issues -- John, thank you.  That issues on what's happening with Germany we can look at in more detail because shares in Deutsche Bank closed down 3 percent on the Dax, opposition growing to a potential merger with Commerzbank.</p><p>The German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz is pushing for negotiations.  The unions are against the deal.  Stefan Mueller is the CEO of DGWA; the German  institute of asset allocation, he's against the merger and told Julia Chatterley, that Scholz must have a reason for sticking by the banks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEFAN MUELLER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GERMAN INSTITUTE FOR ASSET ALLOCATION:  My concern is that he really knows more than we all, and because of that, the only reason why even a bank like Deutsche Bank, one of the former icons of German economy is following his -- let's call it advice or whatever.</p><p>There must be something in the background that we all don't know that he thinks he has to push that merger with Commerzbank.  You know that Germany owns 15 percent of the Commerzbank, and it seems like this is the only partner that Deutsche Bank can merge with.</p><p>We still think that an European Bank, and large European bank from France or Switzerland which would be the better partner, but facing a lot of issues in the future like the money laundering scandal and also some issues with this  gentleman who actually lives in Penn Ave 1600 in Washington seem to be two huge risks within Deutsche Bank for other partners in the future.</p><p>So they don't know what may happen with Deutsche Bank in the future.  So they are not open for merger talks, so Commerzbank has to do it.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN:  So basically what you're saying is, these are two inherently weak banks at this moment, but this is a bailout, a rescue for Deutsche Bank?</p><p>[15:55:00]  MUELLER:  I think so, yes.  They don't merge because of -- I think some of the parts becomes a real good bank.  I think that the real risk is that without that, let's call it merger, and without that merger, Deutsche Bank is definitely too weak to come back to somehow strength that the bank had in the past.</p><p>And the risk that somebody else takes it over and maybe slice it or the bank is running into huge issues is too high.  I mean, the German economy itself is large and strong, and we need a German bank that is representing our economy, our huge companies Steven Stein(ph), Lufthansa, Allianz, you all know them in the world.</p><p>It can't be that especially the U.S. investment banks control our corporate business here.  So we need a huge corporate bank, and Deutsche Bank alone can't do that in the future any longer.  And I think therefore Mr. Scholz is acting here now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Right, when we come back, we're awaiting the British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is going to make a statement in Downing Street sometime in the next half hour.  We're not sure what she's going to say, but bearing in mind the precarious situation for Brexit, we're expecting something important.</p><p>But then the last time she came into Downing Street, we thought that too.  Anyway, stay with me on the other side of this break, we will have what Theresa May says.  This is CNN.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2194662859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR6-S5R1-JBHT-D156-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7363\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

Two months into 2020, the financial world remains at a point of uncertainty about the immediate future, but is also seeing a number of interesting developments, both in terms of market movements and regulatory/legislative initiatives.</p><p>The current consensus about the global (and, by extension, CEE) macro-economic outlook it that, on the one hand, we find ourselves at the peak of the cycle. On the other, we are facing idiosyncratic uncertainties such as a looming pandemic, a prospect of a disorderly Brexit, and political instability in EU. Thrown into the mix are legacy business challenges facing European/CEE banks, such as the fight to sustain profits on traditional banking products and the quest to tap into new markets (where a new breed of competitors - including Big Tech and fintechs - needs to be fought). Last but not least, looming legal uncertainties are not making matters easier: should the loan syndication (and possibly even restructuring) processes be re-thought in light of DG Comp's  report-and-syndicated-loans/ and market inquiry? What stance will courts and legislators ultimately take on questions regarding foreign law denominated (consumer) loans? Are banks adequately protected against risks in the wake of the transition away from the IBORs? The list goes on.</p><p>A gloomy outlook? I think the right term is \"challenging\". Regulators and private players alike have no alternative but to put on a brave face, take on the challenges and keep going. As you will see in this edition of Schoenherr's To the Point Finance, the CEE is doing precisely that. To give you a taste: the Czech Republic, embracing the digital era, has laid down the legislative foundation for a singular e-identity (via banks as ID gatekeepers); Montenegro, learning from recent experience, has revamped the legislative toolbox for resolution of credit institutions; Hungary is making it increasingly easier for companies to tap into capital markets for debt finance; Poland is re-vamping its pension system and the Slovenian bank regulator has stepped on the brakes for consumer/residential lending - for domestic banks only.

Yes, this is the second time this week the Supreme Court has gone against the White House. The High Court said the President overstepped his authority in attempting to end DACA.</p><p>President Trump said the court's recent decisions are political tweeting \"These horrible and politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court a short term blast in the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans and conservatives would be more justices. We will lose our second amendment everything else vote Trump 2020\"</p><p>Well, Chief Justice John Roberts who sided with liberals on the decision said \"We do not decide whether DACA or its recession or sound policies we dress only wanted the agency complied with the procedural requirement that to provide a reasoned explanation for its actions\"</p><p>Senator Tom Cotton slammed Roberts saying he should resign from the bench and should run for office \"Believes his political judgment is so explicit\".

And those are your headlines from newsroom Dagen back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so Cheryl. We'll see you shortly. Looking at markets this morning stocks ending mostly higher yesterday investors weighing recovery, optimism, stimulus hopes along with worries about a second Coronavirus wave.</p><p>Joining the conversation the Head of U. S. Rates for Amerivet Securities and CFA Gregory Faranello along with all morning long Michael Lee of Michael Lee Strategies Chair of the program in Business and Finance at the King's College Fox News Contributor Brian Brenberg Republican Strategist Pinion Enterprises Founder and CEO Joseph Pinion.</p><p>Welcome one and all good to see you. Greg to you first looking at the NASDAQ from the recent low it's up 45 percent are these stocks overvalued here?</p><p>GREGORY FARANELLO, HEADD OF U.S. RATES FOR AMERIVET SECURITIES: Dagen, thank you very much for having me. So kind of fed liquidity I mean we were on March 20th, we talked about the market trying to find a little bit of a bottom.</p><p>You know we think most of what we see today has been driven by Central Bank liquidity, fiscal liquidity. When you look on the Central Bank's side the Fed we've got 3 trillion and balance sheet expansion we've got 2 trillion slated for the lending programs 2 trillion more potentially from the lending programs fiscal and monetary stimulus across the board.</p><p>We've been advocating volatility here to clients over the last couple of weeks. We just feel like we we've come back a long way here and given some of the dynamics out there to your point about viruses potentially spiking again. The looming election we think it's time for a little bit of a sideways pause here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Michael Lee get in here.</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: Good. What do you see the yield curve going forward? Are negative rates in our future anytime soon?</p><p>FARANELLO: Thanks Mike. I mean that's a good question. So we're not a big fan of negative rates and we've written talked about this fairly extensively. When you look at the Chairman himself if you look at other members of the Fed Committee they've really pushed back they haven't said definitively no but they have certainly pushed back.</p><p>The anecdotal evidence globally when you look at the other countries that abuse negative interest rates you look at their economic landscape? It's not at all clear that there's any practical evidence that negative interest rates work more practically though I would say.</p><p>When you look at what negative interest rates would do for the bank's right? So the fed is expanded the reserve base in the in the bank's now the reserves are over 3 trillion it would be not only punitive for the banks but it would be punitive for the consumer.</p><p>So in my opinion and I think the fed's opinion here negative interest rates are off the table for now. In terms of the yield curve yes largely directional we had a nice evening up until a couple weeks ago with the risk on trade.</p><p>We've seen clients trying to roll out the curve grab some credit, grab some yield which makes sense in a zero rate environment. So we expect the yield curve to be largely directional. We expect the curve to steepen out as rates move higher and we have a bit of a reflection trade conversely we have moments like we're having today and yesterday we had some long and supplied it went well where we've re flattened out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Brian Bromberg we talk about just the unprecedented response from the Federal Reserve program after program unlimited buying of treasuries. What's the downside of that? I don't want to sound like a worry word here but there has to be some price to pay for what the Federal Reserve is doing Brian?</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's exactly related the prices. Does all those movements by the fed in the market really start to distort prices? But the other issue Greg that I'd like to ask you about it even with all the fire power from the fed we're getting these rumblings of the Coronavirus come back?</p><p>And the threat of the lock down that would be catastrophic to the real economy? When does that start to show up those fears that are rising in market prices because I don't think we're seeing that right now?</p><p>FARANELLO: Yes, no thank you Brian. I mean that's a great question. I think some of the volatility is starting to reflect that. More specifically though when you listen to the fed when you listen to Powell, Kaplan they're really saying look we've done a lot here but the bigger risk is how we reopen the economy around the virus?</p><p>And that is that is a real risk. It may not be entirely present to your point that we're seeing right now but certainly as we move into the summer months we get a little more deeper into this re opening that's certainly going to be a risk factor.</p><p>But I think for now right here you know the fed has done a lot. They're pushing back on the fiscal side. They've clearly push back in Powell's testimony this week to say we need some fiscal support.</p><p>Christine Laggard this morning has explicitly said that the EU needs to get this package passed. So you know from Central Bank perspective and also keep in mind too Central Banks have been active here for 10, 12 years since the last financial crisis.</p><p>So we certainly need some physical help here but I think the - to your point Brian and it's a good one. The health side of the equation as we move into the fall I think we'll be just is as important as the monetary side.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But can we rely on people whose predictions were wrong in the first place because so much of what we heard from health experts and even leaders of states and cities across the country was just wrong?</p><p>Their projections were wrong but Greg, I don't but - I mean you focus - I fully acknowledge that you study and focus on fixed income and interest rates given that I raised the issue of the over valuation of technology stocks so apologies for that.</p><p>However in terms of risk look and if you look at how far tech has run and you look at the election risk that's on the horizon or these - I worry that these big tech companies are and are in focus for the Democrat or Republican in the White House and people in Congress for break ups? And I wonder if that's factored into this market?</p><p>FARANELLO: Yes, I mean certainly anytime you're in a low interest rate environment like this it could lend itself to excessive risk taking. There's been a lot of talk about you know moral hazard more specifically I think though when you listen to Powell this week. He was asked very explicitly about I think Dagen some of the themes that that you're bringing up right now.</p><p>And he said he wasn't worried at all about equity valuations. So I don't think the fed is going to lay off the gas here. There's obviously been a lot of talk about speculation here. You know Robin Hood account scanned and young millennials getting involved in terms of speculating on the market which is clearly a concerned.</p><p>But like I said I mean from our perspective you know we think markets have come a long way here since March. And we think given a lot of the variables that are out there right now it makes sense in a minimal that we get some volatility here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you Greg, great to see you. Sorry for putting on this spot there's no we have covered it all.</p><p>FARANELLO: It's great to be here. Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Greg Faranello. We're just getting started this morning. Later this hour Washington Examiner Editorial Director Hugo Gurdon reacts to new Fox News polls that reveal Presumptive Democratic Nominee Joe Biden pulling ahead of President Trump.</p><p>And joining me next hour Florida Congressman Greg Steube on the Supreme Court's ruling on DACA the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Junior Dr. Alveda King is here as we commemorate the Juneteenth holiday the end of slavery in the United States.</p><p>Then at 8:00 am I speak to Former Senior Adviser to President George W. Bush Fox News Contributor Karl Rove as Joe Biden builds his lead over the President and Fox News Contributor 32 Advisors Founder and CEO Former Economic Adviser to President Obama Robert Wolf on his expectations for Joe Biden's Vice Presidential pick.</p><p>Coming up a win for dreamers, conservative Supreme Court Justice John Roberts swinging in favor of keeping that program in place blocking the Trump Administration from shutting down the DACA program a big legal threat, big legal defeat to the President. Plus fighting off COVID-19 a new study finds antibodies may vanished quicker than we thought what this means for your immunity next?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Supreme Court shutting down the Trump Administration's attempt to end the DACA program. Blake Burman is live from Washington with the latest. Good morning Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS: Dagen, good morning to you as well. This was a defeat for President Trump in the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the 4 liberal justices on the court saying that DACA cannot be rescinded by the Trump Administration.</p><p>You remember that was the Executive Order that was signed by President Obama some 8 years ago back in 2012 which allowed for the Deferred Deportation for People brought into the U. S. illegally when they were children.</p><p>Now the ruling does not address the merits of the deferred action on childhood arrivals program rather it declared the manner in which the Department of Homeland Security stopped the program as \"Arbitrary and capricious\"</p><p>The Former President hailing the decision on Twitter writing in part \"We may look different and come from everywhere but what makes us American are our shared ideals and now to stand up for those ideals we have to move forward and elect Joe Biden and a Democratic Congress that does its job protects dreamers and finally creates a system that's truly worthy of this nation of immigrants once and for all\"</p><p>President Trump weighed in with several tweets as well writing at one point \"These horrible and politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or conservatives. We need more justices or we'll lose our second amendment and everything vote Trump 2020\".</p><p>Now another tweet Dagen the President also went on to say that there need to be new justices on the Supreme Court and he said that in the upcoming months he will be releasing a new list of potential Supreme Court Justice nominees should he ever have the chance to nominate additional justices on the court? You remember back in the 2016 Election President Trump produced a similar list as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Blake Burman, thank you so much for that great to see you. So Joseph to you first, I wrote this down this decision by the Supreme Court against the Trump Administration puts judicial picks potential Scouts nominees and emigration front and center in this election?</p><p>JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Look, I think one of the reasons that Trump got elected in 2016 highly document is because of the fact that there are people so concerned about the Supreme Court to that end we've gotten two Supreme Court nominees I mean, Justice Cavanaugh</p><p>And so I think at the end of the day on what we need to be focused on is President Trump's own commitment. I think President Trump on many occasions has said that he has a great heart for the dreamers. I think most Americans believe that one of the hallmarks of American Liberty is it we do not punish children for the actions of their parents.</p><p>So I think again, I think politically speaking we're talking about how can we actually leverage Democrats to actually do the right thing to let's see engage and help the very people they claim they want to see have a pathway to the American dream? And I think President Trump has been very clear on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Brian, Joseph gets to the heart of this issue. \"The Wall Street Journal\" has an editorial today on DACA Obama can, but Trump can't basically a talking about how President Obama gave the coverage to the DACA children but the Supreme Court rules against Trump for using the same power if you will?</p><p>And the journal points out we support the legalization of the 700,000 or so immigrants as a matter of fairness and contributors to American life. But this is an issue for Congress. What say you?</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes, I mean look, regardless of how you feel about DACA? This is a bizarre decision because it creates this double standard where it's easier to enact an unlawful regulation than it is to repeal it. And you can just - you can imagine what kind of bad behavior that's going to incentivize for Presidents when they know they can put something in place that's incredibly difficult to unwind.</p><p>And the problem here by not dealing with the issue actually we don't get the substance of the issue. Now Congress has much less reason to come back to the table and actually cut a deal on this to the American people want to see it's just delay and you're going to see delayed by Congress now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the journal to end with this points out the dangerous precedent this sets Chief Justice Roberts joined the liberals to avoid a ruling that would have been criticized by the media and Democrats like Obamacare the 2019 census case and so on. So is the intimidation by Senate Democrats of the court working? We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A spike in Coronavirus cases, more than half the country 26 states seeing a rise in confirmed virus infections. Florida is shaping up to be the next epicenter according to University of Pennsylvania scientists there. Researchers say that the risk there is worse than ever. The state reporting record high cases this week.</p><p>Joining me now Johnson Hopkins School of Public Health Professor Former World Health Organization Collaborator Fox News Medical Contributor Dr. Marty Makary. Dr. Marty, good to see you this morning. But dig into these headlines are we seeing number of rising in cases in part because of more testing?</p><p>DR. MARTY MAKARY, JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSOR: Well, good morning, Dagen, we are seeing the rising number and the concern is not necessarily institutional spread that is meat packing plans, this is from daily activity.</p><p>Now there's a high concentration of more cases among migrant workers, people that live in low-income housing, people that live in condensed situations under the same roof and take public buses to work which is a controversy in Florida may that - that may be driving a lot of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But how do we prevent it then? I was looking at some research or some data that was reviewed by a Stanford Medical Professor and this goes back to what we were told in the very beginning of this outbreak. 80 percent of Americans have died from COVID-19 are older than 65 with the median age of 80.</p><p>The whole point was to protect those most vulnerable to death, the elderly and certainly in the case of New York we did not and put those elderly people in nursing homes at risk. So what are we doing to prevent a real rise in deaths from this virus?</p><p>DR. MAKARY: Well Dagen, the latest under recognition by the medical community is that it is not routine brief interactions where there's direct contact or touching contaminated surfaces. But instead we even met from our own air when we read out these micro droplets immaculate sensually float in the air so indoor areas with poor ventilation is being recognized as a major driver of spread.</p><p>That's probably why we're seeing outbreaks in Austin, Texas in bars among young people leave another case which all the rate is lower and it may explain why New York got hammered because of the poor ventilation and public transit and the elevators.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, which we kept them that some way is open for way too long there's been research done by that that how it accelerated the spread here. If you wear - this is a simple question I'm on a bus going to work or going somewhere, public transit if I wear a mask can I sit next to somebody, if they're wearing a mask?</p><p>DR. MAKARY: Well, it's generally recognized that the - when distance it's not feasible that's when you really need to wear a mask and the risk I would say is reduced from about 50 to 60 percent rates of emitting viral particles down to 17 percent when you're wearing masks so it helps and I do feel confident when people wearing masks though so together.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's mandated in indoor spaces now in California we got that. A new study I want to ask you about Coronavirus antibodies. A new study says these antibodies may only last 2 to 3 months after a person is infected your thoughts on this?</p><p>DR. MAKARY: Well, we look at - first of all many people say we don't know. But I really feel strongly that there are enough surrogate indicators that the immunity lasts for years because they do with the other known Coronaviruses. If you look at SARS, if you look at MERS, these viruses giving immunity of at least 3 years and we're not seeing re infections.</p><p>We looked very closely now in China and we are not seeing re instructions where patients are some symptomatic.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is great news. Marty it was great to see you. Dr. Marty Makary, we will see you very soon take care.</p><p>DR. MAKARY: Thank you Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up Biden building his lead. New Fox News polls find that the Former Vice President pulling ahead of President Trump with less than 6 months until November's Presidential Election. Plus a war over words Twitter and Facebook targeting President Trump again sparking fresh outrage over bias in social media.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Friday June 19th. Your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Futures are showing markets largely shrugging off concerns about coronavirus cases spiking. We have a, speaking of spiking, 231 point gain on the Dow futures right now. That's a departure from yesterday's close. The stocks pared losses minutes before the closing bell. The Dow shedding 39 points.</p><p>In Europe investors putting hopes on a new package from the European Union to help economies recover after the coronavirus. We have gains across the board there.</p><p>In Asia overnight it was green across the screen as well. All four major markets in Asia to the plus side.</p><p>Albertson's reportedly gearing up to go public. Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, that's right Dagen. And according to the Wall Street Journal, Albertson has kicked off its IPO road show as the market for new offerings heats up following the COVID-19 pandemic and well, grocery store sales that really took off during that pandemic. Albertson's is looking to price its IPO between $18 and $20 dollars a share, valuing the company at more than $10 billion. Albertson's is the second largest US grocery based on the number of stores.</p><p>Well, Facebook stepping up in the battle against posts and ads from President Trump. The company has removed Trump campaign ads from its site for violating its policy against organized hate. The bottom of the ads show a large red arrow pointing down, which is a symbol of hate. The Trump campaign says the symbol is used by Antifa. Well, Facebook removing ads run by President Trumps reelection campaign for breeching its policies again on hate speech, let's look at that triangle once again, I know that we're going to be talking about this a little bit later on in the show, but this is believed to be a Nazi symbol. Not the first time the social media site has taken down content. Earlier in the year they took down a campaign ad that referred to a census which said it violated a company policy and preventing any disinformation.</p><p>Well, here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Japan is the largest foreign holder of US debt, with $1.27 trillion dollars. China and the UK rounding out the top three. The US had $25 trillion, by the way, in debt in April. Yelp added a COVID-19 section to business pages to inform customers what services are available and what safety protocols are in effect. And HBO's hit series Watchmen is available to watch for free this weekend. The show explores the legacy of systemic racism in America. And those are your headlines Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl. Counting down to 2020. New Fox News polls out this week show that former Vice President Joe Biden holding steady in his lead over President Trump nationwide. Biden is 12 percentage points ahead of the President in the latest numbers. Last month he was eight points up. Joining me now, Washington Examiner Editorial Director, Hugo Gurdon. Hugo, always great to see you. If you go into these numbers, though, and we know that the national polls are less important than say the state by state polls, and in five, if look at a Real Clear Politics Average, in five critical swing states, that President Trump won in 2016, Joe Biden is ahead in the polling average. So, even if you dig down state by state, Biden is leading.</p><p>HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Yeah, yeah Dagen, the polls are looking pretty bad for Trump at the moment. And, we've past the point, I think, where it's possible to say well, it's a very long time before the election so, the polls don't mean very much. What we're seeing, and we're only four and a half months away from the November election, is the Biden lead widening, President Trump falling further behind. And as you say, it's not just the national poll, which Fox brought out, which is a bit of a serious blow to Trump, where he's 12 points behind Biden. There are states which Trump won, for example, Iowa, where he's now, it's now a tossup. there's bad news in terms of the closeness of the race, for example, in Florida, which was one which I think Trump campaign thought it had in its pocket.</p><p>So, President Trump is currently being forced to defend in states that he thought were, you know, were going to be his. You know, there was a time not that long ago where Trump and the campaign thought that they might take Minnesota. Now they're having to defend those states that they won back from, won from Hillary Clinton, and from the Democrats like Michigan and Wisconsin.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The five states that I was referring to where Biden in the Real Clear Politics Polling Average is ahead of President Trump are Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Arizona and in North Carolina it's a dead heat, it's a tie right now. If you dig into this the Fox News poll, Joe Biden's lead comes from the backing of Black voters, 79 points over Trump. That's not surprising. Young people, suburban areas, women, but also voters who are 65 years of age or over. In the meantime, President Trump is under performing his vote share among key groups, White Evangelical Christians, and rural voters, where he's not where he was in 2016, with those groups of voters. What changes between now and November, and how?</p><p>GURDON: Well, you know, to take the more elderly voters, 65 and older, you know, President Trump has suffered because they believe that his handling of the COVID pandemic has been sloppy and incoherent. And, of course, people of that age are the most vulnerable to the disease, so they are particularly focused on that. As you say, its various different sectors, Evangelicals, for example, now, the decision earlier this week by the Supreme Court relating to sex discrimination in the workplace, that cast a shadow over the claim that President Trump has been able to make for the past nearly four years that he is putting conservatives on the court who will be textualists. It was Neil Gorsuch, one of the two Trump nominees who wrote that decision.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>GURDON: And I think there's some dismay amongst conservatists on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yeah, just to be clear, it expanded workplace protections to the LGBTQ individual in the United States. Let's turn to Facebook, because again, this is bad news for technology companies, in my opinion. The company removed dozens of ads from President Trump's reelection campaign that included a red triangle symbol used by Nazi's to label prisoners in concentration camps. The symbol was used to identify Communists and far left individuals. Facebook says the company prohibits the use of hate group symbols in their advertisements, unless the ad is specifically condemning them. On the flip side, Antifa uses this symbol as well, but if you add up what is going on, where Google is working in coordination with NBC News to shut down conservative web sites, namely the Federalist. And then you also have Twitter getting into what is censorship of speech, particularly of conservatives, how does this play out?</p><p>GURDON: This is a very serious and growing concern amongst conservatives and frankly it should be a growing concern across the country. The social media are stepping in to limit and censor speech. You know, the thing about the red triangles, for example, that were taken down by Facebook, yes, they were originally used by the Nazi's, but they have been adopted to some extent, by Antifa. You know, I was looking online today, you can buy merchandise, such as bumper stickers and water bottles with the triangle and the Antifa name on them. So, it's not as though the Trump campaign is wrong that these have been used by Antifa, they may not be commonly used by Antifa, but even the New York Times says there's no indication that the Trump campaign was aware of the origins of the use of the red triangle. So, symbols are being taken down. It makes the Trump campaign look really bad, even though it's acknowledged by a paper which is obviously very strongly against President Trump, that there's no indication that he used them for that purpose.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joseph.</p><p>JOSEPH PINION, FOUNDER AND CEO, PINION ENTERPRISES: Yeah, I mean, just a quick question here, because I think to your point, we're getting into this kind of slippery slope place with social media platforms. I mean, it almost appears as if somehow, it's not even the symbol itself but who is allowed to use the symbol. The fact that, you know, Facebook is so concerned about hate groups, and yet we still have Isis fan groups. We still have fan groups for Antifa. We still have fan groups for, you know, every manner of organization that promotes hate, and yet somehow we cannot, say have a conversation around that hate that's already being promoted on the platform. So, to your point, you know, what are the things that Facebook can do, or should be thinking about, as we look at the regulations surrounding these social media platforms, and their decisions to try to editorialize their platforms?</p><p>GURDON: Well, you know, the debate is about whether or not Facebook should be a platform or it's a publisher. You know, if Facebook is controlling and stepping in to make editorial decisions, you know, then it should be fair minded, it should, Facebook and Google control an enormous amount of the information that people get and on which they base their political decisions. It has to be the case that in a country, in a democracy where there's free speech, that you don't have fantastically powerful corporations controlling the information and the opinions that people are allowed to read. And the news reporting they're allowed to read.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>GURDON: You know, Google, I think, has like 3/4 or 80 percent of the search market. That's a real monopoly and it's something which Congress needs to look at, and Congress needs to look at.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hugo, great to see you. Just to make, put an exclamation point on that, if Google, as in the case of the threat to The Federalist, in what Google did with Zero Hedge, if they de-platform you, they demonetize you, they deprive you of ad revenue and they essentially shut you down. It is, they put you out of business. That's what's going on. And so, they're, the power there is terrifically astonishing. But, right and left, they let it happen down in Congress. They let these companies get so big and now I think all speech is paying the price. Hugo Gurdon, great to see you this morning. Take care.</p><p>GURDON: Thanks very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll see you soon. Coming up, striking out. Why Commissioner Robert Manfred is rejecting the Major League Baseball Player's Unions pitch to get players back on the field. And going the extra mile, one Dallas principal driving more than 60 hours to give his graduating seniors a very sweet surprise. He joins me after the break.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bringing America together with an act of kindness to the class of 2020. A Dallas principal traveling across the state to hand delivery diplomas to each graduating senior. Joining me now is Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts Principal, Scott Rudes. Scott, what inspired you to do this?</p><p>SCOTT RUDES, PRINCIPAL, BOOKER T. WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE PERFORMING AND VISUAL ARTS: Well, thank you for having me. We had a Zoom call for our seniors several weeks ago, and when I was looking out at their faces there was such disappointment in their faces and I was already on the fence about going around and seeing them. And when I made the announcement that I was going to come visit them with their diplomas, there was just joy that just filled the Zoom call. And the rest is history.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, Scott, these students come from all over the state of Texas. So, talk about your journey across the state. Explain that.</p><p>RUDES: Sure thing. Our students come from all over the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, so I had a chance to visit all corners of the Metroplex, and travel over the course of ten days to visit each of the graduates personally.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What were the, what was the reaction from the students when you showed up at their homes?</p><p>RUDES: You know one of our core values at the school is to ignite joy, and that's exactly what I saw in the faces of our students and their parents. And each one of the stops was unique and different and just to get to see some happiness in the midst of this pandemic made every moment worthwhile.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I, promise not to tear up, but my whole life, I majored in art history when I was in college, and certainly a lot of people on social media mock me for that nowadays, given what I do, but I always have talked about the power of the visual and performing arts, when you're connecting with young people. When they're trying to find that one thing that they are great at. It not only like lifts up everyone's spirits, but you can really define a person's whole life if you can connect with them early on, which is what you're doing in your high school and find that hidden talent, if you will.</p><p>RUDES: Well, that's part of our vision is that these creative revolutionaries we have at our school are the students that are going to write the next chapter of our society. And certainly, as artists we see that creative spirit within each and every one of them put positioning them to be able to do that in the rest of their lives.</p><p>MCDOWELL: These graduates in the short run, what are they going on to do? Is it college? Are they entering the workforce even right after high school? What are their plans?</p><p>RUDES: We have student that are going directly into the music industry. Students that are practicing visual arts with amazing works of metal sculpture. And then we have students that are going off to the armed services and the academies and conservatories all over the country and even the world.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's so exciting. My nieces are in the arts and have gone to, you know, gone to high school and onto college for the performing arts, and the visual arts, so I understand this connection. And the power that these young people take with them as they head out into the world. Scott, thank you for doing what you're doing.</p><p>RUDES: Oh, you're so welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take care of yourself. Scott Rudes.</p><p>RUDES: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Principal of Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas. Coming up, striking out. Why Commission Robert Manfred is rejecting the Baseball Player Union's pitch to get players back on the field, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Time for morning buzz. First up, Major League Baseball players, the Union making an offer to owners including a 70 game regular season and expanded playoffs for 2020 and 2021. The proposal immediately rejected by Commissioner Rob Manfred. Mike, your reaction. Makes me hate baseball even more.</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ALTIUM WEALTH: Dagen, this is the wasted opportunity of a generation for Major League Baseball. There was just a special on the summer with McGwire and Sosa from 20 or so years ago about how after strike they brought everyone back. This was their opportunity to entice a generation of new fans, reengage old fans. They should be playing baseball right now, but instead they are letting money, you know, short term, get in front of the long term. This is a huge huge waste of opportunity. Really, I'm agreeing with you in hating baseball.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And go Nascar. They managed to get the cars and the driver back on the track in the middle of May. And next up, athletes always looking for that championship ring, but how about a ring for their health. When the NBA season begins next month in Walt Disney World, players will reportedly have the option of wearing a ring. It can give early warning signs of coronavirus. I think it's called the Oura, Brian your reaction.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE KINGS COLLEGE: Yeah, this is, now you've got a league that's actually got its stuff together. It is getting things done and they're giving players the options to wear this ring. The ring measures temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate. It can give you 95 percent success rate advance notice if you may contract coronavirus, so another one of these things that helps keep players safe and allows the league to get back at it. Unlike the MLB.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, and I will say that Tony Fauci does not see the NFL season happening unless the league adopts the NBA bubble plan so, he's throwing cold water on that. Finally, getting back to the movies. AMC announcing it will resume operations in 450 of its locations July 15 with new safety measures, reduced seating, new cleaning procedures, but no requirement for face masks. Joseph so, it's going, they're going to leave it up the people in the theatre, the patrons to police one another. That's going to end well.</p><p>PINION: Look, I mean, I can see a lot of popcorn being thrown around the theatre. But look, at the end of the day you're talking about an industry that has hundreds of millions of jobs. You're talking about close to $200 billion dollars in economic productivity. So, we need to put Americans back to work, but more importantly I think, we need to give people the opportunity to feel normal again. To engage in that all American pastime of being able to go to the movies. I think this is a good thing, but to your point, I think, you know, it's as the old boxing saying goes, protect yourself at all times, if people want to wear masks, let them wear masks, if they're unhappy with the type of people who aren't wearing masks, then I guess they won't go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They make so much money off concessions, you can't discourage people from eating popcorn and Milk Dud's, so that makes total sense. Joseph, thank you. Thank you all, those gentlemen. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020061901cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605K-CCM1-JB20-G0W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Crispin Porter + Bogusky will be in charge of Miller's top brand. Spots it has produced so far include ads that show rival brand Bud Light on trial for having \"less taste.\" \"For Miller Lite to continue its strong sales momentum, it's critical that we develop a clear, consistent and distinct voice for our flagship brand,\" Tom Long, Miller's chief marketing officer, said in a statement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUTOMOTIVE: GM awards big tech contracts</p><p>Detroit --- General Motors Corp. awarded billions of dollars in information technology contracts to Electronic Data Systems Corp., IBM Corp. and other companies Thursday in what EDS described as the largest commercial contract bidding process in the history of the tech industry. GM said it plans to spend approximately $15 billion on information technology over the next five years. About half that amount was awarded Thursday in five-year contracts for everything from vehicle design systems to manufacturing support to global supply chain management. GM's current 10-year contract with EDS expires in June, so GM began a rebidding process two years ago. GM spun off EDS in 1996, and the company has kept about two-thirds of GM's business.</p><p>ECONOMY: Key European rate unchanged</p><p>Frankfurt, Germany --- The European Central Bank held its key interest rate steady at 2.25 percent Thursday but laid the groundwork for a likely increase in March as concern about high housing and oil prices prompted a renewed warning of vigilance against inflation. \"We will continue to do whatever is needed in delivery of price stability,\" ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said. \"What I see in the short-term expectations of moves seems to be reasonable, taking into account all the data we have seen. We will exercise vigilance.\" Analysts were nearly unanimous in expecting that the bank would keep rates the same this month, but most expect an increase next month.</p><p>FINANCE: Feds retire brown envelopes</p><p>Warning: Don't toss out any unfamiliar white envelope without giving it a once-over. It might be a check from the government. Those familiar light brown envelopes carrying Social Security, tax refund and many other government checks to millions of Americans won't be arriving anymore. Instead, the Treasury Department is switching to white envelopes this month for most checks sent by its Financial Management Service. It's easier for mail-sorting machines to read printed bar codes on the white envelopes, explained FMS spokeswoman Alvina McHale. Supplemental Security Income payments will continue to be sent in blue envelopes, but most other payments will switch to white with USA printed in gray on the right side of the envelope. McHale added that the agency would actually prefer not to send out checks at all and is urging people to arrange for automatic deposit into their accounts. They can do that by calling 1-800-333-1795.</p><p>Feds attack credit-report scam</p><p>Bad Credit B Gone is one of 20 companies accused by government regulators of making promises to remove negative information from consumers' credit reports --- promises the companies can't keep. \"The fact is, they can't deliver on their claims. No one can legally remove accurate and timely information from your credit record,\" Eileen Harrington, deputy director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Thursday. Harrington announced a joint federal-state sweep against companies accused of running sham credit-repair operations. The crackdown, dubbed \"Project Credit Despair,\" also involved the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and state law enforcement agencies in Louisiana, Tennessee, Ohio, California, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky and Florida. Ten of the cases were from Louisiana. Susan Jandle, a state review examiner with the Office of Financial Institutions, said many consumers in Louisiana are behind on mortgages, car payments and other loans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>FOOD / BEVERAGES: ConAgra to sell meat unit</p><p>ConAgra Foods Inc., one of the nation's largest packaged-foods companies, said Thursday that it will sell off its refrigerated meats business. The unit generated $1.9 billion in sales last year. The sale includes 15 plants in nine states and about 6,000 employees of the Omaha, Neb.-based company, and ConAgra plans to part with its Armour, Butterball and Eckrich brands. ConAgra spokesman Chris Kircher said the company expects that most of those 6,000 employees would become employees of the new owner after a sale. The sale of the refrigerated meat business is one of the first major changes ConAgra's president and chief executive, Gary Rodkin, has made since joining the company in October. </p><p>Del Monte leaving Hawaii</p><p>After 90 years in the islands, Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. says it will cease pineapple operations in Hawaii in a little more than two years. Del Monte said it was no longer economically feasible to grow pineapple in Hawaii because it can be produced for less in other parts of the world. \"It would be cheaper for Del Monte to buy pineapples on the open market than for the company to grow, market and distribute Hawaiian pineapple,\" the company said in a statement Wednesday. Del Monte also cited difficulty in obtaining a long-term lease extension with landowner Campbell Estate. But Campbell Estate Vice President Bert Hatton said Del Monte declined a lease extension at the then-current rent structure in 2001. The estate also offered to sell the pineapple land in three separate proposals, but Del Monte rejected those, Hatton said. Planting at Del Monte's Kunia plantation on Oahu was set to end Feb. 19 and the current crop will produce fruit through mid-2008, the company said. Fred Galdones, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 142, said about the 700 pineapple workers who will lose their jobs. Galdones said he was also concerned with the future of the two remaining pineapple companies in Hawaii, Dole Food Hawaii and Maui Pineapple Co.</p><p>LEGAL: 4 ex-insurance execs indicted</p><p>Three former executives at Berkshire Hathaway's General Re insurance unit and a former American International Group executive have been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of fraud and conspiracy, the Justice Department announced Thursday. The former executives conspired to make AIG's finances appear better than they were, the government contended in the indictment returned Wednesday by a grand jury in Norfolk, Va. Those charged are: Ronald Ferguson, who was General Re's chief executive; Elizabeth Monrad, the former chief financial officer; Robert Graham, the company's former assistant general counsel; and Christian Milton, who ran AIG's reinsurance division. At least two of the defendants are disputing the charges, their attorneys said. Each defendant, if convicted on all 13 criminal counts of conspiracy, fraud and making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission, could face a maximum 95 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines.</p><p>Anti-tobacco verdict upheld</p><p>Salem, Ore. --- The Oregon Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a $79.5 million punitive damages award to the family of an Oregon smoker who died of lung cancer, saying the amount isn't excessive given the \"reprehensible\" conduct of tobacco giant Philip Morris in marketing cigarettes. Philip Morris called the award \"grossly excessive\" and said it would appeal further. The decision upholds a lower court ruling and responds to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that asked Oregon courts to consider whether the award in the lawsuit against Philip Morris USA Inc., a unit of Altria Group Inc., was excessive. The state Supreme Court said it was not, given \"such extreme and outrageous circumstances.\"</p><p>Witness: Enron misled public</p><p>Houston --- The first government witness against two former Enron Corp. chiefs said Thursday that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling gave Wall Street incomplete or misleading information about the earnings of a highly touted business unit in early 2001. But Mark Koenig, Enron's former investor relations chief, did not claim that Skilling knew what he was doing or planned it. Koenig also told jurors in his second day of testimony that he pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting securities fraud in 2004 because he helped mislead analysts by minimizing losses or failing to accurately describe revenue. \"It's clear to me that had that information been known to investors, large or small, they would not have made those same investment decisions,\" he said. Skilling and Enron founder Kenneth Lay are charged with fraud, conspiracy and other charges for allegedly claiming publicly that Enron was healthy when they knew otherwise. Both have pleaded not guilty.</p><p>MANUFACTURING: Delta Apparel's profit doubles</p><p>Duluth-based Delta Apparel's fiscal second-quarter earnings doubled on a 17 percent increase in sales, driven by the acquisition last August of Junkfood Clothing Co. Net income in the quarter ended Dec. 31 increased to $2.4 million, or 27 cents a share, from $1.2 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier. Sales climbed to $57.7 million from $49.2 million. Looking ahead, the maker and distributor of branded and private-label T-shirts and fleece products said it continues to expect basic per-share earnings of $1.71 to $1.80 for the fiscal year ending July 1. That compares with $1.35 in fiscal 2005, which included one-time gains totaling 34 cents a share from the sale of a plant in South Carolina and the reversal of a foreign earnings tax liability. Sales are forecast to rise to $265 million to $275 million. The company posted sales of $228 million in fiscal 2005.</p><p>Georgia Gulf's net falls 22.4%</p><p>Atlanta-based Georgia Gulf Corp. said its fourth-quarter net income fell 22.4 percent from a year earlier because of operational disruptions caused by Hurricane Rita, along with higher energy and raw material costs. The chemicals maker said earnings dropped to $18.7 million, or 55 cents a share, from $24.1 million, or 71 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 59 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial. Georgia Gulf said the impact of Hurricane Rita reduced earnings by 22 cents a share. Sales declined 12.2 percent to $518.9 million. For the full year, Georgia Gulf said earnings fell 9.8 percent to $95.5 million, or $2.79 a share, from $105.9 million, or $3.17 a share, in the prior year. Sales rose 3.1 percent to $2.27 billion.</p><p>REAL ESTATE: Mortgage rates increase</p><p>Mortgage rates around the country went up this week, with rates on 30-year mortgages climbing to their highest point since late December. Mortgage company Freddie Mac, in its weekly nationwide survey released Thursday, reported that rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 6.23 percent for the week. That was up from 6.12 percent last week and was the highest rate since the week ended Dec. 22. Rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, a popular choice for refinancing a home mortgage, averaged 5.81 percent this week, up from 5.70 percent last week. One-year adjustable-rate mortgages increased to 5.33 percent, compared with 5.20 percent last week. Rates on five-year hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages rose to 5.87 percent this week, from 5.75 percent last week.</p><p>RETAIL: Winn-Dixie revises bonus plan</p><p>Bankrupt supermarket chain Winn-Dixie lowered the proposed retention bonus that President and CEO Peter Lynch would receive by almost half after receiving objections from creditors. In court documents filed Wednesday, Winn-Dixie said creditors expressed concern about the $2 million bonus that Lynch was to receive for agreeing to stay through Dec. 31. The new proposal drops the payment to $1.15 million for Lynch to stay through Aug. 31. The money would be on top of his $900,000 annual salary. Lynch would have to repay the bonus if he is fired before Aug. 31 or leaves without a good reason. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Jerry A. Funk is scheduled to consider the motion at a hearing next Thursday.</p><p>TRADE: South Korea, U.S. launch talks</p><p>South Korean cars, cellphones and other consumer goods should drop in price if the United States and its Asian partner are successful in negotiating the biggest free-trade deal since America tore down barriers with Mexico and Canada. The negotiations between the United States and its seventh-largest trading partner are expected to take at least a year, and it's still an open question whether they will succeed. There is strong resistance, especially among South Korean farmers, to giving up some protections, and there have been violent street protests. From an economic standpoint, the deal would dwarf any previous U.S. free-trade agreements except the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement linking the United States with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>TRANSPORTATION: Northwest details cost-cut plan</p><p>New York --- Northwest Airlines wants to replace 30 percent of flight attendants on its international flights with non-U.S. flight attendants, roughly 800 people, to cut costs so that it can emerge from bankruptcy, a company executive testified in a New York bankruptcy court Thursday. Northwest, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in September, seeks to save $1.4 billion in wage and benefit costs. Thursday was the seventh day of hearings devoted to the airline's request to toss out collective bargaining agreements with the unions. \"Outsourcing would be a misnomer,\" said Michael Becker, Northwest's senior vice president of human resources and labor relations, in response to a cross-examination by Thomas Ciantra, an attorney for the pilots union. Becker was referring to the carrier's plans to replace U.S. flight attendants with foreign workers.</p><p>AirTran's traffic rises</p><p>AirTran Airways said passenger traffic rose 25.7 percent in January, compared with the same month a year earlier. Capacity, as measured by seat-miles flown, rose 28.3 percent. The discount airline, which has its main hub in Atlanta and its headquarters in Orlando, sold 63.8 percent of its seats for the month. That compared with 65.1 percent a year earlier.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLJNL-56005952</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLJNL2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4J60-JS50-TX2J-43CY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8379</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2359\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</copyright><publicationName>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1203\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>February 3, 2006 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Briefs</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001PIQ</classCode><className>MILLER BREWING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001SE5</classCode><className>HP ENTERPRISE SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0001O0E</classCode><className>CRISPIN PORTER &amp;

Without needing to even consider the issue of gun rights, federal courts are recognizing that boycotts enforced by government power can menace free speech and free association.</p><p><br/>In December, a federal court in California granted a preliminary injunction against a Los Angeles ordinance requiring city contractors to disclose any business links to, or memberships in, the gun group. It found the evidence \u201coverwhelming\u201d that the city\u2019s intent in passing the law was \u201cto suppress the message of the NRA.\u201d\u2026<br/>Controversial and unpopular speech is protected speech; officials cannot yank a contract from some business, or threaten to, just because it has donated to, or partnered in some venture with, the Sierra Club, the NAACP, or the NRA.<br/>Lawyers for Los Angeles tried to defend their ordinance by saying all it did was require disclosures from contractors, which wouldn\u2019t necessarily amount to punishing or chilling speech. But this sort of First Amendment claim comes down to a question of intent. And\u00a0the court found\u00a0that the city\u2019s lawmakers had made their intent to suppress speech and association utterly clear. They had done so in the text of\u00a0the ordinance itself, in its legislative history, and in the statements made at the time by its chief sponsor, Councilmember Mitch O\u2019Farrell.<br/>New York Times:\u00a0Court Weighs Ban on Secret Recordings of Public Officials<br/>By The Associated Press<br/>A Massachusetts prosecutor defended Wednesday a state ban on secret audio recordings of police and government officials, asking an appeals court to overturn a decision that found the prohibition unconstitutional.<br/>At a hearing before the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals, free speech groups countered that such recordings are protected by the First Amendment and that Massachusetts\u2019 law is out of step with national norms, especially in an era when nearly everyone has a recording device in their pocket\u2026<br/>A panel of three judges is expected to decide the case later\u2026<br/>State Attorney General Maura Healey\u2019s office, which is representing Rollins in the appeal, cites in its legal brief a number of hypothetical scenarios where secret recordings of public officials might harm average citizens\u2026<br/>But the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, which is representing two Boston residents who frequently record police activity, argued the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment \u201cunambiguously\u201d protects the right to peacefully record and observe police activity in a way that does not interfere\u2026<br/>\u201cThe government should have an interest in encouraging members of the public to create accurate records of what police officers say in public when they think no one is recording them,\u201d the ACLU wrote in its legal brief\u2026<br/>[Project Veritas] argued\u2026\u201dMassachusetts should welcome \u2013 not imprison \u2013 citizens using technology to advance speech.\u201d<br/>San Diego Union-Tribune:\u00a0Evans Hotels loses in high-profile court battle with labor unions<br/>By Lori Weisberg<br/>[A] federal court judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit by San Diego-based Evans Hotels accusing local labor unions of extortion and bribery in their efforts to unionize the hospitality industry\u2026<br/>\u201cWe are gratified that the judge recognized Evans Hotel\u2019s lawsuit as an attempt to stifle our union\u2019s First Amendment speech and political participation,\u201d said Brigette Browning, president of Unite Here Local 30, which represents local hospitality workers\u2026<br/>In their defense against the lawsuit, the unions had argued that what Evans Hotels alleged was extortion and racketeering was legislative lobbying protected by the First Amendment. Hayes agreed. Evans, he said, failed to make its case that the unions\u2019 conduct fell outside the protections of the \u201cpetition clause\u201d of the First Amendment.<br/>\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit will burden Defendants\u2019 petitioning activity,\u201d wrote Hayes, who\u00a0held a hearing in October\u00a0on the unions\u2019 motion to dismiss. \u201cPlaintiffs do not allege facts from which the Court can infer that Defendants engaged in non-petitioning activity. Plaintiffs do not allege facts from which the Court can infer that Defendants\u2019 petitioning conduct was a sham.\u201d\u2026<br/>Said Hayes, \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations are conclusory and insufficient to state a bribery claim.\u201d Citing a federal court case, he wrote, \u201cPayments to public officials in the form of . . . campaign contributions, is a legal and well-accepted part of our political process.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOJ</emphasis><br/>Reason:\u00a0Is the FBI Snooping on Political Groups and Ideological Publications?<br/>By C.J. Ciaramella<br/>The Cato Institute\u2026 is calling on Congress to investigate whether the FBI is spying on it and other domestic political groups after public records requests raised the possibility that the Bureau has files on Cato and others.\u00a0<br/>Patrick Eddington, a research fellow at Cato, has submitted more than 200 [FOIA] requests for FBI files on political advocacy groups, civil liberties organizations, think tanks, and publications across the political spectrum.<br/>For about two dozen of those requests so far, the FBI said it could neither confirm or deny whether it had collected national security or foreign intelligence records on the groups\u2026<br/>The FBI has\u00a0a long and sordid history\u00a0of spying on dissident political groups, from early 20th century socialists and labor organizers, to civil rights leaders and\u00a0post-9/11 environmentalists and peace activists,\u00a0to\u00a0Black Lives Matter protesters\u2026<br/>Eddington says that any such surveillance is inimical to freedom of speech.<br/>\u201cAnytime [the FBI] is engaged in gathering that kind of data on news organizations or on domestic groups that are exercising their First Amendment rights, that activity should be expressly prohibited in the absence of a genuine criminal predicate,\u201d Eddington says. \u201cIt should absolutely be prohibited.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Independent Groups</emphasis><br/>Axios:\u00a0Leonard Leo to shape new conservative network<br/>By Jonathan Swan and Alayna Treene<br/>Conservative powerhouse Leonard Leo tells Axios that he\u2019ll step aside from the daily running of the Federalist Society to focus on a new venture \u2013 inspired by Arabella Advisers on the left \u2013 that will funnel big money and expertise across the conservative movement\u2026<br/>Leo is considered one of the most powerful conservatives in the country, playing a key role in shaping President Trump\u2019s selections for the Supreme Court and raising hundreds of millions of dollars to fill the nation\u2019s courts with conservative judges.<br/>One of the first projects will be a \u201cminimum of $10 million issue advocacy campaign focusing on judges in the 2020 cycle,\u201d Leo told Axios.<br/>The new venture will be called CRC Advisors. Leo will remain co-chair of the Federalist Society\u2019s board.<br/>Behind the scenes: Leo told Axios that he and his business partner, conservative communications executive Greg Mueller, studied tax filings that led them to Arabella, a little-known yet powerful consulting firm that advises liberal donors and nonprofits about where to spend their money\u2026<br/>The new venture will go beyond the anonymous money networks they\u2019ve already built and weaponized in the conservative legal movement movement.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Facebook to Keep Targeted Political Ads but Will Give Users More Control<br/>By Emily Glazer<br/>In a break with other tech companies,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Inc.\u00a0said it wouldn\u2019t limit how political ads are targeted to potential voters, but would instead give users tools to see fewer of those ads on its platforms.<br/>The move by Facebook, which says a private company shouldn\u2019t decide how campaigns are able to reach potential voters, is at odds with how other tech firms are approaching political ads leading up to the 2020 election.<br/>The social-media giant also announced changes it says will boost transparency about how political ads are shared.<br/>The company based its policy \u201con the principle that people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public,\u201d according to a memo from Rob Leathern, Facebook\u2019s director of product management. \u201cThis does not mean that politicians can say whatever they like in advertisements on Facebook.\u201d<br/>The memo said all Facebook users have to follow its community standards, which ban hate speech, harmful content and content designed to intimidate voters or stop them from exercising their right to vote\u2026<br/>Facebook said its new control feature for political ads will roll out in the U.S. early this summer on Facebook and Instagram. It will later expand\u2026<br/>The company said seeing fewer political and social-issue ads was a common request from users.<br/>New York Times:\u00a0Facebook Says It Won\u2019t Back Down From Allowing Lies in Political Ads<br/>By\u00a0Mike Isaac<br/>Facebook said on Thursday that it would not make any major changes to its political advertising policies, which allow lies in ads, despite pressure from lawmakers who say the company is abdicating responsibility\u2026<br/>The company also said it would not end so-called microtargeting for political ads, which lets campaigns home in on a sliver of Facebook\u2019s users \u2013 a tactic that critics say is ideal for spreading divisive or misleading information.<br/>Political advertising cuts to the heart of Facebook\u2019s outsize role in society, and the company has found itself squeezed between liberal critics who want it to do a better job of policing its various social media platforms and conservatives who say their views are being unfairly muzzled\u2026<br/>Facebook officials have repeatedly said significant changes to its rules for political or issue ads could\u00a0harm the ability of smaller, less well-funded organizations\u00a0to raise money and organize across the network.<br/>Instead of overhauling its policies, Facebook has made small tweaks\u2026<br/>Facebook also will add a feature that allows users to see fewer campaign and political issue ads in their news feeds\u2026<br/>For now, Facebook appears willing to risk disinformation in support of unfettered speech.<br/>New York Times:\u00a0Why Politicians Get a License to Lie<br/>By Charlie Warzel<br/>On Monday, Facebook\u00a0announced a new policy\u00a0to ban artificial intelligence-generated \u201cdeepfakes\u201d as well as videos \u201cedited or synthesized \u2026 in ways that aren\u2019t apparent to an average person.\u201d\u2026<br/>But the new policy won\u2019t, for example, cover subtly edited videos like last year\u2019s slowed down\u00a0viral Nancy Pelosi clip. And politicians and their ads remain off limits to Facebook\u2019s third-party fact checkers. A company spokesman told me Tuesday that if Facebook determines a politician has shared manipulated media in an ad, Facebook will remove it. But, as far as I can tell, bogus content \u2013 even outright lies \u2013 is still allowed, as long as it isn\u2019t manipulated by artificial intelligence.<br/>And the company left a big loophole: Facebook will not censor political speech if it is in the public interest to see it. \u201cIf a politician posts organic content that violates our manipulated media policy, we would evaluate it by weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm. Our newsworthy policy applies to all content on Facebook, not just content posted by politicians,\u201d the spokesman wrote in an email.<br/>In an effort to assuage the public on political disinformation, Facebook has only muddied the waters. Would Facebook allow distribution of a deepfaked video if it were shared by the president as rationale for the bombing of Iran? Such a hypothetical post would certainly be newsworthy, though such a video would be a clear violation of Facebook\u2019s rules.\u00a0<br/>The Hill:\u00a0Lawmakers voice skepticism over Facebook\u2019s deepfake ban<br/>By\u00a0Chris Mills Rodrigo<br/>Facebook\u2019s global policy chief faced tough questions before a House panel on Wednesday as lawmakers voiced skepticism over the company\u2019s efforts to crack down on manipulated videos known as deepfakes ahead of the 2020 elections\u2026<br/>Rep.\u00a0Jan Schakowsky\u00a0(D-Ill.) opened the hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce by slamming Facebook\u2019s new policy.<br/>\u201cBig Tech failed to respond to the grave threats posed by deepfakes, as evidenced by Facebook scrambling to announce a new policy that strikes me as wholly inadequate,\u201d Schakowsky, the subcommittee chairwoman, said\u2026<br/>The social media giant\u2019s vice president of global policy management, Monika Bickert, stressed during Wednesday\u2019s testimony that the new rule is an addition to a broad set of\u00a0existing\u00a0community standards intended to target disinformation\u2026<br/>Democrats on the committee suggested that more stringent regulations would be necessary to deal with deepfakes, but some of their colleagues across the aisle expressed concern about stifling innovation and expression with new regulations.<br/>\u201cDeepfakes and disinformation can be handled with innovation and empowering people with more information,\u201d subcommittee ranking member\u00a0Cathy McMorris Rodgers\u00a0(R-Wash.) said in her opening remarks. \u201cIt makes far more productive outcomes when people can make the best decisions for themselves, rather than relying on the government to make decisions for them.\u201d<br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Clinton Backer at Facebook Debunks Clinton Claims<br/>By James Freeman<br/>The New York Times reports that it has obtained a recent internal memorandum from senior\u00a0Facebook\u00a0executive Andrew Bosworth. According to the text of the\u00a0memo\u00a0published by the Times, Mr. Bosworth throws cold water on a favorite conspiracy theory of the political left\u2026.<br/>Writes Mr. Bosworth:<br/>$100,000 in ads on Facebook can be a powerful tool but it can\u2019t buy you an American election, especially when the candidates themselves are putting up several orders of magnitude more money on the same platform (not to mention other platforms).<br/>Instead, the Russians worked to exploit existing divisions in the American public for example by hosting Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter protest events in the same city on the same day. The people who shows (sic) up to those events were real even if the event coordinator was not. Likewise the groups of Americans being fed partisan content was real even if those feeding them were not. The organic reach they managed sounds very big in absolute terms and unfortunately humans are bad at contextualizing big numbers. Whatever reach they managed represents an infinitesimal fraction of the overall content people saw in the same period of time and certainly over the course of an election across all media.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>The Atlantic:\u00a0The Real Power of Bloomberg\u2019s Money<br/>By Edward-Isaac Dovere<br/>Part of Bloomberg\u2019s presidential sales pitch is that his personal wealth-he\u2019s worth an estimated $56 billion-makes him incorruptible. Not only is he unbribeable; being rich enough to never take political contributions, he can assume office unbeholden to donors. But Bloomberg is so rich that he shifts the direction of potential influence: Donors may not be able to buy influence, but he can use his wealth to push things in the directions he wants\u2026<br/>Bloomberg spent extensively as mayor of New York\u2026The money he spent led to fewer protests, and deals that were easier to make.<br/>Think of his money, one Bloomberg aide told me, as powering a skunkworks for city innovations. It allowed him to reduce political risk, because he could foot the bill for policy experimentation himself, instead of leaving it to the taxpayers\u2026<br/>In short, the money Bloomberg spent in office helped him to be more popular and successful as mayor than he otherwise would have been. Much of this money can\u2019t be tracked by the usual means of measuring funds in politics: campaign-finance disclosures\u2026<br/>He has unapologetically hamstrung the huge news organization he owns, Bloomberg News, which has gone from publishing implicitly pro-Bloomberg 2020 editorials in the weeks before he made his run official to suspending the editorial board and having many of the same people who were writing them also move over to the campaign; the political reporters there worry about not being taken seriously anymore. Using the standards by which other candidates are judged, all this would be considered campaign expenses or hidden costs.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>The Stranger:\u00a0Durkan Supports Capping Super PAC Donations and Blocking Amazon from City Elections<br/>By Lester Black<br/>[T]he wave of Super PAC cash in Seattle elections may soon crest.<br/>In a sign of growing momentum for reigning in PAC money, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan\u2019s office tells\u00a0The Stranger\u00a0that she\u2019ll be supporting a new council bill, titled the\u00a0Clean Campaigns Act, that would set tight limits on the ability of Super PACs to raise cash. The legislation would also block multinational companies like Amazon from spending in city elections entirely\u2026<br/>The proposed law is currently working its way through council chambers and some aspects of the act could see a full council vote as early as next week\u2026<br/>The Super PAC donation limits would put Seattle at the forefront of campaign finance reform. According to legal experts, the only other place in the country that has set limits on Super PAC donation limits is St. Petersburg, Florida. That city\u2019s law,\u00a0passed in 2017, has not been challenged in court but Seattle would likely be sued if it passes its own Super PAC regulations.<br/>The Seattle law could become a test case for Super PAC regulations nationwide if it makes it to the Supreme Court, and Gonz\u00e1lez has the support of multiple constitutional law experts who say the law could survive a court challenge.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The post Daily Media Links 1/9 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-86161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY6-FCR1-DY1R-B2CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIERRA CLUB</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Wetch, now pending before the Supreme Court:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Petitioner is an attorney who is required by state law to join and to fund a state bar association as a condition of practicing law. He challenged both compulsory membership and the compulsory funding of the association\u2019s political activities under the First Amendment. This Court vacated and remanded the previous judgment against him for consideration in light of\u00a0Janus v. AFSCME\u2026\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions presented are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Are laws mandating membership in a state bar association subject to the same \u201cexacting\u201d First Amendment scrutiny that the Court prescribed for mandatory public-sector union fees in\u00a0Janus?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Does it violate the First Amendment to presume that an attorney is willing to pay for a bar association\u2019s \u201cnon-chargeable\u201d political and ideological speech, unless and until that attorney takes steps to opt out?&lt;/li&gt;</p><p>&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The second question, as you might gather, is narrower than the first.) You can also see the responses and the reply brief\u00a0here. It will be interesting to see whether the Court agrees to hear the case; for Will Baude\u2019s and my thinking on the issue, see pp. 196-98 of our Harvard Law Review article, \u201cCompelled Subsidies and the First Amendment.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable: IRS Private Letter Ruling on Nonprofit and PAC Raises Concerns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Yosef Ziffer and Christopher N. Moran&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRS private letter ruling 202005020 (PLR), released on January 31, addresses a multi entity structure involving a nonprofit and its wholly owned subsidiary that sought to form a political action committee (PAC). Based on the IRS\u2019s conclusions, the PLR may raise concerns for other nonprofits that utilize similar structures\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS ruled that the subsidiary\u2019s operation of the PAC would constitute impermissible participation or intervention in a political campaign by the nonprofit parent. The IRS further concluded that the nonprofit\u2019s provision of services and mailing lists to the subsidiary and the PAC would likewise constitute impermissible political campaign participation or intervention by the nonprofit. The IRS also determined that the shared services agreement between the nonprofit and the for-profit subsidiary caused the nonprofit to be operated for private interests and did not further Section 501(c)(3) purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations Now: IRS Urged To Complete Donor Disclosure Rollback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chris Vest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS took a step closer to rolling back donor disclosure requirements for certain tax-exempt organizations after hearing from witnesses at an agency hearing on February 7\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS proposed the change because it said it doesn\u2019t need the information to enforce the tax code and it protects donors\u2019 information from inadvertently being disclosed for public inspection. The agency\u2019s first attempt to roll back donor disclosure requirements was struck down last year by the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana because the IRS did not go through a notice and comment period before making the change. This time, the agency received roughly 8,400 comments on the new rules and 16 witnesses testified at the hearing last week, mostly conservative groups in support of the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Bloomberg News\u2019s Dilemma: How to Cover a Boss Seeking the Presidency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Michael M. Grynbaum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Micklethwait, the editor in chief of Bloomberg News, walked into his Washington bureau on a Friday morning in December with a daunting task: explaining to his political reporters how to cover a presidential campaign when the boss is a candidate\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, the pressure and unease inside Bloomberg News have only increased. Journalists who hoped Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s candidacy would prove short-lived have watched him vault to the upper tier of the Democratic race. Now there are discussions about what a President Bloomberg could mean for a news organization already grappling with a perceived conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courthouse News: Kentucky Students in Viral Encounter Sue Over Tweets From Writers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kevin Koeninger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Kentucky Catholic school students involved in last year\u2019s videotaped confrontation with a Native American elder at the Lincoln Memorial filed a defamation lawsuit Tuesday against New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman and others, claiming their tweets about the incident sparked harassment and threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\u00a0complaint, filed in Kenton County Circuit Court, comes on the heels of a confidential\u00a0settlement\u00a0between Nick Sandmann \u2013 the Covington Catholic student at the center of the controversy \u2013 and CNN, which was announced last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Attorney General Barr blasts Big Tech, raising prospect that firms could be held liable for dangerous, viral content online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tony Romm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General William P.

Politicians have followed people online, and over the past year, their ads have appeared on popular platforms such as Roku, the maker of hardware and software that powers Internet-connected TVs, and lesser-known options like Tubi, which offers ad-supported movie streaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nothing requires these fast-growing digital providers to disclose whom these ads targeted and who viewed them. The absence of federal transparency rules stands in stark contrast with traditional TV broadcasters, such as ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, which for decades have been required to maintain limited public files about political ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: The only surefire way to stop foreign interference in our elections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Augusta Dell\u2019Omo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the presidential election approaches, American fears of foreign interference are only going to grow. Federal and local officials worry about everything from Russian disinformation campaigns to conspiracy theories to deep fakes amplified by bots and unwitting Americans. The indictments of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, both born in the Soviet Union, for allegedly funneling illegal contributions into a Trump-supporting political action committee also amplify fears about the intrusion of dark money into American politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under threat from hackers, misinformation and fake news, it is tempting to view foreign interference as a problem and product of the digital age \u2013 aided and abetted by a president who has seemed to welcome it. But foreign meddling in American elections \u2013 and international interest in their outcomes \u2013 is hardly new, and the past provides lessons on how we can combat the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Bloomberg\u2019s immense spending gets him 30,000 online ads a minute, and a whole lot more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kevin Schaul, Kevin Uhrmacher and Anu Narayanswamy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Google and Facebook have served up 2 billion Bloomberg ads, which works out to 30,000 a minute\u2026\u00a0Since joining the race in November, he has outspent all other candidates combined on Google by more than $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But digital platforms like Google and Facebook represent just a slice of his ad budget. When combined with television, Bloomberg\u2019s spending is truly staggering. We\u2019ve done our best to contextualize it below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Mike Bloomberg Is Hacking Your Attention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Charlie Warzel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Bloomberg and his presidential campaign respect the fundamental equation governing the modern internet: Shamelessness and conflict equal attention. And attention equals power\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting this week the Bloomberg campaign enlisted the help of a number of popular meme-makers to create sponsored Instagram content for the candidate. The rollout was extremely effective, generating substantial praise and disdain. The ratio doesn\u2019t really matter \u2013 what matters is that people were talking\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of these tactics is a genuine shamelessness that fits perfectly not just with politics but also the internet at large. Mr. Bloomberg is unapologetic about \u2013 and unafraid to hide \u2013 the money he\u2019s spending.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Democrats better be ready for the answer when they accuse Bloomberg of \u2018buying\u2019 an election&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jennifer Rubin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a safe bet that at least one Democratic presidential candidate or moderator at the Nevada debate Wednesday night will accuse former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg of \u201cbuying the election\u201d or \u201cbuying his way onto the debate stage.\u201d They better be prepared for the response, which might go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo one buys an election in America. You guys assume voters are helpless pawns, unable to resist TV ads. If that were the case, Tom Steyer would be on the stage\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as campaign finance rules are the way they are today, President Trump is going to keep raising money from his rich friends \u2013 some of whom he then pardons. I will not allow him the opportunity to go unchecked as he tries to flood social media, TV and radio with disinformation.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Center for Public Integrity: With Michael Bloomberg, Democrats Smash Against Their Own Anti-Big Money Firewall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Dave Levinthal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0tweetsertion\u00a0that Bloomberg is \u201cillegally buying the Democrat nomination,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s historic level of self-funded campaign spending is perfectly legal. Even Trump-like.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg is a post-Citizens United\u00a0candidate, his own\u00a0super PAC. As such, he can do what other billionaire-bashing Democrats cannot: use his\u00a0wealth of $62 billion\u00a0to eclipse the massive financial resources of Trump, who\u2019s been running for re-election since the\u00a0day of his inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligencer: The Price of a Bloomberg Nomination Is Too Damn High&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Eric Levitz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, and Amy Klobuchar are not on my wavelength ideologically. I find much of the former South Bend mayor\u2019s rhetoric vacuous, the former vice-president\u2019s oratory unnervingly incoherent, and the Minnesota senator\u2019s history of abusing her staff unacceptable. But none of them are running campaigns that make an open mockery of our nation\u2019s democratic aspirations, or the Democratic Party\u2019s purported opposition to plutocracy. And none of them could substitute personal wealth for the support of the Democratic coalition upon taking power. The AFL-CIO will have influence over a Klobuchar administration\u2019s labor regulations and NLRB appointments because Amy Klobuchar will need its support when she runs for reelection. The ACLU and Movement for Black Lives will have some voice in a Buttigieg White House because the former small-town mayor will not be able to afford forfeiting the backing of any part of his party\u2019s base. The reason to \u201cvote blue, no matter who\u201d is that you are not just electing a candidate, but a coalition. A Bernie Sanders administration will surely do many important things differently than a Joe Biden one. But they would also do many things similarly, because they will be dependent on the support of almost all of the same constituencies. That won\u2019t necessarily be true of President Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esquire: Stacey Abrams Is Wrong to Compare Bloomberg\u2019s $350-Million Spending Spree to Campaigning With a Dog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jack Holmes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way [Michael Bloomberg] has gained ground is by picking up support from Democratic leaders, including prominent black Democrats. That group seems to include Stacey Abrams, one of the breakout stars of liberal politics coming out of her narrow (and fairly suspicious) loss in the 2018 Georgia governor\u2019s race. Abrams has not endorsed Bloomberg, but she did choose to defend his huge and unprecedented campaign spending Monday on The View. This may have something to do with the fact Bloomberg gave $5 million to Fair Fight Political Action Committee, the massive voter registration and voting-rights protection initiative Abrams is spearheading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: Ex-Obama aides say Bloomberg-Obama relationship more \u2018complicated\u2019 than his ads portray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Zack Budryk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple former Obama administration personnel are pushing back against TV spots by former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg that they say falsely imply Obama is backing Bloomberg\u2019s presidential bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former National Security Council spokesman and Pod Save America co-host Tommy Vietor tweeted Tuesday, \u201cIt\u2019s jarring to see all these Bloomberg ads that suggest Obama has endorsed him, especially considering how\u2026perfunctory his endorsement of Obama was back in 2012.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe tweeted that he had been asked \u201cwhy Barack Obama chose Bloomberg over the rest of the field,\u201d though the former president has made no 2020 endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: Warren leaves door open for super PAC spending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Maggie Severns and Alex Thompson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign denounced big money\u2019s growing role in the Democratic primary in a statement Wednesday \u2013 but stopped short of specifically calling for the shutdown of Persist PAC, a new pro-Warren super PAC, after the group popped up with a major ad campaign benefiting her\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSenator Warren\u2019s position hasn\u2019t changed. Since day one of this campaign, she has made clear that she thinks all of the candidates should lock arms together and say we don\u2019t want super PACs and billionaires to be deciding our Democratic nominee,\u201d Warren campaign spokesman Chris Hayden said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NJ.com: Murphy wants ethics reforms that would hold your N.J. lawmakers more accountable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matt Arco and Brent Johnson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gov.\u00a0Phil Murphy\u00a0on Wednesday threw his support behind sweeping proposals to reform ethics in New Jersey state government, with a focus on disclosing more information on who influences politicians and changing rules to hold state lawmakers more accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures would force lobbyists to reveal who they hire, require lawmakers to disclose their finances, limit gifts lawmakers can accept, open the state Legislature to public-records requests, and increase how long legislation must be public before it can be voted on, among other changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLive: Ballot language approved for proposal to \u2018change the culture\u2019 of lobbying in Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Malachi Barrett&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of a ballot initiative to regulate how lobbyists interact with lawmakers hope to start collecting signatures by the March 10 presidential primary following approval from a state board\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal aims to change the Michigan Constitution to make lobbying efforts more transparent and curb the influence lobbyists have on the legislative process, said Progress Michigan Executive Director Lonnie Scott\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal also requires Michigan residents who make paid public communications on legislative issues to file a report with the Secretary of State. This does not apply to constituents who communicate with their legislators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of people who aren\u2019t lobbyists or public officials caused some disagreement among the Board of State Canvassers Wednesday. The board unanimously approved the petition summary after making several revisions\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans on the board said the ballot summary language should be revised to alert the general public that they would be affected too. Two additional drafts were created after Republicans expressed concerns that the language didn\u2019t reflect how the proposal regulates the speech of Michigan residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inforum: Proposed legislation would expose North Dakotans who donate to private advocacy groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Rob Port&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us agree that political campaigns promoting a candidate or issue on the ballot should be required to make timely and thorough disclosures of their finances to the public\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about donations to private groups that speak out on policy issues and elections?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, those groups face few disclosure requirements, but draft legislation to be introduced for North Dakota\u2019s 2021 legislative session by state Rep. Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo, would change that\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Rep. Hanson gets her way, North Dakotans, who donate anything more than a trivial amount of money to them in a given political cycle, would have their private information exposed to public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courthouse News: Tennessee Republicans Push Fake News Bill Targeting Post, CNN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Daniel Jackson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0A resolution condemning the Washington Post and CNN as fake news for allegedly saying support for President Donald Trump is cult-like passed a Tennessee General Assembly subcommittee on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When introducing his resolution, Representative James \u201cMicah\u201d Van Huss, a Republican representing a section of rural Appalachia in eastern Tennessee, said the measure would recognize the two news organizations as \u201cpart of the media wing of the Democrat Party.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NH Business Review: NH\u2019s 2020 campaign finance landscape&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jay Surdukowski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire campaign finance law has recently seen its most momentous changes since 2014, and some of the more significant ones can reshape how campaigns and outside groups spend this year \u2013 a year when vigorous primaries exist for numerous key offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 2/20 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

Smith and John R. Lott Jr.<br/>House Democrats held a panicked hearing this month about how to respond to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which upheld the right of corporations to spend in elections. Their concern was the undue influence corporate spending might have on the coming elections.</p><p><br/>In the entire 2016 campaign cycle, corporations spent less than $300 million on federal races, less than 5% of total spending. Meanwhile, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has already spent more than $360 million on cable, broadcast and radio advertisements since declaring his candidacy in mid-November. That doesn\u2019t include Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s spending on staff, office space, logistics and internet advertising.

White<br/>The chapter [in \u201cSupreme Inequality\u201d] on unions is titled \u201cWorkers,\u201d but [author Adam] Cohen prefers unions to workers. In Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (2018), the court declared that the First Amendment protects public-sector employees from being forced to fund unions\u2019 political agendas-a win for millions of workers whose paychecks were being docked by union leaders. After Janus, Mr. Cohen reports, \u201c4.8 million workers were instantly given the right to not pay at all\u201d for unions they had not joined. He doesn\u2019t mean this as a compliment; so much for workers\u2019 rights.<br/>Janus, like Citizens United v. FEC (2010) and other cases striking down laws that Mr. Cohen would leave alone, were grounded in specific constitutional guarantees, especially in the First Amendment. Citizens United judged certain restrictions on independent political expenditures to be an abridgment of the speech rights of unions and corporations. Yet Mr. Cohen criticizes such decisions with minimal analysis while pining for a court that, with much less constitutional basis, would nullify a host of state laws.<br/>National Review: Certiorari Petition on Mandatory Bar Associations Post-Janus<br/>By\u00a0Ed Whelan<br/>In its 2018 ruling in\u00a0Janus v. AFSCME, the Supreme Court held that public employees have a First Amendment right not to be compelled to subsidize union speech on matters of substantial public concern. This interesting\u00a0certioriari petition\u00a0in\u00a0Fleck v. Wetch, filed by the Goldwater Institute on behalf of a North Dakota attorney, presents the question whether post-Janus\u00a0a state can force attorneys to join, and thus subsidize the political speech of, bar associations as a condition of practicing law.<br/>The Hill: It\u2019s time for the Supreme Court to treat all speech equally<br/>By Daniel Ortner<br/>In a free society, speech at times can be annoying, obnoxious, unsettling or offensive\u2026 And governments cannot block speech merely because it is irritating or bothersome \u2013 unless you are talking about commercial speech, in which case government bureaucrats have been given more deference to restrict speech\u2026<br/>The reduced protection of commercial speech presumes there is a clear difference between commercial and non-commercial speech. That premise always has been false and, as a result, courts have struggled to [make the distinction]\u2026<br/>Where we shop and what products we buy are acts with political and social overtones.

Parties must see the competition as legitimate even amid vigorous disagreement on ideas. This shared sense is a load-bearing wall for democracy.<br/>Over the past decade, the U.S. has become much more divided, sawing holes in this wall and hoping to miss the support beams. Progressives and conservatives agree on one thing: It\u2019s the other guys with the chain saws\u2026<br/>Why do so many Americans see their political opponents in such stark terms?

He finished third behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. The billionaire then dropped out of the race,\u00a0saying\u00a0he \u201ccan\u2019t see a path where I can win the presidency.\u201d<br/>Candidates and observers have debated the role of self-funding candidates throughout the Democratic primary. Those discussions have often centered on the world\u2019s ninth-richest man, Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg\u2019s astronomical spending is truly without precedent, and its final results are yet to be seen.</p><p><br/>In many ways, however, Steyer\u2019s campaign offers a better test of the ability of advertising to drive a campaign. Steyer lacks previous political experience and entered the race a far less-known figure than Bloomberg. His poor performance in South Carolina suggests that if your biggest political asset is your net worth, you\u2019re in trouble.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Bloomberg Law: Suit Over Trump Hush Money Payments to Playboy Model Tossed<br/>By Peter Hayes<br/>The Federal Elections Commission can\u2019t be forced to investigate alleged campaign finance violations stemming from a former Playboy model\u2019s claim that she was paid $150,000 to remain silent about her relationship with then-candidate Donald Trump, a Washington federal court ruled.<br/>Free Speech for the People hasn\u2019t shown that it suffered an \u201cinformational injury\u201d that would give it standing to sue, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said Monday.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Media</emphasis><br/>Washington Examiner: Covington Catholic teenager to file new lawsuits against New York Times and four other outlets<br/>By\u00a0Madison Dibble<br/>Attorneys for Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann announced that they were filing lawsuits against five additional media outlets.<br/>Sandmann was accused of harassment after he was photographed sporting a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat while standing in front of a Native American man, Nathan Phillips, with a smirk on his face in Washington, D.C., last year. It was later revealed that the student did nothing inappropriate during the exchange, despite several major newsrooms reporting otherwise.<br/>His attorneys notified the court on Feb. 23 that they intended to file lawsuits against the New York Times, Gannett, ABC, CBS, and Rolling Stone. All of the lawsuits will be formally filed by March 9\u2026<br/>Sandmann has two outstanding lawsuits against the Washington Post and NBC Universal. He already settled one other lawsuit with CNN for an undisclosed sum. The original request from CNN was a $275 million settlement, but it is not clear what the final agreement was.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Independent Groups</emphasis><br/>The Hill: Pro-Trump group refuses to pull ad featuring Obama despite cease-and-desist letter<br/>By Alicia Cohn<br/>A Republican super PAC is refusing the demand from President Obama\u2019s attorneys to take down an ad featuring his image.<br/>The pro-Trump group maintains that the TV ad, which has been airing in South Carolina, \u201cis a lawful expression of political speech.\u201d<br/>\u201cCDP will not only refuse to take \u2018Enough Empty Promises\u2019 down but will distribute this advertisement to an additional 50,000 South Carolina Democratic primary voters,\u201d the Committee to Defend the President wrote in a letter responding to Obama\u2019s cease-and-desist letter.<br/>Law firm Perkins Coie sent the letter to the group last week after an ad featuring excerpts from Obama\u2019s 1995 memoir \u201cDreams from My Father\u201d began airing in the early primary state.<br/>The ad makes it appear that Obama is criticizing his former vice president, Joe Biden, by taking excerpts out of context.\u00a0<br/>The Hill: Warren super PAC declines to release list of donors early despite request<br/>By\u00a0J. Edward Moreno<br/>The super PAC that announced $12 million in Super Tuesday ads for Sen. Elizabeth Warren is declining to disclose its list of donors early, despite a request from Warren\u2026<br/>Warren, who has said in the past that she disavows PAC money in the 2020 primary, has not done so for Persist PAC, which has become the largest super PAC in the Democratic field.<br/>While she has not disavowed the group, Warren\u2019s campaign said she wants the PAC to disclose their donors\u2026<br/>Warren\u2019s campaign website claims she would \u201cdisavow any Super PAC formed to support her in the Democratic primary,\u201d though she has argued that she is increasingly at a disadvantage in the race by brushing off support from PACs.<br/>Morning Brew: Google vs. Oracle Sheds Light on Auxiliary Political Groups<br/>By\u00a0Eliza Carter<br/>In politics, the candidates and legislators you see on the news make up only a small element of a complicated web of corporations, lobbyists, and lawyers that allows the private sector to influence government. One ongoing Big Tech proxy battle shows how companies and interest groups pursue their goals through shady and sometimes downright sneaky methods. <br/>Software giant Oracle\u2019s legal horns have been locked with search giant Google\u2019s for nearly a decade\u2026<br/>Both Silicon Valley heavyweights have funneled money into nonprofits known around the IRS as 501(c)(4)s. Those groups are now supporting their benefactors\u2019 cases\u2026despite positioning themselves as independent interest groups\u2026<br/>The 501(c)(4) label means these groups don\u2019t have to share their donor rosters so long as they don\u2019t spend more than half of their funds on election activities (that\u2019s why some call them \u201cdark money\u201d groups). Yet 501(c)(4)s and other similar, tax-exempt organizations have taken on a growing role in both corporate jousting and electoral politics.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>New York Times: Can YouTube Quiet Its Conspiracy Theorists?<br/>By Jack Nicas<br/>Climate change is a hoax, the Bible predicted President Trump\u2019s election and Elon Musk is a devil worshiper trying to take over the world.<br/>All of these fictions have found life on YouTube, the world\u2019s largest video site, in part because YouTube\u2019s own recommendations steered people their way.<br/>For years it has been a highly effective megaphone for conspiracy theorists, and YouTube, owned and run by Google, has admitted as much. In January 2019, YouTube said it would limit the spread of videos \u201cthat could misinform users in harmful ways.\u201d<br/>One year later, YouTube recommends conspiracy theories far less than before. But its progress has been uneven and it continues to advance certain types of fabrications, according to a new study from researchers at University of California, Berkeley.<br/>Brown Political Review:\u00a0It\u2019s Time to Hold Big Tech Accountable For Political Censorship<br/>By Jack Wolfsohn<br/>For years, conservatives in America have railed against Big Tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, and YouTube, for using vague speech guidelines on their forums as a weapon to ban (and shadowban) their accounts, delete posts and remove followers, and demonetize accounts. Big Tech employees create algorithms that purposefully engage in these actions on a broad scale.<br/>Politicians from both sides of the aisle are debating whether Big Tech companies should be treated as platforms or as publishers. The law views Big Tech giants as platforms, meaning they must permit nearly all speech to be posted on their sites regardless of content. However, the companies consistently fail to adhere to this condition\u2026\u00a0<br/>The law should be changed so that the companies that decide to restrict speech are legally considered publishers, allowing them to pick and choose their forum\u2019s content and to censor any speech they dislike. Those companies should have special protections that guard them against having their civil liability revoked. However, the special protections should remain for the companies that truly protect free speech of all political persuasions and can prove so in court. It should be up to the courts to decide whether Big Tech companies are acting as platforms or publishers and whether their designation should be changed.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal: All Tom Steyer\u2019s Money<br/>By The Editorial Board<br/>Tom Steyer spent more than $250 million of his own money running for President-enough to buy 6,200 Teslas -before dropping out Saturday after a distant third-place finish in South Carolina. His money didn\u2019t win him a single delegate\u2026<br/>He spent nearly $150 million to boost Democratic candidates during the 2014 and 2018 midterms, perhaps hoping they would someday return the favor\u2026<br/>Mr. Steyer\u2019s presidential campaign never did take off, perhaps because voters want more than a climate activist for the job. His spending did help him qualify for the debates, but he never broke much higher than 3% in national polls\u2026<br/>Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren say billionaires are trying to buy the election, and the evil of money in politics is a core progressive belief these days. Perhaps Michael Bloomberg will vindicate their point as he reaches the ballot on Tuesday for the first time, having spent more than $500 million to rise in the polls. But he does also bring 12 years as mayor of New York City as a credential\u2026<br/>Money is crucial in modern politics to deliver a message and inform voters. But Democratic primary voters may be proving that money can\u2019t buy the Presidency.\u00a0<br/>CNS News: Biden Calls for Allowing Only the Government to Fund House, Senate and Presidential Campaigns<br/>By Staff<br/>Former Vice President Joe Biden wants to amend the U.S. Constitution to prohibit private individuals from using their own money to make a contribution to a federal election campaign or to fund their own federal campaign,\u00a0according to a plan posted on Biden\u2019s campaign website.<br/>The Biden amendment would need to curtail the First Amendment, which guarantees Americans \u201cthe freedom of speech.\u201d In its 2010 decision in Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission,\u00a0the Supreme Court affirmed\u00a0that spending money on a political campaign is a constitutionally protected exercise of that right.<br/>On\u00a0his campaign website, Biden has published what he calls a \u201cPlan to Guarantee Government Works for the People.\u201d<br/>Part of this plan seeks the constitutional amendment that would prohibit Americans using their own money for political campaigns. The amendment, as Biden describes it, would give the government the sole power to fund federal campaigns.<br/>Politico: Bloomberg\u2019s online tactics test the boundary of disinformation<br/>By Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez<br/>First came the heavily edited video of Democratic candidates looking speechless at a debate when Mike Bloomberg points out he\u2019s the only one of them who\u2019s started a business. That was followed by tweets of fake quotes last week attributed to Bernie Sanders praising dictators.<br/>And shortly before that came news that the Bloomberg campaign was paying social media influencers to hype the billionaire, a novel move by a presidential candidate that was never contemplated by election law.<br/>In isolation, each of the tactics might appear harmless. Lighten up, Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has responded to complaints about the videos and fake quotes \u2013 of course it\u2019s tongue in cheek humor intended to make a point. There is no nefarious intent, the campaign said.<br/>\u201cUnlike Donald Trump and the [Republican National Committee], our campaign will not be using disinformation tactics to engage voters,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, a spokesperson for Bloomberg.<br/>But taken together, Bloomberg\u2019s moves are testing the boundary between edgy campaign fare and disinformation, as well as the limits of regulated political advertising, an array of nonpartisan technology experts tracking the 2020 candidates\u2019 online efforts told POLITICO. And it risks leading Democrats into perilous, anything-goes territory in the brave new world of online campaigning, they said.\u00a0<br/>Atlantic: You Can\u2019t Buy Memes<br/>By Kaitlyn Tiffany<br/>Mike Bloomberg, the Democratic presidential candidate and former New York City mayor, has paid for sponsored Instagram posts on at least 20 major meme accounts in the past two weeks, all with followings in the millions\u2026<br/>Memes spread by imitation and iteration. They need to be remixed and repeated\u2026 Bloomberg\u2019s images, in paid-for spots on meme accounts, are not really spreading; apart from a semipopular parody post that mocks the former mayor, there have been no major copy-pastes\u2026<br/>There is, undeniably, something uncomfortable about watching an extraordinarily wealthy person try to purchase organic expression\u2026<br/>Certainly Bloomberg\u2019s Instagram strategy is helping his campaign on some level. Each of the campaign\u2019s posts has hundreds of thousands of likes. The disbelieving comments themselves drive engagement, and bump the post\u2019s position in other users\u2019 feeds. But the ads do not contain any content other than the information that Mike Bloomberg exists and is running for president. \u201cReach and visibility is not the same as impact,\u201d Varis says. \u201cThe message also has to speak to somebody on some level.\u201d\u00a0<br/>Washington Post: The insidious side of Bloomberg\u2019s \u2018deputy digital organizer\u2019 ploy<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>Americans across the country are filling Facebook feeds and smartphone screens with exhortations to back Mike Bloomberg in his effort to become the Democratic nominee. The catch? Many of them are getting paid to do it \u2013 whether their audience knows it or not.\u00a0<br/>Washington Post: Americans oppose political campaigns using their personal data for targeted ads, new poll shows<br/>By Cat Zakrzewski<br/>Most Americans say political campaigns should not be able to target people with digital ads based on their data, according to new polling released this morning.\u00a0<br/>The\u00a0research from Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation\u00a0reveals most Americans favor greater regulation of ads that are pushed to select groups of people based on personal data such as zip code, age, gender and education\u2026\u00a0<br/>The polling is a rare measure of public sentiment as candidates pour millions of dollars into microtargeted ads ahead of the 2020 elections. It could ramp up pressure on the\u00a0Federal Election Commission and Congress to update political ad rules for the digital era.\u00a0<br/>Washington\u00a0Examiner: Nevertheless, Elizabeth Warren persists in hypocrisy<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>\u201cPeople across this country \u2013 Republicans, independents, and Democrats \u2013 agree that our top priority has to be fighting corruption in Washington,\u201d Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in an ad broadcast thousands of times in Iowa ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses. \u201cI\u2019m not doing big-dollar fundraisers. I\u2019m not selling ambassadorships to donors. I\u2019m not cozying up to super PACs.\u201d<br/>For rank-and-file Democrats, who take it as a matter of faith that \u201ccorrupt\u201d campaign finance is the root of all evil in U.S. politics, this is a powerful message because recent history has proven that no amount of facts or evidence can dissuade them from this dogma.<br/>They cannot be persuaded by the persistent inability of wealthy Democrats to buy elections, nor by the failure of the best-funded Democratic candidates. They cannot even be persuaded after 2016 when Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign outspent Donald Trump\u2019s 2-to-1, and pro-Clinton super PACs outspent pro-Trump super PACs 3-to-1.<br/>The Democratic superstition that money buys elections is so powerful that you can see why Warren would spend so much time and money driving it home\u2026<br/>And that makes it an even bigger deal now that she is completely going back on her promise.\u00a0<br/>Guardian: No, Elizabeth Warren \u2013 taking Super Pac money is not girl power<br/>By Arwa Mahdawi<br/>I don\u2019t completely begrudge [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren taking Super Pac money. Her campaign has been flagging; flooding Super Tuesday markets with expensive ad buys is probably her best chance at changing that. However, I do begrudge the highly disingenuous way she framed her Super Pac backtrack as some sort of feminist position. There is nothing remotely feminist about using gender as an excuse to abandon your principles and embrace big money.<br/>Atlantic: The Two Things That Sank Buttigieg\u2019s Candidacy<br/>By Peter Beinart<br/>What [Pete Buttigieg] achieved playing by the Democratic Party\u2019s old fundraising rules was remarkable. Over the course of 2019, Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, outraised Joe Biden, the former vice president, by $15 million.<br/>Once upon a time, that might have been enough\u2026<br/>Buttigieg\u2019s problem was that this old pattern no longer holds. Since 2004, when Howard Dean harnessed grassroots anger at Democratic complicity in the Iraq War to outraise his establishment rivals, populist Democrats have rewritten the fundraising rules. Over the course of 2019, Buttigieg raised about as much money as Bernie Sanders from donors who gave more than $200, but less than half as much from donors giving less than $200. As a result, Sanders didn\u2019t merely outraise Buttigieg by more than $30 million; he and Elizabeth Warren turned Buttigieg\u2019s big-donor support into a political cudgel.<br/>To make matters worse, Buttigieg suffered from another campaign-finance innovation: the rise of the self-funding billionaire.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Associated Press: Legislation advances to allow child care as election expense<br/>By Staff<br/>A bill is advancing in Rhode Island to allow political candidates to use campaign funds for child care while they\u2019re participating in election activities.<br/>The Rhode Island Senate passed the bill last week, sending it to the House Judiciary Committee\u2026<br/>The Rhode Island Board of Elections is considering changing its regulations to include child care as an allowable campaign expense, even if the bill does not pass the General Assembly.<br/>In neighboring Connecticut, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont has offered legislation this session that would allow candidates who qualify for the state\u2019s Citizens\u2019 Election Fund, the public campaign financing program, to have their child care costs reimbursed by the program when they\u2019re incurred to enable a candidate to campaign.\u00a0<br/>Woodward News: Numerous bills pass during deadline week<br/>By State Rep. Mike Sanders<br/>Feb. 27 was the date by which all bills had to be passed in committee in order to stay active this session. Consequently, that meant House committees heard hundreds of bills this past week. Here is a look at a few that passed.<br/>House Bills 3826 and 3827 by Speaker Charles McCall would make more transparent and modernize the initiative and referendum petition processes used to place state questions on the ballot in Oklahoma.<br/>HB 3827 addresses a lack of transparency in campaign finance for state questions. The Ethics Commission currently says a state question is only a state question when the governor sets an election date. This allows campaigns for or against state questions to avoid disclosing donations and expenditures until that time. State question campaigns will often have been accepting donations and spending money for months or even years before an election date is set by the governor. This measure specifies that a state question becomes a state question when the Secretary of State assigns a state question number, which typically occurs shortly after the petition is filed.\u00a0<br/>CalMatters: Legislators\u2019 charity use has prompted calls for reform \u2013 but not from the Assembly Speaker<br/>By Laurel Rosenhall<br/>Nothing to see here.<br/>That was the essence of what Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon had to say after fundraising by one member of his house triggered an investigation by California\u2019s political watchdog agency, and payments by another prompted calls to tighten the state\u2019s political ethics law.<br/>As CalMatters reported in its \u201cSweet Charity\u201d series, nonprofits created by individual lawmakers or special caucuses of lawmakers are an increasingly common way to raise and spend money outside campaign finance law limits.<br/>But Rendon said these affiliated nonprofits \u201ccan provide valuable resources\u201d and that he has no problem with them \u201cif people are going about their activities ethically and with full transparency.\u201d<br/>JD Supra: The Annual Roundup of California Anti-SLAPP Appellate Decisions<br/>By Thomas Burke<br/>In 2019, California\u2019s appellate courts issued 42 published opinions interpreting the state\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute. Cal. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 425.16 et. seq. Litigants filed at least 435 anti-SLAPP motions in California\u2019s trial courts according to their reporting to the Judicial Council. California\u2019s Supreme Court issued five substantive opinions interpreting the statute while the state\u2019s appellate courts issued nearly 200 unpublished anti-SLAPP opinions. We briefly highlight the past year\u2019s anti-SLAPP rulings for busy anti-SLAPP practitioners. <br/>Enacted in 1992 to protect the exercise of free speech and petitioning activities, California\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute remains the strongest-and most frequently litigated-statutes of its kind in the nation.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>The post Daily Media Links 3/3 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-91621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBP-W861-DY1R-B0V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3450\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 3, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDFDNTVFNUY0MDdENDU1MDg3OTNEOTM5NEE5MzYzNDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTg2NzQwMzNGN0M4NEM3RUFGNUU5QzJGMTcxMTNFRUY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODdEMDhDREQzOEQ2NDE2RkE2Njk3RTNEMUM0NTE3MEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkU5NzdDMzI5QTcxNDQ5QTg3NDAwNjNGM0MwMTgxNEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Political Speech</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTU4MjU4OEY5QjEwNEEzMUE0MEQ3OEVCMDhERTE5MDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>Scope</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFFNzEwMUYzNEU3NDdGRTg4RUM2OUM0ODI1ODg2QjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Initiative &amp;

Many state governments also have attempted to silence citizen advocacy. Matt Nese from the Institute for Free Speech joins the podcast to discuss these issues, and how to proactively protect citizen privacy.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supreme Court</emphasis><br/>The Atlantic:\u00a0Delaware\u2019s Weird-and Constitutionally Suspect-Approach to Judicial Independence<br/>By Garrett Epps<br/>A judge, the old saying goes, is a lawyer who knew a politician. Whether judges are nominated by the executive or elected by voters or legislators, politics plays an overwhelming role in the process.<br/>But can a state\u2019s constitution mandate \u201cpartisan balance\u201d on the bench-and exclude from judgeships anyone who isn\u2019t either a Democrat or a Republican?<br/>The Supreme Court was-before the coronavirus hit-scheduled to take up that question this past week. Now we don\u2019t know when or how the oral argument will be held. Carney v. Adams, a case from Delaware, has attracted little public attention, but it has attracted a set of high-powered First Amendment advocates. To resolve it, the Court must balance the interests of officeholders who wish to make political supporters into judges, of individuals who wish to serve on courts, and of citizens who want to safeguard the independence of the bench.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Legal Newsline: Political groups push for Federal Election Commission to respond to claims against Jeb Bush<br/>By Charmaine Little<br/>Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21 are urging the Federal Election Commission to take action on its Federal Election Campaign Act lawsuit.<br/>The plaintiffs asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for injunctive and declaratory relief in hopes of compelling the FEC to act on the FECA lawsuit. They first alerted the FEC with an administrative complaint in late March 2015, claiming that the previous Florida governor Jeb Bush infringed on 52 U.S.C when he allegedly \u201c\u2018established, financed, maintained, and controlled\u2019 both directly and indirectly through his agents, the Right to Rise Super PAC, Inc., which \u2018acted on his behalf\u2019 by raising and spending soft money to promote Bush\u2019s presidential campaign,\u201d according to the lawsuit.<br/>The FEC had yet to take any action by the filing of the plaintiffs\u2019 request for relief. The plaintiffs said the lack of response has set the tone for other wealthy politicians to break FECA rules.<br/>Mondaq: After Multiple Lawsuits, New Jersey Nonprofit Disclosure Law Permanently Enjoined<br/>By\u00a0Matthew T. Sanderson, Trevor Potter, Bryson Morgan and Olivia N. Marshall<br/>(Caplin &amp;Drysdale;)<br/>A New Jersey law passed in June of 2019 that created new disclosure requirements for certain groups seeking to influence elections and government actions in the state was struck down by Judge Brian Martinotti of the U.S. District Court for New Jersey on March 11, 2020.<br/>The law required \u201c527\u201d political organizations and \u201c501(c)(4)\u201d nonprofit groups seeking to influence New Jersey elections, ballot measures, legislation, or regulations to disclose donors contributing $10,000 or more. Disclosure would also triggered even if a group merely provided \u201cpolitical information\u201d (including advertisements and get-out-the-vote efforts) about an election, legislation, or regulation in New Jersey. Previously, these groups were not required to publicly disclose their donors.<br/>Several groups brought challenges to the law, including the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity (AFP) and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ). Both groups argued in separate lawsuits that the law\u2019s disclosure requirements were overly broad and violated New Jersey citizens\u2019 rights to freedom of speech and association.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Washington Post: The Cybersecurity 202: Cybersecurity experts slam child protection bill that risks rolling back encryption<br/>By Joseph Marks<br/>The EARN IT Act would strip tech companies of their prized liability protections for what users share on their platforms, unless they follow rules designed by a new government task force \u2013 which experts fear would require companies to give law enforcement special access to encrypted communications. <br/>Network experts warned that such a move would make hundreds of millions of people more vulnerable to hacking \u2013 and probably wouldn\u2019t even accomplish its main goal of preventing online child exploitation. <br/>\u201cThe EARN IT bill not only will fail at its objectives, but will also destroy the protection encryption provides to everyday citizens\u2019 medical, financial and personal data,\u201d said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer of McAfee\u2026<br/>\u201cIt pushes toward an Internet where the law require[s] every message sent to be read by government-approved scanning software,\u201d said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group. <br/>Joe Hall, senior vice president for a strong Internet at the Internet Society, a global nonprofit group, called the bill \u201ca bipartisan buzz-saw steamroller through digital rights and free speech.\u201d \u2026<br/>\u201cThe government has shown time and time again that they can\u2019t protect classified information from access (and even release) by unauthorized parties,\u201d [Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency hacker and founder of the cybersecurity company Rendition Infosec.] said\u2026<br/>\u201cTo think the government can (or will) do any better with encryption backdoors given this context is laughable,\u201d he added.<br/>New York Times: House Departs Without Vote to Extend Expired F.B.I. Spy Tools<br/>By Charlie Savage<br/>House Democrats left the capital on Friday after passing the $2 trillion coronavirus relief legislation without taking up a Senate bill to temporarily revive three expired F.B.I. surveillance tools for terrorism and espionage investigations, ensuring that the laws will remain lapsed at least until the Senate returns from vacation next month\u2026<br/>A majority of lawmakers in both chambers support extending the expired provisions, but they have been caught up in a larger argument over whether and how strictly to impose new restrictions on the F.B.I.\u2019s FISA powers after an inspector general\u2019s damning report found numerous factual errors and omissions in applications to target the former Trump adviser Carter Page during the Russia investigation.<br/>The House passed a bill, negotiated by Ms. Pelosi and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, this month before the provisions expired that would extend the expiring provisions while making changes to FISA.<br/>The House bill, for example, would push the FISA court to appoint an outsider to critique the government\u2019s arguments when a wiretap application raised serious issues about First Amendment activity, which could include political campaigns\u2026<br/>But amid objections from libertarian-leaning senators of both parties that the House bill fell short in curtailing surveillance powers, the Senate did not take it up.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Fox News: Bloomberg campaign hit with FEC complaint for $18M transfer to DNC<br/>By Andrew Keiper<br/>A Federal Elections Commission complaint has been filed against former New York City mayor and 2020 presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg for an $18 million transfer from his defunct campaign to the Democratic National Committee.<br/>At the core of the complaint is the tenuous distinction between Bloomberg\u2019s personal finances and those of his presidential campaign. The complaint is unique because of the nature of Bloomberg\u2019s self-funded campaign. He took no outside donations and maintained complete control over the campaign\u2019s finances, and the complaint argues this weakens the legal distinctions normally found between campaign cash and a candidate\u2019s personal wealth\u2026<br/>\u201cAllowing these kinds of contributions is everything we\u2019ve said no to in 40 years of campaign finance jurisprudence,\u201d said Dan Backer, the man who filed the complaint through his pro-Trump Great AmericaPAC. <br/>\u201cNever has this been okay at the federal level.\u201d \u2026<br/>\u201cIf you allow Bloomberg to do this, you\u2019re giving democracy to a billionaire oligarch,\u201d Backer said. \u201c\u2026 Having been unable to buy voters, he\u2019s doing the next best thing and buying the party itself.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Media</emphasis><br/>Boston Herald: Mainstream media wants to filter the message<br/>By\u00a0Boston Herald Editorial Staff<br/>Look out for wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing amongst our media during this coronavirus pandemic.<br/>They are ready and willing to shut off the public\u2019s access to news and information in the name of journalism. They do it, they tell you, because unfettered access to the president\u2019s words is dangerous in this crucial moment.<br/>So they\u2019re looking to shield your feeble and impressionable mind from the president\u2019s coronavirus press conferences.<br/>As the Daily Beast news site reported, staffers and managers at MSNBC and CNN \u201cwill be ready to cut away from the briefings\u201d when the informational portions \u201cgive way to unsupported presidential speculation and outright falsehoods.\u201d \u2026<br/>All of this is ridiculous and offensive.<br/>The American people are smart enough to decide if the president is lying or telling the truth. They don\u2019t need egg-headed media elites editing his words \u2013 they do enough of that already.<br/>The president is the point man for all of the resources available in the federal government and voters deserve to hear him, uncut and raw, not reconstituted by self-important journalists.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Independent Groups</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal: Democratic Groups Adjust to Coronavirus, Spend Big to Beat Trump<br/>By Tarini Parti and Chad Day<br/>Voters who are more dependent than ever on technology for social connection can expect to see more Democratic-boosting content on Facebook, Instagram and even videogame platforms\u2026<br/>\u201cAds are even more important than they were before,\u201d said Josh Schwerin, spokesman for Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, which is spending on advertising earlier than it did in 2016 and plans to shell out $150 million before the Democratic National Convention in July. \u201cPeople are sitting at home, and getting information in front of them is critical.\u201d \u2026<br/>NextGen America, a progressive group created by former presidential candidate Tom Steyer that plans to spend $45 million this cycle, is also built around face-to-face organizing. The group stopped all in-person outreach on March 12\u2026<br/>The group\u2019s roughly 200 organizers are spending hours a day reaching out to voters through Facebook groups, direct messages on Instagram and videos on TikTok (some of which are dance-themed). One organizer in New Hampshire even created an avatar on the social videogame \u201cMinecraft.\u201d<br/>\u201cHe gave himself a NextGen T-shirt and has his virtual persona go up to other virtual personas, and he\u2019s asking people if they\u2019re registered to vote at their current address,\u201d said Ben Wessel, NextGen America\u2019s executive director. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re literally re-creating what they would do in the physical world in the online world.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>New York Times: Facebook, Google and Twitter Struggle to Handle November\u2019s Election<br/>By\u00a0Kevin Roose, Sheera Frenkel and Nicole Perlroth<br/>Facebook, Twitter, Google and other big tech companies have spent the past three years working to avoid a repeat of 2016, when their platforms were overrun by Russian trolls and used to amplify America\u2019s partisan divide. The internet giants have since collectively spent billions of dollars hiring staff, fortifying their systems and developing new policies to prevent election meddling.<br/>But as the events of just one day \u2013 Feb. 12 \u2013 at Facebook showed, although the companies are better equipped to deal with the types of interference they faced in 2016, they are struggling to handle the new challenges of 2020.<br/>Slate: Confronting Viral Disinformation<br/>By Mia Armstrong<br/>In recent weeks, false information about COVID-19-often spread intentionally by state actors with the intent to cause harm, and amplified by overwhelmed and fearful users-has spread about as virally as the virus itself.<br/>In its wake, that false information has left confusion and a big question: What can social media platforms, individuals and governments do about it?<br/>That question was central to \u201cConfronting Viral Disinformation,\u201d Future Tense\u2019s latest web event in our yearlong Free Speech Project series, which is examining the ways technology is influencing how we think about speech.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>New York Daily News:\u00a0Cuomo floats public financing in N.Y. state budget despite judge scuttling controversial commission<br/>By Denis Slattery<br/>Gov. Cuomo is eyeing reviving the recently scuttled recommendations of a controversial commission on campaign finance as part of the state budget, sources told the Daily News.<br/>During recent negotiations, the governor has floated the idea of slipping language into the spending plan that would establish a $100 million publicly-financed election system and limit minor parties\u2019 access to the ballot \u2013 just weeks after a State Supreme Court justice tossed the law\u2026<br/>Cuomo has made clear that the ongoing coronavirus crisis has made no impact on his plan to include a multitude of policy measures, such as a $3 billion environmental bond, the legalization of recreational marijuana and tweaks to bail reforms, in the state budget despite calls from good government groups to pass a strictly fiscal measure.<br/>The spending plan, which the governor said this week could include quarterly adjustments based on the state revenue, is due by April 1.<br/>JD Supra: New York State Modifies Ethics Laws and Several Jurisdictions Update Reporting Requirements in Light of COVID-19<br/>By\u00a0Matthew Bobys, Theodore Grodek, Kenneth Gross, Ki Hong, Melissa Miles, Shayla Parker, Jeremy Regan, Charles Ricciardelli, and Tyler Rosen (Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp;Flom; LLP)<br/>As federal, state and local governments grapple with the COVID-19 outbreak, a number of jurisdictions have modified certain ethics, lobbying and campaign finance requirements in response to the crisis. Below, we describe certain steps taken by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to attempt to alter certain ethics laws in the state in an attempt to better allow for private sector assistance, including a clarification that gifts to the New York state government are exempt from state gift laws.

I didn\u2019t ask to be excluded,\u201d said Klas, who said she tried to attend Saturday\u2019s briefing because recent efforts to submit questions in writing had been unsuccessful. \u201cThe problem with having this available on a satellite feed is there\u2019s no interaction, and we\u2019d already had several days where they weren\u2019t answering [our] questions.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 3/30 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-94752</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJF-XNR1-DY1R-B15V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2661\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 30, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

AmericanAssociation of Political Consultants, which, as I\u2019ve reported, asks the justices to decide whether a 2015 amendment to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act violates the First Amendment and, if so, whether the entire law is unconstitutional. Roman Martinez, an appellate specialist at Latham &amp;Watkins; and a onetime clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts, represents the coalition of political consultants that contends the TCPA is unconstitutional. Last Thursday, before the Supreme Court announced the delay, Martinez was on the phone with the rest of his team, trying to figure out how to get ready for a Supreme Court argument without leaving his house in the Maryland suburbs.</p><p><br/>[Editor\u2019s Note: The Institute for Free Speech filed an amicus brief in the case in support of the American Association of Political Consultants. You can read the brief\u00a0here.]<br/>Washington Post: Supreme inequality<br/>By Adam Cohen<br/>In Nixon\u2019s first three years in office, he appointed four Supreme Court\u00a0justices, one of the fastest rates of turnover in history. The new members \u2013 Warren Burger (the new chief justice), Harry Blackmun, William Rehnquist and Powell \u2013 were more sympathetic to big business than their predecessors.<br/>The ways in which the court drove inequality were wide-ranging. In 1976, in Buckley v. Valeo, it held for the first time that money is First Amendment-protected speech and struck down limits on spending in political campaigns. That began the dismantling of campaign finance laws, clearing the way for wealthy Americans, and then corporations, to use unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. In labor law, the court turned against unions \u2013 a trend that reached its nadir in 2018 with Janus v. AFSCME, which held that government unions cannot require nonmembers to pay fees for being represented in collective bargaining\u2026<br/>As for the nation\u2019s nonprogressive tax system, a significant portion of blame lies with the court\u2019s unraveling of campaign finance laws starting in the 1970s: These decisions rely on the dubious claim that money is speech and therefore deserves constitutional protection. The court\u2019s rulings gave more political power than ever to the rich, who used that influence to drive down their own tax rates.<br/>Higher taxes on rich people are popular \u2013 in one recent poll, 76 percent of registered voters wanted them to pay more. But wealthy campaign contributors have been blunt about conditioning future donations on lower tax rates. When the 2017 Trump tax bill was pending, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned colleagues that if Republicans did not get it passed, the \u201cfinancial contributions will stop\u201d and incumbents would lose their jobs.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>RealClearPolitics: Union Provision Was Secretly Slipped Into COVID-19 Relief Bill<br/>By Susan Crabtree<br/>A provision in the sprawling $2.2 trillion relief legislation, which lawmakers rushed through Congress to help workers and employers in an economy cratering from a global pandemic, would impose a gag rule on mid-sized businesses when it comes to union efforts to organize workers\u2026<br/>[T]he neutrality mandate managed to get slipped in without much GOP scrutiny \u2013 to the chagrin of free-market groups who argue it will impinge on businesses\u2019 First Amendment rights to speak to their workers about union organizing efforts.<br/>\u201cThe gag rule has been something that the unions have been fighting to enact for a long period of time, and it has nothing to do with the virus or the economy,\u201d David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, told RealClearPolitics. \u201cShame on Republicans for not catching it.\u201d<br/>\u201cWhat does a company surrendering their First Amendment rights have to do with the health and economic safety of Americans?\u201d complained F. Vincent Vernuccio, a senior fellow with the conservative Mackinac Center for Public Policy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Media</emphasis><br/>Las Vegas Review-Journal: Group called Free Press embraces the opposite<br/>By The Editorial Board<br/>It takes a certain kind of witless cynicism for a group that calls itself \u201cFree Press\u201d to demand that the federal government censor broadcasters in their coronavirus coverage. But here we are.<br/>Last week, the leftists behind Free Press petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to impose restrictions on how media outlets cover President Donald Trump\u2019s daily briefings on the worldwide pandemic. The group argues that the president is spreading dangerous falsehoods at these news conferences, and thus government regulators must step in to protect the public\u2026<br/>As a remedy for its many grievances, the organization asked that the FCC\u2026either prevent broadcasters from airing the briefings uncensored or force them to include disclaimers when Mr. Trump speaks\u2026<br/>Fortunately, the FCC reacted quickly and decisively to this inane proposal\u2026<br/>\u201cAt best, the petition rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the commission\u2019s limited role in regulating broadcast journalism,\u201d an FCC statement explained. \u201cAnd at worst, the petition is a brazen attempt to pressure broadcasters to squelch their coverage of a president that Free Press dislikes and silence other commentators with whom Free Press disagrees.\u201d<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Playboy correspondent demands access to White House briefing room<br/>By Erik Wemple<br/>Coronavirus has caused much-publicized scarcities of commodities, including toilet paper, flour and all kinds of medical supplies. Now add another: seats in the White House\u2019s James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, where 14 reporters spread out among 49 seats in compliance with social distancing guidelines.<br/>Brian Karem, an outspoken correspondent for Playboy, doesn\u2019t have one\u2026 He wants in. \u201cI provide a distinctive voice to the proceedings,\u201d notes Karem\u2026\u00a0<br/>\u201cThe president has engaged me in the past and knows I won\u2019t back down.

The lawsuit was first reported by the Times of San Diego.<br/>The suit, which was filed in King County on Thursday by the Washington League for Increased Transparency and Ethics (WASHLITE), requests an injunction to bar the network from \u201cinterfering with reasonable and necessary measures to contain the virus by publishing further false and deceptive content.\u201d \u2026<br/>But attorneys previously expressed skepticism that the network could face legal ramifications.<br/>\u201cFox News has been grotesquely irresponsible but I struggle to imagine a plausible legal theory under which it might be sued here,\u201d Susan Hennessey, the executive director of Lawfare, said in March.<br/>Georgia law professor Eric Segall added that any lawsuit would \u201chave to show actual malice or reckless disregard,\u201d which \u201ccould never be shown here.\u201d<br/>\u201cNo one is going to hold liable TV news people for reporting what they think is the news relating to millions,\u201d he said. \u201cNo court would go for it.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Independent Groups</emphasis><br/>Fulcrum: Political love in the time of Covid<br/>By Perry Waag<br/>The entire democracy reform movement, with more than 130 organizations, raises approximately $150 million in contributions every year\u2026<br/>[With the current public health emergency, we ] have an opportunity now to get the attention of our potential backers, especially while so many of them are at home and maybe have unexpected time to spend. But obviously, given the devastating economic consequences that continue to unfold, philanthropy of all kinds will be much harder to come by as everyone focuses more on their own necessities before making donations to their favorite charities\u2026<br/>We need to show would-be donors that they wouldn\u2019t need to give as much to other causes, like curing cancer or slowing climate change, if we fixed our politics first.<br/>Just as with candidates, money will get us noticed, but it won\u2019t hold the public\u2019s attention for long if our message does not resonate. Thankfully, our message does resonate \u2013 we just need the funds to make more Americans aware of the solutions for making their government work better for them.<br/>Protocol:\u00a0Big tech\u2019s ad rules leave plenty of room for dark money to hide<br/>By Issie Lapowsky<br/>Nearly four years after the U.S. presidential election exposed how little Americans know about who\u2019s behind the political ads they see online, these ads remain almost completely unregulated. Facebook and Google have built massive ad archives that show who\u2019s targeting their users with political messages and how. Given that they account for more than 75 percent of political digital ad spending, that\u2019s a start. But those efforts are voluntary on the part of the companies, their requirements vary, and they reveal nothing about the ads appearing off their platforms.<br/>This issue is the subject of a new report by the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington DC-based non-profit that advocates for government accountability. The report analyzes the difference between the amount of digital advertising that dark money groups like the Big Tent Project have reported to the FEC and the amount that appears in the few online ad archives that tech companies have created. The authors found that the vast majority of that money remains unaccounted for. This, they argue, suggests that despite tech giants\u2019 best attempts at self-regulation and transparency, plenty of loopholes remain, allowing political advertisers to hide their tracks.<br/>Daily Beast: Dem Groups Begin Digital Assault of Trump Over Coronavirus<br/>By Lachlan Markay<br/>Swing state voters are being targeted with political ads hammering President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. But the organizations behind the ads are taking steps to ensure that they and their funders remain shrouded from public view.<br/>This week, Not In Our America, a new Facebook advertiser, began buying up promoted space on the platform to attack the administration\u2019s coronavirus response in the key 2020 states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona\u2026<br/>The amounts spent are relatively small so far. Not In Our America dropped less than $1,600 on Facebook ads on Monday, its first full day in existence. But the ads reached as many as 70,000 people in those four states.<br/>Those totals are likely to increase significantly over the coming weeks. But it\u2019s not clear that voters who see Not In Our America\u2019s ads in their Facebook feeds will have any idea who is trying to sway their votes-or providing the financing to do so.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>Politico: Diamond and Silk\u2019s Twitter account locked for breaking coronavirus misinformation rules<br/>By Cristiano Lima<br/>Twitter briefly locked the account of online personalities and prominent Trump allies Diamond and Silk over a tweet that violated the company\u2019s rules against coronavirus misinformation, a spokesperson for the social media firm said.<br/>It\u2019s the latest instance of Twitter taking enforcement action against a notable surrogate of President Donald Trump for ruling afoul of its recently enacted rules against medical hoaxes and misleading information [related to]\u00a0Covid-19\u2026<br/>\u201cThe only way we can become immune to the environment; we must be out in the environment. Quarantining people inside of their houses for extended periods will make people sick!\u201d the pair tweeted from their official account, which boasts 1.4 million followers.<br/>The account later appeared to be unlocked, indicating the violating tweet had been deleted. A public message appended over their post reads, \u201cThis Tweet is no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d<br/>Twitter recently expanded its rules against medical misinformation to include posts that contradict guidance from authoritative health agencies. The social media company in recent weeks has separately found that posts by Fox News host Laura Ingraham and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani broke its rules against Covid-19 misinformation.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Townhall: IA Senate: Greenfield Says She \u2018Cannot Control What Outside Groups Do\u2019 After Ethics Complaint<br/>By Reagan McCarthy<br/>Iowa\u2019s Democratic Senate primary continues to be a target for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as he aims to get Theresa Greenfield, his hand-picked candidate, over the primary finish line. Sen. Schumer\u2019s fundraising group, Senate Majority PAC, has pumped money into Iowa in support of Greenfield and is wasting no time attacking GOP incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA). <br/>Greenfield echoes Democratic talking points about \u201cmoney in politics\u201d and reversing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Citizens United, which was a huge win for free speech:<br/>\u201cTheresa is committed to building a grassroots campaign by Iowans, for Iowans and won\u2019t take a dime from corporate PACs. Theresa has received grassroots contributions from all 99 counties in Iowa, and has been endorsed by dozens of leaders from around the state,\u201d Greenfield\u2019s website says.<br/>When asked [by The Iowa Starting Line] about Senate Majority PAC bankrolling her campaign and running television ads in support of her, Greenfield said, \u201cI cannot control what outside groups are going to do.\u201d<br/>Greenfield\u2019s campaign was recently hit with a complaint from a watchdog group, Foundation for Accountability and Trust, claiming illegal collusion with Senate Majority PAC.\u00a0<br/>Fortune: Bernie Sanders drops out of the presidential race, paving the way for Joe Biden to be the Democratic nominee<br/>By Nicole Goodkind<br/>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced an end to his presidential run Wednesday morning\u2026<br/>\u201cWe showed the world that we could take on a corrupt campaign finance system and run a campaign without being dependent on the wealthy and powerful,\u201d he said in a speech broadcast live from his website. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that any candidate has ever been blessed with a stronger and more dedicated group of people who have taken our message to every part of the country\u2026\u201d<br/>Breitbart: Bernie Sanders Wasted over $160 Million on Failed Presidential Campaign<br/>By Charlie Spiering<br/>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) wasted over $160 million on his failed presidential campaign, according to the latest federal election records.<br/>The campaign finance report filed on February 29, 2020, showed that Sanders spent $160,984,978 on his campaign, according to Open Secrets.<br/>Millions more were likely spent as Sanders continued to campaign through March and into April, despite cutting back on campaign activities [due to\u00a0Covid-19].<br/>Sanders was the most prolific fundraiser in the Democrat party, raising over $179 million from donors. Small donors contributing less than $200 represented 54 percent of his total donors, according to Open Secrets.<br/>The self-described democratic socialist is the last Democrat candidate to leave the race, despite spending significantly less than several self-funded billionaire candidates. Former Mayor Mike Bloomberg spent $600 million on his failed campaign and Tom Steyer wasted $252 million.<br/>Democrats have already spent over $1 billion in their attempts to be the candidate to challenge President Donald Trump for the presidency in 2020.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Missoulian: Montana GOP trying to undermine election integrity<br/>By Linda McCulloch<br/>I was alarmed by the recent revelations that out-of-state signature-gatherers employed by the same organization hired to qualify the Green Party for the ballot in 2018 were once again collecting signatures for the Green Party, despite the Montana Green Party\u2019s unequivocal public condemnation of the effort.<br/>Until recently, no group had come forward to admit their financial support for this operation \u2013 aside from an out-of-state dark money group that abandoned its operation in its infancy. And despite a state law requiring groups to register as a minor party qualification committee within five days of raising or spending more than $500 on signature gathering. On March 6, the secretary of state certified the Green Party to be on the ballot, despite the funding source behind the campaign being a mystery and the funder having clearly violated state law in the course of acquiring the certification.<br/>The mystery of the Green Party signatures was finally solved when it was reported that the Montana GOP had been bankrolling the covert operation all along, spending $100,000 to finance the signature-gathering effort. Republicans led the deception that put petition gatherers in the parking lots of grocery stores and post offices wearing buttons and insignia that implied they were Green Party members.<br/>This fraudulent conduct \u2013 intentionally designed to deceive Montana voters and meddle in our democratic process \u2013 is beneath Montana\u2026<br/>During my tenure as secretary of state from 2009-2017, I worked to uphold the integrity of our elections. The fact that the Montana GOP has engaged in this effort is a new and disturbing level of election fraud.<br/>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Here\u2019s how dark-money groups flooded Milwaukee mailboxes while keeping their donors secret<br/>By Daniel Bice<br/>Seizing on an opportunity \u2013 and a captive audience \u2013 dark-money groups flooded Milwaukee County mailboxes with sometimes dubious claims in the weeks leading up to Tuesday\u2019s contest. These groups are usually nonprofits that don\u2019t have to reveal their source of funding and, sometimes, how much they are spending. <br/>In the Milwaukee County executive\u2019s contest, a local liberal group sent out flyers \u2013 without saying who paid for them \u2013 as it sought to counter the heavy spending by outgoing County Exec Chris Abele and a national pro-school-choice group\u2026<br/>And a shadowy group out of Virginia tried to tip the balance in the Wauwatosa mayor\u2019s contest by sending out five rounds of flyers criticizing one of the candidates without ever explaining who was underwriting these attacks. <br/>Matt Rothschild, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, said it\u2019s no surprise that dark-money groups are getting involved locally.<br/>\u201cOur democracy is drowning under a tsunami of dark money, which is now spilling over into the most local of races,\u201d Rothschild said. \u201cUntil we require these groups to disclose their donors, until they\u2019ve got to tell us who is paying for the mud that\u2019s splattering our screens, the voters of Wisconsin will continue to be swamped with these nasty ads.\u201d\u00a0<br/>The post Daily Media Links 4/9 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-96257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMK-MGH1-DY1R-B34S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3191\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002E0D</classCode><className>LATHAM &amp;

Small Business Administration rules specifically bar \u201cbusinesses primarily engaged in political or lobbying activities.\u201d<br/>These businesses \u201care not immune from the financial hardships that Covid-19 has inflicted on the nation,\u201d the American Association of Political Consultants said in a filing Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \u201cRather, these businesses are acutely suffering the severe economic impacts\u201d of the economic fallout from the pandemic\u2026<br/>In a court filing, the group argued that preventing consultants, strategists and polling firms from qualifying for small-business loans violates their First Amendment right to free speech and requires them to \u201cforego their constitutional rights to obtain a loan.\u201d The SBA\u2019s prohibition, they wrote, \u201ctreats lobbying and political businesses differently when they are in fact similarly situated to other small businesses.\u201d<br/>Miami Herald: BSO union president sues sheriff for his job back, saying his free speech was violated<br/>By Devoun Cetoute<br/>The Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s union president has sued Sheriff Gregory Tony for his job back after Tony suspended him Friday for saying BSO was not providing the deputies with proper equipment to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus, the lawsuit says.<br/>On Wednesday, Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office Deputies Association, and his attorney Robert Buschel, filed the civil rights lawsuit against Tony in Fort Lauderdale federal court.<br/>\u201cThis is a case about the scope of free speech during an unprecedented time in our nation\u2019s history, while a pandemic of COVID-19 viral infections kills thousands every day,\u201d the lawsuit said\u2026<br/>The lawsuit alleges Tony infringed on Bell\u2019s First Amendment rights of free speech.<br/>Reason (The Volokh Conspiracy): 12-Year-Old \u201cPolitically Vocal Boy\u201d Loses Libel Claim Against Newsweek<br/>By Eugene Volokh<br/>From\u00a0McCafferty v. Newsweek Media Group, Ltd., decided yesterday by the Third Circuit, written by Judge Stephanos Bibas and joined by Judges Thomas Ambro and Cheryl Krause (DISCLOSURE: I filed an\u00a0amicus brief\u00a0supporting\u00a0Newsweek, on behalf of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Pennsylvania Center for the First Amendment, and with the help of UCLA School of Law student Brenna Scully):<br/>Political discourse can be bruising. People often express opinions that offend others. But the First Amendment protects virtually all of those opinions, even offensive and hurtful ones, to promote a greater good: robust political discourse. The price of free speech is putting up with all sorts of name-calling and hurtful rhetoric.<br/>C.M. is a politically vocal boy. He claims that a\u00a0Newsweek\u00a0article tarred him, at age twelve, by accusing him of \u201cdefending raw racism and sexual abuse.\u201d But the article contained derogatory opinions based only on disclosed facts, which are not enough to show defamation or false light. Even if they could, C.M. does not plead facts showing actual malice, which the First Amendment requires of those who step into the political spotlight. So the District Court dismissed his claims, finding that no reasonable reader would think the article defamed him. We agree and will affirm\u2026.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Bloomberg Government: Big Tech\u2019s Favorite Law in Congress\u2019s Crosshairs (Video)<br/>By Andrew Satter<br/>In recent years, members of Congress from both parties have started to raise concerns about a nearly two-decades old law that helped create the modern internet. The law, Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, made the web a haven for free speech and free expression and gave rise to big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. Critics say it has also made the internet a breeding ground for trolls, sexual predators, misinformation, and censorship.\u00a0In this video, one of the law\u2019s original authors, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), lawyer and author, Jeff Kosseff, and Bloomberg Government\u2019s Rebecca Kern discuss what Section 230 means to the modern internet, and the law\u2019s uncertain future.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOJ</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal: Steele Dossier Disinformation Update<br/>By The Editorial Board<br/>Russia interfered in America\u2019s 2016 election, as several government reports have established. The latest disturbing news is that Russia may have received an assist from no less than the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br/>That\u2019s the takeaway of newly released portions of last year\u2019s Department of Justice Inspector General report about the FBI\u2019s investigation into Trump-Russia collusion. That report showed how the FBI abused its powers by misleading a secret court into granting surveillance warrants on the Trump campaign. Thanks to Congressional pressure, the Justice Department has now declassified footnotes showing that the FBI\u2019s main source for its collusion allegations-Christopher Steele-may have been targeted as part of a Russian disinformation campaign. The FBI was warned of this threat but ignored it.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>Washington Examiner: Breaking up Big Tech would have left us worse off during the coronavirus quarantine<br/>By Casey Given<br/>If the current pandemic has taught us anything, it\u2019s how vital our interconnected world has become.<br/>During the coronavirus and the ensuing societal lockdown, websites that once seemed somewhat trivial such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have become essential sources of information for White House livestreams, breaking news, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, and so much more\u2026<br/>So, it sure is a good thing that policymakers so far have ignored the loud cries from the likes of populists such as Sens. Josh Hawley and Elizabeth Warren to break up or heavily regulate large tech companies. We would be in a significantly weaker position during the ongoing crisis had we heeded their misguided calls to cripple the entrepreneurial freedom that has allowed the American tech industry to become the envy of the world\u2026<br/>Last June, Hawley introduced the \u201cEnding Support for Internet Censorship Act\u201d that would have required tech companies with revenues over $500 million to be certified as \u201cpolitically neutral\u201d by a board of government bureaucrats or risk losing protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 shields websites from being held liable for the content users post, such as comments, blog posts, and bad reviews.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>New York Times: Biden Is Losing the Internet. Does That Matter?<br/>By Kevin Roose<br/>In a normal election year, a former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee would have no trouble filling an arena. But the coronavirus has forced Mr. Biden to abandon in-person gatherings and adapt to an all-digital campaign strategy \u2013 a daunting pivot even in the best of times, but one made even harder by the need to compete for attention amid a pandemic and a once-in-a-generation economic collapse.<br/>The shift has been clumsy for Mr. Biden, an old-school retail politician who relishes face-to-face interactions. He lacks the social media firepower of Mr. Trump, whose 106 million combined followers on Facebook and Twitter dwarf Mr. Biden\u2019s 6.7 million, and whose White House coronavirus briefings have allowed him to commandeer the news cycle. Mr. Biden\u2019s first virtual town hall last month was marred by technical problems, and some of his other digital experiments \u2013 like a soporific campaign podcast, \u201cHere\u2019s the Deal,\u201d which did not rank among the top 100 podcasts on Apple Podcasts as of this week \u2013 have not gone as well as hoped.<br/>Online popularity doesn\u2019t always lead to electoral success. (If it did, New Yorkers would be listening to daily coronavirus briefings from Gov. Cynthia Nixon.) But underestimating the internet\u2019s influence is a mistake, too. In 2016, Mr. Trump\u2019s surging popularity among the internet\u2019s grass roots was a bellwether that indicated his candidacy might be stronger than it appeared in traditional polls. Conversely, Mr. Biden\u2019s lack of support from meme makers and viral-content mavens could signal trouble ahead.<br/>Wall Street Journal: Biden Campaign Indicates Priorities USA Is Preferred Super PAC<br/>By Ken Thomas<br/>Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign signaled Wednesday that it favors a Democratic super PAC established during the Obama era over another group formed last year as the party prepares for a general-election battle\u2026<br/>The signal that Priorities USA, which was founded in 2011, is the campaign\u2019s preferred political-action committee sends a message to top donors about where they should give money and is a key step as Mr. Biden takes charge of the Democratic fundraising infrastructure\u2026<br/>Campaigns are barred under federal campaign finance law from directly coordinating with outside groups, but candidates can appear at their events as long as they don\u2019t directly solicit donations. Mr. Biden has no plans to appear before any outside groups, according to a person familiar with his plans.<br/>Mr. Biden initially opposed any super PAC supporting him but reversed his position in October. The former vice president, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, faces a major disadvantage in fundraising compared with President Trump and will need the help of such groups to bridge the difference.<br/>Star Tribune: Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s campaign keeps husband\u2019s political firm on payroll<br/>By Torey Van Oot<br/>U.S. Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar\u2019s campaign continues to work with a political firm founded by a longtime consultant she recently married, campaign finance filings show.<br/>The Minnesota Democrat\u2019s campaign paid E Street Group, a firm founded by her husband, Tim Mynett, $292,000 for advertising, fundraising, travel and other services between January and March of this year, according to a federal campaign finance report filed Wednesday.<br/>The law doesn\u2019t prohibit hiring a spouse for a federal campaign and it\u2019s not unheard of for candidates and members of Congress to employ and pay relatives through their committees\u2026<br/>Omar\u2019s relationship with Mynett and his firm attracted scrutiny in August 2019, after Mynett\u2019s wife alleged that the consultant was having an affair with the congresswoman. The claim prompted a conservative group to file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) questioning whether the payments were for personal, not professional, travel. The FEC has taken no public action in response to the complaint.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">States &amp;Territories;</emphasis><br/>Reason (The Volokh Conspiracy): Penn. S. Ct. Rejects Free Speech Challenge to Shutdown<br/>By Eugene Volokh<br/>From the majority in\u00a0Friends of Danny DeVito v. Wolf, handed down yesterday (the three-Justice\u00a0partial dissent\u00a0expressed no opinion on this):<br/>DeVito Committee [a political campaign committee] argues the Executive Order impinges upon these constitutional guarantees, as it interferes with the right to peacefully assemble, as it closed a \u201cplace of physical operations\u201d they wish to use to \u201chold meetings and to engage in speech and advocacy.\u201d<br/>Constitutional rights to free speech and assembly, however, are not absolute, and states may place content neutral time, place, and manner regulations on speech and assembly \u201cso long as they are designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.\u201d \u2026 [T]he right of assembly and expressive association are \u201c\u2018no more absolute than the right of free speech or any other right; consequently there may be countervailing principles that prevail over the right of association[.]'\u201d<br/>There is no question that the containment and suppression of COVID-19 and the sickness and death it causes is a substantial governmental interest\u2026<br/>The Executive Order does not place a restriction on supporters of DeVito Committee to assemble with each other and speak to each other, it only forecloses doing so in the physical campaign office. It does not in any respect limit the ability to speak or assemble, however, as it does not in any respect prohibit operations by telephone, video-conferencing, or on-line through websites and otherwise. In this era, cyberspace in general and social media in particular have become the lifeblood for the exercise of First Amendment rights.<br/>I think this is the right result, but I don\u2019t entirely agree with the analysis. I think the order doesn\u2019t leave open \u201cample alternative channels\u201d for expression, especially given that the First Amendment singles out peaceable assembly as a separately protected right\u2026<br/>Techdirt: Puerto Rico Decides The 1st Amendment Doesn\u2019t Apply To Its Citizens; Criminalizes \u2018Fake News\u2019<br/>By Tim Cushing<br/>The Puerto Rican government has added onto its Public Security law to criminalize certain kinds of speech. Here\u2019s the\u00a0Committee to Protect Journalists on the island\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d law. (h/t\u00a0Sarah McLaughlin)<br/>Puerto Rico Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez signed an amendment to the island\u2019s Public Security law on April 6 making it illegal for media outlets or social media accounts \u201cto transmit or allow the transmission\u201d of \u201cfalse information\u201d relating to government proclamations or executive orders concerning COVID-19 or other disasters\u2026<br/>The government will apparently be the final arbiter on the truthiness of transmitted information\u2026<br/>[I]t makes it illegal for media outlets or social media accounts \u201cto transmit or allow the transmission\u201d of \u201cfalse information with the intention of creating confusion, panic, or public hysteria, with regards to any proclamation or executive order declaring an emergency, disaster or curfew.\u201d \u2026<br/>As the CPJ notes, this doesn\u2019t just violate the Constitution, it makes it more difficult for journalists to cover the pandemic as it unfolds. A lack of solid information isn\u2019t the same thing as misinformation, but criminalizing speech the government feels is inaccurate (and costs money to respond to) is only going to result in\u00a0less\u00a0information being spread. \u201cFake news\u201d laws tend to do\u00a0collateral damage\u00a0to non-fake news reporting as reporters in the middle of unfolding events opt to self-censor, rather than run the risk of being prosecuted.\u00a0<br/>DCist: A City Agency Removed 250 Campaign Signs For A D.C. Council Challenger. Officials Say It Was An \u2018Honest Mistake\u2019<br/>By Andrew Giambrone<br/>A District government agency last week removed hundreds of campaign signs showing support for an upstart political candidate who\u2019s challenging a well-funded D.C. councilmember in the June Democratic primary. The agency now says the mass removal of 248 signs from street poles was an \u201chonest mistake\u201d by new employees, but its account of the incident has shifted since reporters and the candidate\u2019s campaign began asking questions.<br/>The D.C. Department of Public Works says it was responsible for removing the signs, which displayed the name of Janeese Lewis George, a former attorney for the District government, and had been posted on major corridors in Ward 4, where George is running against incumbent Brandon Todd. George\u2019s were the only campaign signs taken down during the incident, even though Todd and third Democratic candidate Marlena Edwards also have campaign signs posted throughout the city\u2019s northernmost ward\u2026<br/>Although most of George\u2019s signs have since been restored, only 150 of the 248 that were taken down were salvageable, according to the department\u2026<br/>When George\u2019s campaign followed up with DPW, the department said a new driver had removed the campaign signs and that someone had \u201csubmitted a service request for an illegal poster, which do fall under us\u201d \u2026<br/>\u201cSomeone absolutely needs to explain this,\u201d George stated at the time. \u201cPolitical speech is not supposed to be censored by government agencies in any way. Full stop.\u201d<br/>Reason: Raleigh Police Department: \u2018Protesting Is a Non-Essential Activity\u2019<br/>By C.J. Ciaramella<br/>In response to a protest calling for North Carolina\u2019s economy to reopen yesterday, the Raleigh Police Department arrested at least one person for violating the state\u2019s stay-at-home orders.<br/>But wait, don\u2019t you have a constitutional right to assemble? Not so fast, says the Raleigh Police Department\u2026<br/>This blithe assertion that fundamental First Amendment activities are \u201cnon-essential\u201d did not go over well, to put it mildly.<br/>\u201cEnforcement of emergency orders should not exacerbate racial disparities and should not lead to custodial arrest unless doing so is the last resort, because arresting people and sending them to jail is antithetical to public health,\u201d Kristie Graunke, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, says. \u201cThe goal of enforcement should be to facilitate long-term compliance rather than to punish non-compliance.\u201d<br/>\u201cEven under emergency orders, the First Amendment right to protected speech, including protest speech, remain in effect,\u201d Graunke continues. \u201cBut government officials may temporarily limit in-person gatherings in circumstances where medical and scientific experts agree that assemblies of people pose an immediate and grave risk to public health. Any public health measure limiting civil liberties must be re-evaluated when the medical and scientific consensus changes.\u201d \u2026<br/>Gathering in crowds right now is not a good idea. It\u2019s a stupid and potentially deadly one.

Comey, the former F.B.I. director who released a memoir describing his relationship with Mr. Trump this week.<br/>But he diverged briefly to discuss a report that a former Federal Election Commission chairman, Bradley Smith, did not think Mr. Cohen should be charged over his payment to Ms. Clifford.</p><p><br/>\"Smith is arguing that Cohen's payment is a perfectly legitimate business move,\" Mr. Hannity said, \"and that any attempt to connect it to an in-kind contribution is an extreme stretch. It doesn't fit.\"<br/>Then Mr. Hannity turned back to other news.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Courthouse News Service: Minor Party Fights New York's Campaign-Finance Limits<br/>By Matt Reynolds<br/>The Upstate Jobs Party sued officials with the New York State Board of Elections, claiming campaign-finance limits favor the major political parties and constrain those that do not have party status but are competing for state offices.<br/>On Friday, founder Martin Babinec and chairman John Bullis joined their party in filing a complaint in Utica federal court against members of the New York State Board of Elections, alleging state laws have \"tilted the playing field\" in favor of the two major political parties while stifling \"new organizations with new ideas.\"<br/>The Upstate Jobs Party - which says it advocates for well-paying jobs, \"transparency in government and an end to corporate welfare\" - claims New York's campaign-finance limits are preventing it from contributing as much money as it would like to its political campaigns, including this year's race for governor.<br/>\"Plaintiffs seek to ensure equal access to the New York State electoral process, by removing restrictions on political donations that disparately impact political organizations that have different political ideas from state-sanctioned political parties like the Democratic and Republican parties,\" the 28-page filing states.<br/>Represented by attorney Jason Torchinsky of Holtzman Vogel, the minor party alleges that the state \"selectively applied\" campaign-finance limits in violation of the First Amendment and the group's equal-protection rights under the 14th Amendment.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Concurring Opinions: FAN 188 (First Amendment News)UW Law profs release letter re applicable law governing security fees on college campuses<br/>By Ronald K.L. Collins<br/>The controversy that prompted the letter involved the University's attempt to impose a fee of at least $17,000 on the College Republicans, this in connection with an event hosted by them on February 10, 2018. The group invited Joey Gibson, a controversial speaker who heads an organization known as Patriot Prayer, to speak on that date...<br/>The University of Washington now plans to change its protocol regarding student-hosted events so that student organizations will not be charged for any security measures needed to protect the students, an invited speaker, or other guests from counter-protesters.<br/>I thought this letter, prepared largely by Professor Eric Schnapper and endorsed by 22 others (including myself), was sufficiently important to post it in its entirety, including endnotes. The letter makes a strong case for First Amendment protection. Equally important, it also reveals how in the past First Amendment law was invoked to protect minority rights in contexts where unruly individuals or crowds sought to silence civil rights demonstrators or where fines or fees were imposed on civil rights groups.<br/>Finally, the UW Law letter provides an informative guide to much of the existing law concerning free speech rights and security fees. In that regard, it should be useful to college administrators, lawyers representing colleges, lawyers representing students and speakers, and to student organizations in general, among others.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>Axios: After Zuck, Congress gets busy with privacy bills<br/>By David McCabe<br/>Lawmakers fired up by Mark Zuckerberg's testimony are homing in on privacy as their Big Tech target, with most active attempts to regulate the industry focusing on companies' use of consumer data...<br/>It's not all privacy.\u00a0The Honest Ads Act increase the disclosure requirements for online political ads. There's been a push to pass it ahead of the midterms, and it has picked up endorsements from Facebook and Twitter.<br/>But, but, but:\u00a0Even with the pressure on the companies, no proposal has gained the traction needed to become law. That only becomes harder as the midterms get closer and lawmakers turn their attention from legislating to keeping their jobs.<br/>Fox News: Facebook has been censoring or suppressing conservative speech for years<br/>By Sen. Ted Cruz<br/>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) states: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"<br/>This is a good provision. It means that, for example, if you run a blogging platform and someone posts a terrorist threat in the comments section, you're not treated as the person making the threat. Without Section 230, many social media networks could be functionally unable to operate.<br/>In order to be protected by Section 230, companies like Facebook should be \"neutral public forums.\" On the flip side, they should be considered to be a \"publisher or speaker\" of user content if they pick and choose what gets published or spoken.<br/>As I expressed to Mark Zuckerberg, as a private business Facebook has a clear First Amendment right to publish whatever it wants on its website within the bounds of the law. The company can support political causes and oppose ones it disagrees with, just like a private citizen can speak his or her mind or agitate against opposing views.<br/>But if Facebook is busy censoring legal, protected speech for political reasons, the company should be held accountable for the posts it lets through. And it should not enjoy any special congressional immunity from liability for its actions.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>Quartz: What Facebook should fear most isn't future regulation-it's what's already here<br/>By Janet Guyon<br/>FOSTA is the first major revision to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act passed two decades ago that allowed websites such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter, to flourish by protecting them from civil liability for what people posted on their sites...<br/>\"The newly enacted law holds all internet services accountable for some portion of user content,\" Goldman says. \"And because internet services can't figure out which content complies and which doesn't, the law is actually regulating everything.\" Without adequate AI tools or enough people to review content, the law is forcing all websites into self-censorship. \"That is why it is so pernicious,\" Goldman added. He predicts smaller websites will either go out of business or never start up...<br/>But the real existential threat to Facebook, Goldman says, is the current campaign to attack so-called \"fake news.\" ...<br/>The US, of course, retains a First Amendment right to free speech and freedom of the press, but the early moves to force websites to take responsibility for a portion of their content is likely to have a chilling effect. Without the exemption that made Facebook possible, the US would probably not have the plethora of online review sites like Rotten Tomatoes, Foursquare, or Yelp.<br/>And certainly, Mr. President, we would not have Twitter.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Phoenix New Times: Postcards Prompt FEC Complaint Against Hiral Tipirneni's Campaign in CD8<br/>By\u00a0\u00a0Joseph Flaherty<br/>Arizona's Public Integrity Alliance alleges that the volunteer-run Postcards to Voters group and Tipirneni's campaign violated campaign-finance law governing in-kind contributions and coordination by sending postcards promoting Tipirneni to households in the state's 8th Congressional District...<br/>Postcards to Voters promotes Democratic candidates by mailing handwritten postcards to likely Democratic voters in contested elections, according to the group's website. The initiative began in March 2017 during a hotly contested Georgia special election. But because the group is not registered as a political-action committee, the Public Integrity Alliance says that its volunteer activity amounts to illegal coordination and unaccountable in-kind campaign contributions...<br/>The Alliance's complaint alleges that because the postcard drive likely cost more than $1,000 in postage and other costs, Postcards to Voters should have registered with the FEC as a political committee and reported its spending on an effort designed to elect Tipirneni...<br/>The complaint from the Alliance also argues that Postcards to Voters violated FEC regulations by having volunteers take phrases directly from candidates and their campaigns and put them into their handwritten messages.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>WKRN Nashville: Social media ad disclosure bill fails in Tennessee<br/>By\u00a0Associated Press<br/>A Tennessee bill that would require the disclosure of who paid for political ads on social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook is likely dead for the year after failing to get enough votes in the House on Monday.<br/>The state Senate passed the measure last month. However, the bill couldn't get the support of a majority of members of the House. The main sponsors of the legislation were Jason Powell and Jeff Yarbro, both Democrats from Nashville. The House voted 43-33. An additional 14 members were present but didn't vote. There was little debate before the vote, so it's not clear why House members rejected the measure.<br/>The bill would have required the disclosure on the ad itself, at another linked site or on the profile page of the social media platform...<br/>Yarbro has said Tennessee law currently implicitly requires disclosure for social media, but the bill would have made it explicit.<br/>New York Times: How New Yorkers Could Put Albany to Work Again<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>A working Democratic majority in the Senate could show political courage by taking on the state's campaign finance laws, essentially one giant loophole that helps promote Albany's dysfunction. They could start by ending New York's L.L.C. scam: As the rules stand, a donor can brazenly contribute as much as he or she wants to a candidate by creating multiple limited liability companies that separately funnel money to a single campaign. The Democrats should also enact comprehensive public financing of campaigns, a measure Senate Republicans have blocked that would encourage competition in state elections.<br/>Kansas City Star: AG Hawley: Greitens committed 'potentially criminal acts' involving veterans charity<br/>By Jason Hancock, Lindsay Wise, and Bryan Lowry<br/>Attorney General Josh Hawley announced Tuesday that his office has uncovered potential criminal wrongdoing by Gov. Eric Greitens, a fellow Republican, and has turned that evidence over to the St. Louis prosecutor.<br/>Hawley said that during an investigation into the Mission Continues, a charity founded by Greitens, his office \"uncovered evidence of wrongdoing that goes beyond Missouri's charity laws\" and indicates \"potentially criminal acts were committed by Gov. Eric Greitens.\"<br/>Hawley, who is a candidate for U.S. Senate, said his team found evidence that Greitens allegedly obtained and transmitted the charity's donor list for political fundraising. He said there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the charity, only by the governor.<br/>\"And he did all of this without permission of the Mission Continues,\" Hawley said.<br/>In These Times: Law Enforcement Has Quietly Backed Anti-Protest Bills in at Least 8 States Since Trump's Election<br/>By Simon Davis-Cohen and\u00a0Sarah Lazare<br/>According to research conducted for In These Times in partnership with Ear to the Ground, law enforcement in at least eight states-Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington and Wyoming-lobbied on behalf of anti-protest bills in 2017 and 2018. The bills ran the gamut from punishing face coverings at protests to increasing penalties for \"economic disruption\" and highway blockage to criminalizing civil protests that interfere with \"critical infrastructure\" like oil pipelines.<br/>Emboldened by the Trump administration, at least 31 states have considered 62 pieces of anti-protest legislation since November 2016, with at least seven enacted and 31 still pending.<br/>KTAR News Arizona: Phoenix amendment requiring ID of dark money donors moves forward<br/>By Kathy Cline<br/>The city's Sustainability, Housing, Efficiency, and Neighborhoods subcommittee unanimously decided to move forward with a city-charter amendment requiring the identification of independent groups and donors in city elections, councilmember Kate Gallego said Tuesday...<br/>That change requires all groups spending more than $1,000 on local races to disclose their donors and organization name. The \"Sunshine Ordinance\" is aimed to eliminate independent groups' anonymous political spending - often dubbed \"dark money\" - in local elections...<br/>On April 5, Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill banning local governments from requiring non-profits, the most common type of organization donating to political campaigns, to disclose their funding sources. Supporters say donors to political groups have a right to remain anonymous for fear of harassment.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-1904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2209\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 18, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

That\u2019s not only a bad idea but an incredibly dangerous one.<br/>Legal experts note that these bills and laws-which 38 states have considered and 21 have passed-threaten democracy at large by scaring the public into silence on key issues like climate change. What\u2019s more, state legislators in Kentucky, South Dakota, and West Virginia have stealthily passed anti-protest laws during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><br/>\u201cThe most important point there is that the government should not be exploiting this temporary situation to make long-lasting decisions, including passing legislation, while knowing that the community is unable to be as vocal as it likely would be in opposition to these sorts of measures, whether that\u2019s by physically being able to gather in protest\u2026 or simply by reaching out to legislators or being able to provide testimony,\u201d Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told Earther.<br/>Washington Post: The pursuit of liberty does not mean a license to endanger others<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>Public fatigue with stay-at-home orders to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic is inevitable and understandable. Not understandable, nor forgivable, is the president of the United States inciting disrespect for his own government\u2019s guidelines, which are unquestionably essential for the public health\u2026<br/>The protesters in the United States carried signs such as \u201cLive Free or Die in Lockdown\u201d and \u201cRe-Open Now.\u201d Some of them set a bad example, without masks or social distancing. But what was most concerning was the message that somehow all this sacrifice can be quickly abandoned in the name of liberty and rights. This is wrong. The pursuit of liberty does not mean a license to endanger the lives of others.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Media\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Washington Post: The Trump administration is muzzling government scientists. It\u2019s essential to let them speak candidly to the press again.<br/>By Margaret Sullivan<br/>Kathryn Foxhall remembers a time when reporters could call up any doctor or researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ask them questions on the record. A journalist might even get them to open up for a \u201cbackground\u201d interview, offering candid information on the condition the expert\u2019s name would not be used.<br/>\u201cThere was the official story and then there was everything else,\u201d the former editor of the Nation\u2019s Health, an industry publication, told me\u2026<br/>Foxhall watched with dismay as that openness disintegrated radically over the past two decades. Federal agencies, including the CDC, began to require media inquiries to go through a public information officer. Direct contact was minimized and tightly monitored. Interviews might take place with a \u201cminder\u201d present.<br/>When the coronavirus pandemic arrived, the situation got much worse.<br/>Suddenly, the filter between journalists and experts became even more opaque \u2013 and much more politicized. Who got to speak publicly, including to the news media, was controlled by Vice President Pence\u2019s office after he was put in charge of the administration\u2019s pandemic response.<br/>The new restrictions are dangerous, said Anna Diakun, staff attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which this month sued the CDC for the release of records about White House and CDC policies that may keep the agency\u2019s employees from speaking to the press and public\u2026<br/>She told me what\u2019s happening amounts to a \u201cgag order\u201d on the very experts that the public needs to hear from directly. And it may be a violation of constitutionally protected free speech.<br/>Cato: How JFK Censored Right-Wing Radio<br/>By Paul Matzko<br/>In the early 1960s, President Kennedy\u2019s administration launched one of the most successful censorship campaigns in U.S. history. The subjects of Kennedy\u2019s ire were conservative radio broadcasters, who constantly attacked the administration\u2019s policy proposals. Worried about his reelection chances, Kennedy instructed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to target the offending broadcasters with tax audits and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Within a few years, this censorship campaign had driven conservative broadcasters off hundreds of radio stations; it would be more than a decade before the end of the Fairness Doctrine enabled the resurgence of political talk radio.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal: Facebook Puts Limits on Protest Organizers<br/>By Georgia Wells and Andrew Restuccia<br/>Facebook is banning posts and groups promoting anti-lockdown protests that don\u2019t comply with government health directives, as organizers of those events seek to recruit new members on social media\u2026<br/>Facebook\u2019s prohibition doesn\u2019t explicitly target posts promoting anti-lockdown protests; rather the company said it is barring content that advocates for in-person gatherings that don\u2019t follow government health guidance. A spokeswoman for the social media giant said it is also taking down claims designed to discourage treatment for coronavirus infection or taking appropriate precautions against its spread.<br/>Facebook removed content related to anti-lockdown protests planned in California, New Jersey and Nebraska.<br/>\u201cUnless government prohibits the event during this time, we allow it to be organized on Facebook,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cFor this same reason, events that defy government\u2019s guidance on social distancing aren\u2019t allowed on Facebook.\u201d \u2026<br/>While some governors have asked protesters to stay home, President Donald Trump expressed his support for their actions in tweets over the weekend.<br/>Politico: Coronavirus protests test Facebook\u2019s free speech pledges<br/>By Steven Overly<br/>Facebook\u2019s partial takedowns [of content promoting\u00a0protests]\u00a0were still enough to bring a political brushback from some Republicans\u2026<br/>President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., accused Facebook of \u201ccolluding with state governments to quash peoples free speech,\u201d calling its actions \u201cchilling &amp;disturbing;.\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) asked rhetorically of the company\u2019s decision: \u201cBecause free speech is now illegal America?\u201d<br/>\u201cGiven Big Tech\u2019s history of bias and censorship, I\u2019m deeply concerned that they and government officials are partnering not to protect public health, but to shut down views with which they disagree,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in a statement Monday evening. \u201cNow, more than ever, companies like Facebook should focus on connecting people, not shutting down communities because they hold different views.\u201d<br/>But Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal praised the company\u2019s move Monday night, tweeting: \u201cPowerful special interests are using astroturfing &amp;dangerous; tactics to undermine the fight against COVID-19. Facebook is right to take a stand against harmful misinformation.\u201d \u2026<br/>\u201cFacebook, which controls a platform for the speech of billions, should not be censoring political speech online,\u201d said Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, despite the public-health stakes at play on mass gatherings held during a pandemic. \u201cThis is especially true now, when questions of when and how to reopen the country are among the central political questions, and online platforms are the main vehicle for expression.\u201d<br/>American Prospect: From Virtue Signaling to Politics<br/>By Micah L. Sifry<br/>A decade and a half ago, many of us thought that the rise of personal computing and the openness of the web would lead to the democratization of politics. We celebrated how ordinary citizens made use of these tools. We cheered as bloggers challenged powerful politicians and we evangelized for social media, telling everyone we knew that they had to get on Facebook and Twitter. There have been many beneficial outcomes from the rise of the networked age, no doubt. Groups that were previously marginalized by mainstream media, especially women and people of color, now have more voice. Candidates who choose to avoid dependence on big money, such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have learned how to amass small donors and run for office with fewer constraints.<br/>But as the authors of two valuable new books, Eitan Hersh of Politics Is for Power, and Sabeel Rahman and Hollie Russon Gilman of Civic Power, make clear, merely opening up the media floodgates and lowering the barriers to participation have not led to the power shifts the early evangelists for tech-enabled democracy expected. Meaningful participation, the kind that ensures that ordinary people can influence the decisions that affect their lives, requires far greater attention to how power is organized and structured.<br/>Washington Post: The Technology 202: Coronavirus could change how social networks approach public health<br/>By Cat Zakrzewski<br/>The coronavirus is transforming how social networks approach public health, and some of those changes will persist even after the pandemic is over. <br/>YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki told CNN\u00a0that the virus has been \u201can acceleration of our digital lives.\u201d It\u2019s also accelerating changes at the video-streaming service, which is now doing more to spread authoritative public health information \u2013 changes Wojcicki said may have otherwise been years away\u2026<br/>YouTube has been adjusting its policies to make sure it\u2019s blocking the latest falsehoods gaining traction online. For instance, the company recently prohibited videos making false claims that 5G is the source of the coronavirus\u2026<br/>But actually enforcing these policies and removing the videos is a major challenge. Especially because the crisis forced the companies to send many of their content moderators home. YouTube and Facebook have been relying more on machines to do content moderation, which are not yet as equipped as people to make difficult decisions about what posts violate company policies. <br/>The companies have acknowledged this could lead to more mistakes, both in leaving up content that should be removed and over policing posts that don\u2019t break the rules. That could cause major problems as more people are spending more time online while stuck at home. <br/>Reason (Volokh Conspiracy): Attempt to Vanish (Cubed) Post Critical of the Sandy Hook Hoax Libel Judgment<br/>By\u00a0Eugene Volokh<br/>Lenny Pozner, the father of a boy (Noah Pozner) killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, sued James Fetzer and Mike Palacek, who co-wrote the book \u201cNobody Died at Sandy Hook.\u201d \u2026<br/>Pozner said this libeled him, and in June 2019 a Wisconsin judge agreed, and granted Pozner summary judgment on liability. In October, the jury awarded Pozner $450,000 in damages, and in December, the judge issued an injunction barring Fetzer \u201cfrom communicating by any means\u201d these libelous statements\u2026<br/>But in October, a request was submitted to Google, in Pozner\u2019s name, seeking to deindex material that simply discussed the case and criticized the court decision\u2026 The court\u2019s judgment of course didn\u2019t find these items (posted in response to the judgment) to be libelous, and it offers no basis for Google to deindex them.<br/>In November, I\u00a0wrote about this, and in January I learned that Amazon Web Services had gotten a takedown demand (which Amazon didn\u2019t act on) to remove that post. So I\u00a0wrote about that, and today I learned that Google had gotten a request to deindex that post, also submitted under the name \u201cLeonard Pozner.\u201d So we now have an attempt to vanish a post about an attempt to vanish a post about an attempt to vanish posts critical of the Sandy Hook hoax libel judgment\u2026<br/>Of course, there\u2019s no real basis for this deindexing request\u2026\u00a0My posts do criticize the earlier vanishing requests, but of course nothing in the court order can preclude such criticism, or purports to preclude such criticism.<br/>I\u2019m pretty sure Google won\u2019t do anything about this deindexing request, but I thought I\u2019d mention it just to illustrate how some people are trying to vanish criticism from the Internet.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PACs\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Roll Call: Trips to ski slopes, beaches and golf courses popular with House leadership PACs<br/>By Chris Marquette<br/>House and Senate members use leadership PACs to raise and spend money separately from their principal campaign accounts. Created before courts opened the door to the super PACs that are not subject to contribution limits, leadership PACs were intended to be for \u201cparty building,\u201d a way for members to tap their networks to raise money for their parties and other House and Senate candidates.<br/>Yet one study found some lawmakers spend so much raising money, there\u2019s not always much left to give away.<br/>Lawmakers are prohibited from using political contributions for personal use and must be able to verify the resources were appropriately spent.<br/>But to Robert Maguire, research director at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, leadership PACs are \u201cslush funds.\u201d<br/>Michael Beckel, research director at the the advocacy group Issue One, sees them as a prime example of why rules need to be tightened.<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the political fundraising industry is capitalizing off of a broken political system in which wealthy donors get special access to lawmakers under the guise of fundraising events in which they are enjoying ski trips or fishing trips or fine wine and food together,\u201d he said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Politico: Bloomberg\u2019s final bill: $1B for a 104-day campaign<br/>By Zach Montellaro<br/>Mike Bloomberg ended his ill-fated presidential bid on March 4, but his campaign still shelled out nine figures last month anyway, taking his total spending over $1 billion in a losing run for the Democratic nomination.<br/>The billionaire\u2019s campaign spent $176 million in March, according to the campaign finance report Bloomberg filed with the FEC on Monday. That pushed his spending north of $1 billion for a campaign that lasted a bit over four months.<br/>It isn\u2019t unusual for campaigns to spend some money after they end \u2013 but the staggering size of Bloomberg\u2019s post-dropout spending illustrates the unusual scale of his campaign, which ultimately saw the media mogul win only one contest: American Samoa. He did net delegates on Super Tuesday as well, but he spent more than $17 million for each delegate acquired.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>San Diego Union-Tribune: Why weren\u2019t protesters cited despite stay-home orders? Officials point to a \u2018delicate balance\u2019<br/>By David Hernandez<br/>Despite a ban on gatherings, scores of protesters frustrated with stay-home orders intended to fight the spread of COVID-19 took to the streets in San Diego and Encinitas over the weekend.<br/>Many stood within six feet of others and didn\u2019t wear masks, flouting public-health measures.<br/>Although San Diego police and county Sheriff\u2019s Department officials have issued warnings about shifting from education to enforcement of local and state orders, and followed through with more than 100 citations in recent weeks, no one was cited during either protest over the weekend.<br/>Some observers questioned why\u2026<br/>San Diego police and county Sheriff\u2019s Department officials offered an explanation Monday, saying in a joint statement that they are attempting to maintain a \u201cdelicate balance\u201d between respecting people\u2019s First Amendment right to protest and enforcing laws that aim to protect the public.<br/>In the statement, the departments left open the possibility that protesters, particularly organizers, could still be prosecuted.<br/>\u201cWhile no citations were issued at the protests, that does not mean prosecution will not be sought, especially to the organizers of these events,\u201d the statement read.<br/>Associated Press: Lt. Gov. Forest uses campaign money for COVID-19 help<br/>By Gary D. Robertson<br/>Lt. Gov. Dan Forest has given nearly $200,000 from his gubernatorial campaign fund to people and businesses needing assistance due to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, according to his campaign committee.<br/>Forest campaign manager Hal Weatherman disclosed the donations on Monday in a video in which he criticized Democratic incumbent Roy Cooper for a recent fundraising plea by his campaign. The two won their primaries last month and will face each other in the fall.<br/>As Cooper was \u201cpressuring people to help you meet your political fundraising goals, (Forest) gave targeted financial assistance directly from his campaign account,\u201d Weatherman said. \u201cMost of the people he assisted he had never met. Most did not even know he was the lieutenant governor or running for governor of this great state.\u201d \u2026<br/>Forest campaign spokesman Andrew Dunn said state law allowed Forest to expend campaign funds as donations to individuals and businesses. He cited provisions allowing expenditures resulting from being a candidate and holding public office, as well as donations to charity. Dunn also cited a 2006 opinion from the then-state elections director saying it\u2019s permissible to give \u201cgifts\u201d under certain circumstances.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 4/21 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-97609</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YR5-8X31-JBJN-M0VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Jurisdiction</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg0OUQ4QzVBOTdFNDY2RTlBN0YwQTVBNjA4NDVGRTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The Supreme Court agrees, as do most lower courts. But a few states do deny non-institutional-media speakers the same First Amendment protections that the institutional media gets; and Minnesota is one of them.</p><p><br/>Thus, in the recent Maethner v. Someplace Safe, Inc., the Minnesota Court of Appeals held that a libel plaintiff could recover presumed damages (i.e., damages not supported by specific evidence of lost business opportunities or other harms stemming from injury to reputation) even without a showing that the defendants knew the statements were false or likely false. In Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), the Supreme Court held that this was not allowed when it comes to statements on matter of public concern, even when the plaintiff is a private figure. But Minnesota precedents say that this doesn't apply to speech outside the institutional media.<br/>Here, Someplace Safe (\"a nonprofit organization that provides advocacy and other services for victims of violence and domestic abuse\") gave a \"Survivor Award\" to a woman, and published an article by the woman in which she described her \"surviving domestic violence.\" Her ex-husband sued... The appellate court let the case go forward, reasoning partly that \"[t]he media, and related concerns to protect constitutional rights under the First Amendment, were not involved.\"<br/>The defendants have recently asked the Minnesota Supreme Court to review the case, and I filed an application to file an amicus brief...<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>Politico: Watchdog sues Paul Ryan-aligned dark money group<br/>By Maggie Severns<br/>The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued the nonprofit American Action Network on Monday, the latest turn in a quest to reclassify the Paul Ryan-aligned nonprofit as a political committee and force it to reveal its secret donor list.<br/>The lawsuit, which ramps up CREW's complaint against AAN after the Federal Election Commission twice voted not to act, could offer an unusual window into the inner workings of one of the country's largest political nonprofits.<br/>CREW is alleging that AAN violated campaign law by operating as a political committee - using most of its resources to air campaign-related ads and otherwise support Republican candidates for Congress from 2009 to 2011 - while registering as a social welfare organization...<br/>FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub - who is currently the only Democrat on the commission - released a public statement last week saying she believed her colleagues at the FEC would find more ways to stall progress on the CREW complaint.<br/>She encouraged CREW to use a clause in federal law that she said has never been fully utilized in order to bypass the commission and directly sue AAN, and she even implied she would stall the FEC behind the scenes in order to clear a path for CREW to sue.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>Axios: Americans don't trust tech companies on data privacy<br/>By Kim Hart<br/>[T]he survey also finds that the majority of people want government to do more to regulate Big Tech, especially social media companies...<br/>65% support the Honest Ads Act requiring political advertisements on social media to list who paid for them, just like political ads on radio, print and TV...<br/>38% think the federal government isn't capable of regulating large tech companies, while 31% think it is capable.<br/>Bottom line: A majority (58%) of people believe regulation of Facebook and other social media companies is inevitable. But it's not clear they trust the government to get it right: 49% say of congressional representatives do not understand how Facebook works.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Washington Post: Sen. Kamala Harris spurns corporate PAC donations, joining other 2020 hopefuls<br/>By John Wagner<br/>Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) said Monday that she will no longer accept donations from corporate political action committees, a shift in her public position from just a few weeks ago.<br/>With Harris's new stance, announced during a radio interview, she joins a handful of other progressive Democratic senators who are also considered possible 2020 presidential candidates in pledging not to take PAC money.<br/>\"Money has now really tipped the balance between an individual having equal power in an election to a corporation,\" Harris said on the New York radio show \"The Breakfast Club.\"<br/>She cited the impact of the Citizens United case, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2010. It \"basically means that big corporations can spend unlimited amounts of money influencing a campaign,\" she said.<br/>At a town hall in California this month, Harris was asked by an audience member if she would turn down donations offered by a corporation or corporate lobbyist.<br/>\"Well, it depends. It depends,\" Harris said, prompting the audience member to respond: \"Wrong answer.\" ...<br/>Others in the Senate who have made similar pledges not to take corporate PAC money include Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).<br/>USA Today: This PAC wants to help you 'fire' your member of Congress<br/>By\u00a0Marilyn Icsman<br/>Fire Your Congressman is a nonpartisan campaign fundraising organization that wants to help elect new candidates that normally wouldn't have a chance against powerful incumbents.<br/>Founder Norbert Richter decided to start Fire Your Congressman after he considered running as a primary challenger against Rep.Ted Yoho, R-Fla. Richter said he found that the party inhibited challengers to the sitting representative by restricting fundraising opportunities and chances to engage with the incumbent in debates...<br/>People can donate money to a \"pool\" that works against a specific member of Congress. You can also donate to a general fund that targets five Democrats and five Republicans that are determined to be the highest priority to fire, based on an algorithm...<br/>Having funds available for challengers can help give them a foothold and make their campaigns more successful, Richter said. Fire Your Congressman is mainly for people to express their dissatisfaction with a representative and start to contribute against them even before an opposing candidate announces their run...<br/>The group also allows donors to work against an incumbent while still maintaining their relationships with them, Richter said. The PAC has to report the names of anyone who donates more than $200, but there is no method to report who the money is working against. According to Richer, this is important for some donors, like small businesses, who still want to work with the incumbent in Congress, but would prefer a different candidate in office.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>PennLive: Want to fix Harrisburg? Start by approving these campaign finance reform bills<br/>By Editorial Board<br/>Late last month, Gov. Tom Wolf, joined by his Democratic allies in the state House and Senate, rolled out a comprehensive suite of reforms aimed at restoring public trust in the electoral process and to limit the influence of special interests in state politics...<br/>The House bill, sponsored by Minority Leader Frank Dermody, D-Allegheny, would, among other things, impose hard caps on contributions...<br/>The bill would also require so-called groups that make uncoordinated expenditures on behalf of candidates and campaigns to disclose those contributions...<br/>Separate legislation, sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Allegheny, would limit election expenditures to \"the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election, to expenses directly and exclusively incurred for the campaign in which the candidate is running in the contemporaneous election cycle and not for any personal purpose. The legislation also addresses acceptance of campaign contributions from out-of-state committees.\"<br/>Costa's bill would similarly crack down on independent expenditure groups, and would, like Dermody's proposal, require corporations to notify shareholders when political expenditures (through political action committees) are made on their behalf. The bills also would require companies to seek shareholder permission for contributions of $10,000 or more.<br/>U.S. News &amp; World Report: Fundraising, Ethics Upfront in Lieutenant Governor's Primary<br/>By Mallory Moench, AP<br/>Three million dollars have poured into the Alabama lieutenant governor's race as four candidates vie for a statewide position with limited responsibilities other than succeeding the governor...<br/>The lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate, but only casts a vote in the event of a tie. He or she serves on two dozen committees and appoints more than 400 state positions. The primary responsibility is succeeding the governor if he or she dies, resigns or is impeached...<br/>Beyond fundraising, ethics is a top issue in the race as the Legislature looks to review the state's ethics law next year and lawmakers currently face corruption charges.<br/>Baltimore Sun: Baltimore City Council to consider public financing of city elections<br/>By Ian Duncan<br/>Councilman Kristerfer Burnett's charter amendment bill is the first step toward creating a fund that would provide matching public funds for money individual donors contribute to candidates.<br/>If the bill is approved by the council, voters would be asked in November whether to change the city charter to allow for public financing and to create an 11-member commission to oversee the public money available for candidates...<br/>Under the bill, only candidates who agree to accept individual donations of less than $150 would be eligible for matching funds from the city. Individuals currently can contribute up to $6,000 to a local political campaign.<br/>The proposal would offer qualifying candidates some multiple of an individual's donation. Supporters propose that donations of up to $25 would be boosted seven times - so a $10 donation would draw $70 in public funds. The multipliers would diminish as donations increase in size...<br/>The bill - co-sponsored by eight other council members - calls for establishing a revenue source for the proposed \"Fair Election Fund\" through an annual budgeted allocation, dedicating certain fines, fees and surcharges, and grants or donations.<br/>The council would have to consider another piece of legislation to make funds available. That legislation is expected to be introduced in coming weeks.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-3213</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1765\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 24, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0003POR</classCode><className>WELCH INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS541820 PUBLIC RELATIONS AGENCIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC8743 PUBLIC RELATIONS AGENCIES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Still, they suggest such aggressive measures may not serve the public interest. </p><p>In fact, they may backfire in some cases\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Keating, president of the D.C.-based Institute for Free Speech, says blindly supporting government dictums can do a disservice to the public at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTo this day in the U.K. the official guidance is not to wear a mask [to prevent coronavirus transmission],\u201d Keating says, citing Taiwan\u2019s more successful pandemic fight credited in part by mask use. \u201cBasically, the government is lying to people \u2026 they don\u2019t want them buying medical-grade masks.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned over history is that governments often lie,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd WHO, while not being a government, shares many of the same characteristics.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keating suggests blindly following conventional wisdom can lead to other ill effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat would have happened if these platforms had these kind of policies, blindly following government advice, in the Jim Crow era?\u201d he asks. \u201cWould they have taken down NAACP videos?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New from the Institute for Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay-at-Home Orders and Freedom of Assembly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ryan Morrison and Alex Baiocco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Kentucky recently declared \u201cconstitutional rights still exist\u201d and ruled that a mayor\u2019s pandemic-related executive order violated the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While constitutional rights can\u2019t be extinguished, temporary orders to protect public health, if neutrally applied, can prohibit people from gathering in the same physical space. In New Mexico, a federal judge rejected a First Amendment challenge to the state\u2019s limit on the number of people who may gather in one building, holding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;The right to expressive association is not an absolute right and can be infringed upon if that infringement is (i) unrelated to the suppression of expressive association; (ii) due to a compelling government interest; and (iii) narrowly tailored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether speech or assembly is for religious or secular purposes, government constraints on First Amendment activity in times of crisis still must face strict judicial scrutiny. As the federal judge in Kentucky noted, even as government pursues \u201ca compelling interest of the highest order through its efforts to contain the current pandemic,\u201d its efforts must be \u201c\u2018narrowly tailored to advance that interest.'\u201d Government cannot be \u201cselective\u201d in how it burdens First Amendment conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: U.S. judge strikes down prohibitions on political speech for 1,100 federal court workers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Spencer S. Hsu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. judge Wednesday prohibited an administrative agency for the federal judiciary from barring its 1,100 employees from engaging in virtually all forms of partisan political activity outside the workplace. The judge called the ban an excessive effort to protect courts from \u201chyper-partisanship\u201d and attacks from members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Christopher R. \u201cCasey\u201d Cooper of Washington granted summary judgment to two employees who sued in May 2018, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of the District, challenging the sweeping new rules as violating their freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 46-page ruling, Cooper called the effort to protect the judiciary from perceptions of political influence \u201claudable.\u201d But, the judge said, that intent did not justify a new code of conduct barring employees from participating in political activities open to virtually all other federal workers, including expressing views publicly or on social media about political candidates, attending events for political parties or candidates, joining parties or making donations\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACLU-DC Legal Director Scott Michelman called the agency\u2019s attempt to ban \u201ca huge range of core political speech on the weakest of justifications\u201d exactly the type of overreach the First Amendment exists to prevent. He said the ruling means federal court system workers can express their political views without risking their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Two who protested white nationalists suing for rights\u2019 violations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chris Joyner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, more than 700 uniformed police swarmed downtown Newnan\u00a0in a massive, coordinated effort from state, county and city agencies that included assault weapons, armored vehicles and drones designed to keep the peace at a rally by the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement. The black-clad NSM members numbered about two dozen, but their presence drew hundreds of counter-demonstrators from across the metro area, a handful of whom were arrested on a variety of minor charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now two activists arrested April 21, 2018 in the counter-protest have filed federal lawsuits against Coweta County and the officers who arrested them, claiming the arrests violated their constitutional protections of freedom of speech and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo matter what one thinks of the First Amendment and its reach, few would disagree that political speech lies at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect \u2013 an idea often emphasized by the US Supreme Court itself,\u201d said Atlanta attorney Drago Cepar, who represents the two men bringing the lawsuits, activists Alan Hutzel and Daniel Hanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hutzel was among a handful of activists arrested for violating the state\u2019s anti-mask law even before the neo-Nazi rally began. The encounter was captured, in part, by a reporter for the Huffington Post who recorded an unidentified officer warning a crowd of counter-demonstrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NLRB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason (Volokh Conspiracy): Make an Anti-Union Joke, Prepare to Be Accused of an Unfair Labor Practice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan H. Adler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writers at Vox Media staged a walk-out as part of their unionization efforts, Ben Domenech, publisher of\u00a0The Federalist, responded with a joke on Twitter: \u201cFYI @fdrlst first one of you tries to unionize I swear I\u2019ll send you back to the salt mine.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s no evidence anyone at The Federalist thought this was anything other than a topical joke, responding to a current event. Yet as Domenech recounts in the WSJ, a progressive writer and lawyer responded by filing unfair labor practice complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, and the NLRB pursued these claims with vigor, resulting in this decision against Domenech and The Federalist\u2026&lt;br /&gt;The free speech implications of this case are troubling for multiple reasons. First, this episode shows haw well-intentioned regulations can be weaponized for political purposes. The complainants had no interest in \u201cprotecting\u201d Federalist workers-if they even know any. Their clear aim was to harass and punish ideological adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Amendment\u00a0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFF: The Dangers of COVID-19 Surveillance Proposals to the Future of Protest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matthew Guariglia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the new surveillance powers now sought by the government to address the COVID-19 crisis would harm our First Amendment rights for years to come. People will be chilled and deterred from speaking out, protesting in public places, and associating with like-minded advocates if they fear scrutiny from cameras, drones, face recognition, thermal imaging, and location trackers. It is all too easy for governments to redeploy the infrastructure of surveillance from pandemic containment to political spying. It won\u2019t be easy to get the government to suspend its newly acquired tech and surveillance powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this wave of the public health emergency is over and it becomes safe for most people to leave their homes, they may find a world with even more political debate than when they left it. A likely global recession, a new election season, and re-energized social movements will provide an overwhelming incentive for record numbers of people to speak out, to demonstrate in public places, and to demand concessions of their governments. The pent-up urge to take to the streets may bring mass protests like we have not seen in years. And what impact would new surveillance tools, adopted in the name of public health, have on this new era of marches, demonstrations, and strikes?\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: The Looming Civil-Liberties Battle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Joseph A. Ladapo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A] substantial minority of Americans are concerned about the legitimacy of shutdown orders and the sensibility of extending them, with protests stretching from North Carolina to California. These protesters have largely been dismissed-or, worse, arrested and pursued for criminal prosecution. This will intensify concerns about heavy-handedness, energize the efforts of dissenters, and jeopardize the effectiveness of future public-health efforts\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning for the next phase of the pandemic will also heighten concerns and conflict over civil liberties. Health policy leaders have outlined a way forward that relies on widespread testing and contact tracing as prerequisites for lifting state shutdowns. Many governors, including California\u2019s Gavin Newsom and New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo, have expressed similar sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But think hard about the details. Testing may be mandatory. Contact tracing may mean government tracking of cellphone data. How much privacy are individuals willing to forfeit for a virus that increasingly appears to pose little danger to a large percentage of the U.S. population? We will soon learn the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hays Post: Our First Amendment rights must survive COVID-19&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Gene Policinski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the government override our First Amendment rights with orders such as limits on public assemblies, faith-based gatherings and public protests during the COVID-19 pandemic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is \u201cyes \u2026 probably \u2026 in certain circumstances \u2026 within specific limits.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s what our public officials, should ask themselves \u2013 and what we should demand that they do \u2013 before using public health concerns as a reason to infringe on any of our core freedoms of religion, speech, press, assembly or petition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealClearPolitics: Tucker Carlson: Big Tech Using Coronavirus To Increase Their Power Over Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ian Schwartz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS:\u00a0Last night on this show, we played a clip from a nearly hour-long video produced by two physicians in California, Doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi. Many of you had likely already seen it. The video had more than five million views on YouTube. In their presentation, the two doctors presented a flurry of data pointing to what we\u2019re learning about this virus. They recited pages of government statistics, and then interpreted them in light of their own long clinical experience. At one point, they noted the newly-adjusted death rate in their state, which is much lower than anyone expected, and asked if government officials should change their policies based on the science\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, the doctors\u2019 video was pulled off YouTube. This wasn\u2019t an accident\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only justification for taking it down was that the two physicians had reached different conclusions from the people currently in charge. In other words, it was a form of dissent. YouTube, and its parent company Google, have now banned dissent. YouTube\u2019s CEO has admitted that openly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;WOJCICKI: Anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would be a violation of our policy\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else involved in global pandemic policy, the W-H-O has often been wrong in its recommendations. In mid-January, they told us that the coronavirus could not spread from person to person. In March, they told us that face masks didn\u2019t work. Those lies were welcome on Google\u2019s platforms. Doctors who are actually treating patients with the virus have been banned. So, no, this is not about science. Censorship never is. It\u2019s about power.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breitbart: YouTube: California Doctors\u2019 Comments on Reopening the Country Are \u2018Misinformation\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Allum Bokhari&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube has released a statement on its decision to censor a video of two doctors in Bakersfield, California, making the case for an end to Chinese virus lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement provided to 23ABC, the local Bakersfield news station that uploaded censored video, the Google-owned platform said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;We quickly remove flagged content that violate our Community Guidelines, including content that explicitly disputes the efficacy of local healthy authority recommended guidance on social distancing that may lead others to act against that guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;However, content that provides sufficient educational, documentary, scientific or artistic (EDSA) context is allowed \u2013 for example, news coverage of this interview with additional context. From the very beginning of the pandemic, we\u2019ve had clear policies against COVID-19 misinformation and are committed to continue providing timely and helpful information at this critical time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube has used the pandemic to increase its censorship and control over the flow of news. It recently introduced \u201cfact check\u201d labels next to videos, and its CEO has warned that any information that contradicts World Health Organization guidelines will be removed from the platform. Over the weekend, the platform took down a video explaining UV light treatment from a life sciences company that has partnered with Cedars-Sinai hospital in L.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willamette Week: Campaign Finance Reformers Sue Mayor Ted Wheeler\u2019s Reelection Campaign Over Disputed Contributions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nigel Jaquiss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayoral candidate Sarah Iannarone and three other plaintiffs today sued the reelection campaign of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, alleging it\u00a0knowingly\u00a0violated a $500 contribution limit voters overwhelmingly approved in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, asks the court to enforce the $500 limit, which plaintiffs say went into effect Sept. 1, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of that request would be to force the Wheeler campaign to give up about $175,000 in contributions, the cumulative amount he\u2019s received in contributions above the $500 limit. The lawsuit alleges that accepting those contributions gave Wheeler an unfair advantage in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf [the Wheeler campaign] is allowed to retain and/or spend the unlawfully obtained funds, it and the incumbent mayor will receive an unfair advantage in current electoral contest, causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs\u2019 legally recognized interests,\u201d says the lawsuit\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group Honest Elections Portland, which put contribution limits on the 2018 ballot, had previously warned Wheeler\u2019s campaign that it believed the $500 limit was in effect, despite legal uncertainty over the Supreme Court case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheeler\u2019s campaign, which accepted individual contributions as large as $5,000 (Iannarone is relying on public financing for her campaign), ignored those warnings and banked on the 1997 law remaining in effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily Sentinel: Complaint filed against commissioner candidate Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Charles Ashby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complaint has been filed with the Colorado Secretary of State\u2019s office alleging that Mesa County commissioner candidate Cody Davis improperly used county workers to help him campaign for that office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis recently won top line in the Mesa County Republican Assembly for the June primary for District 1. His chief rival is state Sen. Ray Scott, R-Grand Junction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his campaign, Davis has been hosting a series of virtual \u201cConversations with Cody\u201d with various people. Two of those events featured Jeff Kuhr, director of the Mesa County Department of Public Health, and several top officials with the county\u2019s Department of Human Services, including Director Tracey Garchar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the complaint, filed April 15, Grand Junction resident Brian Timothy Fenwick alleges that those virtual sessions actually were \u201ccampaign events,\u201d and having those county workers on his Facebook page constitutes an endorsement of his candidacy in violation of state campaign finance laws\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis said the video conversations are intended to help people understand what\u2019s going on with the county\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and what they should do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 4/30 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

To uncover their identities, officials repeatedly attempted to obtain a warrant for private information from the group's Facebook page...<br/>The first two warrant applications were withdrawn after the American Civil Liberties Union and Facebook fought back, noting that they would chill political speech and association. So county prosecutor David McEachran went to the feds, and the Department of Justice chimed in with tips on how to craft a warrant to pass constitutional muster.<br/>Third time was the charm. Must be nice to have friends in high places...<br/>Abuses of this sort aren't limited to one side of the political aisle, as a group of conservative citizens in Wisconsin know all too well. Their own saga began around 2010, when the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office opened a secret probe into the Milwaukee County Executive's Office, run at the time by then-gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker.<br/>Three years later, Wisconsinites affiliated with right-of-center groups that had supported Gov. Walker's collective bargaining reforms had their homes raided by police officers in full riot gear before dawn.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Making a Difference with Anonymous Political Speech<br/>By Joe Albanese<br/>Last week, the Tampa Bay Times published a detailed article about a group called \"The Collective PAC,\" whose mission is to \"fix the challenge of African American underrepresentation in elected seats of power throughout our nation.\" The Times outlines how this group is \"bankrolling\" Andrew Gillum, a black candidate for Florida governor in the Democratic primaries, by donating to political action committees (PACs) affiliated with Gillum's campaign.<br/>Collective PAC has several affiliated organizations under its umbrella: a PAC, a super PAC, and a 501(c)(4) nonprofit advocacy organization. The Times takes issue with the fact that the 501(c)(4) organization is donating the most of those three groups ... Collective PAC's Founder and Executive Director, Quentin James, has said that the 501(c)(4) is simply donating more because it has attracted more donations than the other groups under the Collective PAC umbrella...<br/>[D]espite Collective PAC's donors not being individually known, current disclosure laws have already managed to identify the organization's role in supporting Gillum's campaign and provide readers with a good amount of background information as to its mission and leadership. Voters can already judge for themselves whether Collective PAC's role in the race is a pivotal voting issue...<br/>[F]or those who support Collective PAC's mission of promoting black leaders - or for those who support numerous other causes - making it easier to participate in political debate without fear of harassment can make a significant impact.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Daily Caller: Tech Giants Urged To Explain Their Censorship Tactics By Influential Watchdog Groups<br/>By Eric Lieberman<br/>Several influential watchdogs and digital privacy rights groups called on big tech companies Monday to be more transparent about their content moderation tactics.<br/>In doing so, the larger group released a set of standards for powerful websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and others to follow called The Santa Clara Principles. The guidelines center around three main categories: the quantity of accounts suspended and posts removed (numbers), the communications provided to affected users (notice) and the ability to request a re-examination (appeal).<br/>The coalition includes the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), New America's Open Technology Institute, the ACLU of Northern California and multiple individual free expression advocates...<br/>\"The decisions they make have major consequences for individuals' rights to freedom of expression and everyone's ability to access information,\" Emma Llans\u00f3, director of CDT's Free Expression Project, said in a statement. \"As policymakers around the world focus on how online platforms shape our information environments, it's crucial to know more about how content moderation happens in practice. We hope that the Santa Clara principles can prompt broader discussions amongst advocacy groups, experts, and platforms across the globe and lead to more transparent and accountable content moderation.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>Adweek: Congress Releases 3,000 Russian Ads Found on Facebook<br/>By\u00a0Marty Swant<br/>The release comes the same week Facebook announced plans to begin rolling out its previously announced policy changes for political ad buys. The new changes will require political ad buyers to both verify their identity and location along with new labeling that shows the ad is political in nature.<br/>In a press release published today by Facebook, the company provided additional context to how it's trying to improve the platform while also admitting \"this will never be a solved problem because we're against determined, creative and well-funded adversaries.\"<br/>In response to the ads being released, Meredith McGehee, executive director of the nonpartisan political reform nonprofit Issue One, called on Congress to pass legislation that would require online advertising to be more transparent. She mentioned the Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan bill that would require the largest internet companies to disclose all political ad buys. (So far, the bill hasn't gained much traction, and political advertisers and strategists don't expect it to this year.)<br/>\"If online ad disclosure requirements had been law, we would have already seen these ads in near real-time and that some were paid for in rubles,\" she said. \"And law enforcement officials would have seen they were illegal because spending foreign money in U.S. elections is illegal. The bipartisan Honest Ads Act would directly address this loophole.\"<br/>Media Matters for America: Can tech platforms protect election integrity?<br/>By Melissa Ryan<br/>Shadowy online ads are a staple of American elections in the digital age. In the last election cycle, voters targeted with digital ads had no way to see who purchased the ad unless they clicked through, and even then, there was sometimes no disclosure. There was no way to learn why you were being targeted or how much money was being spent on your demographic segment. (FEC disclosure requirements for online advertisements are pretty basic. Most of the time you can see only how much was spent - and not who was targeted, for example - on a digital buy that might include multiple platforms.) And that lack of transparency is particularly problematic given that thousands of ads on Facebook and Twitter came from Russian trolls and other hostile actors who were targeting American voters, a practice voters were unaware of until nearly a year after the elections.<br/>In 2016, Facebook's terms of service did not explicitly prevent foreigners, including Russians, from purchasing political ads on digital platforms. Its ad policy simply stated, \"Advertisers are responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws and regulations.\" But it's not even clear if it's against the law for foreign trolls to purchase ads targeting American voters. And it's highly unlikely that the law will change before the midterm elections, even though lawmakers have introduced The Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan bill to provide more transparency in digital political ads, and it has the support of several government reform organizations and both Facebook and Twitter.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>The Hill: Americans must change the incentives in our broken politics<br/>By\u00a0 Former Reps.\u00a0Tom Davis III (R-Va.) and\u00a0Jason Altmire (D-Pa.)<br/>The failure of campaign finance reform has also contributed to our political dysfunction. A lawmaker's schedule is often squeezed out by the demand to constantly raise money. Big money has also moved from the political parties themselves to less-regulated, opaque \"Super PACs.\" This dominant role of money in politics has engendered deep cynicism in the electorate, with 65 percent of respondents in a 2016 University of Maryland national poll saying that the U.S. political system is \"rigged.\"<br/>With non-competitive districts and the explosion of special interest money, it is no surprise that voter turnout in the United States is embarrassingly low...<br/>We believe it is essential to find a way out of this downward spiral. That is why we are co-chairing the new Commission on Civility and Effective Governance, sponsored by the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress...<br/>We will focus on reforming the incentives in U.S. politics that currently drive our leaders to favor partisan point scoring, personal attacks, and all-or-nothing posturing over reasoned debate and finding real solutions to our nation's daunting challenges.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>New York Times: Big Donors Form New Alliance to Seize House From Republicans<br/>By\u00a0Shane Goldmacher<br/>Major Democratic donors in New York have discreetly formed a new political alliance to raise roughly $10 million that would be injected into as many as two dozen key House battlegrounds in an effort to wrest control of Congress from Republicans.<br/>Admission to be an official partner in what's being called the House Victory Project comes with a $108,000 price tag. More than 80 people have each committed that sum, according to a half-dozen donors familiar with the group, whose existence has not previously been reported.<br/>The $108,000 pledge allows each donor to effectively give the maximum $5,400 contribution to 20 different House candidates. With nearly $9 million in commitments amassed so far, each Democratic recipient could see a windfall of as much as $432,000 - an amount that, for many House candidates, equals months of fund-raising in one fell swoop...<br/>For House candidates, large-scale direct campaign contributions are a hard commodity to come by.<br/>Federal election rules limit direct donations to candidates to $2,700 per donor for both the primary and general election, but joint committees, such as the House Victory Project, can bundle those contributions into one larger check.<br/>Roll Call:\u00a0Potential FEC Violations Cast Shadow on Rice's Possible AG Run<br/>By\u00a0Griffin Connolly<br/>Rep. Kathleen Rice, a leading name to replace former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, could be dogged in the coming months by a batch of potential campaign finance violations involving her old district attorney campaign account.<br/>Rice never deactivated the account from when she was elected Nassau County district attorney after she lost to Scheiderman in the 2010 Democratic primary for state attorney general. Since winning election to the House in New York's 4th District in 2014, she has subsequently spent thousands of dollars from the DA campaign account on ads, consulting services, and donations to local Democratic groups that have actively worked on her elections to the House, according to a report by Crain's New York.<br/>Federal Elections Commission rules prohibit candidates for federal office from using leftover money from old local campaigns - such as Rice's DA campaign account - for their federal office campaigns.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>St. Louis Post-Dispatch:\u00a0Donors behind political cash cannot be concealed, ethics watchdog says<br/>By\u00a0Sky Chadde<br/>Nonprofits that donate to political campaigns can't conceal the identities of their donors, Missouri's campaign finance watchdog said in an opinion Thursday.<br/>The opinion targets dark money groups...<br/>\"Both the Missouri Constitution and Missouri campaign finance disclosure law contain prohibitions on making contributions to a committee with intent to conceal the identity of the actual source of the contribution,\" James Klahr, the Missouri Ethics Commission's executive director, wrote in the opinion...<br/>According to the ruling, under Missouri law a nonprofit becomes a political committee once it accepts contributions of more than $500 in a year or more than $250 from a single person in an attempt to sway voters.<br/>Once the nonprofit becomes a committee, it must register with the ethics commission and start to file reports that include names of donors and amounts, according to the opinion.<br/>Reason:\u00a0Man Protests Police Department's Violation of Speech Rights, So Cops Arrest Him<br/>By Scott Shackford<br/>In April, Michael Picard staged a protest outside the Stamford courthouse with a sign that read \"Fuck Free Speech -Stamford PD.\" Picard was showing support for a buddy, Michael Friend, who had been arrested earlier that month for standing around in public holding a sign warning drivers of a police checkpoint designed to catch and ticket distracted drivers.<br/>Police ordered Friend to dump the sign. He refused. He was then charged with a misdemeanor count of interfering with police.<br/>That arrest, of course, was a violation of Friend's speech rights, and that's why Picard showed up in front of the courthouse with his own sign when Friend was being arraigned. He had a fellow protester, Dawud Talib, recording him. Picard provided video of what happened next to Reason. Picard and Talib wandered next door to the police station, and that's where they were confronted by Police Chief Jon Fontneau, who ordered them to put the sign down or face arrest for breach of peace. When Picard refused, he was arrested by three other officers and escorted into the police station, leaving Talib out on the curb.<br/>While Picard's arrest report claims witnesses saw him jumping out in front of pedestrians with his sign, I did not see anything like that in the video, which shows hardly any foot traffic near the police station. According to the report, \"Michael was publicly displaying offensive and indecent language.\" The report says Picard was ordered to move to the public sidewalk under the threat of arrest for breach of peace.

Town of Gilbert (2015) because it exempts onsite signs and held the act unconstitutional in its entirety. After the Sixth Circuit held the Tennessee Billboard Act content-based for the same reason in Thomas v. Bright (2019), that may not seem surprising. But unlike Thomas, L.D.

In Seattle, for example, 84 percent of election donors in 2017 were new donors, according to a study by the organization Every Voice\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[R]eformers should take comfort in the fact the Supreme Court still allows for public financing systems like Seattle\u2019s innovative democracy voucher program. Other cities and states should follow Seattle\u2019s lead. And once a new Congress is seated, the public financing provisions in the democracy reform bill H.R.1 should be enacted into law as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital Times: Lawsuits test limits of political speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Natalie A. Harris (Baron Harris Healey)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president, through his campaign, is suing television station WJFW-TV in Rhinelander for airing a political ad that allegedly defamed him\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is not the only public official testing the language of politics in the courtroom. Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Jill Karofsky also recently sued to block ads she claimed were defamatory\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political ad defamation suits are difficult to win. But even the filing of a lawsuit, successful or not, can chill political speech. Filing suits based on negative ads and flooding battleground markets with takedown demands quiets the voice of opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign\u2019s lawsuit against WJFW is also a reminder of the risk broadcasters face by accepting campaign ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters cannot be sued for claims made in ads placed by candidates, but suits based on ads from third parties like PACs are fair game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Amendment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: A disturbing draft opinion is an attempt to exclude conservatives from the legal debate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By George F. Will&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15-judge Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States has circulated to all federal judges \u201cfor review and comment\u201d a draft opinion that, although seemingly evenhanded, is disturbing and perhaps cynical. To reasonable readers, the draft seems tailored to injure the Federalist Society. Without necessarily imputing to the committee this purpose, the proposed code of behavior for federal judges, if adopted, would have the predictable effect of discouraging membership in the organization that has challenged the American Bar Association\u2019s preeminence in the nation\u2019s legal culture\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the draft opinion are probably concerned about the perception of the judiciary as drenched in politics\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft opinion\u2019s real purpose, however, is revealed by its conclusion that judges\u2019 involvement with the American Bar Association (ABA) is not problematic.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBC:\u00a0Burning EU and other flags can now bring German jail term&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany has made public burning of the EU flag or that of another country punishable by up to three years in jail, classing it as a hate crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote in the Bundestag (parliament) on Thursday makes defiling foreign flags equal to the crime of defiling the German flag.&lt;br /&gt;The same applies for the EU anthem, Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move followed Social Democrat (SPD) complaints about protesters\u2019 burning of the Israeli flag in Berlin in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht, a member of the centre-left SPD, said \u201cburning flags publicly has nothing to do with peaceful protests\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said it stoked up \u201chatred, anger and aggression\u201d, and hurt many people\u2019s feelings\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France has made desecration of the tricolour punishable by a fine of up to \u20ac7,500 (\u00a36,600; $8,000) or six months in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain, Italy and Greece also have laws banning desecration of the national flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg:\u00a0Orban Uses Crisis Powers for Detentions Under \u2018Fake News\u2019 Law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Andras Gergely and Veronika Gulyas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hungarian authorities have started criminal probes against dozens of people for allegedly spreading fake news related to the pandemic, in a move that Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s opponents say is meant to silence them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government changed the criminal code to allow authorities to jail people for up to five years for \u201cdistorting\u201d facts in a way that\u2019s deemed to hamper the virus fight. The amendment accompanied legislation that gave Orban the right to rule by decree for an indefinite period, which has raised alarm about the future of Hungarian democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the law\u2019s approval in late March, authorities have started 86 criminal probes for alleged scaremongering, according to official data. The opposition Momentum party said that one of its supporters had been briefly detained Wednesday after a Facebook post sharing details about an anti-government protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Review: Our Nevermind Media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kyle Smith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Trump collusion yarn is perhaps the most-promoted false conspiracy theory in American history: Major figures who advanced the theory have now conceded that they had no evidence for it, and yet leading media personalities who hyped it are expressing no shame or remorse whatsoever. CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter is telling his audience, not, \u201cMy God, I have failed you, and I hereby announce my retirement in disgrace from public life\u201d but, \u201cWhy are those jerks so obsessed with this Russia story we talked up incessantly for three years?\u201d Working in the major media is a (self) love story: It means never having to say you\u2019re sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: Liberals embrace super PACs they once shunned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Max Greenwood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progressives are embracing super PACs with newfound vigor\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of new liberal outside groups have cropped up in recent weeks, many of them founded by former aides and allies of Sen. Sanders and other progressives\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the proliferation of super PACs has come at a cost for some in the progressive movement, which has long denounced the existence of such groups and the influence of money in politics\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chuck Rocha, a former senior adviser to Sanders who is involved in America\u2019s Promise PAC and is spearheading the creation of another group, Nuestro PAC, said that super PACs are simply a means to an end: helping Democrats and progressives win up and down the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional political action committees and political nonprofits, super PACs can act as a \u201cpartisan hammer,\u201d Rocha said, a role that traditional campaigns and PACs can\u2019t necessarily fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI am anti all this money in politics and if we can operate without super PACs, I would vote for that everyday,\u201d Rocha told The Hill. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to do something right now. I don\u2019t have the privilege to be able to wait around until there aren\u2019t super PACs on either side.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSuper PACs aren\u2019t the problem. The problem is corporate money in super PACs,\u201d Rocha said.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Will Facebook\u2019s oversight board actually hold the company accountable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Editorial Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook\u2019s high court was constructed by Facebook, for Facebook, which has left many wondering: Will the Silicon Valley leviathan\u2019s oversight board keep chief executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company accountable, or will it shield it from accountability instead? \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some observers have pointed out all the problems with Facebook that the oversight board doesn\u2019t solve: the privacy harms of a business model that critics have come to call surveillance capitalism, for example, or insufficient disclosure obligations in elections messaging and advertising. These are real problems, but the responsibility for addressing them shouldn\u2019t lie with the board, and it shouldn\u2019t even lie with Facebook: Governments ought to set rules of their own, and this country\u2019s legislature has fallen short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: Google Hides News, Tricked by Fake Claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Andrea Fuller, Kirsten Grind and Joe Palazzolo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Journal identified hundreds of instances in which individuals or companies, often using apparently fake identities, caused Google to remove links to unfavorable articles and blog posts that alleged wrongdoing by convicted criminals, foreign officials and businesspeople in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google took them down in response to copyright complaints, many of which appear to be bogus, the Journal found in an analysis of information from the more than four billion links sent to Google for removal since 2011\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Google erases links to an article in its search engine, it is often the equivalent of wiping the piece from the internet, even though the item may still exist on a little-trafficked website. Searchers won\u2019t see a trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf people can manipulate the gatekeepers to make important and lawful information disappear,\u201d said Daphne Keller, a former Google lawyer and now a program director at Stanford University\u2019s Cyber Policy Center, \u201cthat\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spectator: How can Twitter decide whether COVID news is \u2018untrue\u2019?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Karol Markowicz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are sure masks help. Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in January, Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said during a briefing, \u2018the virus is not spreading in the general community. We don\u2019t routinely recommend the use of face masks by the public to prevent respiratory illness. And we certainly are not recommending that at this time for this new virus.\u2019 \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mid-April, the CDC adopted its new policy that masks should be worn in situations where social distancing is not possible\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why when Twitter announced this week it would start \u2018alerting users when a tweet makes disputed or misleading claims about the coronavirus\u2019, it was immediately clear it would become problematic\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with the site policing truth is that truth isn\u2019t particularly evident right now and it shifts with time\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[F]or many users, particularly conservatives, it\u2019s clear that \u2018true\u2019 will be what is currently acceptable among liberal elites while \u2018untrue\u2019 will be anything that challenges that\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter should focus on doing what it does best: open discourse between many people of differing opinions\u2026 Disagreement is good, even in a time of pandemic. Twitter should foster it not clamp down on it for its own version of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Post: YouTube censors epidemiologist Knut Wittkowski for opposing lockdown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jon Levine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big\u00a0Tech companies are aggressively tamping down on COVID-19 \u201cmisinformation\u201d \u2013 opinions and ideas contrary to official pronouncements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Knut M. Wittkowski, former head of biostatistics, epidemiology and research design at Rockefeller University, says YouTube removed a video of him talking about the virus which had racked up more than 1.3 million views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wittkowski, 65, is a ferocious critic of the nation\u2019s current steps to fight the coronavirus. He has derided social distancing, saying it only prolongs the virus\u2019 existence and has attacked the current lockdown as mostly unnecessary\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witkowski said,\u201dThey don\u2019t tell you [why they removed the video.]\u00a0They just say it violates our community standards. There\u2019s no explanation for what those standards are or what standards it violated.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across social media, censors have been racing to limit the flow of verboten information\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of totalitarian thinking and conduct that has cost millions of lives in recent world history. The fact that it\u2019s being done by private companies and not government doesn\u2019t change that,\u201d Ron Coleman, a prominent First Amendment lawyer, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post:\u00a0Donors can now give $620,600 to Biden and DNC, expanding Democratic big-money fundraising&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Michelle Ye Hee\u00a0Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presumptive\u00a0Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will ask donors to give as much as $620,600 to support his White House bid and down-ballot candidates, dramatically expanding his fundraising capability to compete with President Trump\u2019s big-money machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden Victory Fund, a committee that raises money with the Democratic National Committee, on Saturday filed an agreement that allows wealthy donors to give large checks that will be shared by the campaign, the party and 26 state parties \u2013 the latest move by Democrats to ramp up the former vice president\u2019s fundraising for the general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision allows Biden to raise money at the levels of the campaign for Trump, who has enjoyed a fundraising advantage as the incumbent president who can coordinate directly with the party and state parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden Victory Fund agreement is the latest example of the dramatically expanding fundraising power of national party committees, made possible through pivotal legal changes in 2014 that loosened restrictions on individual contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OCPA: Privacy-protection measure heads to governor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ray Carter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong bipartisan coalition of lawmakers voted Tuesday to protect Oklahomans\u2019 privacy when they support nonprofit charities and similar organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House Bill 3613 creates the \u201cPersonal Privacy Protection Act.\u201d The law would ban state government entities from forcing nonprofits to publicly disclose the identities, home addresses, and other personal information of supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s a First Amendment speech-and-association issue,\u201d said Sen. Julie Daniels, a Bartlesville Republican who carried the bill on the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the legislation, no state agency could compel a nonprofit entity to publicly report data that \u201cdirectly or indirectly identifies a person as a member, supporter, or volunteer of, or donor of financial or nonfinancial support to\u201d any nonprofit entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the bill, state agencies would also be barred from requiring contractors to provide information on \u201cwhere they put their charitable dollars,\u201d Daniels said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, some special-interest groups have attacked businesses for supporting groups like the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill does not alter existing requirements for public reporting of donors to political candidates and various political campaigns\u2026&lt;br /&gt;HB 3613 passed on a bipartisan 43-2 vote. The bill now goes to Gov. Kevin Stitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Louis Jewish Light: Missouri governor expected to sign anti-BDS bill into law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Eric Berger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Missouri legislature approved a bill Thursday that would require certain companies entering into a contract with the state to certify that they are not, and will not, engage in a boycott of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pro-Israel lawmakers and advocates have tried repeatedly in recent years to pass anti-boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement legislation in the state, but previous attempts have failed in part because of opposition from lawmakers concerned that it violates people\u2019s rights to free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that the legislature has approved such a bill, and Gov. Mike Parson is expected to sign it\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House approved the bill on a 95 to 40 vote, and the Senate did so on a 28 to 1 vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states that have passed similar legislation have faced legal challenges in recent years from the American Civil Liberties Union on the grounds that the laws violate individuals\u2019 free speech rights. In Missouri, supporters have countered such opposition by saying that the legislation does not target individuals but rather companies worth over $100,000 with 10 or more employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 5/18 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

Presumably, these students used the Internet, social media, or mobile device apps to organize their rally.</p><p><br/>In so doing, they may have committed a crime under an obscure Maryland law.<br/>Instead of fixing this flawed speech law, the Maryland General Assembly recently passed a bill to reenact and expand it. The legislation purports to counter foreign online political propaganda. But in reality, the new burden it would place on Marylanders' Internet speech threatens our First Amendment rights. Gov. Larry Hogan, R, should veto the bill.<br/>At issue is HB 981, the so-called \"Online Electioneering Transparency and Accountability Act.\" If signed into law, the bill would reenact the state's existing regulation of \"campaign material.\" The term includes any \"material transmitted by or appearing on the Internet or other electronic medium\" that \"relates to\" a candidate, prospective candidate, ballot measure, or prospective ballot measure. If you think about it, that includes just about anything...<br/>It is bad enough that HB 981 would reenact Maryland's unconstitutional speech law. But the bill would make matters even worse by imposing a whole host of additional reporting and record-keeping requirements.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Americans Support Speech Regulation... If They Are Not Told the Facts Surrounding It<br/>By Joe Albanese<br/>In their story, [the Center for Public Integrity]\u00a0specifically highlighted results showing that a large proportion of respondents support certain regulatory policies, such as a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, greater disclosure requirements for nonprofit advocacy organizations, and tax-financing of political campaigns. By and large, these results hinge on poll questions that are either excessively subjective or dubious.<br/>Polling for campaign finance issues is tricky, and the authors acknowledge this: \"For this type of topic, standard polls are inadequate as few citizens have sufficient information about the legislative proposals to provide meaningful input.\" To account for this knowledge gap, they provide an assessment of each policy proposal, plus arguments in favor and against. Respondents were then asked their opinions on the overall proposal and each set of arguments.<br/>Throughout, the authors repeatedly use loaded words and phrases that explicitly frame the issues in terms that are most favorable to pro-regulation groups. They state the goals of speech regulation as \"reducing or counterbalancing\" the influence of all sorts of supposedly unsavory groups: big campaign donors, special interests, corporations, and the wealthy. Left unstated is how political speech regulations burden the rights of other groups - such as advocacy organizations like the ACLU or National Right to Life Committee, or smaller nonprofit corporations. (Indeed, the constant use of \"corporation\" suggests that large, for-profit businesses are bigger players than they are - most super PAC funds, for example, come from individuals, not businesses.) The word \"nonprofit\" appears only once in the questions.<br/>Below is an analysis of the poll results from three major issue areas.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>The Atlantic: Germany's Attempt to Fix Facebook Is Backfiring<br/>By\u00a0Linda Kinstler<br/>Even Germany's new Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who led the push for the NetzDG during his time as justice minister, ran afoul of the new law when one of his old tweets, in which he\u00a0called\u00a0an immigration opponent an \"idiot,\" resurfaced.<br/>\"I'm far from being a fan of the far right, but a lot of them are afraid that their postings are deleted because of their beliefs, not because of what they say,\" said Jeorg Heidrich, a German internet lawyer and a longtime opponent of the regulation. He said that the NetzDG incentivizes social-media companies to \"delete in doubt\"-to remove any content that seems like it might be illegal-and is he is one of many who have observed a general \"chilling\" of speech online and offline in Germany. \"The NetzDG is on people's minds,\" he said. \"Generally, people are more careful what to think, what to write. Lots of people are afraid of losing their accounts.\" ...<br/>Last month, Weidel earned praise for bringing Facebook \"to its knees\" in Germany after winning a court case against the company...\u00a0<br/>Martin Munz, a White &amp; Case attorney representing Facebook, called the offending comment \"tasteless\" but warned of the repercussions of the ruling: By compelling the social-media company to remove the post, it would, in effect, be enforcing German speech law internationally, even in places where the post's content would be perfectly legal.<br/>NewCo Shift: A Magic Shield That Lets You Be An Assh*le?<br/>By\u00a0John Battelle<br/>It's the first amendment to the US Constitution, but it's also deeply misunderstood. Free speech seems an inviolate right, but when practiced at public institutions like UC Berkeley, or within private corporations like CloudFlare or Starbucks, the concept of free speech is both tested and proven. Join UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ, EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn, and moderator Nellie Bowles of the New York Times for a challenging and timely conversation on the role of speech in our roiling democracy...<br/>Nellie: There's a movement within Silicon Valley to get the platforms to self-regulate. You have people like Tristan Harris and a lot of ex-Facebook, ex-Google employees who are saying these platforms need to be regulated.<br/>Cindy: Regulated by\u00a0who? Remember that if you're calling for regulation, then you're asking for (current Attorney General) Jeff Sessions to decide when you've violated the law. I think we all might want to stop a little bit and think about whether that's going to head where we want it to go right now...<br/>Back to your moral question, should we be pushing these companies to engage in more censorship, there's plenty of things I would like to push the companies to do here. Let me make sure that I put that pin in so we can get back to it.<br/>Companies suck at censorship. There's a website,\u00a0onlinecensorship.org, where EFF and another group called Visualizing Impact try to keep track of how well this happens. The through lines are really clear. If you're a really powerful person, you'll get other people kicked off the platform. If you're a person without power, you won't.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>The Hill: Arizona men charged with operating scam PACs<br/>By Max Greenwood<br/>Two Arizona men were charged on Thursday for allegedly operating several fraudulent political action committees that prosecutors say defrauded donors out of more than $23 million.<br/>The men, William Tierney, 46, and Robert Tierney, 40, were arrested in Arizona and charged in New York City federal court with wire fraud conspiracy, mail fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, prosecutors said.<br/>The defendants are expected to appear on Thursday afternoon in federal district court in Arizona.<br/>According to court papers, the Tierneys \"defrauded tens of thousands of donors to at least nine political action committees that they controlled, operated, and influenced,\" starting in 2014.<br/>Those so-called Scam PACs allegedly solicited money from donors under the pretense that the funds would support voter education and the political campaigns of candidates who supported various causes, such as autism awareness, law enforcement and opposition to abortion.<br/>In reality, prosecutors said, less than 1 percent of the money raised by the PACs went to political contributions. The vast majority of the funds went to the Tierneys directly - totaling more than $3.5 million - or to expenditures for perpetuating the scheme, such as overhead costs and telemarketing.<br/>Boston Globe: Warren challenger ends lawsuit over 'fake Indian' sign<br/>By\u00a0Associated Press<br/>A US Senate candidate in Massachusetts is ending a lawsuit he'd filed against a city that asked him to remove a sign from a campaign bus reading: \"Only a REAL INDIAN Can Defeat the Fake Indian.\"<br/>Shiva Ayyadurai was born in India and is running as an independent against Democratic US Senator Elizabeth Warren. The slogan refers to Warren's claims of Native American ancestry.<br/>In a court filing Thursday, Ayyadurai asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit, saying the city of Cambridge has rescinded its enforcement order.<br/>In the original complaint filed last month, Ayyadurai said his First Amendment rights were violated when Cambridge's building inspector told his campaign it didn't have permission to display the banner on the bus, which was parked at a building the candidate owns.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>Forbes: Tech On Capitol Hill<br/>By\u00a0Jessica Nordlander<br/>Many things have already been said about Mark Zuckerberg's Capitol Hill hearings - from people that sat through it and from people that didn't. Here are my main takeaways after spending a total of 10 hours in front of the live broadcast...<br/>Lawmakers are struggling to control advertising in a world where it can be targeted only to a specific audience. This ability to personalize content on platforms like Facebook and Google has caused turmoil in election campaigns and political messages have been able to spread in a very different way than they did in the pre-social media world, for good and bad. The Honest Ads Act is a U.S. bill that would level the rules of advertising online with all other media; political ads in newsprint, on television and on the radio are required to disclose who paid for the ad, but there is no such requirement for online ads. This is one of the ways by which meddling in foreign elections has been made possible. Zuckerberg said during the hearing that he is supportive of the act and also stated that one of the changes that will be made to the Facebook advertising solution is that it will be possible to see all ads that an advertiser is currently running, not just the ones targeted to you. This is a positive development.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Independent Groups\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Hedge Funds' Favorite Charity Is Funding Their Opponents<br/>By\u00a0Rob Copeland<br/>For years,\u00a0Mr. Loeb and other\u00a0hedge-fund managers have\u00a0sent millions of dollars\u00a0to groups\u00a0participating in anti-hedge-fund activist campaigns such as the Hedge Clippers and Strong Economy For All.<br/>They have done so via a series of transactions involving the Robin Hood Foundation, a nonprofit co-founded by famed investor Paul Tudor Jones...<br/>The money goes to support what Robin Hood describes as \"organizations helping New Yorkers in need,\" such as community centers, health-care providers and mentorship programs.<br/>A portion of those grants, totaling more than $11 million since 2010, has gone to\u00a0an arm of\u00a0Service Employees International Union, Coalition for the Homeless and Make The Road\u00a0NY. They are among more than 20 labor and advocacy groups that comprise\u00a0either Strong Economy For All or the Hedge Clippers...<br/>Robin Hood's chief program officer, Emary Aronson, said the charity became aware of its connection to some protest groups several years ago, and decided to continue funding. \"There's no thermometer that we use to say we are\u00a0going one way or the other because of something that's in the news or how it\u00a0affects\u00a0the hedge-fund community,\" Ms. Aronson said.<br/>She said the charity's money is earmarked specifically for serving poor communities, not advocacy, though some organizations may do both...<br/>The Hedge Clippers became active roughly three years ago, in response to what the organization viewed as outsize influence of hedge funds and other wealthy financiers on public policy.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Center for Responsive Politics:\u00a0Women have won nearly half of the House Democratic primaries so far<br/>By\u00a0Geoff West and Doug Weber<br/>The top female spenders included Nebraska Democratic Senate candidate Jane Raybould, who won having spent nearly half a million dollars...<br/>But other female Democrats won primaries Tuesday having spent little to no money at all.<br/>In Nebraska, for example, Jessica McClure took the First District with roughly $16,000 in outlays.<br/>In Pennsylvania, former Jaguar executive Bibiana Boerio spent about $17,000 for the 14th District nomination, and fellow state Democrat Susan Boser, whose background includes assessing the state's mental health and addiction services, spent about $3,500.<br/>In Idaho, Boise realtor Christina McNeil won the First District without a dime in reported spending before the primary.<br/>An advantage in spending was no guarantee of success on Tuesday. In his bid for the Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania's Fifth District, Rich Lazer received over $1 million in outside support. He finished third.<br/>Republican Rick Saccone's second loss for a congressional seat in less than a year - this time to state senator Guy Reschenthaler for Pennsylvania's 14th District - was another surprise, if for no other reason than Saccone outspent Reschenthaler by roughly $1.6 million.<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Politicians who took NRA money ought to give it back<br/>By Jennifer Rubin<br/>There are numerous questions yet to be answered - the extent of the NRA's knowledge of Russian meddling, whether the NRA participated in a conspiracy to break campaign finance laws barring foreigners from making campaign donations and where the Russian money funneled through the NRA wound up...<br/>Congressional hearings into the possible use of of right-wing front groups by the Kremlin would certainly be appropriate. Meanwhile, the NRA revelation raises a serious problem for politicians who have received money and/or support from the NRA. No one is suggesting that any candidates who benefited from the NRA's largesse knew of Russia's alleged infiltration; however, now that significant questions have been raised about the origin of campaign money, any candidate who received NRA support, I would argue, has at least a moral obligation to give the money back.\u00a0Those who have gotten the coveted \"A\" rating from the NRA should think twice about touting the stamp of approval from a group that wittingly or unwittingly allegedly helped in essence launder Russian money.\u00a0Opponents of the NRA-backed candidates would be foolish not to demand that they give their NRA money back - perhaps in rubles.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Media</emphasis><br/>Reason:\u00a0When Social Media Debunk Conspiracy Theories<br/>By Jesse Walker<br/>A February 20\u00a0ThinkProgress\u00a0article, to pick one representative example, announces in its lede that crisis-actor tales \"have spread like wildfire across social media platforms-despite the repeated promises of Big Tech to crack down on fake news.\" The author circles back to that idea at the end, arguing that \"the viral spread of the 'crisis actor' theory, along with other recent examples of highly-shared fake content, shows that [Facebook] is still ripe for misinformation and exploitation.\" One Facebook post touting the theory, he notes, has gotten more than 110,000 shares, and some of the videos promoting the idea have been \"viewed tens of thousands of times.\"<br/>That sounds less impressive when you start thinking about the context. We do not know how many of those 110,000 shares were trolls or bots, those crisis actors of the online world. Nor do we know how many people watch a video because they're inclined to believe it, how many watch because they're inclined to laugh at it, and how many just turn it off after 30 seconds...<br/>The idea that the crisis-actor story is replicating unchallenged in some endless cancerous pattern may play to people's anxieties about social media...\u00a0But out there in the actual internet, people were knocking these stories down. The criticisms of the conspiracy theory may well have been more viral than the theory itself.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>WMUR Manchester:\u00a0NH Primary Source: Campaign cash at issue in Democratic gubernatorial primary<br/>By John DiStaso<br/>After unveiling a campaign finance reform plan last week, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Marchand on Wednesday issued a request that his primary opponent, Molly Kelly, sign on to the People's Pledge.<br/>You remember the People's Pledge, right? The attempt to limit third party spending in campaigns first came up in these parts when it was agreed to in 2012 by Massachusetts U.S. Senate candidates Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown...<br/>Kelly's gubernatorial campaign responded to Marchand's challenge by saying that he should follow his own campaign finance reform plan and return $13,000 in corporate contributions he has received since announcing his candidacy.<br/>Marchand's plan calls for outlawing corporate contributions in top state races, and when we brought to his attention last week that he had received such contributions, he said that he would no longer accept them \"going forward.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-8670</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 18, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Doyle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency advocates are looking for a legislative fix after the IRS approved a rule they say opens the door to allow politically active nonprofits to take foreign money to influence U.S. elections, without being detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAt a time when over $10 billion total is expected to be spent during this election season, the requirement that organizations (like the National Rifle Association) report their donors to the IRS was key to ensuring that the foreign-money ban on elections was enforced,\u201d Campaign Legal Center President Trevor Potter said\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others hailed the move, which was announced Tuesday, saying it would prevent accidental disclosure of information always meant to be confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cEveryone has the right to support social causes without being harassed,\u201d David Keating, president of the nonprofit Institute for Free Speech, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new rule, the IRS will stop routinely collecting information identifying specific donors to tax exempt groups, except for charities, for which donations are tax deductible. </p><p>Previously, the IRS collected this information but didn\u2019t make it public\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonprofits known to critics as \u201cdark money\u201d groups have spent nearly $1 billion to influence federal elections over the last decade, according to reports filed with the FEC. And much of their election-related spending isn\u2019t reported because groups skirt campaign finance rules by avoiding specific words of advocacy or spending during certain time periods not covered by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump Administration\u00a0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters: Trump to sign executive order on social media on Thursday: White House&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jeff Mason and Nandita Bose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on social media companies on Thursday, White House officials said after Trump threatened to shut down websites he accused of stifling conservative voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials gave no further details. It was unclear how Trump could follow through on the threat of shutting down privately owned companies including Twitter Inc. The company declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute erupted after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time tagged Trump\u2019s tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact check the posts\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution limits any action Trump could take\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cRepublicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,\u201d Trump said in a pair of additional posts on Twitter on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president, a heavy user of Twitter with more than 80 million followers, added: \u201cClean up your act, NOW!!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican Trump has an eye on the November election. \u201cBig Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election,\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday night. \u201cIf that happens, we no longer have our freedom.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Trump expected to sign executive order that could threaten punishment against Facebook, Google and Twitter over allegations of political bias&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tony Romm and Josh Dawsey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order Thursday\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s directive chiefly seeks to embolden federal regulators to rethink a portion of law known as Section 230, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a document that could still evolve and has not been officially signed by the president\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law is controversial. It allows tech companies the freedom to police their platforms for abuse without fear of lawsuits. But critics say those exceptions have also allowed some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most profitable companies to skirt responsibility for the harmful content that flourishes on their online platforms, including hate speech, terrorist propaganda and election-related falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order would prompt federal officials to open a proceeding to reconsider the scope of the law, the people familiar with the document said. A change could mean potentially dramatic free-speech implications and wide-ranging consequences for a broad swath of companies reliant on doing [online business.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order would also seek to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission, which would be encouraged to probe whether tech companies\u2019 content-moderation policies are in keeping with their pledges of neutrality. It would also require federal agencies to review their spending on social media advertising\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick the speech that Americans may access and convey online,\u201d according to an undated draft version of the executive order obtained by The Washington Post late Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason (Volokh Conspiracy): Freedom Watch and Laura Loomer Lose Lawsuit Against Social Media Platforms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Eugene Volokh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In\u00a0Freedom Watch, Inc. v. Google Inc., decided today by D.C. Circuit Judges Judith Rogers, Thomas Griffith, and Raymond Randolph, Freedom Watch and Loomer sued \u201cGoogle, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple \u2026 alleging that they conspired to suppress conservative political views.\u201d No, said the court (correctly, in my view):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A.] The plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment claim failed because \u201cthe First Amendment \u2018prohibits only\u00a0governmental\u00a0abridgment of speech.\u2019\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[B.] The plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claim failed because there was no evidence of an anticompetitive behavior by platforms\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C.] The plaintiffs\u2019 claim under D.C.\u2019s public accommodation statute failed because the statute doesn\u2019t apply to online service providers\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would add that the D.C. ban on discrimination based on \u201cpolitical affiliation\u201d in places of public accommodations is limited to discrimination based on \u201cbelonging to or endorsing any political party.\u201d Discrimination on mere ideological beliefs is not covered, as the D.C. Court of Appeals expressly held in\u00a0Blodgett v. University Club\u00a0(D.C. 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also think that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230 would preclude liability for service providers\u2019 decision to block material that they view as offensive. And I think (though here matters are less firmly established) that\u00a0state and D.C. public accommodations laws can\u2019t apply to this fundamentally interstate medium, given the dormant Commerce Clause. But the court didn\u2019t have occasion to reach those questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courthouse News: San Francisco Mayor Dodges Suit Over Removal of \u2018Racist\u2019 Billboards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nicholas Iovino&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco Mayor London Breed cannot be sued for allegedly pressuring advertising firms to pull a political rival\u2019s billboards that were denounced as racist by the mayor and several other elected officials, a federal judge ruled\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failed mayoral candidate Ellen Zhou sued Mayor Breed and two billboard advertising firms\u2026in November last year, after the companies took down two of her campaign billboards\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhou argued in her lawsuit that Breed used her government position to \u201cpressure and encourage\u201d advertising firms to remove her billboards and suppress her speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 13-page ruling, U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick III rejected that theory. He cited a 1984 Third Circuit decision, R.C. Maxwell Co. v. New Hope, which found a town government\u2019s letter urging a landlord to take down billboards was not coercive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe landlord\u2019s \u2018nebulous desire\u2019 to stay in the town council\u2019s good graces was not enough to give rise to a constitutional claim,\u201d Orrick wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhou failed to show Breed provided \u201csuch significant encouragement\u201d that the billboard companies\u2019 decisions to pull the ads were \u201ceffectively government decisions,\u201d Orrick concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo one threatened legal action or any other negative ramifications to encourage removal of the billboards,\u201d Orrick wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Times of San Diego: OAN to Appeal Judge\u2019s Ruling to Toss Rachel Maddow Defamation Suit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ken Stone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A San Diego federal judge Friday dismissed a $10 million defamation lawsuit filed by the owners and operators of San Diego-based One America News Network against MSNBC and political commentator Rachel Maddow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer, the liberal host told her viewers that the Trump-friendly conservative network \u201creally literally is paid Russian propaganda.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant dismissed Herring Networks\u2019 suit with prejudice, ruling \u201cthere is no set of facts that could support a claim for defamation based on Maddow\u2019s statement,\u201d made during a July 22, 2019, segment of her show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Herring Sr., the 78-year-old owner and founder of the Trump-friendly network based in San Diego, told Times of San Diego that he would appeal\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bashant ruled that Maddow\u2019s statement \u201cis an opinion that cannot serve as the basis for a defamation claim,\u201d and thus is protected under the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge ruled that most viewers would be able to conclude that Maddow was forwarding her opinion when she made the July 22 statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Daily News: Tulsi Gabbard drops defamation suit against Hillary Clinton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Stephen Rex Brown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Democratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard dropped her defamation lawsuit against Hillary Clinton Wednesday, citing the coronavirus pandemic and importance of defeating President Trump in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabbard sued Clinton in January for suggesting she was a \u201cRussian asset\u201d whose candidacy helped Trump\u2019s reelection chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Times of San Diego: Seattle Judge Throws Out COVID-19 \u2018Hoax\u2019 Suit Against Fox News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ken Stone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nonprofit watchdog group in Washington state had \u201claudable\u201d aims, a Seattle judge said Wednesday, but he threw out its lawsuit targeting Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWASHLITE\u2019s professed goal in this lawsuit \u2013 to ensure that the public receives accurate information about the coronavirus and COVID-19 \u2013 is laudable,\u201d said King County Superior Court Judge Brian McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the way the Washington League for Increased Transparency and Ethics moved against the top-rated cable news channel \u201cruns afoul of the protections of the First Amendment,\u201d he said in an eight-page order\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its original complaint, WASHLITE called out Fox News host Sean Hannity for leading viewers to believe the pandemic was a \u201choax.\u201d Fox News argues Hannity never said that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge McDonald noted that in many key U.S. Supreme Court decisions involving the First Amendment, \u201cthe motives for seeking to curtail or prohibit speech were understandable and could be considered righteous.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said the Supreme Court recognized that \u201cif there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: Republicans working on legislation to strip Twitter of federal liability protections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Maggie Miller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) on Wednesday separately announced they were both working on legislation to strip Twitter of federal protections that ensure the company is not held liable for what is posted on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers began work on legislation following Twitter\u2019s decision to add warnings to two tweets by President Trump this week\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Hawley and Gaetz argued that Twitter\u2019s decision to flag the tweets called its legal liability protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act into question\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawley sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday questioning why the platform should be given Section 230 protections and tweeted that he would soon introduce legislation to end \u201cgovernment giveaways\u201d under the legal shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf @Twitter wants to editorialize &amp;comment; on users\u2019 posts, it should be divested of its special status under federal law (Section 230) &amp;forced; to play by same rules as all other publishers,\u201d Hawley tweeted. \u201cFair is fair.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaetz also announced the action on Wednesday against Twitter, tweeting that he was \u201cworking on legislation to revise Section 230 so we don\u2019t have election interference from companies like Twitter.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donor Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg Tax: Burden Shifts to States After IRS Eases Donor-Disclosure Rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sam McQuillan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s now on states to seek more information about nonprofit donors if they want it, after the IRS rolled back disclosure requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS nixed a requirement that organizations exempt under tax\u00a0code Section 501(c), except for 501(c)(3) charities and Section 527 political organizations, include names and addresses of donors who contribute $5,000 or more on tax forms they send to the agency. The final IRS rules (T.D. 9898), issued Tuesday, left it up to states to take a different path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTo the extent that any state determines that the burdens of collecting and maintaining such information are justified by its own needs, such a state is free to require reporting of such information to the state and to maintain the information at the state\u2019s own expense,\u201d the IRS said\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader issue of donor disclosure was at the center of Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Becerra, in which a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit panel ruled a conservative political action committee must disclose information on its biggest donors to the state attorney general. That fight is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, where the justices have invited the solicitor general to file a brief reflecting the government\u2019s views as they consider whether to take the case\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen attorneys general-including those from New Jersey, New York, and California-commented on the proposed rules, telling the IRS that no longer receiving the information from the agency would \u201crequire a reorientation of processes that would cost the states time and money.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: POLITICO Playbook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Lehrich\u00a0\u2014 an Obama and Hillary Clinton alum \u2014 and\u00a0Nicole Gill\u00a0are launching Accountable Tech, which is aimed at combating misinformation online.

Fact check: Joe Biden got a good night\u2019s rest and is decidedly not sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Republicans demand the same, they\u2019ll have a point. \u201cMedicare for All will cost substantially less than the status quo,\u201d Bernie Sanders tweeted Jan. 14\u2026 Is Twitter going to verify what the leaders of Iran are posting? Any fact-checking can\u2019t help but be wildly inconsistent, and it will inevitably be attacked as arbitrary and partisan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this means that CEO Jack Dorsey is handing Mr. Trump evidence to prove his point that technology elites are out to get the President and his followers. Mr. Dorsey is teeing up Twitter (and maybe other social-media sites) for government monitoring and political control. \u201cTwitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter (of course), \u201cand I, as President, will not allow it to happen!\u201d Watch and weep as public support leaps for government regulation of internet content, a Fairness Doctrine for social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason (Volokh Conspiracy): Twitter\u2019s Speech Isn\u2019t \u201cStifling Free Speech\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Eugene Volokh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1.] [S]uch\u00a0labeling by Twitter\u00a0isn\u2019t stifling free speech-it\u2019s Twitter management exercising their own free speech: They are letting [President Trump] speak, but responding to the speech with their own. That\u2019s their First Amendment right, just as it\u2019s [President Trump\u2019s] First Amendment right to criticize them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if they did take down his post, then one could argue that would be stifling free speech. It wouldn\u2019t be a violation of the Free Speech Clause, because Twitter is a private company. But free speech is a broader idea than just the freedom from government suppression; one could sensibly say that a private entity is undermining free speech in various ways, especially when the entity promotes itself as a forum for public discourse\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2.]\u00a0The President, of course, has no power to stop Twitter from doing this, partly because he can\u2019t create new laws and partly because Twitter\u2019s speech is constitutionally protected\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[3.]\u00a0Finally, there is a separate objection here: that Twitter is \u201cinterfering\u201d in the election by throwing its massive weight behind one particular position. But the First Amendment protects our right to speak, at least under\u00a0Citizens United\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any event, though, even if one concludes that speech by rich and powerful institutions or individuals that may influence elections is \u201cinterference\u201d that should be condemned, it is still not \u201cstifling FREE SPEECH.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(By the way, it\u2019s not clear where the\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0dissenters would have drawn the line between newspaper corporations, which they said do have a First Amendment right to speak about candidates, and other corporations, which they said don\u2019t have such a right. It\u2019s therefore not clear which side of the line Twitter would fall on-recall that Citizens United was a video production company, and the dissenters would have ruled against it. But their position didn\u2019t prevail.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News: Zuckerberg knocks Twitter for fact-checking Trump, says private companies shouldn\u2019t be \u2018the arbiter of truth\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Yael Halon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called out Twitter for attaching a fact check to a tweet from President Trump, telling Fox News\u2019 Dana Perino that privately-owned digital platforms should not act as the \u201carbiter of truth.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,\u201d Zuckerberg told \u201cThe Daily Briefing\u201d in an interview scheduled to air in full on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn\u2019t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,\u201d he added. \u201cPrivate companies probably shouldn\u2019t be, especially these platform companies, shouldn\u2019t be in the position of doing that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg made the comment after President Trump warned social media giants that the federal government could \u201cstrongly regulate\u201d or \u201cclose them down\u201d if they continue to \u201csilence conservative voices.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI have to understand what they actually would intend to do,\u201d Zuckerberg said in response to the president\u2019s warning. \u201cBut in general, I think a government choosing to to censor a platform because they\u2019re worried about censorship doesn\u2019t exactly strike me as the the right reflex there.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KFOR: Stitt signs controversial bill that prohibits Israel boycotts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By K.

Stitt signed the measure into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, attorneys with the Oklahoma chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union and Council on American-Islamic Relations warned that the measure is unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Redman, the interim director of ACLU of Oklahoma, said the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that economic and political boycotts are a form of political speech enshrined and protected by the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe ACLU has a long history of challenging this type of legislation,\u201d Redman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal judges in Arizona, Kansas and Texas have blocked similar laws from taking effect, while a judge in neighboring Arkansas let a similar law stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 5/28 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

The company\u2019s plan is unwise, but a far worse outcome would be a government effort to bar it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Twitter added a link to a compilation of its own facts to two of Trump\u2019s tweets about mail-in ballots. Trump responded by accusing Twitter of stifling free speech and interfering in the 2020 election\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only threat to the First Amendment here is the president\u2019s threat to retaliate against Twitter. Private companies have the right to speak. Social media companies have the right to set policies for speech on their platforms. </p><p>The government has no power to punish a company for fact-checking or editorializing about the president\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many conservatives and some liberals understand and support the Constitution\u2019s protection for speech by corporations, recognized by the 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which allowed corporations to independently support or oppose candidates. Along with other key precedents like New York Times vs. Sullivan, Citizens United protects Twitter\u2019s speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Center for Responsive Politics: Election spending boosted by secret money tops $100M as IRS ends donor reporting rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Karl Evers-Hillstrom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS finalized a rule this week that will exempt some dark money groups from disclosing their donors to the IRS. Many 501(c)(4) nonprofits affected by the new rule already don\u2019t disclose their donors to the public. But some experts have expressed concern that the elimination of donor reporting could hurt government investigators\u2019 efforts to uncover the illegal use of foreign money in U.S. elections\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department noted the rule would prevent the IRS from leaking confidential donor information as the agency did in 2013\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative groups attempted to eliminate nonprofit donor reporting to the IRS through the courts but judges repeatedly ruled that government requests for the names of donors are not a violation of the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Keating, president of the Institute for Free Speech, which argues against campaign finance restrictions, said this week the rule \u201cwill encourage more people to give and protect groups that criticize government.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump Administration\u00a0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: The Twitter Fairness Doctrine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By The\u00a0Editorial Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump, personally piqued by a \u201cfact check\u201d that Twitter added to two of his tweets, now wants to pare back the liability protections that have helped the internet flourish for 24 years. This is a mistake, and it would drag the federal government into regulating online speech, aiming for some nebulous \u201cneutrality.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive order that Mr. Trump signed Thursday is aimed in particular at Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That 1996 law lets websites moderate posts by users without risking liability for the content. Without this shield, a company like Yelp might be sued by every business that gets a bad review. The Journal might be sued for something in the comments section\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 230 says internet platforms, acting in good faith, can nix anything they find \u201cobscene,\u201d \u201charassing,\u201d or \u201cotherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s order calls on regulators to clarify when content moderation might be considered in bad faith, such as if it\u2019s \u201cpretextual,\u201d inconsistent with the terms of service, or performed without giving users \u201cadequate notice, reasoned explanation, or a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cato Institute: Trump\u2019s Social Media Order Rewrites Internet Law by Decree&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Will Duffield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A] draft of the forthcoming executive order seems to slyly misunderstand Section 230, reading contingency into its protections. Let\u2019s take a\u00a0look at the\u00a0statute\u00a0and the relevant sections of the proposed\u00a0executive order\u00a0to see how its interpretation errs\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statute contains two parts, (c)(1) and (c)(2). Subsection (c)(1) prevents providers of an \u201cinteractive computer service,\u201d be they Twitter, or a\u00a0blog with a\u00a0comments sections, from being treated as the publisher of their users\u2019 speech. 230 (c)(2) separately addresses providers\u2019 civil liability for actions taken to moderate or remove content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive order obfuscates this distinction, presenting (c)(1) as contingent on (c)(2). The EO contends that \u201csubsection (c)(2) qualifies that principle when the provider edits content provided by others.\u201d This is simply incorrect. Subsection (c)(2) protects platforms from a\u00a0different source of liability entirely. While the first subsection stops platforms from being treated as the publishers of user speech, (c)(2) prevent platforms from being sued for filtering or removal. Its protections are entirely separate from those of (c)(1); dozens of lawsuits have attempted to treat platforms as the publishers of user speech, none have first asked if platforms\u2019 moderation is unbiased or conducted in good faith. Even if a\u00a0provider\u2019s moderation were found to breach the statute\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d element, it would merely render them liable for their moderation of the content in question, it wouldn\u2019t make them a\u00a0publisher writ large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Review: Trump\u2019s Illiberal Internet Fairness Doctrine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Harsanyi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 230 wasn\u2019t passed to regulate fairness or neutrality of political speech on platforms \u2013 a nebulous and unenforceable demand, even if it had been \u2013 but to allow websites to deal with online indecency\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What right does the executive branch of the United States government have to collect speech complaints? What does \u201ccensorship\u201d even mean when it relates to a private company? Is a fact-check by Twitter an act of \u201ccensorship?\u201d Is shutting down a Nazi troll account or a Chinese propaganda account an act of censorship? The administration risks creating new methods to chill speech without benefiting open debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, when was the last time government intervention made speech more free or fair? Have conservatives forgotten that\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0was a decision sparked by bureaucrats who used existing election laws, passed in effort to ensure more \u201cfairness,\u201d to ban political speech? Have they forgotten that how easily IRS officials tasked as arbiters of that fair speech can abuse their power?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe they\u2019ll remember when Attorney General Kamala Harris is overseeing the White House Office of Digital Strategy and regulating online speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Insider: An FCC commissioner slammed Trump\u2019s executive order on social media, calling it an attempt to turn the FCC into \u2018the President\u2019s speech police\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Aaron Holmes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A draft of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order targeting social media companies is already getting feedback from the Federal Communications Commission, with commissioners split along party lines over the proposal\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, harshly criticized the order in a statement Thursday, framing it as a threat to free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis does not work. Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into the President\u2019s speech police is not the answer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for those in Washington to speak up for the First Amendment. History won\u2019t be kind to silence.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Republican FCC commissioner Brendan Carr voiced support for the executive order in an interview with Yahoo Finance, arguing that Section 230 should be reexamined if not overhauled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI think given what we\u2019ve seen over the last few weeks, it makes sense to let the public weigh-in and say \u2018is that really what Congress meant\u2019 when they passed and provided those special protections,\u201d Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Mike O\u2019Rielly, another Republican, said on Twitter that he sees both sides of the debate and urged his followers to \u201ctake [a] deep breath.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiley\u2019s Election Law News: FEC\u2019s Prosecutorial Discretion Considered by Federal Court, Again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lee E. Goodman and Jeremy J. Broggi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard arguments in\u00a0Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) v. Federal Election Commission (FEC)\u00a0on April 24, 2020. The case involves CREW\u2019s challenge to the FEC\u2019s dismissal of CREW\u2019s complaint against a now-defunct conservative 501(c)(4) organization, New Models, alleging the organization became a \u201cpolitical committee,\u201d or PAC, by contributing to several independent super PACs. Because the FEC dismissed for legal reasons \u201cand in exercise of our prosecutorial discretion\u201d the case implicates an important and ongoing dispute in the D.C. Circuit involving the reviewability of the FEC\u2019s exercise of prosecutorial discretion when the agency pairs that discretion with substantive legal reasoning.\u00a0\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason (Volokh Conspiracy):\u00a0Washington Judge Rejects Lawsuit Over Fox News\u2019 Supposed Coronavirus Misrepresentations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Eugene Volokh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From\u00a0today\u2019s opinion\u00a0by Judge Brian McDonald:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;On April 15, 2020, WASHLITE filed a first amended complaint alleging that Fox violated the Consumer Protection Act \u2026. The complaint alleges that in February and March 2020, hosts and guests on Fox\u2019s programs falsely described the coronavirus as a \u201choax\u201d and falsely minimized the threat of the coronavirus and COVID-19\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;WASHLITE\u2026argues that Fox, as a cable programmer, does not have the same First Amendment rights accorded to newspapers and broadcast television stations\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;These assertions do not hold up to scrutiny\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;[A]s the Supreme Court recognized, \u201cIf there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is generally quite right, certainly as to the \u201ccable television is unprotected\u201d argument (see\u00a0this post) and likely also as to the \u201cfalse statements about epidemics are unprotected\u201d argument (see\u00a0this post). I also think the alleged misinformation on Fox\u2019s part consisted of expressions of opinion, not false statements of fact (see\u00a0this post), but the judge\u2019s reasoning here made it unnecessary for him to decide that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN: Arresting reporters at a protest is an affront to the First Amendment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Brian Stelter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a journalist is arrested at a protest, the free and fair gathering of the news is arrested, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s one of the reasons why these infringements on press freedom are relatively rare in the United States \u2014 and why Friday\u2019s brief arrest of a CNN crew in Minneapolis was so egregious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cPolice may not prevent journalists from covering protests if the journalists are in a place where the public is allowed, and they are not disrupting or interfering with law enforcement. Simply being near a protest or other newsworthy event is not a crime,\u201d the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press states in its guide to covering protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live video from correspondent Omar Jimenez and the CNN crew showed that they were not interfering with law enforcement\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Jimenez was taken into custody along with producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reporters Committee guide states that \u201cpolice cannot arrest journalists in retaliation for negative coverage or to prevent reporting on a public demonstration.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to many viewers who saw the arrest take place live on air, that\u2019s exactly what it looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News: Gaetz warns \u2018big tech will steal this election from Donald Trump and the American people\u2019 without action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Charles Creitz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Rep.

Hasen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Federalist Society\u00a0continues to claim\u00a0officially that it plays no role whatsoever in politics, policy, or judicial nominations, and the group itself scrupulously avoids taking stances on issues like voter fraud, Leonard Leo-who until recently ran operations at the Federalist Society-has developed a network of political groups, none of which disclose their donors, funded at about a quarter of a billion dollars. So far, that effort has been mostly directed at seating deeply conservative judges on the federal bench for decades to come. But there is a new initiative afoot: an effort to engage in political dirty tricks to manipulate democracy itself\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As\u00a0an eye-opening new report released Wednesday\u00a0by Sens. Chuck Schumer, Debbie Stabenow, and Sheldon Whitehouse contends, Leo, who is still co-chairman of the Federalist Society, is now spearheading an all-out effort to capture the federal judiciary and to seat judges who are likely to rule in favor of those secret monied interests. That is more of an investment plan than a means of preserving an independent judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: Twitter Flags Trump Tweet About Minneapolis Protests for \u2018Glorifying Violence\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Newley Purnell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter placed a notice on a tweet from President Trump, shielding it from view for breaking what the company said are its rules about glorifying violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet was a comment on the violent protests in Minnesota. The post can now only be seen after users click a box with a notice saying it violated Twitter\u2019s rules against encouraging violence, but it otherwise remains visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019ve taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the Tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the Tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance,\u201d Twitter said on its official communications account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time such a step has been taken against a head of state for breaking Twitter\u2019s rules about glorifying violence, a company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said users\u2019 ability to interact with the tweet will be limited, and that users can retweet it with comment, but not like, reply to, or otherwise retweet it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2026These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won\u2019t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood Reporter: Twitter CEO Responds to Trump: \u201cWe\u2019ll Continue to Point Out Incorrect or Disputed Information About Elections\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Abid Rahman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey reaffirmed the company\u2019s commitment to fact check information related to elections despite a fierce reaction from the Trump administration over a pair of Donald Trump\u2019s tweets that were flagged as misleading on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a storm of criticism from the president\u2019s allies and threats from Trump himself to regulate social media companies via executive order, Dorsey tweeted\u2026that Twitter will \u201ccontinue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis does not make us an \u201carbiter of truth.\u201d Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions,\u201d Dorsey wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Review: The Folly of Twitter\u2019s Fact-Check Policy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Harsanyi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Twitter begins tagging some tweets and not others with \u201cwhat you need to know,\u201d it will be staking out partisan positions. The Trump tweets that precipitated its first election-related fact-check are a good example of this\u2026Twitter decided to inaugurate its policy by alleging that Trump had dishonestly claimed that mail-in ballots would lead to \u201ca Rigged Election.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if this contention were entirely baseless, it would be as untrue as saying Russia rigged the election \u2013 a claim that politicians such as Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi, along with most major media outlets, have been making for years. But while the president\u2019s rhetoric about voting is debatable, it is also well within the normal parameters of contemporary political discourse\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the problem: Whom will Twitter designate as its judge? Its fact-checking page redirects users to debunkings of the president\u2019s tweets by partisan operatives such as Vox\u2019s Aaron Rupar and CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale \u2013 two figures who possess no expertise gauging policy outcomes and who are quite often dishonest and misleading themselves. As for CNN, the Washington Post, Vox, HuffPost, and the other outlets featured on the page \u2013 they deceive their audiences with far more sophistication than the president. These outlets like to appeal to the authority of experts, but not experts whose conclusions contradict their own. There is a reason we debate issues rather than appoint Truth Magistrates to hand down verdicts: For the most part, politics is a dispute not over facts but over values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: New York City Mayor\u2019s Race Feels the Impact of the Coronavirus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Katie Honan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[One] major change for this election is the new [New York City] campaign-finance laws, which makes small-dollar donations more valuable with a new 8-to-1 matching program introduced before the pandemic\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program can be a boon for lesser-known candidates such as [mayoral candidate] Dianne Morales. \u201cThe matching funds program is such a great potential leveler for a candidate like myself, in terms of making it possible,\u201d said Ms. Morales\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates will be first eligible for funds from the program in December based on their campaign-finance filings due in July-money that is usually raised during the spring. There are other opportunities for campaign payouts, but the first one is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ms. Morales has essentially stopped campaigning, shifting instead to the immediate needs in her community of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe current crisis has significantly hindered the initial spirit and intention behind the matching program in terms of someone like me specifically,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best-known, best-funded candidates so far are those already in public office\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These candidates also have more name recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou have a natural role in a crisis, you have a natural platform you can be focused on whether it\u2019s mutual aid or legislation to help people,\u201d said Monica Klein, a political adviser who worked on [two] de Blasio mayoral campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 5/29 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, Pennsylvania ranked as one of the top states in the country, earning an A grade...</p><p><br/>Pennsylvania's high score is particularly notable given the poor performances of its neighbors. Bordering West Virginia and Maryland both receive an F, while Ohio and Delaware each earn a D. New York fares a little better, earning a C grade, but it still restricts most forms of political giving. Taking stock of the entire East Coast, only Virginia does as well as the Keystone State at protecting the freedom to support candidates and causes...<br/>Capping the amount of money that a candidate's supporters can donate makes it harder for political outsiders to break into a system dominated by entrenched incumbents.<br/>Perhaps that is why recent calls to impose contribution limits in Pennsylvania have come from the governor's residence. Gov. Tom Wolf has pushed for contribution limits as part of his plan to \"reform\" Pennsylvania politics. If he gets his way, democracy will become less vibrant in the state and voters will have less speech about candidates to inform their vote.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Debunking Three Myths about the \"Honest Ads Act\"<br/>By Luke Wachob<br/>The deceptively-named \"Honest Ads Act\" is a proposal in Congress that would increase regulations for paid political and issue advertising on the Internet - including communications by organizations engaged in nonpartisan voter education, registration, and get out the vote efforts.\u00a0In order to run such ads, groups would be forced to comply with complex and confusing government reporting requirements and include an inflexible disclaimer on their online ads...<br/>Here's the reality behind three common myths about the misnamed \"Honest Ads Act.\" ...<br/>Myth #1:\u00a0The Honest Ads Act is a \"light touch\" approach to Internet speech regulation...<br/>Myth #2:\u00a0The Honest Ads Act would apply current rules for television, radio, and print ads to Internet ads...<br/>Myth #3:\u00a0The Honest Ads Act would prevent or deter foreign interference in elections...<br/>While failing to meaningfully address foreign election interference, the so-called \"Honest Ads Act\" places considerable burdens on the online political speech of Americans and groups of Americans through heavy-handed regulation of the Internet.\u00a0<br/>PDF<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supreme Court\u00a0</emphasis><br/>San Francisco Chronicle: Supreme Court turns down challenge to SF advertising restrictions<br/>By Bob Egelko<br/>San Francisco's restrictions on outdoor advertising signs, permitting the signs only where advertisers conduct business, were left intact Tuesday when the U.S. Supreme Court turned down a challenge by business groups...<br/>In a 2015 lawsuit, Contest Promotions argued that the ordinance was discriminatory and violated free speech. The company cited a Supreme Court ruling, also in 2015, that found an Arizona town violated freedom of speech by setting tighter limits on signs that advertise local church services than on signs that carry political or ideological messages.<br/>But U.S. District Judge Susan Illston dismissed Contest Promotions' suit, saying the Supreme Court ruling in the Arizona case did not involve commercial speech, which has been granted lesser constitutional protection than noncommercial expression and is subject to more government regulation.<br/>The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld Illston's decision last August, citing its previous rulings that allowed cities to ban commercial billboards and other off-site advertising in order to promote \"safety and aesthetics.\" ...<br/>The high court denied review Tuesday without comment.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation</emphasis><br/>TechCrunch: Internet titans ask for 'flexibility' with new election ad regulations<br/>By\u00a0Taylor Hatmaker<br/>A trade group representing big tech's interests in Washington reached out to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Tuesday to weigh in on proposed regulation that would affect the disclosure of funding for online election ads...<br/>Tech companies are warming up to proposed regulation in Congress known as the Honest Ads Act, but the FEC is working on a new ruleset of its own regarding funding disclosures for election ads, as well.<br/>In its new comments, the Internet Association (which represents companies including Facebook, Twitter, Google, Snap and more) argued that such disclosures should be allowed to live one click away from the ads, pushing against proposals that would force disclosure to be displayed on an ad itself. The IA said such requirements would be limiting for innovation in the ad industry.<br/>\"IA also believes that technology plays an important role in providing information, and that rollovers, click-throughs, and other technology yet to be developed, can provide far more meaningful information to users than traditional 'in the box' disclaimers,\" said IA President and CEO Michael Beckerman.<br/>In the filing, the IA further elaborated on its position in favor of what it calls adaptive disclaimers:<br/>\"Rather than trying to fit a 'paid for by' notice on an ad that may change in size when delivered on different platforms or devices, the adaptive disclaimer would be inserted into the ad and be visible and accessible in all formats.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IRS</emphasis><br/>Center for Individual Freedom: Eric Schneiderman Proves the Need for IRS Reform and Donor Privacy Protection<br/>By Timothy H. Lee<br/>[T]he Internal Revenue Service (IRS) currently compels private nonprofit organizations to file a \"990 Schedule B\" form. Among other sensitive private information, that form contains the names, addresses and other identifying information on many people who simply choose to donate their own money to those organizations. In turn, that obviously creates the risk that such donors can be exposed and targeted by federal, state and local officials for their donations.\u00a0<br/>Here's the particularly odd part. The IRS is actually prohibited from using the form's information for any substantive purpose. Which raises the question of why it's collected at all...<br/>Earlier this year, the House of Representatives introduced the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, H.R. 4916, which would eliminate the Schedule B filing requirement. The House passed identical legislation in the last Congress, so there's even more reason to pass it now with a President Trump willing to sign it.\u00a0<br/>Obviously, a permanent legislative fix through H.R. 4916 would be ideal. In the meantime, however, nonprofit organizations and their donors remain vulnerable to targeting. So until Congress passes it, the Trump Administration can act.\u00a0<br/>Namely, the current IRS under Trump Administration leadership can commence a rulemaking to eliminate the Schedule B collection mandate. Because Congress has never adopted a requirement that the IRS collect the Schedule B forms for most exempt nonprofit organizations, eliminating it lies within the IRS's authority.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Daily Caller:\u00a0A Primer For Confused Conservatives On The First Amendment And Free Speech On Social Media<br/>By\u00a0Carl\u00a0Szabo<br/>The First Amendment does not entitle a liberal journalist to demand publication in a conservative magazine. The First Amendment also does not require a cable news television station to feature balanced coverage.<br/>Nor is it a violation of the First Amendment for an online platform to remove content it doesn't like. Rather, that is the operators of the online platform exercising their First Amendment rights.<br/>This is something conservatives usually recognize, even as recently as the Sinclair fake news bulletin scandal, where the network was accused of pushing out a political message via its locally owned media stations. Conservatives were quick to defend the media company, acknowledging its right to regulate content...<br/>For those conservatives fully aware of how the First Amendment works and who still call for government action against Facebook, I just say: Cut it out. The solution for conservatives' concerns about social media platforms is to vote with your feet and use a different platform. Stick to your principles and forget about the temporary insanity of arguing to expand government regulation...<br/>Government regulation of free speech online would not safeguard the future of conservative speech. It would endanger it.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>InsideSources: Congressional Democrats Pushing for Bold Democracy Solutions<br/>By Michael Sozan<br/>Now more than ever, Democrats must show that they are the party that wants to expand the essential right of every American to have their voice heard and to spur progressive economic changes that will help all Americans. That's why the time is right to advance the democracy reform agenda unveiled by congressional Democrats, the Better Deal for Our Democracy.<br/>First, the package aims to fix our broken campaign finance system to combat big money influence. This includes policies like ending the harmful effects of unaccountable dark money unleashed by Citizens United and empowering everyday voters via a new system of citizen-funded elections.<br/>Second, the legislation would strengthen our nation's ethics laws to reduce corrupt self-dealing. This includes reforms like applying ethics laws to all U.S. presidents, strengthening anti-bribery laws, and banning lobbyists from fundraising for members of Congress...<br/>Congress could even go a step further by banning lawmakers from raising money from interests under the jurisdiction of the committees they sit on, a CAP proposal supported by 88 percent of voters, including 86 percent of Trump voters.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Chambersburg Public Opinion: Halvorson and Eichelberger file FEC complaints in Pa. 13th Congressional race<br/>By Jim Hook<br/>Two GOP candidates in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District allege that ads attacking them were coordinated by Dr. John Joyce's campaign committee and \"dark money\" groups in violation of federal election law.<br/>Art Halvorson and state Sen. John Eichelberger say they\u00a0filed separate complaints last week with the Federal Election Commission...<br/>Red Maverick Media handled advertising for both the Joyce campaign and at least one super PAC.<br/>\"Given the limited size of Red Maverick Media, it is likely they do not have prior 'firewall' procedures to prohibit the flow of information between employees or consultants\" working for the Joyce campaign and working for Defending Main Street SuperPAC, according to Halvorson's complaint to the FEC...<br/>Adam Breneman, Joyce's campaign manager, previously worked for Red Maverick.<br/>Breneman termed the alleged collusion\u00a0as \"an absurd accusation\" and \"another ridiculous lie.\"<br/>\"Our campaign hired Ray Zaborney as our general consultant, and there was absolutely no coordination between our campaign and any outside groups,\" Breneman said.\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Events\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Cato:\u00a0Will Social Media Save Democracy?<br/>Featuring Alexandra Woodward, Digital Organizing Director, Organizing for Action; Ned Ryun, Founder and CEO, American Majority; George Hawley, Author, Making Sense of the Alt-Right; Katie Harbath, Director, Global Politics and Government Outreach, Facebook; moderated by Andrew Marantz, Contributing Editor, The New Yorker.<br/>Many critics think social media poses a novel threat to liberal democracy. Seeking to divide Americans, agents of the Russian government bought ads on Facebook. Extreme speech also finds a home on the internet, fostering conflicts that appear to generate more heat than light. Governments and consumers worry about \"fake news\" designed to misinform readers for fun, profit, and power. And yet social media has made more information more widely available at less cost than any technology since the printing press. Less reliant on gatekeepers than traditional media, the new purveyors of news arguably better satisfy the diverse preferences of the American electorate. Following up on the Project on Political Reform at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, we will consider the troubles and triumphs of the social media platforms that promise to host American political debate for generations.<br/>Date: May 31, 2018<br/>Time: 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM EDT<br/>Location: Cato Institute<br/>Brookings:\u00a0The consequences of misinformation: A symposium on media and democracy<br/>The spread of false information is hardly new or unique to the current political moment. It has historical roots in sensationalist journalism, foreign espionage, propaganda, and partisan debates-a collection of approaches far richer than suggested by the phrase \"fake news.\" This historical context does not make disinformation any less dangerous, however. Understanding how disinformation is exploited by political actors both internal and external to the state, how existing divisions and polarization create the conditions for disinformation to be more effective, and the ways in which technologies incentivize or disrupt disinformation, is critical.<br/>On May 31, Governance Studies at Brookings and the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) will host a half-day forum on the history, circulation, and management of misinformation (untruths circulated without the intention to deceive) and disinformation (untruths intended to deceive). Several panels of experts will convene to explore the most effective means of identifying and countering false information, as well as the challenges in doing so. Social scientists and journalists will speak to three aspects of the current moment in misinformation: the status of facts/persistence of misinformation; the speed, virality, and spread of misinformation; and what we-or anyone-can do to correct or manage the misinformation that already exists.<br/>Date:\u00a0May 31, 2018<br/>Time:\u00a08:45 AM - 12:45 PM EDT<br/>Location: Brookings Institution<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns</emphasis><br/>Daily Beast:\u00a0What Happened to Jill Stein's Recount Millions?<br/>By Charles Davis<br/>Shortly after the 2016 election, Jill Stein raised more than $7 million from shell-shocked liberals eager to pursue a swing-state recount. Nearly two years later, the U.S. Green Party's last candidate for president is still spending that money.<br/>Ongoing litigation, travel costs, and staff salaries are also likely to eat up whatever is left, meaning those who donated to Stein are unlikely to receive a once-promised chance to vote on how the post-recount money would be spent. Nor have donors been given much of a window into how Stein is actually spending their donations.<br/>The last FEC filing from the Stein campaign was for the month of September 2017. And the last update from the campaign itself came in a post on April 20, in which it said it was down to $932,178 in recount funds.<br/>\"It is strange that they would just stop filing reports given they were a legitimate, professional campaign, and despite still having more than a million dollars in cash on hand,\" Andrew Mayersohn, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, told The Daily Beast...<br/>In a May 7, 2018 letter, the FEC warned Stein campaign treasurer Steven Welzer that he was violating federal law by not accounting for half a year of spending.\u00a0<br/>\"The failure to timely file this report may result in civil money penalties, suspension of matching funds, an audit or legal enforcement action,\" the letter states, noting there is no grace period.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>New York Times:\u00a0Online Political Ad Bill to Be Law Without Gov's Signature<br/>By The Associated Press<br/>Maryland officials who support the measure have called it a first-of-its kind law in the country for its expansiveness and the powers it provides the Maryland State Board of Elections to investigate social media ads. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed a similar measure to bring transparency to online political ads into law last month...<br/>The bill is similar in some respects to one introduced in Congress that would require digital platforms with at least 50 million monthly visitors to maintain a public file of advertisers who spend more than $500 in ads on the platform. But the Maryland measure goes much further, because it would apply to digital platforms with 100,000 monthly visitors...\u00a0<br/>Rebecca Snyder, executive director of the press association, said the organization remains concerned that the law is unconstitutional. She said she has heard from some members of the association mention a potential legal challenge.<br/>\"I do not know if that will happen, but it has been raised,\" Snyder said, adding that the lower monthly visitor threshold \"reaches down very deep\" in terms of how many websites will be affected...<br/>Facebook supported the measure.<br/>\"We believe this bill will be a national model for the other 49 states to follow,\" Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local policy, said last month.<br/>Arizona Republic:\u00a0Ducey signs off on Tempe's dark money measure, with a word of caution<br/>By Jerod MacDonald-Evoy<br/>Gov. Doug Ducey signed off on a voter-approved measure to eliminate secret political spending in Tempe elections, but his office also issued a word of caution: the approval is based on current law, not new rules that will take effect in August.<br/>The state Legislature outlawed cities from requiring political non-profits to disclose their donors, among other things. Ducey, a major benefactor of dark money spending in 2014, signed the bill in April.<br/>\"Please note that this approval is based on the law as it is at the time of the approval and does not take into account any changes that have not yet taken effect from this legislative session,\" Ducey's Deputy General Counsel, Anni Foster, said in her letter to the city...<br/>[Tempe Councilwoman Lauren] Kuby said that she expects a state lawmaker to promptly seek an investigation into whether Tempe's new disclosure requirement violates state law. Any state lawmaker can request an Attorney General's Office investigation into whether a municipal ordinance violates state law or the state Constitution. If a city is found to be in violation, the state can withhold revenue until the problem is fixed.<br/>\"We're walking into this with our eyes open,\" said Kuby...<br/>Ducey and Republican lawmakers say political spending is an issue of free speech. \"The governor's view is that individuals have the First Amendment right to free speech without the fear of intimidation,\" Daniel Scarpinato, Ducey's spokesman, previously told The Arizona Republic.<br/>St. Louis Post-Dispatch:\u00a0Greitens goes out the way he came in, haunted by the specter of dark money<br/>By Tony Messenger<br/>Not quite 17 months into his term, Greitens is going out the way he came in, haunted by the specter of dark money.<br/>Earlier in the morning, on the day that would signal a sudden end, Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem ruled that Greitens would have to turn over documents from his campaign, and those from his dark-money committee, A New Missouri, to the House committee investigating the governor's various alleged misdeeds.<br/>That committee met on Tuesday, hearing from former Greitens staffer Michael Hafner, who laid out the case that the early days of Greitens' campaign, in 2014 before he ever filed a campaign committee, might have run afoul of Missouri ethics laws.<br/>Hafner's testimony wasn't new. He previously spoke to the committee behind closed doors, and was questioned by Attorney General Josh Hawley, who was investigating whether the governor broke the law by taking the donor list from the nonprofit he founded - The Mission Continues - and using it to raise money for his political campaign.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-11894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3234\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 30, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Daily Media Links</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

As Secretary Mnuchin has\u00a0noted\u00a0in the past, this proposal does not limit transparency as the same information will be available to the public as before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already measures in place to track foreign donations, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will admit to funneling illegal money on the form.\u00a0Even if the IRS did suspect laws were being broken, it has no authority to share the information it collects with the FCC and the DOJ, the two agencies with the ability to enforce campaign finance\u00a0laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ending the collection of Schedule B forms will instead remove a tool of the left to chill political speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New from the Institute for Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campaign Legal Center v. Federal Election Commission: Proposed Amicus Curiae Brief Of The Institute For Free Speech In Support Of Defendant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amicus writes to apprise this Court of reasons why Plaintiff Campaign Legal Center\u2019s motion for a default judgment should not be granted at this time. </p><p>While the Federal Election Commission (\u201cFEC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) has failed to respond to this Court\u2019s show cause order of May 14, 2020, that is only because it is blocked from participating in this litigation by an act of Congress and inaction by the political branches. None of these causes was within the FEC\u2019s control. However, with the confirmation of a new commissioner, the FEC\u2019s quorum has been restored and its legal paralysis resolved. The Commission should be given a reasonable amount of time to get its affairs in order and respond to the Plaintiff\u2019s suit. That is especially true where the underlying lawsuit poses a distinct threat to the statutory role Congress envisioned for the Commission, the underlying merits of the lawsuit implicate the First Amendment rights of third parties, and there are reasons to doubt Plaintiff\u2019s Article III standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full amicus brief here (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump Administration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Trump, Lacking Clear Authority, SaysU.S. Will Declare Antifa a Terrorist Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Maggie Haberman and Charlie Savage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that the United States would designate a group of far-left anti-fascism activists as a terrorist organization, a declaration that lacked any clear legal authority, as his administration sought to blame the group for violent protests across the nation over the weekend\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, antifa is not an organization. It does not have a leader, membership roles or any defined, centralized structure. Rather, it is a vaguely defined movement of people who share common protest tactics and targets\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More important, even if antifa were a real organization, the laws that permit the federal government to deem entities terrorists and impose sanctions on them are limited to foreign groups\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere is no authority under law to do that \u2013 and if such a statute were passed, it would face serious First Amendment challenges,\u201d said Mary B.

Federal Election Commission [SCOTUSbrief]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Michael R. Dimino&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a non-profit organization called Citizens United attempted to air and advertise a political documentary called \u201cHillary: The Movie\u201d (funded in part by corporate contributors), the Federal Election Commission said that this would be a violation of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which proscribed corporations from engaging in \u201celectioneering communication\u201d within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do corporations have a right to engage in political speech?

Nygaard wrote in the opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State officials appealed to Nygaard\u2019s court after U.S. Middle District Judge Sylvia H. Rambo barred the state from enforcing the act\u2019s ban on political contributions by anyone affiliated with an entity holding a state gaming license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute hit the courts when Pasquale T. Deon Sr. and Maggie Hardy Magerko, who both have interests on gaming businesses, sued the state gaming board and attorney general\u2019s office over the political contributions ban\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt is axiomatic that a democratic government must make every effort to fight corruption, and the perception of it, to protect the integrity of its electoral, legislative, and regulatory processes,\u201d [Nygaard] wrote. \u201cBut when it acts it must be mindful of the fundamental speech and associational rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution at stake.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania officials have not proven that their total ban is justified when those other states impose lesser restrictions that don\u2019t severely infringe free speech rights, Nygaard concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Verge: Reddit and Twitter join the fight against US demands for visa applicants\u2019 online handles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By James Vincent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit and Twitter have filed\u00a0supporting evidence\u00a0in a lawsuit against the US government, which challenges the requirement that nearly all visa applicants submit their social media handles for scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies argue that this requirement will \u201cunquestionably chill a vast quantity of speech\u201d and that it \u201cviolates the First Amendment rights to speak anonymously and associate privately.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThose guarantees are deeply rooted in this nation\u2019s history, which has long cherished anonymity\u2019s role in guaranteeing a robust marketplace of ideas \u2013 one where speakers can choose to keep their identity and their associations private as \u2018a shield from the tyranny of the majority,'\u201d say the two firms. Their evidence is supported by the Internet Association, a trade association that represents US tech companies including Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirement for visa applicants to detail their social media accounts was\u00a0introduced in 2019\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, only applicants subjected to additional vetting had to supply this information. Certain diplomatic and official visa applicants are exempt\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit against these changes was brought\u00a0last year, with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, the Brennan Center for Justice, and lawyers from Simpson Thacher &amp;Bartlett; LLP suing the State Department on behalf of two US-based documentary film organizations, the Doc Society and International Documentary Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office of Congressman Matt Gaetz:\u00a0Congressman Matt Gaetz Hits Twitter with FEC Complaint, Accuses Platform of \u201cDomestic Election Interference\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz (FL-01) today filed a complaint against the social network company Twitter, accusing the tech giant of interference in federal elections \u201cby affixing a dubious \u201cfact-check\u201d link to certain statements of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d and thus \u201cmaking an in-kind contribution to his political opponents.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Twitter labeled two of President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets with \u201cfact checks,\u201d directing users who click on their labels to a Twitter \u201cstory\u201d which called the President\u2019s claims \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d In doing so, Twitter overstepped boundaries and set aside its privileged role as a mere \u201cinteractive computer service,\u201d and instead began acting as a \u201cshadow contributor\u201d to the Democratic National Committee, according to Congressman Gaetz\u2019s complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congressman Gaetz announced his complaint last night on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d and asserted that by adding this so-called \u201cfact check\u201d feature to the President\u2019s tweets, Twitter was engaging in \u201cdomestic election interference.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf someone is going to assert\u00a0that they are\u00a0a nonbiased neutral platform, we should not\u00a0just take that as an article of\u00a0faith.

If we just wait around, big tech\u00a0will steal this election from\u00a0Donald Trump and the American\u00a0people,\u201d\u00a0said Congressman Gaetz\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the complaint sent to the Federal Election Commission may be found\u00a0HERE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axios: Exclusive: Cruz calls for criminal investigation of Twitter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Margaret Harding McGill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), in a\u00a0letter\u00a0Friday to the Justice and Treasury departments, is calling for a criminal investigation of Twitter over allegations the company is violating U.S. sanctions against Iran\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter allows Iranian leaders to maintain accounts on its service, and Cruz is asking Attorney General Bill Barr and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to probe whether that violates U.S. sanctions prohibiting American companies from providing goods or services to the country\u2019s top officials\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has said it\u2019s in the public interest to have political figures\u2019 speech on its platform, even if some find that speech objectionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company on Friday\u00a0labeled a tweet\u00a0from Trump about the unrest in Minneapolis as breaking its rules on \u201cglorifying violence.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\u00a0White House\u00a0and Federal Communications Commission Chairman\u00a0Ajit Pai, among other prominent conservatives, questioned why Twitter hasn\u2019t applied similar labels to tweets from Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEN America: Arresting Dissent: Legislative Restrictions On The Right To Protest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nora Benavidez and James Tager&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEN America has documented an explosion of 116 state bills introduced since 2015-110 of which were introduced between 2017 and 2019 alone-that create new penalties or harsher sentences for protesters. In many cases, these bills appear to be direct responses to particular protests, or designed to constrain particular protest movements. These include \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d bills introduced in states that have seen significant pipeline protests, and anti-highway obstruction bills following on the heels of protests that have used road obstruction as a tactic\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 116 bills introduced since 2015 that would limit protest rights, 23 bills in 15 states have become law, and only two of those have been challenged in court. Already in the 2020 session, PEN America notes 16 similar bills working their way through state capitols. These new laws\u00a0 place a heavy burden on individuals in states where these bills have passed, forcing them to weigh their civic interest in exercising their First Amendment rights against the very real potential of being arrested or facing other reprisals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: \u2018The norms have broken down\u2019: Shock as journalists are arrested, injured by police while trying to cover the story&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Paul Farhi and Elahe Izadi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[MSNBC anchor Ali] Velshi, who suffered minor bruises, was one of at least a dozen journalists injured in cities across America this weekend \u2013 including a photographer who was blinded in one eye \u2013 as police fired rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas to quell unrest. Not since the 1960s, when the nation was racked by civil rights demonstrations, antiwar protests and urban riots, has the press been embroiled in so much violence on American shores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In several cases, reporters appear to have been swept up in indiscriminate efforts by authorities to disperse crowds. But in a number of incidents, journalists were injured, harassed or arrested even after identifying themselves as reporters \u2013 a blatant violation of constitutional protections and long-standing ground rules that guide interactions between media and law enforcement officials\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether these assaults are happening by accident or on purpose, they have the effect of impeding the news \u2013 hampering the public\u2019s ability to see and judge the behavior of officials who are accountable to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: News Outlets Are Liable for Others\u2019 Facebook Comments, Australian Court Rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Mike Cherney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newspapers\u00a0and television stations that post their own articles on Facebook Inc.\u2019s platform are liable for other Facebook users\u2019 defamatory comments on those posts, an Australian court ruled Monday, presenting a fresh dilemma for traditional publishers in the social-media age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media companies encourage and facilitate comments that can be seen by other Facebook users, said the highest court in the Australian state of New South Wales, which includes Sydney. That means, it ruled, that the companies should be considered publishers of the comments, responsible for their content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The media companies that were defendants in the original lawsuit, which include News Corp Australia as well as the publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald, said they are considering a further appeal to the country\u2019s highest court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cToday\u2019s decision means the media cannot share any story via Facebook without fear of being sued for comments which they did not publish and have no control over,\u201d they said. \u201cIt also creates the extraordinary situation where every public Facebook page-whether it be held by politicians, businesses or courts-is now liable for third-party comments on those pages.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision could also threaten social-media platforms like Facebook, which count on news articles for traffic and ad revenue\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia has also moved to hold social-media companies themselves responsible for what users post. After a live stream of a shooting spree at New Zealand mosques last year was posted on Facebook, Australia passed legislation that allows social-media platforms to be fined if they don\u2019t remove violent content quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Campaign Funds for Judges Warp Criminal Justice, Study Finds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Adam Liptak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elected judges, a new study found, tend to appoint lawyers who contribute to their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cCampaign finance is perverting the criminal justice system,\u201d said\u00a0Neel U. Sukhatme, a professor at Georgetown Law and an author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on six sets of data, the study examined Harris County in Texas, which is home to Houston and is the third most populous county in the nation, with more than four million residents. There is reason to think the problem identified by the study is widespread, as the same basic incentives exist in many jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2018Pay to play\u2019 might affect millions of Americans in other states, such as California, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, among others, which also permit attorneys to contribute to judges who control indigent defense appointments,\u201d the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Sukhatme conducted the study, which will be published in The Duke Law Journal, with Jay Jenkins, a lawyer with the\u00a0Texas Criminal Justice Coalition, a research and advocacy group. It considered more than 290,000 felony cases in Harris County between 2005 and 2018, analyzing data on elections, assignments, campaign contributions, lawyers\u2019 fees and bar records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat we find is shocking,\u201d the study said. \u201cWhile donor and nondonor attorneys appear similar in terms of their education and experience, on average, judges assign their donors more than double the number of cases they assign to nondonors.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American University Law Review: Anti-SLAPP Coverage and the First Amendment: Hurdles to Defamation Suits in Political Campaigns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David L. Hudson, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defamation cases often arise out of intemperate or offensive statements made in political campaigns. These comments may refer to a candidate\u2019s criminal history, familial conduct, or other matters. Whatever the subject, emotions undoubtedly run high during hotly contested campaigns. However, First Amendment protection is at its zenith when speakers engage in political speech, and speech about political candidates is inherently political speech. Thus, defamation suits arising out of political campaigns face significant hurdles, including (1) anti-SLAPP statutes and a greater public awareness of SLAPP suits; (2) a history and tradition of mudslinging and enhanced protection of political speech during political campaigns; and (3) the first-amendment-inspired doctrine of rhetorical hyperbole. This Article addresses these three obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Inside Twitter\u2019s Decision to Take Action on Trump\u2019s Tweets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Georgia Wells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Recently, Twitter] has taken several actions on messages from Mr. Trump as well as a post from the official White House account, marking some as breaking the company\u2019s rules and adding a fact-check label to two about mail-in ballots\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe internal decision-making wasn\u2019t quite a domino effect, but it started slowly trickling,\u201d an employee familiar with Twitter\u2019s decisions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, employees across the company have met privately on an unofficial basis to discuss how the company could apply its rules to Mr. Trump\u2019s postings, according to people familiar with the meetings. This past week\u2019s decisions were unexpected, one of the people said\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Mr. Dorsey] has repeatedly told employees that people should be aware of the unfiltered views of public figures, current and former executives have said\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has long said that maintaining a healthy public discourse on its platform is its priority. \u201cServing the public conversation includes providing the ability for anyone to talk about what matters to them,\u201d the company has said previously in a statement. \u201cThis can be especially important when engaging with government officials and political figures.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many users and even some internally have felt the company\u2019s enforcement of its rules has been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact-checking tool that Twitter unveiled in early May created a way for the company to flag the accounts of people in power without removing their content entirely. The company described the tool as a way to address conspiracy theories and other misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic, but internally, employees noted that it could be used more broadly, the employee familiar with the company\u2019s decisions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason:\u00a0Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden vs. Twitter vs. Facebook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nick Gillespie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and his allies, such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), aren\u2019t the only ones attacking Section 230. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has\u00a0pronounced\u00a0that \u201cSection 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked, number one. For Zuckerberg and other platforms\u2026.It should be revoked because it is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false.\u201d Biden is joined in such condemnations by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has consistently called\u00a0for ending existing Section 230 protections\u00a0and recently\u00a0railed against Facebook\u00a0as \u201ca hate-for-profit machine that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracy theorists-to talk about how social media platforms should essentially allow politicians to lie without consequences. This is eroding our democracy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s wrong about that: Creating a space where citizens and politicians can more easily exchange views, no matter how bilious or wrong, is\u00a0enacting\u00a0democracy, not eroding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Trump\u2019s executive order is essentially worthless as policy\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that the president and other politicians are constantly attacking freedom of expression. The Trumps and Bidens and Hawleys and Warrens of the world may come at the platforms from different angles and for ostensibly different reasons, but the threat is effectively the same:\u00a0Protect and promote the sort of speech I like or else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: Even Janus Is Bigger in Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By The Editorial Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Attorney General of Texas, Ken Paxton, plans to release an advisory opinion soon that could help free public employees who are fed up with their union. In 2018 in\u00a0Janus v. Afscme, the Supreme Court said that union fees couldn\u2019t be deducted from the paycheck of a government worker who didn\u2019t \u201caffirmatively consent.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is what flows from this logic. Last fall Alaska Governor Michael Dunleavy, citing\u00a0Janus,\u00a0signed an order\u00a0to let state workers quit the union anytime, instead of only during 10 enchanted days once each year. Union members also would have to refresh their consent forms periodically. Those changes are on hold pending a legal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Paxton\u2019s advisory opinion takes a similar tack. In Texas, it explains, public unions \u201cserve as a middleman\u201d by circulating and then submitting the dues authorizations for state workers: \u201cState agencies appear to have no independent method of confirming that an employee knowingly and voluntarily consented to the payroll deduction without any coercion or improper inducement.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One solution, the opinion says, would be for the state to take fee authorizations directly from each employee. Mr. Paxton evaluates some suggested waiver verbiage, under which a public worker would certify: \u201cI recognize that I have a First Amendment right to associate, including the right not to associate.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I am not compelled to pay a labor organization any money as a condition of employment, and I do not have to sign this consent form.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiley\u2019s Election Law News: Under Cover of Darkness and Crisis, Apparent Attempt to Revive Unconstitutional New York 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) Reporting Laws&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Carol A. Laham and Eric Wang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, a little-noticed and opaque provision was slipped at the last minute into New York State\u2019s recently passed massive omnibus budget bill. The legislation, which was signed into law at the beginning of April, may breathe new life into onerous and complex reporting requirements for certain Section 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) entities operating in the state. Late last year, a federal court had struck down broader requirements as being unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As\u00a0Election Law News\u00a0has previously reported, at issue are two reporting requirements that were first enacted in the wee hours of the morning in June 2016. First, Section 501(c)(4) entities that spend more than $10,000 in a calendar year on certain issue advocacy \u201ccovered communications\u201d were subject to new reporting requirements.

Federal Election Commission, the FEC blew past a court deadline to \u201cshow cause\u201d why it had not responded to CLC\u2019s complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The problem is, until recently,\u00a0the FEC was without a quorum of Commissioners due to Matthew Petersen\u2019s resignation in September of last year. At the time of Petersen\u2019s departure, the FEC had two slots vacant already, and the three remaining Commissioners are serving on expired terms. The three-person Commission was therefore powerless to direct its lawyers on how to defend itself against the CLC complaint. (It takes four affirmative votes for the bipartisan Commission to do anything substantive.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that CLC took advantage of the FEC\u2019s loss of quorum. CLC\u2019s administrative complaint was filed on September 12, 2019 \u2013 nearly a year after the underlying facts but just twelve days after Commissioner Petersen left. This tactic should not be encouraged: it is political gamesmanship and a weaponization of campaign finance laws\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read our full amicus brief here (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump Administration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Trump calls governors \u2018weak,\u2019 urges them to use force against unruly protests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Robert Costa, Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump on Monday berated the nation\u2019s governors during a conference call, describing them as \u201cweak\u201d in the face of growing racial unrest and urging them to take an aggressive stand against unruly protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump told governors that if they don\u2019t take back the streets and use force to confront protesters they would look like \u201cfools,\u201d alarming several governors on the call as they communicated privately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou have to dominate. If you don\u2019t dominate, you\u2019re wasting your time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to run over you. You\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump followed up on the forceful rhetoric to the governors in a Rose Garden announcement later Monday evening, warning that he will dispatch the U.S. military to end the unrest in cities across the country if mayors and governors don\u2019t escalate their law enforcement presence, including the National Guard\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump told the governors that \u201cyou have to use the military\u201d and \u201cwe have a wonderful military.\u201d He also mused about the Occupy Wall Street movement, calling it a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that was ended by governors and mayors being tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president said that people arrested at the protests should serve 10-year prison sentences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to arrest people, you have to try people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years, then you\u2019ll never see this stuff again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you have to let them know that.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: GOP deeply divided over Trump\u2019s social media crackdown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Easley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives are deeply divided\u00a0over President Trump\u2019s executive order directing the federal government to consider stripping some of the legal protections afforded to the social media platforms\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive order has split traditional ideological allies, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), two of the most conservative members of the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee described the order as a \u201cterrible precedent\u201d and a \u201cvery dangerous, slippery slope\u201d that is certain to be abused by future administrations seeking to regulate political speech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou keep government as far away from it as you possibly can,\u201d Lee said on Fox News Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Guy Benson Show.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cGovernments have force as their only real weapon. You don\u2019t want force deciding the art of persuasion or deciding the art of communication with social media,\u201d he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruz cheered the order, describing Big Tech as \u201cthe greatest threat facing our democracy\u201d and arguing that the social media platforms have been able to hide behind legal protections to \u201ctarget speech with which they disagree and advance their own political agendas.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic: Trump\u2019s Warped Definition of Free Speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Adam Serwer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment was explicitly written to protect the right of citizens to express opposition to their leaders; it says that Congress \u201cshall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d But to the president, criticism of his falsehoods is a violation of his free-speech rights. This position reverses the purpose of the First Amendment, turning an individual right of freedom of expression into the right of the state to silence its critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet-communications companies have a tremendous amount of power to shape public discourse, power\u00a0they have often wielded irresponsibly\u2026But the president\u2019s [Executive Order\u00a0is] little more than an attempt to use state authority to intimidate social media companies into amplifying his falsehoods\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s attempt to punish Twitter for labeling his tweet is a textbook free-speech issue, one that involves the core democratic right to criticize the government\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is hardly the first media company to face this kind of extortion from the president; as my colleague\u00a0David Graham points out, Trump has attempted to use the authority of his office to silence criticism from the\u00a0Washington Post, CNN, members of the White House press corps, and even ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the actual legal effect of the order remains unclear, its intent is not. Democracy is impossible if private citizens cannot publicly oppose their leaders. The ultimate goal of Trump\u2019s retaliation is to chill criticism of his actions and behavior, by sanctioning online platforms that engage in such criticism. Contrary to the president\u2019s claim, Twitter was not \u201cstifling free speech\u201d by criticizing the head of state. But in directing the federal government to punish Twitter\u00a0 and other social-media companies, Trump was engaging in a form of censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCOTUSblog: Justices will not review challenge to mandatory bar dues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Amy Howe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The [Supreme Court]\u00a0declined to review a challenge to the constitutionality of laws requiring lawyers who want to practice law in a state to join the state\u2019s bar association and pay dues. The lawsuit was filed by two Wisconsin lawyers who argue that compelling them to do so violates the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, in\u00a0Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, the Supreme Court ruled that government employees who are represented by a union but do not belong to that union cannot be required to pay a fee to cover the costs of contract negotiations. The decision in\u00a0Janus\u00a0overruled the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decision in\u00a0Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. In the wake of the\u00a0Janus\u00a0decision, Adam Jarchow and Michael Dean went to federal court in Wisconsin. Jarchow and Dean are licensed attorneys in Wisconsin but they disagree with the Wisconsin bar association\u2019s advocacy on issues like the death penalty, immigration law, the free exercise of religion and campaign finance, and they object to having to join the bar association and support it with their dues. They argued that\u00a0Janus\u00a0\u201cknocked the legs out from under\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s prior rulings upholding compulsory bar membership and dues. The lower courts turned them down, on the ground that only the Supreme Court can overturn its earlier cases; Jarchow and Dean then went to the Supreme Court last winter, asking the justices to take up their case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bozeman Daily Chronicle: U.S. Supreme Court won\u2019t hear challenge to Montana campaign finance law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Holly K. Michels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday\u00a0declined to take up a case\u00a0that challenged Montana\u2019s law on disclosing the spending for political ads within 60 days of an election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2019, the\u00a09th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Montana\u2019s law\u00a0that nonprofit groups running ads that mention candidates, political parties or ballot issues in the 60-day window before an election have to report any spending of $250 or more and say who funded their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s part of the state Disclose Act. At the federal level, those sorts of 501(c)4 nonprofits do not have to say where they get their money or how they spend it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in Montana was filed by the National Association of Gun Rights in 2016. In their lawsuit, the group said it planned to send mailers in Montana but would not report its donors or spending, saying it was a violation of their constitutional rights of free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas Lawyer: Bad News for Lawyers Suing Over Bar Dues: Court Rules in Favor of Texas Bar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Angela Morris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Texas attorneys have lost their claims that the State Bar of Texas violated their constitutional rights by allegedly using bar dues for political speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel of Austin ordered that plaintiffs\u2026take nothing from their lawsuit and also pay the costs for the Texas Bar, said the final judgment in\u00a0McDonald v. Sorrels\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald is one of\u00a0many\u00a0lawsuits filed nationally challenging mandatory bar membership in the wake of the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision\u00a0in\u00a0Janus v. AFSCME, which overturned decades of precedent by ruling that public-sector non-union workers cannot be required to pay union dues as a condition of employment\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In McDonald, the court explained its ruling in an\u00a0order on cross-motions for summary judgment. It explained that\u00a0the plaintiffs argued that Janus overruled two previous U.S. Supreme Court cases,\u00a0Lathrop v. Donohue\u00a0and\u00a0Keller v. State Bar of California, that were specific to bar associations and said mandatory dues were constitutional as long as the bar spent the money on improving legal services or regulating the profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Legal Intelligencer: Gambling Business Stakeholders Can Contribute to Political Campaigns, 3rd Circ. Rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0P.J. D\u2019Annunzio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that Pennsylvania\u2019s law restricting those with business interests in legalized gambling from contributing to political campaigns is unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In\u00a0Deon v. Barasch, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling that while Section 1513 of the Gaming Act is important for preventing quid pro quo politics, the act\u2019s restriction on political contributions was not \u201cclosely drawn.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was brought by\u00a0Pasquale Deon, the chairman of SEPTA\u2019s board who has a controlling interest in the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, and businesswoman Maggie Hardy Magerko, owner of the\u00a0Nemacolin Woodlands Resort, against state gaming officials and the Attorney General\u2019s Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They claimed that the act curtailed their First Amendment rights by limiting political speech. The district court agreed, granting summary judgment in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Trump Encounters New Legal Challenge for \u2018Wildly Broad\u2019 Nondisclosure Agreements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Byron Tau&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former staffer on Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign filed a new challenge against the president\u2019s use of nondisclosure agreements, asking a New York state court to rule in a lawsuit filed Monday that the agreements drawn up by the campaign are \u201cnull, void and unenforceable.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica Denson, who managed phone banks on the Trump campaign before rising to become director of Hispanic engagement, brought a class-action suit in New York state court on behalf of herself and other campaign staffers\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the complaint, Ms. Denson\u2019s attorneys argue that the campaign\u2019s nondisclosure agreement, which all staffers were required to sign, \u201cis wildly broad, prohibiting a vast array of speech about a candidate for the highest office and the current President of the United States-forever. And the campaign has repeatedly invoked its prohibitions in an effort to chill truthful political speech it dislikes.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Denson also previously filed a federal suit-without being represented by an attorney-seeking to be released from her NDA. The case was instead sent to arbitration, which she lost. The arbitration award was later vacated by a New York state court as invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USA Today: Our journalists are being attacked while doing their jobs. This is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Maribel Wadsworth, Nicole Carroll, and\u00a0Amalie Nash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JC Reindl, a reporter for the Detroit Free Press, was withdrawing from a confrontational protest area in his city Saturday night when police began chasing him and several demonstrators\u00a0with pepper spray. He lifted up his media badge but still got hit fully in the face.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police slapped\u00a0a phone from a hand of\u00a0a Free Press photographer\u00a0as she streamed the scene live on USA TODAY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And\u00a0police ran up to a black reporter from the Free Press and asked for\u00a0his press ID while ignoring his white colleagues. He was trying to produce the credential while blinded by tear gas in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free Press reporter David Jesse called it\u00a0\u201cone of the craziest nights of my career.\u00a0Got tear gassed multiple times. Police shot rubber bullets at us even though\u00a0we were moving where they wanted us to go, holding up our press passes and yelling \u2018media.'\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is\u00a0what happened at just one protest, in one city, over\u00a0the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others. But the actions \u2013 attacking journalists who clearly identified themselves as media, not interfering with police business \u2013\u00a0occurred all across the country at protests this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporters and photographers are there to record the truth, as peaceful or as violent as it may be. We are considered public servants in this role, not part of the protests but there to document it for the American people\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must be able to do our jobs safely.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Facebook Employees Stage Virtual Walkout to Protest Trump Posts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sheera Frenkel, Mike Isaac,\u00a0Cecilia Kang and Gabriel J.X. Dance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Facebook employees, in rare public criticism on Monday of their own company, protested executives\u2019 decision not to do anything about inflammatory posts that President Trump had placed on the giant social media platform over the past week\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg said Mr. Trump\u2019s posts did not violate the social network\u2019s rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cPersonally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to his Facebook page on Friday. \u201cBut I\u2019m responsible for reacting not just in my personal capacity but as the leader of an institution committed to free expression.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In private online chats, employees have called for the resignation of Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy. Mr. Kaplan is seen as being a strong conservative voice within the company. In 2018, he upset some employees when he sat in the front row of the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was a close friend\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, planned to host a call on Monday evening with civil rights leaders who have lashed out publicly against Facebook\u2019s protection of Mr. Trump\u2019s posts\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s really important for Mark Zuckerberg to contend with the fact that he is prioritizing free expression while our democracy is literally burning,\u201d said Ms. Gupta, who organized the call with the executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Verge: Twitter takes action against Rep. Matt Gaetz for glorifying violence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Makena Kelly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has restricted a tweet from Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) for violating its policies against glorifying violence, following a\u00a0similar action taken against President Donald Trump\u00a0last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a tweet published Monday, Gaetz wrote, \u201cNow that we clearly see Antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?\u201d The post was retweeted over 12,000 times before Twitter took action against it. Hours after it was posted, Twitter determined that it violated its policies against glorifying violence. In doing so, the tweet is hidden from Gaetz\u2019s profile and users must click a \u201cview\u201d button before seeing. Likes, retweets, and replies are all disabled from the tweet in an effort to limit its reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe have placed a public interest notice\u00a0on this Tweet from @mattgaetz. The Tweet is in violation of our glorification of violence policy,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson tells The Verge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other lawmakers, like Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) called for Twitter to take down the tweet. \u201cTake the Gaetz tweet down right now @twitter. RIGHT NOW. The survivors of mass shootings are lighting up my phone. They are scared to death this will inspire someone to start shooting into a crowd tonight. They are right,\u201d he said. Gaetz responded to a tweet calling him out \u201cfor inciting violence,\u201d by writing in a follow-up tweet, \u201cYou know what incites violence? Weakness.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New America:\u00a0Free Speech Project: Should We Think Twice Before Limiting Political Advocacy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webinar: June 2, 2020 at 4pm\u00a0ET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last year, Twitter imposed a total ban on political ads.\u00a0 Other social media companies have allowed such ads, but imposed a range of restrictions that extend beyond candidates running for election-ensnaring interest groups, non-profits, and others who want to advocate for a wide range of issues. Are platforms going too far in limiting speech or are they simply protecting against deceptive messaging and the outsized influence of well-heeled interest groups in the wake of Citizens United? \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring:&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Blumenthal&lt;br /&gt;Vice President of Technology and Innovation Policy, Stand Together&lt;br /&gt;Director of Technology and Innovation Policy, The Charles Koch Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Kreiss&lt;br /&gt;Associate Professor, University of North Carolina Hussman School of Journalism and Media&lt;br /&gt;Investigator, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Daskal&lt;br /&gt;Professor and Faculty Director, Tech, Law, &amp;Security; Program at American University Washington College of Law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSVP for the webinar here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballotpedia\u00a0News: In November, Alaskans will decide two ballot initiatives, one to establish top-four ranked-choice voting and one to increase taxes on North Slope oil fields&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ryan Byrne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign Alaskans for Better Elections is supporting a ballot initiative that would make changes to Alaska\u2019s election policies, including (a) requiring additional disclosures for campaign finance contributions, (b) replacing partisan primaries with open top-four primaries for state executive, state legislative, and congressional offices, and (c) establishing ranked-choice voting for general elections, in which voters would rank the four candidates that advanced from the primaries. Former Rep. Jason Grenn (I-22), who is chairperson of the campaign, described the ballot initiative as \u201ckind of a three-pronged attack on making our elections better.\u201d The campaign has received financial backing from the nonprofits Unite America, Action Now Initiative, and Represent.Us\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he Alaska ballot initiative faces a lawsuit that could stop them from appearing on the ballot or change their ballot language. Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer (R) and the Alaska Division of Elections (DOE), which oversee state ballot initiatives, argued that the elections-related ballot initiative addressed multiple issues and violated the state\u2019s single-subject rule. In October, Judge Yvonne Lamoureux ruled that the ballot initiative was designed with a single subject-election reform. Meyer and DOE appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 6/2 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-102557</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6024-2FJ1-JBJN-M0GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 2, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Circuit on Friday said the White House can\u2019t temporarily suspend the\u00a0press pass of Playboy correspondent Brian Karem over an altercation with former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka in the Rose Garden last July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an\u00a0unanimous opinion\u00a0authored by Judge David Tatel, the court found the temporary suspension of the hard pass violated Karem\u2019s due process rights, as the White House had not set specific standards on when media access could be revoked. The opinion, joined by Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan and Judge Cornelia Pillard, upheld a preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson that blocked the suspension.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN: Senate panel approves legislation requiring campaigns to report foreign election help&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate Intelligence Committee quietly approved on Wednesday a measure that would require presidential campaigns to report offers of foreign election influence to federal authorities, a move taken in response to Russian election interference in 2016 and one that could draw the attention of President Donald Trump, committee sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Republicans, however, are preparing to remove the provision from the bill when it heads to the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Election\u00a0Commission: James E.

From Itself.\u201d To Rosenbaum, a law professor and public intellectual, hatemongers have twisted a constitutional right formulated to enlighten our political dialogue into a weapon of oppression. \u201cWe have repeatedly confused and conflated hostile acts with free speech,\u201d Rosenbaum contends, and \u201chave allowed the First Amendment to provide cover for those who do violence and disguise it as political expression.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Rosenbaum] calls for narrowly tailored restrictions on those intending \u201cto cause harm \u2013 either by threatening and intimidating certain targeted audiences . . . or when speech is being deployed in order to deprive vulnerable groups of their dignity, self-respect, and social status.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Rosenbaum also recommends creating] a private cause of action for the emotional damage caused by hate speech\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenbaum [says], \u201cAny criticism of the First Amendment is instantly regarded as seditious in our political culture.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, suffragists, civil rights activists, antiwar protesters and LGBT advocates were censored not just by sexists, racists and bigots but also by well-meaning detractors who bristled at their tactics or found their revolutionary ideas offensive, threatening or unpatriotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps nothing exemplified this dynamic more than McCarthyism\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a stout defender of free speech, Frederick Douglass confronted the same quandary\u2026 \u201cNo right was deemed by the fathers of the government more sacred than the right of speech,\u201d Douglass uttered days after a mob shut down an abolitionist meeting in Boston out of fear that the assembly would offend the Southern states then contemplating secession.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: James Bennet resigns as editorial page editor of the New York Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Erik Wemple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a lumbering colossus that processed copy and internal change at its own cerebral pace, the New York Times on Sunday brandished its Internet-era agility: Editorial Page Editor James Bennet, the newspaper\u00a0announced, had resigned his post following the controversial publication of an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0by Sen. Tom Cotton (R- Ark.) regarding the federal response to recent protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of four days, the paper published a controversial opinion piece; beheld a furious backlash; defended it; defended it some more; bailed on it; held a staff meeting about it; and took a high-level personnel action on a\u2026Sunday\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resignation caps off a whirlwind of turmoil at the Times, much of it visible on the churning commentary on Twitter. After Cotton advocated the deployment of U.S. troops \u2013 \u201cThe nation must restore order. The military stands ready,\u201d\u00a0reads\u00a0the op-ed\u2019s subtitle \u2013 Times staffers and others said the piece put African Americans in danger. Bennet on Wednesday wrote a\u00a0Twitter defense\u00a0of the op-ed, claiming that it advanced debate and that the role of the section was to host competing views. The next morning, Sulzberger wrote a staff memo that mustered pretty much the same defense\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Friday morning, both men had folded. In a video staff meeting, Sulzberger said that the piece never should have been published. Bennet, too, had stopped defending it. The discussion moved to corrective measures, with Sulzberger stressing the need to revamp procedures and the role of the op-ed at the Times.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper appended an editor\u2019s note to\u00a0Cotton\u2019s op-ed indicating that it fell short of Times standards and shouldn\u2019t have been published.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tweets from Bari Weiss (via Thread Reader app)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young) wokes the (mostly 40+) liberals is the same one raging inside other publications and companies across the country. The dynamic is always the same. (Thread.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Old Guard lives by a set of principles we can broadly call civil libertarianism. They assumed they shared that worldview with the young people they hired who called themselves liberals and progressives. But it was an incorrect assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Guard has a different worldview, one articulated best by\u00a0@JonHaidt\u00a0and\u00a0@glukianoff. They call it \u201csafetyism,\u201d in which the right of people to feel emotionally and psychologically safe trumps what were previously considered core liberal values, like free speech\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s one way to think about what\u2019s at stake: The New York Times motto is \u201call the news that\u2019s fit to print.\u201d One group emphasizes the word \u201call.\u201d The other, the word \u201cfit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Inside the Revolts Erupting in America\u2019s Big Newsrooms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Ben Smith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[America\u2019s] biggest newsrooms are trying to find common ground between a tradition that aims to persuade the widest possible audience that its reporting is neutral and journalists who believe that fairness on issues from race to Donald Trump requires clear moral calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflict exploded in recent days into public protests at The New York Times, ending in the resignation of its top Opinion editor on Sunday;\u00a0The Philadelphia Inquirer, whose executive editor\u00a0resigned on Saturday\u00a0over the headline \u201cBuildings Matter, Too\u201d and the ensuing anger from his staff; and\u00a0The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. And it has been the subject of quiet agony at The Washington Post, which [journalist\u00a0Wesley]\u00a0Lowery left earlier this year, months after the executive editor, Martin Baron, threatened to fire him for expressing his views on Twitter about race, journalism and other subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lowery\u2019s view that news organizations\u2019 \u201ccore value needs to be the truth, not the perception of objectivity,\u201d as he told me,\u00a0has been winning in a series of battles, many around how to cover race. Heated Twitter criticism helped to retire euphemisms like \u201cracially charged.\u201d The big outlets have gradually, awkwardly, given ground, using \u201cracist\u201d and \u201clie\u201d more freely, especially when describing Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he shift in mainstream American media \u2013\u00a0driven by a journalism that is more personal, and reporters more willing to speak what they see as the truth without worrying about alienating conservatives \u2013\u00a0now feels irreversible.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: What\u2019s a journalist supposed to be now \u2013 an activist? A stenographer? You\u2019re asking the wrong question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Margaret Sullivan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every piece of reporting \u2013 written or spoken, told in text or in images \u2013 is the product of choices\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\u00a0choose\u00a0what to focus on, what to amplify, what to investigate and examine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why the simplistic \u201cjust the unadorned facts\u201d can be such a canard. And that\u2019s why the notion to \u201crepresent all points of view equally\u201d is absurd and sometimes wrongheaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cJournalism is not stenography\u201d is a refrain from an astute editor I know\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s take the New York Times example. Plenty of well-respected media people are saying that the much-discussed opinion piece by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) absolutely should have been published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe need to hear all points of view,\u00a0especially\u00a0those we disagree with,\u201d is their reasoning. And some even argue that those who object to the piece on the grounds that it is incendiary and factually flawed are a mob of coddled activists masquerading as objective journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That argument can be dismantled in a nanosecond. Should the denialist views of, say, Alex Jones of Infowars on the Sandy Hook massacre be given a prestigious platform, too? But Cotton is a prominent political figure, you say? By that logic, the lies of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway should be welcomed on news-discussion shows daily because she\u2019s close to the president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a more useful way to think about many of these tough issues is to consider the role of journalism in democratic society: to dig out and present the information that helps citizens hold their elected officials accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: A Minor IRS Miracle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By The Editorial Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal agencies don\u2019t typically give up discretionary power, so it\u2019s worth applauding the Internal Revenue Service, believe it or not. Late last week it published a final rule that relieves most 501(c) nonprofits of a requirement to report the names and addresses of major donors. The IRS \u201cdoes not need\u201d the information \u201cto administer the internal revenue laws,\u201d said the Treasury Department, and it changed the rule \u201cin light of the risks and burden.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal law requires 501(c)(3) charities to report information on donations of more than $5,000 on their 990 tax forms. In the 1970s the IRS wrote a rule adding the demand for other 501(c)s-including chambers of commerce and social welfare groups that can engage in limited political activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schedule B forms are supposed to be confidential, but \u201cthe IRS has experienced incidents of inadvertent disclosure,\u201d Treasury says in its guidance document. In 2014 the IRS settled a lawsuit alleging that the agency leaked donor data from the conservative National Organization for Marriage. The IRS said the leak was inadvertent but the data somehow ended up in the hands of opponents at the Human Rights Campaign\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rule will reduce administrative costs for nonprofits. But the biggest gain is for free political speech, as donors to causes on the left and right have less chance of being harassed. No one paid a price for the IRS abuses of the Obama years, but this is at least one small result for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: The Complex Debate Over Silicon Valley\u2019s Embrace of Content Moderation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nellie Bowles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existential question that every big tech platform from Twitter to Google to Facebook has to wrestle with is the same: How responsible should it act for the content that people post?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer that Silicon Valley has come up with for decades is: Less is more. But now, as protests of police brutality continue across the country, many in the tech industry are questioning the wisdom of letting all flowers bloom online\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this notable shift, some civil libertarians are raising a question in an already complicated debate: Any move to moderate content more proactively could eventually be used against speech loved by the people now calling for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt comes from this drive to be protected \u2013 this belief that it\u2019s a platform\u2019s role to protect us from that which may harm or offend us,\u201d said Suzanne Nossel, the head of PEN America, a free-speech advocacy organization. \u201cAnd if that means granting them greater authority, then that\u2019s worth it if that means protecting people,\u201d she added\u2026 \u201cBut people are losing sight of the risk.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Civil libertarians caution that adding warning labels or additional context to posts raises a range of issues \u2013 issues that tech companies until recently had wanted to avoid. New rules often backfire. Fact checks and context, no matter how sober or accurate they are, can be perceived as politically biased. More proactive moderation by the platforms could threaten their special protected legal status. And intervention goes against the apolitical self-image that some in the tech world have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: Facebook, Twitter and Google Write Their Own Rules for Political Ads-and What You See&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Patience Haggin and Emily Glazer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political campaigns and advocacy groups will funnel billions of dollars into digital advertising during the 2020 election season. With virtually no federal guidelines regulating these ads, the major online platforms are drawing up their own rules for what political advertisers can and cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platforms\u2019 decisions to moderate content have sparked widespread debate, as with Twitter Inc.\u2019s decision in May to flag tweets posted by President Trump that violated its rules and Facebook Inc.\u2019s decision to allow similar posts to appear without moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, Alphabet Inc.-owned Google and Twitter updated their ad policies in 2019, setting rules for what counts as a political ad, who is allowed to buy them and what they can say. All three platforms use a combination of automated and human review to enforce their policies. The following uses real ads as examples to explain how the three platforms diverge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Facebook to Review Content Policies Related to Civil Unrest, Violence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kimberly Chin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Friday that the company will review existing policies on how it handles content related to civil unrest or violence, as the company faces criticism over its decision to not moderate or take down some posts\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s memo to employees-which was also\u00a0posted publicly\u00a0on Facebook-comes after the company\u2019s employees staged a virtual walkout Monday over the CEO\u2019s decision to leave up a post from President Trump about the recent social unrest. Critics say the president\u2019s post violated Facebook\u2019s rules about inciting violence\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook will review potential options for dealing with violations or partial violations of its content policy \u201caside from the binary leave-it-up or take-it-down decisions,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tweets from Randy Barnett (via Thread Reader app)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Replying to this\u00a0tweet from John Daniel Davidson:]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fully appreciate these costs, but am unsure the country would be better off\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter has given me a voice as a public intellectual, in ways that are difficult to imagine without something like it. I can speak to hundreds, perhaps many thousands, at low cost. It also allows me to have serious discussions of constitutional &amp;legal; issues with other experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to interacting with nonexperts, I now can interact (for the better) with other academics and public intellectuals far better and on a more personal level than would ever before have been possible. I don\u2019t just pontificate, I learn a lot from these interactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And these are all in addition to having a personally-curated news feed from which, should I care to, I can learn what\u2019s happening far faster than by any other news medium. And by following many with whom I disagree, I also instantly get the other side of every issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This column ignores or discounts ALL these personal and social benefits enjoyed by me and millions of others\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having said this, I think the power enjoyed by Twitter and Facebook to stifle political views with which their faceless employees disagree is the type of \u201cprivate power\u201d that progressives would inveigh against if it was happening to them to the same degree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precisely because of the benefits it provides, if my Twitter platform disappeared tomorrow, it would impose a major cost on me. I would feel that loss, and be quite distressed it if was the result of arbitrary acts by anonymous ideological bigots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, addressing this by eliminating or restricting Section 230 protection would be more understandable if I had any confidence at all in our civil justice system not to prevent abusive lawsuits that themselves will stifle free expression. I just don\u2019t trust that system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City &amp;State;: Is police money the new real estate money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Rebecca C. Lewis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people, organizations and causes whose campaign donations are politically toxic to Democrats in New York \u2013 and the list keeps growing. Donations from police unions is the newest addition to that list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneaopolis police officer, protests erupted across the nation and across the state\u2026 [T]he\u00a0 protests have also called attention to politicians who have accepted campaign donations from police groups, such as police union political action committees, and some on the left have begun pressuring lawmakers to return the money and pledge to accept no more. So far, at least 12 state legislators have publicly donated some or all of those contributions to causes like bail funds and mutual aid groups\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although criminal justice reform is on the agenda for many Democratic legislators, most still accept money police groups that generally oppose those changes. After all, they are the party of organized labor, and law enforcement unions are unions. About 50 Democratic state legislators have accepted donations from police, corrections or court officer unions\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the recent protests once again placing police brutality on the front page, police money has become controversial in the way that donations from powerful business interests have long been on the left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CalMatters: Proposal to prohibit police unions from funding district attorney campaigns doesn\u2019t go far enough&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Joel Fox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One response to the protests over police treatment of black communities is a proposal by some current and former California district attorneys to prohibit candidates running for prosecutor positions from receiving police unions\u2019 donations and endorsements.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u2026backed the idea arguing, \u201cThese unions\u2019 power to raise and dispense large amounts of campaign cash has warped the electoral process.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If such a move is seriously considered, then the proposal doesn\u2019t go far enough. The same principle of unions unduly influencing authorities that oversee their work applies to other relationships between public unions and government officials. If police unions should not give to District Attorney candidates, then teachers unions should not endorse and donate to school board candidates; prison guard unions should not give to state legislators; other public sector unions should not campaign for mayors and city council members who set their salaries and working conditions\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if this idea of banning endorsements and contributions from police unions (or any public union) is moved forward \u2013 there are major obstacles ahead.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denying the unions their First Amendment rights of free speech is certainly threatened. In addition, ironically, for unions who complained about the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0case, usually reported as allowing corporations the right to speak with their dollars, unions would get the same protection. Under\u00a0Citizens United, unions can take member dues and spend the money on materials in support or in opposition to a candidate for office. As Justice Antonin Scalia noted at the time of the decision, \u201cWhat individuals have the liberty to do alone, they have a liberty to do together.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercury News:\u00a0Finding compromise on San Jose\u2019s Fair Election Initiative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Garrick Percival and Mary Currin-Percival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the Fair Elections Initiative (FEI), a San Jose ballot measure that restricts certain lobbyists\u2019 campaign contributions and proposes to move mayoral elections to presidential years, recently received a major legal victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Superior Court judge has called for a full recount of the nearly 100,000 signatures collected to qualify the initiative for the 2020 ballot after the Santa Clara County Registrar\u2019s office erroneously disqualified valid signatures. The recount is expected to cost the city $1 million\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question now is what\u2019s the best way forward? Labor leaders who bankrolled the initiative are asking the City Council to place the FEI on the ballot. Given Mayor Sam Liccardo\u2019s business-friendly coalition on the council, this is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we believe there is a way forward that preserves major parts of the FEI, avoids a costly recount, and (perhaps) lowers political tensions. The City Council would agree to place a charter amendment on the ballot that proposes to move San Jose\u2019s mayoral elections to presidential years beginning in the 2024, just as the FEI calls for. In exchange, supporters of the FEI would agree to drop the measure\u2019s campaign finance restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This compromise would offer something to all sides\u2026 As it stands now, developer-backed interest groups will undoubtedly file lawsuits challenging the legality of the measure\u2019s campaign finance restrictions. Even if FEI supporters prevailed in court, delays caused by legal wrangling would be harmful.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 6/8 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

And most nonprofit groups prohibit disclosing donor details. But elected officials in recent years have worked to erode that privacy under the guise of exposing the influence of \u201cdark money\u201d on causes or elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma, Utah, and West Virginia have passed laws in 2020 to protect donor information, and Louisiana and Tennessee are considering similar bills\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Citizens United v. Schneiderman, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a challenge to a New York law requiring groups to disclose their donors to the state annually. A conservative advocacy group that produced Hillary: The Movie and other media groups claimed the state had a vendetta against it. The appeals court said the concern did not measure up to the \u201cclear and present danger\u201d that faced NAACP donors in the 1950s. The 9th Circuit rejected similar challenges to California\u2019s disclosure law in Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Becerra and Institute for Free Speech v. Becerra. </p><p>The court found that the state had a sufficient interest in keeping nonprofit groups \u201chonest.\u201d Plaintiffs in those cases have appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump Administration\u00a0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: Trump Criticizes 75-Year-Old Buffalo Protester Injured After Shove by Police&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Catherine Lucey and Jimmy Vielkind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump criticized a 75-year-old protester who was captured on video bleeding from his ear after police officers in Buffalo, N.Y., shoved him to the ground, suggesting without providing evidence that the activist could instead be an \u201cANTIFA provocateur.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump tweeted\u00a0Tuesday that Martin Gugino \u201cwas pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN\u00a0I watched, he fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Zarcone, an attorney for Mr. Gugino, said he had been moved out of the intensive care unit but is still hospitalized and needs to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cMartin has always been a PEACEFUL protestor because he cares about today\u2019s society,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cNo one from law enforcement has even suggested anything otherwise so we are at a loss to understand why the President of the United States would make such untrue accusations against him.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Law Journal: DC Circuit Says Postal Service Can\u2019t Ban Custom Stamps for Political Views&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jacqueline Thomsen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday struck down the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s ban on political content featured on custom stamps as unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anatol Zukerman in 2015 submitted a piece of art to a vendor in the postal service\u2019s custom stamps program. The art depicts Uncle Sam with a snake labeled \u201cCitizens United,\u201d in reference to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing corporations and unions to make political donations, and the caption \u201cDemocracy Is Not For Sale.\u201d The vendor rejected the design due to its political design, under the USPS custom stamp program\u2019s policy against \u201cpolitical\u201d content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Zukerman and a Washington, D.C., art gallery he collaborates with alleged he found many stamps created through the program that featured political content, such as stamps for candidates such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump, and sued over the policy\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of Judges Merrick Garland, Neomi Rao and Senior Judge Harry Edwards unanimously\u00a0ruled\u00a0to reverse U.S. District Judge Christopher \u201cCasey\u201d Cooper\u2019s dismissal of the claims. Edwards wrote in the panel opinion that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in\u00a0Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky\u00a0requires the postal service to create standards on what political content is and is not allowed, which USPS policy failed to do\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel did not issue a broad ruling on the merits of Zukerman\u2019s claim that the policy constitutes viewpoint discrimination, remanding it to the district court to further develop the record. However, Edwards wrote \u201cthese allegations pass the \u2018most basic \u2026 test for viewpoint discrimination,\u2019 which is \u2018whether-within the relevant subject category-the government has singled out a subset of messages for disfavor based on the views expressed.'\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courthouse\u00a0News: Treatment of the Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal court in Minnesota\u00a0denied\u00a0injunctive relief to journalists challenging the treatment by law enforcement of members of the media reporting on events in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge, noting that several members of the press sustained severe injuries and were allegedly threatened or subject to unlawful arrests, says they \u201cdeserve better.\u201d But police have not used tear gas or rubber bullets since May 31 and injunctive release is not necessary at this time.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Review: GOP Senators Ask FCC to \u2018Clearly Define\u2019 Section 230 Protections for Big Tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tobias Hoonhout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four Senate Republicans sent a letter\u00a0to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) on Tuesday asking for the agency to act on President Trump\u2019s executive order regarding tech censorship by \u201cclearly\u201d defining Section 230 liability protections for social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senators Marco Rubio (R., Fl.), Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.), Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.), and Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) asked FCC chairman Ajit Pai to address \u201ca lack of clear rules\u201d and the \u201cjudicial expansion\u201d of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects platforms from civil liability in instances when third-party posts contain false or misleading information\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans argue that the law has been abused in regard to political speech, where social media companies \u201cblur the lines between distributor and publisher by favoring one political point of view over another.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kentucky Today: Politicians can\u2019t pick and choose from First Amendment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sen. Mitch McConnell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is becoming clear to many Americans, including many who appreciate and applaud the recent protests, that our national life during this pandemic has slid toward a double standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weeks, state and local leaders put normal American life totally on ice and asked citizens to prioritize fighting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weeks, the mainstream media heaped scorn on any small citizen protest, outdoor gathering, or even the suggestion that other important values might require a reappraisal of certain restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American people did their part. They made necessary sacrifices that clearly helped the country and they\u2019re ready to continue doing their part as our re-opening carefully proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, many Americans feel they\u2019ve just seen those fastidious regulations and that puritanical zeal disappear in an instant because a new cause has emerged that powerful people agree with\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no criticism for the millions of Americans who have peacefully demonstrated in recent days. Their cause is beyond righteous. It is the inconsistency from leaders that has been baffling\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians are now picking and choosing within the First Amendment itself\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These governments are acting like the coronavirus discriminates based on the content of people\u2019s speech. But alas, it\u2019s only the leaders themselves who are doing that\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians do not get to play red-light, green-light within the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bill of Rights is not some a-la-carte menu that leaders may sample as they please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time: Civil Rights Groups Urge U.N. Human Rights Council to \u2018Urgently\u2019 Meet on U.S. Police Violence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jamey Keaten, Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union says relatives of George Floyd and three other black people who were killed by police have joined some 600 rights groups to demand the top U.N. human rights body \u201curgently\u201d convene a special session to look into a rise of police violence and repression of protests in the United States\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groups want an independent investigation into the recent killings of unarmed black people in the United States, as well as one into \u201cviolent law enforcement responses to protests.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s time the United States face the same scrutiny and judgment it is quick to pass on to other countries,\u201d said Jamil Dakwar, who heads the ACLU\u2019s human rights program.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post:\u00a0Badge-less police officers are showing up at protests. It\u2019s dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Garrett M. Graff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scores of armed, helmeted men in blue and olive drab shirts took up positions around the nation\u2019s capital last week, many without uniforms, badges or formal markings. They seemed to be police \u2013 but were they really? \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of generational unrest, it is not unreasonable to ask: Are these officers the vanguard of a new U.S. secret police, another step down the path toward authoritarianism? After all, what are secret police other than anonymous agents of the state charged with intimidating and silencing dissident citizens? \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This development is dangerous \u2013 for public safety, for free speech and for democracy. \u201cThe No-Badge practices seem designed to instill fear and to intimidate people from exercising rights protected by the First Amendment,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of Columbia University\u2019s Knight First Amendment Institute, which sent a letter of objection to Attorney General William P. Barr. \u201cThey also conceal information that the public has a right to know. There is no legitimate justification for these practices, and they should have no place in any free society\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]here is a dramatic difference between undercover operations targeting illegal activities of a specific kind and anonymous federal forces ringing the White House and providing \u201csecurity\u201d at constitutionally protected gatherings. In a democracy, after all, it\u2019s the police who are meant to answer to the protesters \u2013 not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gothamist: \u201cThat Happens in Fascist Countries\u201d: The NYPD Is Interrogating Protesters About Their Political Sympathies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nick Pinto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York City Police Department may be violating a 35-year-old agreement meant to keep the police from investigating individual\u2019s protected political speech, according to the lawyers who negotiated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter sent to the police department\u2019s legal counsel Monday, the lawyers raise concerns\u2026that the NYPD\u2019s Intelligence Division, along with the FBI, have been questioning protesters arrested on curfew violations about their political sympathies and affiliations, along with their social media behavior\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In raising these questions, the NYPD wades into one of the thorniest and most long-standing problems in its lengthy history: its recurrent tendency to police political dissidents. In the early years of the 20th Century, the NYPD maintained a unit that went after communists, anarchists, and Italians. In subsequent decades, the unit evolved into the \u201cRadical Bureau,\u201d which kept tabs on communist New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the 1960s, the unit was called the \u201cBureau of Special Services,\u201d and it was spying on nearly every political organization New Yorkers could come up with. As that surveillance and interference came to light, it gave rise to a lawsuit named after one of the plaintiffs, Barbara Handschu. After more than a decade, in 1985 the lawsuit produced a consent decree in which the police committed not to investigate people\u2019s political, ideological or religious behavior unless they have good cause to think that person is committing a crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ProPublica: The Police Have Been Spying on Black Reporters and Activists for Years. I Know Because I\u2019m One of Them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Wendi C. Thomas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 20, 2018, the first day of a federal police surveillance trial, I discovered that the Memphis Police Department was spying on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACLU of Tennessee had sued the MPD, alleging that the department was in violation of a 1978 consent decree barring surveillance of residents for political purposes\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s been more than a year since a judge\u00a0ruled against\u00a0the city, and I\u2019ve never gotten a clear answer on why the MPD was monitoring me. Law enforcement also was keeping tabs on three other journalists\u00a0whose names came out\u00a0during the trial. [Officer]\u00a0Reynolds testified he used [a] fake [social media]\u00a0account to monitor protest activity and follow current events connected to Black Lives Matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sin, as best I can figure, was having good sources who were local organizers and activists, including some of the original plaintiffs in the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit against the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: An Arrest Warrant from Liberty University, For Me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Julia Rendleman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person on the phone was calling to warn me: The police for Liberty University, the private evangelical college in southern Virginia, had gone to the authorities and had a warrant for my arrest for trespassing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a freelance photographer for The New York Times, and I had recently taken pictures for an article about the decision by Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, to keep the school partially open during the growing Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberty asserted that they had recently changed policies and only staff, students and those conducting \u201cUniversity business\u201d were permitted on campus\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A week after completing the assignment],\u00a0the news of the warrant for my arrest appeared on Twitter\u2026 I received more hateful emails than I ever had in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One read: \u201cYou media scum are indeed the \u2018enemy of the people\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s about time some Justice was served against your non stop continual attacks against Conservatives. You feel you can act with impunity while hiding behind the 1st Amendment.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times hired a local attorney to represent me\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, my attorney called. The prosecutor had agreed to dismiss the case. I didn\u2019t think about Mr. Falwell too much, though. I felt he was just using me for what I represented. It wasn\u2019t personal.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: The New York Times\u2019s self-inflicted fiasco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kathleen Parker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the New York Times\u00a0leadership recently apologized to the paper\u2019s staff for running an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), the enemies of \u201cfake news\u201d high-fived, and free speech collapsed from embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heaven forbid an opinion on a newspaper\u2019s op-ed page should offend someone. It\u2019s one thing to disagree on the merits of an opinion; it\u2019s quite another to have published an opinion column, then criticized the column and then made a senior personnel decision in part because the column was published in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times\u2019s editorial page editor, James Bennet, once a potential executive editor candidate, resigned over what should have been a blip on the continuum of lessons learned. This unnecessary spectacle isn\u2019t only disappointing but also portends the gradual shrinking of the free marketplace of ideas\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cotton\u2019s essential argument was that an \u201coverwhelming show of force\u201d was needed as the protests unfolded and that President Trump should invoke\u2026the Insurrection Act to \u201crestore order to our streets.\u201d Bad idea, Tom. See how easy that was? I for one am glad to know what\u2019s inside Cotton\u2019s cerebral cavity\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons and ways to disagree with Cotton\u2019s ideas and the way he presented them without censorship as prequel or apology as sequel\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t take much courage to join a gang and cancel an opinion \u2013 or ruin a career. It does take great courage, on the other hand, to stand alone against a tide of pitchfork-wielding Twitter tyrants and defend a free exchange of ideas, even if some of them are bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techdirt: No, The Resignation Of NYT Editor James Bennet Does Not Mean American Newsrooms Have \u2018Turned Into College Campuses\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Mike Masnick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday we wrote about the uproar regarding the terrible op-ed piece by Senator Tom Cotton in the New York Times, calling for the use of the US military against protesters in the US. There was widespread anger against the decision to run the op-ed, and then a backlash from some who argued that this showed the people complaining about it were somehow \u201cunwilling to listen\u201d to viewpoints they disagreed with. In my piece, I argued that if the NY Times didn\u2019t publish my op-ed on why the Opinions Editor James Bennet was an incompetent dweeb,\u00a0then clearly, they hated free speech\u00a0and were unwilling to confront difficult ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, the news came down that\u00a0Bennet had resigned, leading to a new round of hand-wringing from people who want to appear to be among the Serious Thinkers&lt;img src=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\">https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png</url>\" alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /&gt;, fretting that American newsrooms were \u201cbecoming college campuses\u201d full of \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[W]hile some people were freaking out about so-called \u201ccensorship,\u201d the issue was actually about\u00a0editorial discretion\u00a0\u2014 which is something wholly different. When you consider every act of editorial discretion to be the same as censorship, then the real problem is on your end. You can\u00a0disagree\u00a0with the decision (in either direction) and speak out about it (because there are many ways to speak out these days). But a single platform choosing to publish a terrible, disingenuous op-ed whose entire point appeared to be to piss people off, and then the person in charge resigning following the controversy, has nothing at all to do with censorship or safe spaces or avoiding difficult conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Post: GOP candidate: Facebook is \u2018defending terrorists\u2019 by censoring Antifa warning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Joshua Rhett Miller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GOP congressional candidate in Georgia said Facebook is \u201cdefending terrorists\u201d by removing a campaign video of her holding an AR-15 rifle as she warns Antifa to stay out of her state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marjorie Taylor Greene, a businesswoman vying in Tuesday\u2019s primary to succeed US Rep. Tom Graves in Georgia\u2019s 14th Congressional District, posted the spot on Facebook on June 2, telling the far-left militant group to \u201cstay the hell out of northwestern Georgia\u201d while on the porch of a local business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, the platform removed the video, saying it violated company policies against promoting the use of firearms,\u00a0Fox News reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it time after time again, where conservative Americans put their thoughts, their feelings and their expressions and their beliefs on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, but yet our posts get deleted and we get censored,\u201d Greene\u00a0told Fox News Monday\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to Fox News, Facebook defended removing the campaign spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe removed this ad, which advocates the use of deadly weapons against a clearly defined group of people, for violating our policies against inciting violence,\u201d the tech giant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene countered Facebook\u2019s response by accusing the company of siding with \u201cterrorists\u201d while denying that she was inciting violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techdirt: Trump Campaign Gets Parody Cartoon Taken Down Off Redbubble Over Trademark Claim On MAGA Hats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Timothy Geigner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever your politics, it simply can\u2019t be denied that on First Amendment grounds, our current president and his organizations have an abysmal reputation on matters of free speech, so long as that speech could potentially pierce the notoriously thin skin of Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This continues to today, of course. You can see it when there are executive orders issued just because social media companies point the public to facts about the President\u2019s claim. You can also see it more recently in the Trump campaign issuing a takedown with Redbubble\u00a0for a parody cartoon over the trademark on MAGA hats\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, \u201cabsurd\u201d doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it. All kinds of speech are protected by the First Amendment, whatever the trademark rights any holder might have. Political speech is probably more revered in that regard than any other speech. The very idea that an artist couldn\u2019t create parody art that comments on a particular public figure and/or his or her voting block is so completely the antithesis of American history that one should really just have to yell something like, \u201cThe Federalist Papers!\u201d at this sort of thing and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This country was built on political parody. And, frankly, cartoon parody in particular. The Trump campaign does, or at least should, know this. Redbubble does too, which explains the fairly very good mea culpa that it issued when the site reinstated the cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 6/10 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

These individuals do not support the cause of the protesters, but exploit the moment to commit acts of wanton destruction. Those few who smash up and loot high-end storefronts should not detract from the message of tens of thousands of peaceful protesters. So why should someone hurt by a lawbreaker be able to sue the person who organized the protest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most parts of the country, they could not. </p><p>But the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\u2026allowed such a lawsuit to proceed in December 2019. A policeman injured by an unknown attacker at a Black Lives Matter protest in July 2016 in Louisiana sued the protest\u2019s organizer, DeRay Mckesson, for damages. Mckesson did not attack the officer or urge anyone to commit violence. He simply led the protest at which the attack happened\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If protest organizers can be dragged into court whenever an injury occurs in an otherwise peaceful assembly, only those backed by big groups or the wealthy would feel secure exercising their rights. This would chill protest activity for grassroots causes across the political spectrum\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The Institute for Free Speech, for which the authors work, has filed an\u00a0amicus brief\u00a0in support of this case being heard by the Court.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dispatch:\u00a0A Victory for Free Speech at the IRS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ryan Morrison&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the IRS has not been a guardian of our free speech rights. It has a long and troubling history of political abuses and targeting unpopular viewpoints, which includes the 2013\u00a0targeting of conservative and Tea Party groups. But a new tax rule indicates the IRS may have a newfound respect for Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS recently amended its nonprofit donor reporting rules to protect the identities of contributors. From now on, nonprofits (except for 501(c)(3) charities and 527 political groups) are not required to disclose their largest donors on annual tax returns. The organizations must still maintain this information for a potential audit, but the IRS will stop routinely collecting these names.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compelled disclosure of donors to nonprofit groups offends the First Amendment. As the Supreme Court acknowledged in\u00a0Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 64 (1976) (per curiam), compelled disclosure, in and of itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief. After all, an individual\u2019s freedom to speak, to worship, and to petition the government for the redress of grievances cannot be vigorously protected from state interference unless the freedom to engage in a group effort to promote these interests is also guaranteed\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rule values Americans\u2019 right to freedom of speech and associational privacy. It relieves the IRS of an unnecessary burden without compromising the agency\u2019s tax enforcement mission. And it does not interfere, in any way, with campaign finance law enforcement or election security efforts of other government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MinistryWatch: States Considering Non-Profit Disclosure Rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Anne Stych&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several states have passed or are considering laws that\u00a0further strengthen\u00a0privacy protections for nonprofit donors\u00a0after\u00a0guidance released by the Internal Revenue Service\u00a0and Treasury Department in late May\u00a0altered reporting regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new rules, certain tax-exempt groups no longer need to include the names and addresses of their major donors to the IRS each year under section 6033\u00a0of the Internal Revenue Code\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative groups and Republican politicians supported the change, arguing that it protects\u00a0the\u00a0First Amendment rights\u00a0of donors who want to keep their philanthropic activities private to avoid political backlash or because their religious beliefs promote altruistic giving\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 22, Oklahoma passed the\u00a0Personal Privacy Protection Act\u00a0prohibiting public agencies from disclosing certain personal affiliation information. West Virginia\u2019s\u00a0Protect Our Right to Unite Act, approved in April, protects an individual\u2019s constitutional right to privately associate with advocacy groups that represent his or her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah\u2019s\u00a0Nonprofit Entities Amendments, signed into law in March,\u00a0prohibits a public entity, with certain exceptions, from disclosing information that identifies a person as affiliated with a tax-exempt entity\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Supreme Court appeals are underway for two cases involving California\u2019s disclosure law Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Becerra and Institute for Free Speech v. Becerra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Times: Supreme Court mulls whether to take Black Lives Matter case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alex Swoyer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeRay McKesson, a top activist in the Black Lives Matter movement, is asking the justices to hear his case after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled he was liable for an assault on a police officer at a rally outside a police station in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2016 following the police shooting of Alton Sterling\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has been percolating in the courts for years but has taken on a new urgency with the rise of nationwide protest over George Floyd\u2019s death last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer in the case, identified only as \u201cJohn Doe\u201d in court papers, sued Mr. McKesson after being struck in the head by a \u201crock-like\u201d object when he began arresting unruly protesters. He said the protesters at the rally became aggressive toward law enforcement officers after Black Lives Matter activists whipped the crowd into an anti-police frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police officer argued that the First Amendment doesn\u2019t protect the protesters from \u201cnegligent, illegal, and dangerous activity that poses a risk of serious harm to others.\u201d Though the individual who threw the object is unidentified, the officer sued Black Lives Matter and Mr. McKesson, hoping to hold someone liable for the assault\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. McKesson contends that if the 5th Circuit\u2019s ruling stays in place and holds organizers liable for other people\u2019s conduct, it will curtail First Amendment rights to peacefully assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances. He said people will be afraid to protest if they could be held liable for the unlawful acts of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: Bloomberg asks court to toss suit from former campaign aides&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Christopher Cadelago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Bloomberg is asking a court to throw out a lawsuit brought by former aides to his failed presidential campaign who allege they were promised to be paid through the general election before he laid them off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg attorneys wrote in their Monday motion to dismiss that the former field organizers who brought the class-action lawsuit earlier this year signed offer letters and were provided employee handbooks that specifically stated they were \u201cat will\u201d workers and could be terminated \u201cat any time.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the motion, Bloomberg\u2019s lawyers wrote that the aides do not meet any of the requirements to bring such claims and contend that they also failed to meet the heightened standard for fraud. Bloomberg\u2019s team argued that if the case isn\u2019t dismissed outright, the court should nix the class-action allegations because the claims are \u201chighly individualized and not suitable for class treatment.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three former Bloomberg field organizers in Georgia, Utah and Washington state filed the lawsuit in March, contending that they were fraudulently induced to accept jobs with the former New York mayor\u2019s presidential campaign via promises of guaranteed pay through November\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg, who initially shared plans about starting a super PAC that could have employed the former aides, decided instead to transfer $18 million of his own money to the Democratic National Committee to help the eventual Democratic nominee, presumably Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roll Call: Democrats increase pressure on Facebook over content policies and Trump posts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Dean DeChiaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to [Facebook CEO Mark] Zuckerberg\u00a0last week, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, D-Mo., and other House Democrats wrote that the company\u2019s response to violent content and the spread of disinformation on its platform, such as Trump\u2019s recent false statements about mail-in voting, \u201care extremely troubling.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company\u2019s decision not to remove Trump\u2019s post was met with opposition from within Facebook\u2019s own ranks and stood in stark contrast to action by other social media platforms such as Twitter, which labeled both of Trump\u2019s statements in violation of its content policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis highlights a possible negligent obfuscation of responsibility to your team, your shareholders, and your users,\u201d Cleaver and the other Democrats wrote. \u201cIt also underscores a likely pattern of practice in failing to appropriately balance free speech against public safety and the general welfare of users.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleaver\u2019s co-signers included Democratic Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who is leading an antitrust investigation of Facebook and other technology companies by the House Judiciary Committee, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who questioned Zuckerberg about the spread of false information on the website when he testified on Capitol Hill last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats also questioned the company\u2019s paid advertising policies and its \u201cmicro-targeting\u201d practices, which allow advertisers to aim their messages at specific users based on data collected by Facebook. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and others have derided the system as a \u201cdisinformation-for-profit machine\u201d since Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has spent millions on Facebook advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: America\u2019s Newsrooms Face a Reckoning on Race After Floyd Protests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Khadeeja Safdar, Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg and Benjamin Mullin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News organizations have dealt with a host of difficult questions regarding race and diversity in the wake of the protests sparked by the death of [George]\u00a0Floyd\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From newspapers to cable news channels, the events have fueled debates in newsrooms over the extent and nature of protest coverage, how much editorial staffers should be able to express themselves publicly, news outlets\u2019 commitment to diversity and conditions in the workplace for minorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At The Wall Street Journal, more than 150 journalists on Friday sent a letter to Almar Latour, the recently appointed chief executive of News Corp unit Dow Jones and publisher of the Journal, and Matt Murray, editor in chief of the Journal, expressing concerns about diversity, hiring and coverage, among other issues, according to people familiar with the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cMany WSJ journalists, including many who are white, find the way we cover race to be problematic,\u201d the letter says, according to a person who viewed it\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some journalists want more freedom to express their views on social media or attend protests and rallies. In many newsrooms, including the Journal\u2019s, social-media guidelines for staff members are meant to avoid any perception that reporting is biased. Whether a journalist\u2019s commentary or activities constitutes a political statement-or simply a statement of social values-can sometimes be a subject of debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealClearPolitics: Don\u2019t Break Up Big Tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Stephen Moore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk blasted Amazon for being a \u201cmonopoly\u201d and tweeted, \u201cTime to break up Amazon.\u201d Conservatives piled on. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri has introduced new antitrust legislation against the tech companies. President Donald Trump has threatened to regulate social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook \u201cstrongly.\u201d Some in Congress want an investigation into Google\u2019s search engine algorithms to make sure they aren\u2019t discriminating against conservative websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been a loud critic of the anti-conservative bias of the big Silicon Valley tech firms, and conservative leaders must keep the pressure on these firms to level the playing field. New polling commissioned by a group I run, the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, and conducted by Remington Research Group revealed that a majority of conservative activists believe tech companies engage in censorship or display bias against conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When conservatives were asked, \u201cDo you believe the federal government should be involved in regulating political speech on the internet?\u201d the results were shockingly one-sided. Seventy-six percent of respondents said no, the government should keep its hands off regulating it, the technology companies and their platforms. The same poll asked conservatives which issue is most important to them when casting their vote for federal offices such as senator or representative. Just 1% said \u201conline censorship.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: The Technology 202: New study reveals extent of hate speech on Reddit in right-leaning forums&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Cat Zakrzewski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study of abuse on Reddit found that more moderation is needed to stem racist and white supremacist content on the service \u2013 particularly in right-leaning political forums.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentropy, a start-up that makes content moderation tools, analyzed comments in some of the most popular political message boards on both sides of the aisle, such as \u201cr/The_Donald\u201d \u2013 which is dedicated to discussion of President Trump \u2013 and \u201cr/WayOfTheBern\u201d \u2013 a forum for fans of former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company found that right-leaning forums contained three times as much hate speech containing racist, sexist, religious and homophobic attacks as the left-leaning groups. These forums also contained six times as much hate speech containing white supremacist extremism.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere\u2019s more moderation that absolutely should be happening,\u201d said Sentropy chief executive John Redgrave in an interview\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, Reddit has a more hands-off approach than social media services like Facebook and Twitter, and it relies much more heavily on community content moderators to prevent the spread of harmful content on its forums. That\u2019s led to widespread complaints that the company has allowed violent and racist content to fester unchecked for years.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s now bringing more urgency to content moderation efforts in light of the Black Lives Matter protests.\u00a0Earlier this month, Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman\u00a0promised\u00a0to update the company\u2019s content policy, as it does not currently explicitly ban hateful or racist content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techdirt: Devin Nunes\u2019 Lawyer Tells Judge To Ignore Section 230, Because Twitter Is Anti-Devin Nunes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Mike Masnick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter and [Devin Nunes\u2019 lawyer]\u00a0Steven Biss. . . were in court on Friday to continue Nunes\u2019 frivolous SLAPP suit\u00a0against a satirical internet cow\u00a0who makes fun of Nunes. The current issue remains Twitter\u2019s\u00a0unwillingness to reveal\u00a0who is behind the\u00a0@DevinCow\u00a0account. Twitter, correctly, continues to point out that it doesn\u2019t need to give up the account info, that\u00a0it\u2019s protected from doing so under Section 230, that the Cow has engaged in 1st Amendment protected speech, and more. And Biss\u2019s response appears to be\u2026\u00a0\u201cbut Twitter\u2019s mean to us, so it\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this is not a very good argument\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]here\u2019s no evidence that Twitter is \u201cbanning conservative accounts\u201d or \u201cknowingly encouraging\u201d anything involving an \u201canti-Nunes agenda,\u201d but even if they were, that\u2019s explicitly allowed (even encouraged) under Section 230, which flat out says that sites cannot be held liable for the moderation of constitutionally protected speech.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Political Groups Track Protesters\u2019 Cellphone Data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Emily Glazer and Patience Haggin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protests continuing around the country are historic displays of social action. For political operatives, the mass gatherings are also a unique opportunity to harvest data on potential voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy and voter-registration groups are gathering a trove of data from protests by tracking the cellphones of participants and sending them messages about registering to vote or taking other actions. The tactics, which one user called \u201cdeeply spooky yet extremely helpful,\u201d are the latest example of ways political groups are using cellphone data to target voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking individuals through location data gathered by apps on their phones, often referred to as geofencing, has been used by businesses for years and has more recently caught on among political groups. That data allows firms to reach people\u2019s phones with ads or other messaging-in real-time or later-without identifying individuals, proponents say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political groups say\u00a0the protests\u00a0following the killing\u00a0of George Floyd while in police custody, along with\u00a0earlier lockdown\u00a0protests, are opening up fresh opportunities to reach people who may not be registered to vote or weren\u2019t previously politically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen these protests emerged, it was eye-opening for folks to understand, wow, people are gathering again,\u201d said Quentin James, founder and president of the Collective, which works to elect African-Americans. Mr. James\u2019s group is using the data gathered to target voter-registration messages to people who have been at protest locations. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re using all available tools in our toolbox to make sure we\u2019re reaching the right people.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Ask Not What President Trump Can Do for You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Michelle Cottle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Trump\u2019s triumphal return, his campaign has decided that no social distancing is required. He wants [his Tulsa rally] to be a spectacle, packed with as much noisy adoration as possible\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to stress that there is nothing wrong with presidential photo ops per se. Politics is a performative business, especially the presidency. With skillful staging, presidents can signal their priorities, inspire the nation or simply model good behavior. Think about Ronald Reagan at the Berlin Wall; George W. Bush throwing out the first pitch in Game 3 of the World Series in Yankee Stadium not long after the Sept. 11 attacks; Barack Obama sitting alone on the Rosa Parks bus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As tacky as it may sound, using people as props is also a presidential staple. What are the guests at the State of the Union address but a way to convey priorities? \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[O]n the whole, presidential theater is a powerful tool of the trade, one that Mr. Trump should understand better than most.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Center for Responsive Politics: No, that company cannot fund Trump\u2019s campaign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Karl Evers-Hillstrom and Brendan Quinn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major corporations aren\u2019t bankrolling President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, despite viral social media posts that say otherwise. They also aren\u2019t funding former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s White House bid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s because corporations are barred from contributing directly to federal candidates\u2019 campaigns or political parties. Only individuals and political action committees, which can include those funded by employees of a company, may contribute to candidates\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media users this month falsely claimed that fast food restaurant Wendy\u2019s is funding Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, spawning the \u201cWendysIsOverParty\u201d hashtag and prompting the company to donate $500,000 to social justice organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any other company, Wendy\u2019s cannot contribute directly to candidates. Those claims came about because an executive at MUY! Companies, which owns and operates hundreds of Wendy\u2019s, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations, did give big to Trump. The company\u2019s CEO, James Bodenstedt, gave $450,000 to Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee benefitting Trump\u2019s campaign. However, Bodenstedt does not own those restaurant chains; he owns individual franchises of the restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan Capitol Confidential: Township Officials Sue Tax Hike Opponents For Successfully Committing Politics Online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Holly Matkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Bloomfield Township officials have filed a class-action lawsuit against the social media platform Nextdoor for allegedly allowing local members to spread false information about a tax hike proposal, on the August 2019 ballot, for a special assessment. The officials blame the online postings for influencing a majority of voters to vote \u201cno\u201d on a measure that would have increased local property taxes by about 10%. They characterized the defeat as the equivalent of a $9 million loss to the township\u2019s fire and police budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yatooma Law Firm filed the lawsuit in Oakland County Circuit Court on May 5 on behalf of Bloomfield Township Supervisor Leo Savoie, Township Treasurer Brian Kepes, and \u201call others similarly situated.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomfield Township residents Valerie Murray, who is running for a township trustee seat, and Kathleen Norton-Schock, the regional director responsible for enforcing Nextdoor\u2019s guidelines and policies, are also named as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norton-Schock allegedly allowed Murray and others to \u201cmonopolize posting boards with demonstrably false postings designed to fabricate fear and panic,\u201d according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nextdoor\u2019s policies specify that postings must be \u201chelpful, not hurtful,\u201d and prohibit postings that \u201cattack, shame, insult, bully or belittle\u201d other members, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political comments are permitted in some areas, but are required to be \u201cneutral in tone,\u201d the plaintiffs noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit claims that Murray, \u201cunder the guise of being a \u2018concerned\u2019 citizen,\u201d monopolized and intentionally spread misinformation \u201cdesigned to defeat a ballot initiative\u201d aimed at increasing funding to fill police and fire department vacancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fulcrum:\u00a0Alaskans will decide on sweeping election reform plan in November&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Shirin Ali&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measure that would revamp Alaska\u2019s elections will be put to a statewide vote in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The package cleared the last remaining hurdle to getting on the ballot Friday, when the state Supreme Court\u00a0ruled unanimously\u00a0that it met the requirement that referendums all relate to a single topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption of the initiative would on a single day push Alaska to the forefront of states adopting central goals of the mainstream democracy reform movement. The proposal would replace traditional partisan primaries with a single contest open to all candidates; allow the top four finishers to advance to the November ballot; use ranked-choice voting to choose the winner; and bolster state campaign finance rules with strict new disclosure requirements\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path for such a statewide vote in Alaska was cleared after the state\u2019s top court decided in favor of Alaskans for Better Elections, the group pushing the referendum\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final element of the plan would require additional disclosure of contributions to independent expenditure groups and about the sources of contributions in campaigns \u2013 generally when the amounts topped $2,000. The proposal would require a disclaimer on paid election communications by independent expenditure groups funded by mostly out-of-state money. Under current federal election campaign law, candidates benefiting from independent expenditures have no reporting obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 6/16 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

Doe\u00a0and reverse a lower court decision that allowed a policeman who was injured by an unknown attacker at a Black Lives Matter protest to sue the protest\u2019s organizer; they argue that \u201cthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion handed a terrible weapon to would-be censors.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New from\u00a0the\u00a0Institute for Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There Should Be Qualified Immunity for Protesters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alec Greven&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right to protest is clearly enshrined in the First Amendment and is central to any legitimate democratic or free society. Protest challenges orthodoxy and injustice and draws attention to pressing issues that need to be remedied. The Supreme Court has an\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to increase protections for protesters by hearing\u00a0Mckesson v. Doe. The Institute for Free Speech recently\u00a0filed\u00a0an amicus brief arguing that there should be higher standards before a lawsuit can be brought against a protest organizer. These higher standards would protect the speech of individuals by\u00a0requiring\u00a0\u201ca more particularized and direct connection\u201d between the harm resulting from a protest and the actions of the protest organizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a solution exists. </p><p>Qualified immunity is a higher legal standard that would offer protections to protesters. Typically reserved for government officials,\u00a0qualified immunity\u00a0shields individuals from legal liability unless they clearly violate the law or the constitutional rights of others. The doctrine of qualified immunity should be extended to the content of the speech within a protest to protect the constitutional rights of citizens. This immunity should not be absolute, of course. For example, if someone negligently organized a protest with too little space and a large amount of people set off a panic, causing injury, then qualified immunity would not apply. However, merely speaking on a controversial issue should not expose protesters to liability unless they intentionally incite violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ICYMI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Politicians, \u201cFalse\u201d Speech About You Is Protected by the First Amendment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alex Baiocco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers should keep in mind that any effort to use the force of law to inflict punishment for allegedly false political speech will have [a] chilling effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the mere threat of legislation (along with a\u00a0relentless pressure campaign) from Congress has already chilled political speech online. Shortly after\u00a0Rep. David Cicilline announced\u00a0he was working on legislation to\u00a0impose liability\u00a0on social media companies for false statements in political ads that appear on their platforms,\u00a0Twitter announced\u00a0it would no longer allow\u00a0any\u00a0political ads on its services.\u00a0Rep. Jan Schakowsky is also interested\u00a0in legislation to address her concerns \u201cabout how far one can go in paid political advertising where Facebook will take no responsibility for anything that is said in a paid political ad.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cicilline\u00a0insists\u00a0that \u201c[r]ather than being a First Amendment issue, it\u2019s really a kind of revenue generation issue for a business.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in [the landmark 1964 case\u00a0New York Times\u00a0 v. Sullivan,] the Supreme Court\u00a0held\u00a0that \u201c[e]xpression does not lose constitutional protection to which it would otherwise be entitled because it appears in the form of a paid advertisement.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cicilline, perhaps aware of the serious constitutional issues in his original idea, has apparently now\u00a0settled\u00a0on \u201cProtecting Democracy from Disinformation\u201d by forcing online platforms to limit the ability of political advertisers to microtarget\u201d their messages. The proposal would also force platforms to report detailed information about individual ads and advertisers. The imposition of liability in the proposal\u00a0would likely cause more\u00a0platforms to follow Twitter\u2019s lead in banning all political ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump Administration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Examiner: Justice Department proposes reforming online company protections under Section 230&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jerry Dunleavy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department issued a report proposing that the laws governing internet companies should be reformed and some immunities should be rolled back to help incentivize internet businesses to be \u201cresponsible actors.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney General William Barr\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday that\u00a0Section 230\u00a0of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 must be updated after nearly two decades\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department\u2019s 28-page\u00a0report, titled\u00a0Section 230 \u2013 Nurturing Innovation or Fostering Unaccountability?, was the culmination of a 10-month review\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also\u00a0introduced\u00a0a bill on Wednesday to enable U.S. citizens to sue Big Tech companies who act in bad faith by selectively censoring political speech. The\u00a0bill\u00a0would forbid Big Tech companies such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter from receiving Section 230 immunity unless they update their terms of service to promise to operate in good faith\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union has repeatedly\u00a0argued\u00a0against Republican proposals to reform Section 230, saying that \u201csetting aside the obvious constitutional problems with a government entity judging the political content of speech, or dictating the censorship decisions of online platforms, these proposals would make it far less palatable for online services to host others\u2019 speech at all.\u201d The group previously argued that \u201cif enacted, the internet\u2019s marketplace of ideas \u2013 and our freedom to communicate online \u2013 would suffer.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic: The Obscure Supreme Court Decision the Trump Administration Could Use to Gut the First Amendment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Garrett Epps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My attention . . . was caught by a curious case citation in [President Trump\u2019s executive] order that has gone mostly unnoticed. In Section 4, \u201cFederal Review of Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practice,\u201d the order reads: \u201cIt is the policy of the United States that large online platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, as the critical means of promoting the free flow of speech and ideas today, should not restrict protected speech. These sites are providing an important forum to the public for others to engage in free expression and debate.\u00a0Cf.\u00a0PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 85-89 (1980).\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PruneYard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that name doesn\u2019t ring a bell, don\u2019t feel bad-even for First Amendment nerds,\u00a0PruneYard\u00a0is obscure\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been wondering whether the citation is a legal Easter egg, a hidden sign pointing to the direction that William Barr\u2019s Justice Department would like to take the law. If the administration is serious about raising\u00a0PruneYard\u00a0as a rallying cry for internet regulation, it would mark yet another curious deformity that Trumpism has imposed on what was once called conservatism. Because\u00a0PruneYard\u00a0was, until now, considered a disgraceful liberal assault on property rights. It may be a harbinger that Trump seeks to apply a new kind of eminent domain to cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Free speech \u2013 not national security \u2013 is at stake in Trump\u2019s absurd lawsuit against John Bolton\u2019s book&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Editorial Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed Tuesday, the Justice Department insists that it wants to stop former national security adviser John Bolton from damaging national security by revealing secret information in his forthcoming book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened.\u201d In fact, the primary danger is to President Trump, who, if early leaks are any indication, has much to fear from an unvarnished account of his behavior. The suit is absurd, and the Justice Department should be ashamed to be associated with a clear attempt to harass a man trying to detail Mr. Trump\u2019s malfeasance\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, no self-respecting judge would order Mr. Bolton to halt publication. The government seeks a \u201cprior restraint\u201d of speech on matters of critical public interest\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit could simply be a feeble attempt to mollify Mr. Trump, who only likes freedom of speech when the message praises him, and who routinely pressures the Justice Department to help his friends and punish his enemies. But even a long-shot bid to silence a Trump critic may intimidate other disillusioned former officials from revealing disturbing things they saw during their time in the administration, lest the Justice Department sic taxpayer-funded lawyers on them, too\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former government employees need not fear telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courthouse\u00a0News: Fighting Slander Suit Over Tucker Carlson, Fox Calls Host Hyperbolic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Adam Klasfeld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cRemember the facts of the story; these are undisputed,\u201d Fox News personality Tucker Carlson told his 2.8 million viewers in 2018, before labeling former Playboy model Karen McDougal as a presidential extortionist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, an attorney for the network asserted that no reasonable viewer would believe that what followed this preamble was factual reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s a commentary show,\u201d Fox\u2019s lawyer Erin Murphy, of the firm Kirkland &amp;Ellis;, insisted during arguments trying to swat away\u00a0McDougal\u2019s defamation lawsuit. \u201cIt\u2019s a show that markets itself \u2026 as opinion and spirited debate. That context matters.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDougal\u2019s defamation claims cannot advance without her showing that Carlson acted with actual malice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil noted at Wednesday\u2019s hearing this requires more than showing the Fox personality has bias and an agenda\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[McDougal\u2019s] lawyer added there were other reasons to suspect Carlson peddled a false narrative to advance his \u201csymbiotic\u201d relationship with the president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump had promoted Carlson\u2019s book \u201cShip of Fools\u201d a little less than two months before the segment\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In trying to dismiss the lawsuit, Fox News could encounter an ironic hurdle: Sarah Palin, the folksy Alaskan politician who became a pundit for the network, sued The New York Times over its editorial tying her to a trend of partisan rhetoric fueling mass shootings.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second Circuit\u2019s\u00a0revival of that defamation case\u00a0could now undermine Fox\u2019s argument that Carlson\u2019s commentary is protected opinion, if the court finds it makes false claims with reckless disregard to the facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood Reporter: YouTube Alleged to Racially Profile Via Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Eriq Gardner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of African American content creators has launched a putative class action against YouTube and its Alphabet parent company for allegedly violating various laws intended to prevent racial discrimination. The lawsuit\u00a0represents the latest courtroom attack on the increasingly controversial immunities afforded digital services under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint filed on Tuesday in California federal court objects to the way in which YouTube is employing artificial intelligence, algorithms, and other filtering tools\u2026[T]he complaint adds, the system is rife with \u201cdigital racism,\u201d where users are essentially profiled on race, identity and viewpoints. The plaintiffs assert that this interferes with their ability to monetize their content\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the suit alleges that YouTube is applying \u201cRestricted Mode\u201d to videos titled or tagged with abbreviations like \u201cBLM\u201d or \u201cKKK\u201d ones that use terms like \u201cracial profiling\u201d or \u201cpolice shooting\u201d or \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d those that include names of individuals killed by law enforcement; and videos titled or tagged with the names \u201cBill Cosby\u201d or \u201cLouis Farrakhan.\u201d \u2026The suit also targets other alleged practices of YouTube ranging from \u201cshadow banning\u201d to what\u2019s excluded on the \u201ctrending\u201d and \u201cup next\u201d video recommendation lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest suit is being handled by attorneys at Browne George Ross, who notably were involved in two other recent court actions against YouTube\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[P]laintiffs claim Trump\u2019s [recent executive\u00a0order] precludes the government from stepping in to enforce Section 230 to claims based on viewpoint discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Review: Ted Cruz Lambastes Google CEO for \u2018Politically Motivated\u2019 Crackdown on The Federalist Comments Section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tobias Hoonhout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) demanded in a Wednesday letter that Google CEO Sundar Pichai explain why the platform threatened to demonetize the right wing news website\u00a0The Federalist\u00a0over comments on articles related to recent Black Lives Matter protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAs evidence by its actions yesterday, Google seems more than happy to play this censorship role by trying to break the financial back of a media publication it disagrees with,\u201d wrote Cruz, who serves as chairman of the Senate Judiciary\u2019s Constitution Subcommittee. Attorney General Bill Barr and Federal Trade Commission chairman Joseph Simons were also copied on the letter\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also challenged Google over its \u201cdeeply ironic\u201d defense of Section 230, which grants it liability immunity for third-party content published on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhile Google demands that it cannot be held financially accountable for unlawful speech on its own platform, it is all too willing to use its market power to hold a conservative media outlet financially responsible for allowing disfavored speech on its platform,\u201d Cruz argued\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruz ended his letter by requesting answers from Google over whether it was tipped off by NBC News or the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) that the\u00a0Federalist\u00a0had violated its policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: House Republican accuses Facebook, Twitter, YouTube of not doing enough to combat Chinese propaganda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Maggie Miller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scorecards released by House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member\u00a0Michael McCaul\u00a0(R-Texas) on Wednesday accused Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube of not taking adequate steps to limit the spread of Chinese disinformation and propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scorecards graded the three social media giants on whether they labeled state-sponsored media outlets on their sites, blocked Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials from having verified accounts, fact checked posts, and initiated comprehensive removal of CCP propaganda and disinformation\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCaul highlighted his concerns about CCP-backed online propaganda in a\u00a0letter\u00a0sent to Secretary of State\u00a0Mike Pompeo\u00a0in March, urging Pompeo to intensify efforts to push back against China for spreading misinformation around the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen.\u00a0Ben Sasse\u00a0(R-Neb.) and\u00a0Mike Gallagher\u00a0(R-Wis.) also\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0to Twitter in March asking the platform to ban the CCP from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salon: Exclusive: Tucker Carlson-founded Daily Caller violated tax law, IRS complaint alleges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Roger Sollenberger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Caller,\u00a0a conservative news outlet\u00a0co-founded by\u00a0Tucker Carlson, and its related nonprofit, the Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF), appear to have operated in violation of tax law, according to a complaint filed Tuesday with the IRS by a public transparency watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint \u2013 which the group, Campaign for Accountability (CFA), shared exclusively with Salon \u2013 calls for the IRS to strip the foundation of its tax-exempt status. It alleges that The Daily Caller has used the foundation to effectively subsidize its business, while the nonprofit entity has engaged in political activities in violation of the rules governing its tax status\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFA complaint singles\u00a0out political activity.\u00a0Because the two entities are nearly indistinguishable, political activity on the part of The\u00a0Daily Caller\u00a0may violate\u00a0the foundation\u2019s special tax status,\u00a0it says.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, The Daily Caller\u2019s email newsletter regularly features foundation-generated content. In 2016, The Daily Caller\u00a0rented its email list to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign\u00a0for $150,000. The campaign used the list to solicit contributions\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the complaint alleges that DCNF employees have engaged in political activity in their official foundation capacities, in violation of rules governing 501(c)(3) organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Protesting should not result in a lifelong criminal record&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Margaret Love and David Schlussel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters should not wind up with a lifelong criminal record\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Atlanta woman arrested for being a \u201cpedestrian in a roadway\u201d and \u201crefusing to comply when asked to leave\u201d told\u00a0the Guardian\u00a0newspaper, \u201cNow I have my mugshot taken, my fingerprints taken and my eyes scanned. Now I\u2019m a criminal over an illegal arrest.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure to clear arrest records such as these is not only bad policy but also an ironic outcome for protesting excessive policing. It will likely serve as a deterrent not just to free speech and assembly but also to media coverage of protest events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: NBC Tries to Cancel a Conservative Website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Ben Domenech and Sean Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC News attempted this week to use the power of Google to cancel our publication, the Federalist. The effort failed, but it should serve as a warning about the unchecked power of big tech companies, particularly when they can be manipulated by partisans, including partisan journalists\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC News colluded with a foreign left-wing group in an attempt to destroy us because it disagrees with our political commentary and media criticism. The episode illustrates how dangerous the combination of partisan media and monopolistic tech companies is to America. We survived the attack because our organization is well-known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is only the latest example of media outlets using social-media platforms to attack and destroy Americans who don\u2019t kowtow to left-wing orthodoxy. Ask Brendan Eich, who was fired from a Silicon Valley job in 2014 for contributing to a referendum against same-sex marriage six years earlier, or Nicholas Sandmann, who at age 16 was labeled a bigot by journalists for CNN and other outlets for attending a pro-life rally in D.C. and politely staying silent while an adult berated him and his classmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These attacks target not only individuals but free speech itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital Research Center: ActBlue: The Left\u2019s Favorite \u201cDark Money\u201d Machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Hayden Ludwig&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As InfluenceWatch explains,\u00a0ActBlue\u00a0is a service for left-wing groups and Democratic politicians to fundraise without setting up an online donation infrastructure themselves. Money passes through ActBlue to the ultimate recipient and ActBlue collects a fee as payment. This also has the added effect of obscuring the ultimate recipient, since money passing through ActBlue looks like a donation to ActBlue-not to, say, Black Lives Matter\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the trick to ActBlue is understanding that it\u2019s a single brand encompassing 3 separate nonprofits: a 501(c)(3) called\u00a0ActBlue Charities, a 501(c)(4) called\u00a0ActBlue Civics, and a PAC (also called a \u201c527\u201d) simply called\u00a0ActBlue\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]hese are three money \u201cpots\u201d which don\u2019t spill over into each other\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ActBlue Charities and ActBlue Civics file Form 990 reports with the IRS, meaning that their top-line finances are publicly disclosed\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nearly all the money ActBlue Charities and ActBlue Civics\u00a0paid out\u00a0is reported generically in one lump, as \u201cpassed-through contributions\u201d-meaning those ActBlue nonprofits don\u2019t have to disclose which groups they passed money to or how much each group received in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the Left\u2019s loathing for untraceable \u201cdark money,\u201d that\u2019s shocking hypocrisy\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not aware of any other nonprofits that hide that lumping everything into the generic expense of \u201cpassed-through contributions\u201d the way ActBlue does. In fact, I wonder if any reporter has ever asked ActBlue Charities and ActBlue Civics if the IRS has explicitly okayed their highly convenient non-reporting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Now You Can Opt Out of Seeing Political Ads on Facebook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Mike Isaac&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, [Facebook] said it would allow people in the United States to opt out of seeing social issue, electoral or political ads from candidates or political action committees in their Facebook or Instagram feeds. The ability to hide those ads will begin with a small group of users, before rolling out in the coming weeks to the rest of the United States and later to several other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cEveryone wants to see politicians held accountable for what they say \u2013 and I know many people want us to moderate and remove more of their content,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, wrote in an op-ed piece in USA Today on Tuesday. \u201cFor those of you who\u2019ve already made up your minds and just want the election to be over, we hear you \u2013 so we\u2019re also introducing the ability to turn off seeing political ads. We\u2019ll still remind you to vote.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move allows Facebook to play both sides of a complicated debate about the role of political advertising on social media ahead of the November presidential election. With the change, Facebook can continue allowing political ads to flow across its network, while also finding a way to reduce the reach of those ads and to offer a concession to critics who have said the company should do more to moderate noxious speech on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg has long said that Facebook would not police and moderate political ads. That\u2019s because the company does not want to limit the speech of candidates, he has said, especially in smaller elections and those candidates who do not have the deep pockets of the major campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knight Foundation &amp;Gallup;, Inc.: Free Expression, Harmful Speech and Censorship in a Digital World&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A Knight Foundation/Gallup study found:]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two-thirds of Americans (65%) favor allowing people to express their views on social media, including views that are offensive, over restricting what people can say on social media based on societal norms or standards of what is fair or appropriate (35%)\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are somewhat divided on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which largely shields major internet companies from liability for content posted on their websites and apps by third parties\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levels of trust in social media companies to make the right decisions about what people can say or post on their websites and apps are low, with more than 8 in 10 Americans saying they trust the companies \u201cnot much\u201d (44%) or \u201cnot at all\u201d (40%).\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slim majority of Americans (54%) say that social media companies are \u201cnot tough enough\u201d in policing content on their sites, and 25% say they get it right. Men, whites and less educated Americans are all more likely to say content oversight is \u201ctoo tough.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 8 in 10 Americans say they think a content oversight board is a \u201cgood idea\u201d (54%) or \u201cvery good idea\u201d (27%), while 12% say it is a \u201cbad idea,\u201d and 7% say it\u2019s a \u201cvery bad idea.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason:\u00a0NBC Said Google Is Demonetizing The Federalist for Spreading Fake News; Google Says the NBC Report Is Fake News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Robby Soave&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have every right to complain about Google but, as a private company, Google is not obligated to treat all of its users equally. People on the right often grasp this intuitively when the issue is slightly different: Many conservative writers do not want a\u00a0Christian bakery to be compelled\u00a0to bake cakes for gay weddings, for instance. But if it\u2019s wrong for the government to force a private company to do business with an LGBT couple, it should also be wrong to force a private company to do business with\u00a0The Federalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can find hypocrisies in every direction. Anyone who wants to argue that an outlet like\u00a0The Federalist\u00a0should not be held responsible for its comment section is actually making a philosophical case\u00a0for\u00a0Section 230, which extends precisely this protection to large platforms. In general, the internet works best when the government takes a hands-off approach, allowing all sorts of viewpoints to flourish. Still, if Google would like to avoid losing its own protection, the company might think twice about arguing that outlets like\u00a0The Federalist\u00a0should be held to a harsher standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portland Press Herald: Would-be Clean Elections candidates find it harder to qualify during pandemic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Scott Thistle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of legislative candidates running publicly funded campaigns is down dramatically in 2020, largely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Campaign Finance, the independent state agency that oversees Maine Clean Elections Act funding, said about 43 candidates who wanted to participate in the program were unable to qualify \u2013 a much higher figure than usual\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although 208 candidates did successfully qualify by collecting $5 contributions from each of 60 registered voters in their districts, that\u2019s a decrease from 229 in 2016 and 249 in 2014 \u2013 the last two legislative elections\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Cyr, an Auburn Republican who is challenging incumbent state Rep. Gina Melaragno, a Democrat, for the city\u2019s House District 62 seat, said\u2026the economic pressure some voters were feeling made them hesitant to give even $5. But collecting funds as a traditional candidate presents fewer restrictions on who can give and how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve actually been much more successful as a traditional candidate in trying to get checks,\u201d Cyr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 6/18 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

Such a ban could be an enormous blow to an ad-supported website. By some measures, Google Ads commands\u00a0over 30%\u00a0of the entire digital ad business worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google spokesperson\u00a0added\u00a0that\u00a0The Federalist\u00a0was in violation of its policies, not because of its articles, but because of content in its readers\u2019 comments.\u00a0The Federalist\u00a0responded by immediately removing all user comments from its website. Google then\u00a0said\u00a0the matter was resolved, and the site would not be demonetized\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]onservatives should be asking: would\u00a0revoking Section 230\u00a0make things any better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federalist\u2019s response suggests that it would not. </p><p>The instant the site faced financial repercussions for the content of its user comments, it removed\u00a0all\u00a0user comments. It did not go through and separate good from bad. It just chucked all the comments out in one fell swoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While\u00a0The Federalist\u00a0plans\u00a0to bring back its comments section in due course, it\u2019s easy to see how others could make a different choice. If these incidents were to continue, many websites might decide that user comments aren\u2019t worth the trouble. Especially if some group goes hunting for comments that violate Google\u2019s rules (or even posts problematic comments themselves), hoping to damage a particular publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes with Section 230 immunity are even higher than a loss of ad revenue. The risk to a platform is that it will be sued and have to pay out for illegal content that users are able to slip past the refs. The incentives to restrict speech will be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump Administration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forbes: Trump Says He Wants To Punish Flag Burning With A Year In Prison&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Andrew Solender&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At his rally in Tulsa on Saturday, President Trump said he wants to make flag burning a crime, punishable by one year in prison\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump. . . [called]\u00a0on the senators in attendance, Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.), to propose legislation criminalizing flag burning, with jail time as a penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year,\u201d Trump\u00a0said, claiming that he\u2019s \u201ca big believer in freedom of speech,\u201d but calling flag burning \u201cdesecration.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump cited an incident at a protest in Portland as the inspiration for his proposal. \u201cTwo days ago, leftist protesters in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped in an American flag, and set the American flag on fire,\u201d Trump said to raucous boos from the crowd. \u201cDemocrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat,\u201d he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter users were quick to note the unconstitutionality of Trump\u2019s proposal. \u201cSomeone should tell Trump that they once tried to have a law that criminalized flag burning but the Supreme Court struck it down in a decision that Justice Scalia joined,\u201d historian Kevin Kruse\u00a0noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News: AG Barr on tech companies censoring viewpoints: \u2018There\u2019s something very disturbing about what\u2019s going on\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Talia Kaplan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0something very disturbing about what\u2019s going on,\u201d Attorney General William Barr told Maria Bartiromo in an exclusive interview [about tech censorship. Barr\u00a0explained:]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTo some extent there was a bait-and-switch over the past couple of decades.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on to say the tech companies got their \u201cstrong market position\u201d by marketing themselves as \u201copen to all comers.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barr noted . . .\u201dthey built up all their membership and their networks [by] saying, \u2018We have a wide variety of views. People can come in and post their views and their positions and their statements.'\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThen they\u2019ve switched,\u201d Barr added. \u201cNow they\u2019re being more selective and they\u2019re starting to censor different viewpoints.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[He said\u00a0there is a\u00a0] \u201cconcentration of these very large companies that have that kind of influence on the sharing of information and viewpoints on our society.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barr explained that that is a \u201cfundamental problem\u201d because \u201cour republic was founded on the idea, and the whole rationale was that there\u2019d be a lot of diversity of voices and it would be hard for someone to be able to galvanize, big faction in the United States that could dominate politically and oppress a minority, and yet now we have with the Internet and with these big concentrations of power, the ability to do just that, to quickly galvanize people\u2019s views because they\u2019re only presenting one viewpoint and they can push the public in a particular direction very quickly.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then said that \u201cone way this can be addressed is through the antitrust laws and challenging companies that engage in monopolistic practices.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law360: Trump Adds PAC To Claims Over \u2018Manufactured\u2019 Quote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Christopher Cole&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has added a progressive political action committee as another target of a defamation suit already leveled against an\u00a0NBC\u00a0affiliate in Wisconsin because the PAC produced and sponsored an ad that featured allegedly manipulated clips of Trump claiming the coronavirus was \u201ca hoax.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump\u2019s reelection arm says Priorities USA Action belongs in the suit, which did not name the PAC when originally filed. The progressive organization\u2026asked to join the case as an intervenor defendant May 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald J. Trump for President Inc. sued Northland Television LLC, which does business as WJFW-NBC,\u00a0two months ago, saying it should not have broadcast Priorities USA\u2019s ad, which the campaign says it knew or should have known used digital technology to \u201cmanufacture\u201d a \u201cblatantly false statement that was never said by\u201d Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest pleadings, Trump\u2019s campaign accused Priorities USA, which it called a \u201cfar-left super PAC,\u201d of sponsoring \u201ca false and defamatory statement\u201d in a television ad that has been distributed via social media and broadcast through various media outlets, including television stations such as WJFW\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit is Donald J. Trump for President Inc. v. Northland Television LLC et al., case number\u00a03:20-cv-00385, in the\u00a0U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albuquerque Journal: Cowboys for Trump sues New Mexico\u2019s secretary of state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Elise Kaplan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cowboys for Trump, a controversial grassroots group supporting the president, has moved its fight with the New Mexico secretary of state to federal court, alleging she violated their civil rights by mandating that they register as a political action committee and disclose their donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute began last fall when Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver determined the group should be considered a political committee and in February fined the group $7,800 for not filing expenditure reports with her office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bill passed by the Legislature in 2019 required that organizations such as Cowboys for Trump be considered political committees, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for New Mexico Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group has undertaken cross-country horseback rides in support of the president, as well as rallies at the Roundhouse to protest abortion rights bills and border-related issues\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin Hunter, an attorney representing Cowboys for Trump, said the group does not support individual candidates and doesn\u2019t get involved in state politics, so should not be considered a political action committee\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit states that the plaintiffs are worried that if they have to disclose donors and the information is posted on the internet, their supporters will face \u201csubstantial personal and economic repercussions.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAcross the country, individual and corporate donors to political candidates and issue causes are being subject to boycotts, harassment, protests, career damage and even death threats for publicly engaging in the public square,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cPlaintiffs fear that their donors may also encounter similar reprisals from activists if their donations are made public.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan Advance:\u00a0Court rejects rehearing of GOP cases to bar redistricting commission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Allison Donahue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans have challenged the constitutionality of Michigan\u2019s Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has\u00a0denied\u00a0requests to rehear the cases\u00a0en banc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 13-member commission of Democrats, Republicans and independents is supposed to draw lines for congressional, state House and state Senate districts after the 2020 census, something that was previously done by the Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters approved the change in Proposal 2 of 2018. More than 6,000 people have applied to be on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Daunt, the Republican activist who filed the first lawsuit, argued that Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson excluded the plaintiffs from serving on the commission due to its eligibility criteria, which prohibit eight classes of individuals with certain current or past political ties from serving as a commissioner\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second lawsuit, filed by the Michigan Republican Party, argued that the commission violated the First Amendment based on its selection process, composition and restrictions on the commissioners\u2019 ability to speak publicly about redistricting matters.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0against a preliminary injunction to stop implementation of the redistricting commission. On Friday, the court ruled that the issues raised in the petitions were already considered and did not need another hearing.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The petitions were circulated to the full court, but no judge requested a vote on the suggestion for a rehearing in front of the full 16-judge panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters Not Politicians, the group behind Proposal 2, claimed victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albany Times Union: Trump supporters challenge Glens Falls law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Wendy Liberatore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of President Donald Trump who are \u201ctired of being bullied into silence by the progressive left\u201d are taking legal action against the city, claiming it is violating their First Amendment right to free speech and peaceful assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, Northern District of New York on Tuesday by the American Patriot Express seeks to declare a city law requiring a permit for rallies and marches with 25 or more people unconstitutional. The lawsuit claims the city has \u201cunconstitutionally abridged\u201d their rights to assemble. It also calls the law\u00a0 \u201cunconstitutionally vague \u2026 overbroad\u201d and states that that it \u201c\u2026 censors speech based upon its content \u2026 and grants the city clerk limitless discretion through the permitting process.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Judge Lawrence E. Kahn signed an emergency temporary restraining order, halting enforcement of the local law until a decision can be made\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the number of people assembled, the law can impose a $250 fine for those who don\u2019t comply. The lawsuit contends American Patriot Express has had to impose \u201cself-censorship\u201d over fears of being fined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law also calls for a protest organizer to apply for a permit at least 14 days in advance. However, a permit may take up to 28 days to issue. That\u2019s a problem for the American Patriot Express, which coalesced spontaneously in response to the anti-Trump and/or Stefanik protesters\u2019 actions. The lawsuit notes that the permitting time frame effectively silences the American Patriot Express.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breitbart: Rep. Jim Banks: Election Is at Stake if We Don\u2019t Rein in Big Tech Censorship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Robert Kraychik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political censorship from the world\u2019s largest technology companies places elections at risk through manipulation of information, warned Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), offering his comments on Thursday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s\u00a0Breitbart News Tonight\u00a0with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other technology companies regularly deploy censorship of political speech and expression under the guise of restricting \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201cmisinformation.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political censorship and manipulation of information flows by large technology companies will escalate as 2020\u2019s presidential election draws near, he\u00a0predicted\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the Justice Department\u2019s proposals to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act hold promise in addressing \u201cbig tech\u2019s editing and censoring content [that] come from conservatives.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks said, \u201cRecent academic studies\u00a0show\u00a0that Facebook alone, using their algorithms, could steer nearly a half a million votes in the upcoming election. This is what is at stake if we don\u2019t do something about it, to rein in and hold these big tech platforms accountable for their actions, for their censorship, for their attacks on the First Amendment rights of all Americans.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks concluded, \u201cNot just regulations for regulations sake, but with Section 230, this is about holding these companies liable for infringing upon the First Amendment rights of the American people. These are American companies that were built from American ingenuity and innovation, and they should uphold the same values that we expect.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barron\u2019s: It\u2019s Time for Boards and Institutional Investors to Act on Racial Justice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Eleanor Bloxham and Bruce F. Freed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies\u00a0spend millions each year\u00a0on election-related political spending, either directly on state candidates or funneled through third party organizations including political action committees or trade organizations.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address racial injustice, boards and their investors need to understand the potential and actual consequences of their company\u2019s election-related spending and ensure those dollars advance rather than erode racial equity\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to corporate sponsored PACs funded by employees, company funds used for election-related spending ultimately come out of shareholders\u2019 pockets.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These investors can make a difference by voting for shareholder proposals that encourage boards of invested companies to\u00a0disclose and more effectively oversee\u00a0the corporate funds they choose to use for election-related spending\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headlines like \u201cMeet the Fortune 500 Companies Funding the Political Resegregation of America\u201d and \u201cThese Companies Support Climate Action, So Why Are They Funding Opposition To It?\u201d along with\u00a0fears of consumer boycotts\u00a0have forced greater corporate and investor attention to the impacts of corporate election-related spending.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still much work to be done.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s\u00a02010 Citizens United\u00a0decision, corporate political power has risen while the political power of African Americans has declined.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Review: Vive la Libert\u00e9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kevin D. Williamson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In France, the Constitutional Council (something like our Supreme Court) has struck down a new set of regulations put forward by the government of President Emmanuel Macron that would have imposed heavy fines on technology companies if they were insufficiently energetic in taking down certain \u201chateful\u201d content. Under the Macron rules, companies such as Facebook would have been legally responsible for doing that policing on their own initiative (as opposed to being directed to remove illegal content by a judge), and would have been given as little as one hour to act in some cases. It was an absurd proposal, though not quite as absurd as the German approach upon which it was based and which is standing law in that country\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small victory for free speech in France does not put Europe on the road to a First Amendment. And that should be of interest to Americans, not only as a point of comparison but also for practical reasons: Companies such as Facebook endeavor to comply with the law in the countries where they operate, and corporations by nature prefer the bureaucratic qualities of conformity, homogeneity, and standardization. For much the same reason that most U.S. automobile companies have long built cars that\u00a0satisfy California\u2019s stricter air-pollution standards\u00a0even when those cars are destined for Louisiana or North Dakota, firms such as Facebook have incentives to develop procedures that satisfy their most demanding regulators worldwide rather than their more permissive ones, and so it is likely that Americans relying on global technology companies will feel some influence from Berlin, Brussels \u2013 and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Review: Hands Off the Federalist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By The\u00a0Editors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media outfits that rely heavily upon the goodwill and cooperation of Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc., are making a very dangerous bet. These companies have shown time and again that they can be bullied and bullied fairly easily \u2013 by Beijing, by Brussels, and, most important, by their own employees. They are media companies of a kind, but what they mostly are is commodity eyeball aggregators with no abiding interest in journalism or democratic discourse and no real grounding in the history and culture of free speech and freedom of the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are multi-multi-billion-dollar behemoths, but they are oddly easy to push around, if the right kind of person is doing the pushing. And the people at the\u00a0Federalist\u00a0aren\u2019t the kind that the powers in Silicon Valley companies care about very much, even if they do take an occasional Jane Goodall-ish interest in conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Left will try to shut down the\u00a0Federalist, just as it has tried to cancel Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh. We expect that\u00a0National Review\u00a0will be targeted in the same way in turn. We have been sounding the alarm about the authoritarianism and illiberalism of the Left for years, and the current nadir is surprising even to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember this: If they can do it to the\u00a0Federalist, if they can do it to the\u00a0New York Times, if they can do it to the University of Chicago, they can do it to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Jos\u00e9\u00a0Spotlight: San Jose measure falls short of signatures as mayor says it may violate First Amendment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Adam F. Hutton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days after San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo questioned the constitutionality of a controversial ballot measure, elections officials announced Friday the initiative fell short of a threshold of signatures needed to qualify for the November ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than a year of intense public debate on the future of San Jose\u2019s local elections, Liccardo \u2013 during a program on public access television earlier this month \u2013 said the Fair Elections Initiative, proposed by the South Bay Labor Council, may violate the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiercely contested ballot measure would move mayoral and City Council elections to presidential election years and prohibit campaign contributions from some real estate developers, landlords and businesses with city contracts \u2013 and their lobbyists. Proponents of the measure say it will\u00a0increase voter turnout\u00a0and help stop\u00a0pay-to-play politics\u00a0in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Silicon Valley union leaders said they \u201care looking into their legal options,\u201d to overturn the Registrar\u2019s latest announcement that their petition fell 2,248 signatures short of the required 69,024\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, the mayor and his allies on the City Council have said they opposed the measure because they feared presidential elections would overshadow local races. Other opponents, including The Silicon Valley Organization \u2013 the local chamber of commerce \u2013 have said the measure unfairly restricts campaign contributions from business owners and lobbyists, but not unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myrtle Beach Sun News: Dark money? Ads attacking S.C. senator \u2018paid for\u2019 by organization that doesn\u2019t exist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Weissman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the days leading up to a runoff election for an Horry County state senate seat, local residents have been inundated by advertisements attacking the incumbent, Sen. Luke Rankin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the group claiming to pay for those ads doesn\u2019t exist, and no can say for sure who is actually funding the effort\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Crangle, the former executive director of Common Cause South Carolina, which advocates for transparency in campaign finance laws, said the state has a major issue with untraceable campaign donations because laws don\u2019t limit the amount political action committees can spend and don\u2019t require disclosure of donors to those committees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The \u201cdark money,\u201d which refers to political spending from an undisclosed source, is rampant in South Carolina, Crangle said, though it usually goes to help incumbent candidates, so the anti-Rankin spending is unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive disclosure of campaign contributions is important, Crangle argued, because it shows who is supporting which candidates, and that support can impact a legislator\u2019s actions in the General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If [challenger John] Gallman wins, then Rankin would be the second consecutive legislator serving as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to lose after a reported influx of dark money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleveland.com: Ohio GOP votes to censure former chairman over pro-Joe Biden super PAC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Seth A. Richardson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Republican Party central committee on Friday voted to censure former Chairman Matt Borges for a number of actions they deemed detrimental to the party, including his recent founding of a super PAC supporting former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the PAC, the party cited an FEC violation and Borges\u2019 continued criticism of Republican President Donald Trump as reasons to censure the former chairman and strip his \u201cchairman emeritus\u201d status. The resolution passed without opposition, demonstrating how the party apparatus once dominated by Borges and other allies of Republican Gov.

Threats made \u201crecklessly,\u201d without regard to whether or not the target will be scared, aren\u2019t enough\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 14 other States have enacted statutes that criminalize reckless threats, Kansas told the justices. \u201cThe law in each of these jurisdictions is now subject to attack based on the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the First Amendment.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of states, led by Virginia, filed an\u00a0amicus brief\u00a0urging the justices to take up the case\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Clarence Thomas, who\u00a0dissented\u00a0from the court\u2019s decision not to hear the latest case, noted that courts are split on whether such laws are permissible and said the court should have taken this opportunity to clarify the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His dissent Monday echoed his 2015 dissent that the court\u2019s decision to not the decide the question \u201cthrows everyone from appellate judges to everyday Facebook users into a state of uncertainty.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is\u00a0Kansas v.

McCalla heard closing arguments on Monday on proposed changes to the\u00a01978 Kendrick Consent Decree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City of Memphis attorneys say the consent decree is so outdated that Memphis police officers can\u2019t do their jobs effectively, and they say without changes, public safety will be harmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, McCalla ruled the Memphis Police Department violated the decree by using a fake Facebook account to spy on activists and put together a list of activists that would require police escorts to enter city hall\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, which filed the lawsuit that led to the 2018 ruling, and the City of Memphis have agreed to change several parts of the consent decree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, they have agreed to change the phrase \u201cpolitical intelligence\u201d to \u201cFirst Amendment-related intelligence\u201d to make the document less confusing\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sides also agreed to add language about social media and how MPD may still be able to use it, if they are not spying\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat the City of Memphis struggled with were the gray-area threats, threats that do not rise to the level of being a crime,\u201d said [Bruce McMullen, the city\u2019s former chief legal officer.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the decree made it more difficult to deal with other threats that surfaced online, like those surrounding protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe struggled with monitoring the internet in order to be prepared and ready when there are protests groups and counter-protest groups,\u201d McMullen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federalist: Marsha Blackburn Pushes DOJ To Examine Google\u2019s Power Over Free Speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tristan Justice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn penned a\u00a0letter\u00a0to Attorney General William Barr Monday urging the Department of Justice to conduct a thorough antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s monopolistic power over the internet after the tech giant\u2019s recent\u00a0attack\u00a0on The Federalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAs your antitrust investigation of Google intensified, I urge you to thoroughly scrutinize how the company\u2019s anticompetitive practices could lead to the crippling of journalistic freedom,\u201d Blackburn wrote. \u201cI also ask that your probe examine abuses in both the online advertising and online search markets, and to take enforcement action swiftly before further economic harm results.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackburn, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s Tech Task Force praised Barr\u2019s move to ramp up DOJ efforts to curb liability protections to the Silicon Valley tech giants provided in Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act in light of Google\u2019s most recent episode of selective censorship but pushed the Justice Department to do more. A Daily Caller\u00a0analysis\u00a0of the Justice Department\u2019s current probe into Google published Sunday shows that federal investigators appear to be ignoring bias claims in Google\u2019s search algorithms even as its search engine dominates roughly 90 percent of the entire internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey are not an infant business,\u201d Blackburn said, arguing they no longer need broad government protections. \u201cThey are some of the biggest corporations in this country, and they should not be given protections that other businesses or private citizens are not given.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: America\u2019s Jacobin Moment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By The Editorial Board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger at the killing of George Floyd has spurred useful reflection about race and perhaps some important police reform. But the political and cultural forces have transformed in recent weeks into something far less healthy-a ferocious campaign of political conformity sweeping across American artistic, educational, business and entertainment institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This coercive cultural turn threatens to devour what remains of America\u2019s civic comity and push durable social progress on race and politics out of reach\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe this as a Jacobin moment because it has the fervor and indiscriminate judgment of the revolutionary mind. The guillotine isn\u2019t in use, but the impulse is the same to destroy careers, livelihoods and reputations. The wave of resignations, firings, disavowals and forced apologies at institutions large and small is moving so fast it is difficult to keep track\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purges also reach into local schools and governments. A Vermont principal was removed after posting on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0\u201cI firmly believe that Black Lives Matter,\u201d but \u201cJust because I don\u2019t walk around with a BLM sign should not mean I am a racist.\u201d The mayor of the northern California town of Healdsburg resigned after doubting police reform was necessary in that community. She was excoriated and told local press that \u201cmy intention was to follow through with my term, but basically at what personal price?\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Turley: Vermont Principal Put On Leave For Not Agreeing With Black Lives Matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have yet another teacher suspended or put on leave for merely expressing her opinion of Black Lives Matter on her personal Facebook page.\u00a0 After Tiffany Riley wrote that she does not agree with the BLM, the Mount Ascutney School Board held an emergency meeting to declare that it is \u201cuniformly appalled\u201d by the exercise of free speech and\u00a0Superintendent David Baker\u00a0assured the public that they would be working on \u201cmutually agreed upon severance package.\u201d \u00a0The case magnifies concerns over the free speech rights of teachers on social media or in their private lives. As a public employee, Riley could seek judicial relief rather than a severance package under the First Amendment\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, I come to these issues from a free speech perspective. I am less concerned with the merits of the position than I am in the refusal to allow one side to be stated without punitive measures. I would take (and have taken) the same position if the view on BLM were reversed. \u00a0I fail to see what educators cannot express their views in favor of or against BLM in participating in one of the most important periods of debate in our history. The message to educators is that you must not criticize BLM in your private life if you want to keep your job.\u00a0\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: Trump administration designates 4 more Chinese media outlets as \u2018foreign missions\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sabrina Rodriguez&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration on Monday announced that it is designating four major Chinese state-run media outlets as \u201cforeign missions\u201d \u2013 the equivalent of an embassy, a move that is likely to worsen already-strained diplomatic relations and trigger retaliation from China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. operations of China Central Television, China News Service, the People\u2019s Daily and the Global Times will be considered \u201cforeign missions\u201d as they are \u201csubstantially owned or effectively controlled\u201d by the Chinese government, the\u00a0State Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The designation will require the outlets to send the State Department a full list of employees in the U.S. and their real estate holdings, similar to the rules for embassies and consulates. It could force some of the groups\u2019 journalists to leave the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe decision to designate these entities is not based on any content produced by these entities, nor does it place any restrictions on what the designated entities may publish in the United States. It simply recognizes them for what they are,\u201d State spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPR (All Things Considered): \u2018Facebook Groups Are Destroying America\u2019: Researcher On Misinformation Spread Online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:\u00a0Facebook groups are ripe targets for bad actors, for people who want to spread misleading, wrong or dangerous information. So warns Nina Jankowicz. She\u2019s the disinformation fellow at the Wilson Center. And in a recent opinion column in WIRED\u00a0magazine, she and a co-author write that the company\u2019s so-called pivot to privacy, Facebook\u2019s promise to protect sensitive user information, did little to combat the spread of misinformation. Instead, Facebook encouraged users to join its groups, which are private pages for users with similar interests. We want to note here that Facebook is among NPR\u2019s recent financial supporters. Nina Jankowicz is here with us now\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCCAMMON: So what changes does Facebook need to make?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JANKOWICZ: We think it\u2019s really important that Facebook show how groups are connected because often, one group moderator will control several groups that are sharing similar divisive or straight-up disinformation content. And users deserve to know that. And after a certain point, groups aren\u2019t really private spaces anymore if they have tens or hundreds of thousands of members. So we\u2019re suggesting that Facebook not allow groups to be private or secret over a certain threshold, say 5,000 members. So I think the bottom line is more transparency. I think the most important thing is to arm users with information so that they can navigate this information flow during these very confusing times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealClearPolitics: Big Tech Monopolies Are a Threat to First Amendment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By K.S. Bruce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current rules regulating free speech and the \u201cmonopoly social media\u201d (Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, Google/YouTube \u2014 together, the MOSM) are a mess, but the basic principles should be obvious. They should be treated as the new public square, and subject to First Amendment requirements\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOSM have become such a dominant location for political speech that they deserve to fall under the First Amendment, even though they are private companies. The Supreme Court has itself pointed the way under two key precedents: Packingham and Marsh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In [Marsh v. Alabama], a \u201ccompany town\u201d was not allowed to preclude free speech on its sidewalks. Justice Hugo Black wrote, \u201cWhen we balance the constitutional rights of owners of property against those of the people to enjoy freedom of press and religion, as we must here, we remain mindful of the fact that the latter occupy a preferred position.\u201d\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2017 case, Packingham v. North Carolina, the justices unanimously found that the MOSM have become the \u201ccompany town\u201d\u2026of our own day, as the court ruled that the State of North Carolina could not block registered sex offenders from the use of social media such as Facebook\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the MOSM act under these First Amendment standards, they should not create their own rules and rulings, but should follow the set of rules and rulings that already exist from over 200 years of law, jurisprudence and precedent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch: Google adds contextual fact-checking for some image search results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Taylor Hatmaker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the role that misleadingly edited or out-of-context images play in seeding the internet with misinformation,\u00a0Google\u00a0is introducing fact-checking labels for some Google image searches. The feature, available starting today, provides a few lines of context with select searches, drawing on services provided by third-party fact-checkers. The tool is powered by publishers themselves, who can now opt to tag images that have been fact-checked using\u00a0ClaimReview, a method for publishers to communicate to search engines that an image has been verified\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Google\u2019s announcement, the labels will pop up on \u201cresults that come from independent, authoritative sources\u201d that meet its standards. The company notes that the inclusion of fact-checking tags won\u2019t elevate those search results. While more fact-checking and additional context is always a good thing, the new image fact-checking tool only reinforces context from third-party sources already doing this fact-checking work rather than surfacing fact-checking on low-quality websites spreading misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R Street: Promoting Free Expression Online: What are the options?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual Event: June 23 at 2:00pm ET (RSVP\u00a0here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new Gallup/Knight poll finds that Americans want the internet to be an open forum for free expression-even as they grow increasingly concerned about the effects of some harmful content. As a public health crisis and civil unrest reshape the public conversation, what approaches are available to policymakers and industry stakeholders to both protect free expression online and protect the public from disinformation, hate speech and political manipulation? Do attitudes point the way to legislative action or to forbearance toward regulation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The R Street Institute will be joined by the Center for Democracy and Technology, Gallup, the German Marshall Fund and Knight Foundation for a briefing on this new study and to discuss the implications of the sometimes contradictory attitudes toward both Big Tech and the prospect that free speech might be further restricted by government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panelists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Godwin, The R Street Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Sands, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Llans\u00f3, Center for Democracy and Technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Kornbluh, The German Marshall Fund&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priscilla Standridge, Gallup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Biden campaign confirms he will attend three debates with Trump, criticizes the president for flipping on his debate stance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matt Viser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Biden\u2019s campaign on Monday committed to three scheduled debates with President Trump in September and October and criticized the president for taking varied positions on whether and how many debates he would participate in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign\u2019s letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, obtained by The Washington Post and written by Biden campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, stated that Biden will participate in the debates already planned by the commission, which would be on Sept. 29, Oct. 15, and Oct. 22\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe want fair debates. We want them sooner, and we want a bigger schedule,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said last week. \u201cWe also don\u2019t want them up against football games competing for viewers. As many Americans as possible need to see the stark differences between the accomplishments and leadership of President Trump and the failed record and sleepiness of Joe Biden.\u201d\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden\u2019s campaign firmly stated in the new letter that it wants the debates to be conducted as they have been traditionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo one should be fooled: the Trump campaign\u2019s new position is a debate distraction,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote. \u201cThe Trump position seems to be saying that he will debate if he can pick the moderators: clearly the President, who largely conducts interviews only with favorable news outlets, is afraid of facing questions from a neutral moderator. The Trump campaign proposal for elaborate negotiations is merely an effort to dodge fair, even-handed debates.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Republic: Scottsdale rejects ban on anonymous donations, including GoFundMe campaigns, to council members&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lorraine Longhi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a fairly simple effort to tweak Scottsdale\u2019s gift policy grew complicated as some residents and council members saw an opportunity to push\u00a0for campaign finance reform\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the council opted to do nothing at all.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal, which sought to specifically ban anonymous gifts to elected officials, was prompted by\u00a0a controversy earlier this year. Councilman Guy Phillips had broken his leg, and a city resident launched an online GoFundMe campaign to help cover his lost wages and pay medical bills\u2026\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Some] saw it as a potential way to filter anonymous online giving to elected officials, thus prompting the proposed ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillips accepted approximately $2,400&lt;strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;/strong&gt;in donations from GoFundMe\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city attorney, to eliminate [any] ambiguity, then proposed\u00a0an update\u00a0to Scottsdale\u2019s\u00a0ethics code to insert a prohibition on anonymous gifts to council members\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Some,] such as Phillips and Councilwoman Kathy Littlefield, said that the gift policy should be expanded to include campaign donations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 6/23 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

They simply argue the Governor has gone too far in his pursuit of that interest. </p><p>Based upon the record before it, the Court agrees,\u201d Van Tatenhove wrote in his\u00a024-page ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original lawsuit was filed by four Kentucky residents, in advance of a planned May 23 protest, and sought to challenge the state\u2019s restrictions on mass gatherings. In that ruling, Van Tatenhove\u00a0rejected\u00a0the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an injunction because Beshear said he would not enforce the order against the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case then proceeded to the Sixth Circuit, which found that the protest could be held as a \u201cdrive-in\u201d or \u201cdrive-through\u201d affair, but the panel did not rule regarding the legality of in-person protesting and the state\u2019s restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Circuit\u2019s\u00a0ruling\u00a0landed the case back in the lap of Van Tatenhove, who this time found the restrictions unconstitutional, a welcome ruling for the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer Christopher Wiest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cProtesting is a fundamental right, and as recent events have shown, a right in a free society to express dissent and affect change, whether it is protests about lockdown orders, for racial justice in policing, or even protesting the failure to keep a promise on unemployment,\u201d Wiest said in a statement to Courthouse News. \u201cFree speech and protests, like freedom of religion in church services, cannot be relegated to third class status in public health orders, even in a pandemic.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southern Illinoisan: Illinois attorney general\u2019s office says gathering restrictions regulate conduct, not speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Rebecca Anzel, Capitol News Illinois&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State regulation of the number of people allowed at gatherings does not violate Illinoisans\u2019 First Amendment rights, the attorney general\u2019s office argued in a court document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit filed on June 15 by the state\u2019s Republican Party alleged Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s executive order limiting gatherings to 10 residents or fewer was unconstitutional because it restricted the party\u2019s freedom of speech. It also contended the order treated religious institutions and protests differently than other groups, which breaches the U.S. Constitution\u2019s equal protections clause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor\u2019s May 29 executive order suggested houses of worship follow COVID-19 safety guidelines \u2013 limit indoor services to 10 people, for example \u2013 but did not require they do so. The GOP also pointed to Pritzker\u2019s attendance at a Black Lives Matter demonstration as evidence he was not enforcing his order against groups he supports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neither allegation is accurate, the state wrote in a document filed Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe 10-person limitation on gatherings is no different for First Amendment purposes than a building occupancy limit imposed by a municipal fire code,\u201d officials at the attorney general\u2019s office wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Constitution protects speech and the right to assemble, but allows governmental bodies with a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d to protect \u201cthe safety of the general public,\u201d according to the argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cPolitical rallies and conventions have always had to abide by occupancy limits, even though overflow crowds (or lack thereof) may signal strong support (or the reverse) for a particular message or messenger,\u201d the office continued. \u201cThe act of gathering in a confined space, which increases the risk of casualties in the event of a fire, is what is being regulated, not the message being delivered at the gathering.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey Law Journal: Third Circuit Finds Restrictions on Political Activity Violate Exacting Scrutiny Standard of Review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By William J. Palatucci and Steven H. Sholk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although restrictions on political campaign contributions are not subject to the highly demanding strict scrutiny standard of review, but the more deferential exacting or intermediate scrutiny standard of review, recent judicial decisions have shown that exacting or intermediate scrutiny is indeed a rigorous standard. In enacting legislation that restricts political campaign contributions, legislatures must not only ensure that the restriction promotes a sufficiently important government interest, but employs means closely drawn to protect that interest and thereby avoid unnecessary abridgment of First Amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In\u00a0Deon v. Barasch, 2020 WL 2781295 (3d Cir. May 29, 2020), the Third Circuit struck down the restrictions on political campaign contributions under Section 1513 of the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act. Section 1513 prohibited contributions to candidates for any public office in Pennsylvania, any political party or other political committee in Pennsylvania, or any group, committee, or association organized in support of a candidate, political party, or other political committee in Pennsylvania. The prohibition applied to applicants and holders of a broad array of gaming licenses, including slot machine licenses, manufacturer licenses, supplier licenses, and principal licenses. The prohibition also applied to affiliates, intermediaries, subsidiaries, and holding companies of these persons and entities, and their licensed principals and key employees.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOJ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN: FBI director says bureau is looking into possible foreign influence in Floyd protests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Devan Cole&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday that the bureau is looking into the \u201cprospect of\u00a0foreign influence or foreign interference\u201d\u00a0in the recent nationwide protests against police violence\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe have certainly seen in the past a variety of foreign adversaries looking to amplify controversy in this country and they use state media, they use social media, some of that is through propaganda, some of that is through disinformation, some that is through just fake information,\u201d Wray said in an interview with Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd we are looking carefully at the prospect of foreign influence or foreign interference in all the protest activities (that\u2019s) occurred over the last few weeks,\u201d he said\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe violence that occurred during the protest over the past few weeks is driven by a variety of different motivations and ideologies, it\u2019s not all the work of any single ideology movement or group,\u201d Wray said. \u201cWe certainly have a number of active ongoing investigations into violent anarchist extremists.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director added that some of the bureau\u2019s probes involve people who self-identify with\u00a0Antifa,\u00a0a far-left political organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federalist: Exclusive: New Bill Would Slash Protections For Tech Companies Censoring Free Speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Elle Reynolds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information obtained exclusively by The Federalist, Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) introduced a\u00a0bill\u00a0to amend the Communications Decency Act so tech companies that restrict constitutionally protected speech may not retain liability protections. Under Section 230 of the CDA, big tech companies are generally shielded from liability for unlawful content on their platforms (such as posts engaging in trafficking or terrorism).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Loeffler\u2019s Stopping Big Tech Censorship Act would allow internet users to challenge those protections if the platform censors users\u2019 free speech. It would also require tech companies to \u201cexplain the practices and procedures\u201d they use to censor content, and provide an explanation to users when their content is taken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFor too long, Big Tech has cloaked themselves in the protection of the First Amendment when convenient, while using their essentially monopolistic platforms to censor and suppress conservative speech,\u201d Loeffler said\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loeffler\u2019s bill follows a similar bill\u00a0proposed\u00a0by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Hawley\u2019s Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act, of which Loeffler is a co-sponsor, would only grant Section 230 immunity to tech companies that operate in \u201cgood faith\u201d toward speech on their platforms. Hawley\u2019s bill would also allow internet users to sue platforms that violate the \u201cgood faith\u201d standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: New research explores how conservative media misinformation may have intensified the severity of the pandemic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Christopher Ingraham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, three studies have focused on conservative media\u2019s role in fostering confusion about the seriousness of the coronavirus. Taken together, they paint a picture of a media ecosystem that amplifies misinformation, entertains conspiracy theories and discourages audiences from taking concrete steps to protect themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MarketWatch:\u00a0Watchdog says Washington\u2019s growing swampier, even as coronavirus lockdowns let Congress climb off \u2018hamster wheel of fundraising\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Victor Reklaitis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington has in fact become swampier in the past three and half years, according to a \u201cSpotlight on the Swamp\u201d report out this month from Issue One, a nonpartisan watchdog that aims to reduce the influence of big money in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report points to a rise in lobbying spending, a high number of ex-lobbyists in cabinet-level positions, donors getting ambassadorships and other trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the organization\u2019s executive director, Meredith McGehee, also takes a long view and says the Obama administration didn\u2019t do much in areas such as campaign finance reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the coronavirus crisis and nationwide protests shake up Washington, McGehee spoke with MarketWatch this week about the new report, as well as the November elections, the federal government\u2019s aid spending, racial inequalities and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Review: YouTube\u2019s Transgender Problem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kristen Waggoner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube claims to provide a space where people can share their experiences and ideas, but by suppressing content from an important national debate, YouTube (which is run by Google) violates its own claim. Rather than being a platform for all ideas, these companies suppress free and open debate by censoring ideas with which they disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is wholly at odds with the cherished principles of free speech.\u00a0Protecting dissent is a uniquely American tradition, and those \u201cunpopular\u201d views \u2013 such as the views of abolitionists prior to the Civil War \u2013 have often led our society to more just positions on crucial social and moral issues. When information giants like Google and YouTube suppress certain viewpoints \u2013 and silence personal stories \u2013 they crush the robust exchange of ideas that makes our society more just and that they claim to support\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are people to make informed decisions when only \u201ccorrect\u201d personal life stories and experiences are shared? A culture that embraces free-speech principles affords us the opportunity to listen, to think critically, and then civilly debate our ideas with those with whom we disagree. And we are all better for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewpoint discrimination is a threat to a healthy, diverse, and prosperous society. YouTube should help society express a diversity of viewpoints and ideas instead of suppressing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch: Facebook will show users a pop-up warning before they share an outdated story&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Taylor Hatmaker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook\u00a0announced Thursday that it would\u00a0introduce a notification screen\u00a0warning users if they try to share content that\u2019s more than 90 days old. They\u2019ll be given the choice to \u201cgo back\u201d or to click through if they\u2019d still like to share the story knowing that it isn\u2019t fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook acknowledged that old stories shared out of their original context play a role in spreading misinformation. The social media company said \u201cnews publishers in particular\u201d have expressed concern about old stories being recirculated as though they\u2019re breaking news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOver the past several months, our internal research found that the timeliness of an article is an important piece of context that helps people decide what to read, trust and share,\u201d Facebook Vice President of Feed and Stories John Hegeman wrote on the company\u2019s blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: Facebook Looks to Contain Advertising Boycott Over Hate Speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Suzanne Vranica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook executives in emails and calls with advertisers and ad agencies over the past week have conveyed that they are taking seriously the concerns of civil-rights groups about the proliferation of hate speech and misinformation on its platform. But they are also maintaining that business interests won\u2019t dictate their policies, according to people familiar with the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe do not make policy changes tied to revenue pressure,\u201d Carolyn Everson, vice president of Global Business Group at Facebook, said in an email to advertisers last weekend that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe set our policies based on principles rather than business interests.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook executives are also vowing to invest more to tackle hate on the platform including continuing the development of artificial-intelligence technology that can detect hate speech, according to the email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several advertisers . . . have said they would halt advertising on the platform. Their decisions came after\u00a0a call from civil-rights groups\u00a0including the Anti-Defamation League and NAACP last week to pull ad spending from Facebook for the month of July\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to advertisers Thursday, the Anti-Defamation League said Facebook has repeatedly refused to remove political ads that contained \u201cblatant lies,\u201d and has been slow to respond to calls to take down conspiratorial content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Verge: Lots of Politicians Hate Section 230 \u2013 But They Can\u2019t Agree on Why&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Adi Robertson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its face, conservative Section 230 proposals like the Justice Department\u2019s seem contradictory, demanding that web services aggressively remove content while\u00a0also\u00a0being afraid to crack down on users. By carving up Section 230 in general, they\u2019re weakening its power as a bargaining chip that companies must keep with \u201cunbiased\u201d moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the point isn\u2019t necessarily to construct solid internet law. This rhetoric is often a show of force aimed at threatening big companies like Facebook and Twitter, as well as a rallying point for politicians who want to score points against \u201cBig Tech,\u201d even when those points are\u00a0confusing and probably unconstitutional. Last week\u2019s proposals, for instance, both hinge on making companies follow their terms of service \u2013 documents that are written by the companies and can be changed at any time. The rules look toothless, but they amplify a popular narrative that social media sites are unfair, a perception these companies strive to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, many politicians haven\u2019t bothered to distinguish this strategy from earnest (if not necessarily positive) attempts to narrow Section 230\u2019s legal shield. And many plans have seemed too undercooked to take seriously \u2013 like\u00a0Hawley\u2019s idea\u00a0for a government-issued \u201cpolitical neutrality\u201d certification or Biden\u2019s\u00a0extremely vague\u00a0\u201crevoke 230\u201d platform.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: \u2018Culture Jamming\u2019: A Decades-Old Spoof of Consumerism Makes Its Way to the 2020 Campaign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ben Zimmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When President Trump took the stage last weekend at his rally in Tulsa, Okla., the crowd numbered only about 6,200 in the 19,000-seat BOK Center, according to local officials. The low turnout was declared a victory by thousands of teenagers who had spread the word via TikTok videos for people to register for tickets but not attend the rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, campaign officials dismissed the TikTok campaign and chalked up the depressed attendance to the presence of protesters outside the arena. But the small-scale demonstrations could hardly explain the disparity between the crowd size and advance ticket requests numbering more than a million as the Trump campaign\u00a0had boasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, Jillian York of the free-speech advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation\u00a0described\u00a0the massive TikTok prank as \u201cculture jamming,\u201d using an expression that has come to label an array of subversive tactics seeking to disrupt commercial and political messaging by repurposing the media channels that spread the messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 6/26 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

As one of the country\u2019s preeminent free speech litigators, Allen is a leading expert on how campaign finance law intersects with free speech. He is also a true gentleman. Allen\u2019s exceptional background and experience, along with his even-keeled temperament, will allow him to be a leader on the Commission for many years to come.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNLA President David Warrington spoke for RNLA leadership when he said: \u201cAllen is a brilliant legal mind committed to the rule of law and protecting the rights of all Americans to participate in the political process. In addition to his military service, this is another opportunity for Allen to serve his country in this important capacity. </p><p>He will be an extremely valuable addition to the Federal Election Commission.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Center for Responsive Politics: With FEC again defanged, Trump\u2019s latest nominee likely to face opposition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Karl Evers-Hillstrom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dickerson cheered the Supreme Court\u2019s\u00a02010\u00a0Citizens United v. FEC\u00a0decision that unleashed\u00a0nearly $1 billion\u00a0in dark money into federal elections over the last decade, arguing that the ruling greatly expanded Americans\u2019 freedom to speak on political issues. Since then, Dickerson has led the Institute for Free Speech\u2019s legal challenges against laws and regulations that would force politically active nonprofits to disclose their donors.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formerly the Center for Competitive Politics, the Institute for Free Speech opposed the\u00a0DISCLOSE Act, Democrats\u2019 attempt to crack down on dark money spending following the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling. Dickerson argued that the bill\u00a0chilled free speech rights\u00a0of nonprofits to advocate on political issues. Senate Republicans successfully blocked the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dickerson\u00a0supported reversing\u00a0a district court decision that\u00a0unsuccessfully attempted\u00a0to reveal donors to dark money groups. He\u00a0led a lawsuit\u00a0against California over its law that required nonprofits to disclose names of donors to the state. He also\u00a0supported a lawsuit\u00a0that challenged the legality of Alaska\u2019s relatively low contribution limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New from the Institute for Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus and Mass Protests Demonstrate Need to Proactively Protect First Amendment Rights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alec Greven&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These past few months have been especially challenging for many in the United States. The dangers of coronavirus and the widespread protests against police brutality have placed enormous stress on government leaders. These emergencies have given officials more latitude to infringe on the First Amendment rights of American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During times of emergency, the First Amendment is more important than ever. Government officials have a tendency during crises to overreact to potential dangers and limit more expression than they should. Additionally, emergencies can heighten social tensions and make society as a whole less tolerant of controversial ideas or statements that challenge the status quo. And as citizens naturally react to government policies and ongoing controversies during a crisis, it is imperative that our elected leaders are forward looking and resolve to protect free expression before an emergency occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason: Partisan Hypocrisy on Display in Supreme Court Ruling on Anti-Prostitution Pledge and the First Amendment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Elizabeth Nolan Brown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign groups that receive American funding to fight HIV and AIDS must still pledge to oppose sex work, following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of the requirement. A similar requirement for U.S. nonprofits was struck down as unconstitutional in 2013\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn short, plaintiffs\u2019 foreign affiliates are foreign organizations, and foreign organizations operating abroad have no First Amendment rights,\u201d wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the majority\u2019s opinion\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe last time this case came before us,\u201d writes Justice Breyer [in his dissenting opinion], \u201cwe held that the First Amendment forbids the Government from distorting their speech by requiring, as a condition of receiving federal funds, that they \u2018pledge allegiance\u2019 to a state-sponsored message. This time, the question is whether the American organizations enjoy that same constitutional protection against government-compelled distortion when they speak through clearly identified affiliates that have been incorporated overseas. The answer to that question, as I see it, is yes.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s easy to imagine the conservative justices in this case coming to the same conclusion as Breyer if the compelled speech were of a different variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans have (rightfully) objected to, for instance,\u00a0a California law compelling crisis pregnancy centers\u00a0that oppose abortion to display messages about where women could get an abortion. Would that suddenly be OK if the California centers themselves were excluded but any international anti-abortion groups they partnered with to help pregnant women in need were still compelled to advertise abortion services?\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: Hillicon Valley: Facebook takes down \u2018boogaloo\u2019 network after pressure | Election security measure pulled from Senate bill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chris Mills Rodrigo and Maggie Miller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRESSURE FROM SENATORS&lt;strong&gt;:\u00a0&lt;/strong&gt;Three Democratic senators on Tuesday urged Facebook to more aggressively purge white supremacist groups from its platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg, Sens.\u00a0Mark Warner\u00a0(D-Va.),\u00a0Mazie Hirono\u00a0(D-Hawaii) and\u00a0Bob Menendez\u00a0(D-N.J.) said the CEO has failed to enforce existing community standards that would remove racist and violent extremist content from Facebook\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, DON\u2019T SAY SOMETHING:\u00a0A measure that would require presidential campaigns to report attempts by foreign nationals to interfere in elections was removed from the Senate\u2019s bipartisan Intelligence Authorization Act, Sen.\u00a0Mark Warner\u00a0(D-Va.) said Tuesday.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clause was based on Warner\u2019s Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections (FIRE) Act, which requires presidential campaigns to report all contacts with foreign nationals seeking to interfere in the election process to both the FBI and the Federal Election Commission (FEC)\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about the legislation here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roll Call:\u00a0Effort to crack Big Tech\u2019s legal shield gains bipartisan momentum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Dean DeChiaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Republicans and Democrats have frequently criticized a landmark 1996 law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, that protects online companies from being sued for third-party content posted on their sites\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with one bipartisan bill, authored by Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., expected to win committee approval this week and another benefiting from the support of Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., changes to Section 230 seem more likely than ever\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham\u2019s bill, first introduced in March with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., seeks to crack down on the spread of child pornography and other illegal content online by revoking automatic Section 230 protections for online companies and requiring them to \u201cearn\u201d them back through content moderation\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Judiciary Committee is expected to advance the Graham bill at a markup on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thune\u2019s bill would take a different approach by allowing companies to keep their immunity under Section 230 but requiring them to post their content moderation practices online and explain what content is removed. It would also require them to be more responsive to user complaints and allow federal regulators and state governments more leeway when pursuing civil lawsuits against the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thune said the legislation is rooted in the concern that social media companies \u201care often not transparent and accountable enough to consumers,\u201d but he cautioned against a heavy-handed approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Social media companies should not act as censors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kathleen Parker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Censoring the president of the United States, even by a nongovernmental entity enforcing its own rules of civility, is fraught with potential for collateral damage. Hate or nefarious purposes once revealed in daylight are banished to the darkness where they fester and become more foul. Suppressing someone\u2019s thoughts, especially the president\u2019s, leads to a suppression of public debate. As Syracuse University\u2019s Roy S. Gutterman (and others before him) have\u00a0put it, the answer to hate speech is more speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn\u2019t the responsibility of social media companies to sanitize the village square, but does that mean they have no responsibility for content? Public opinion may be mixed, but pressures are mounting for companies to step up and clean up their communities. Advertisers, under the banner \u201cStop Hate for Profit,\u201d have begun\u00a0boycotting\u00a0Facebook because of its refusal to block the president\u2019s posts\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is speech but the expression of thoughts? And, how, exactly, should we purge people\u2019s unacceptable thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such is the quandary of a free society, and so my free thought is this: Let everybody talk, especially the president of the United States, so that we know exactly what they are thinking. Better that than to be unpleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: Facebook Bans Large Segment of Boogaloo Movement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Uberti and Rachel Levy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Facebook Inc.] said in\u00a0a blog post\u00a0it removed more than 300 Facebook and Instagram accounts and 106 groups tied to a boogaloo-affiliated network \u201cthat actively seeks to commit violence.\u201d The removals came alongside an additional takedown of 400 groups and 100 pages that hosted content broadly supportive of the boogaloo movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large segment \u201cis actively promoting violence against civilians, law enforcement and government officials and institutions,\u201d Facebook said in the blog post, adding that \u201cmembers of this network seek to recruit others within the broader boogaloo movement.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook removed the boogaloo accounts after a targeted investigation by human analysts, officials said\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those systems rely on \u201chashes,\u201d or digital fingerprints that identify extremist propaganda and artificial intelligence-based \u201cclassifiers\u201d trained to evaluate content like a human reviewer. They proved effective at minimizing jihadist groups such as Islamic State on the platform in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But human-led takedowns could be more important for far-right or white supremacist groups, company officials said. Such content tends to be more decentralized and often share hard-to-decipher content laced with irony and sarcasm, the company officials added\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook\u2019s move Tuesday doesn\u2019t ban boogaloo content altogether. The company said it sought to ban a wide-ranging boogaloo network that is nonetheless \u201cdistinct from the broader and loosely-affiliated boogaloo movement because it actively seeks to commit violence.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: Facebook to prioritize original reporting in feed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chris Mills Rodrigo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook announced Tuesday that it will begin prioritizing original reporting in its news feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog post, two senior employees\u00a0explained\u00a0that the platform will use artificial intelligence to determine which articles on a particular issue are most often cited as the original source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook will also demote content lacking transparent info about editorial staff of the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This change would theoretically decrease the reach of clickbait sites that just repost articles from other publications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday\u2019s blog post stressed that the changes will not dramatically change the feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe anticipate most news publishers won\u2019t see significant changes to their distribution in News Feed as a result of these updates,\u201d Campbell Brown, vice president of Global News Partnerships, and Jon Levin, product manager, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Reddit\u2019s C.E.O. on Why He Banned \u2018The_Donald\u2019 Subreddit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kevin Roose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Reddit \u2013 a site that for years was considered one of the internet\u2019s dirtiest sludge pits \u2013\u00a0barred more than 2,000 communities\u00a0as part of a broad crackdown on hate speech\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]fter the bans were announced, I interviewed [Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve] Huffman about the decision to take down The_Donald and many other subreddits. These are edited excerpts from our conversation\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question: A few years ago, you were asked about banning The_Donald specifically, and\u00a0you said, \u201cThere are arguments on both sides, but ultimately, my view is that their anger comes from feeling like they don\u2019t have a voice, so it won\u2019t solve anything if I take away their voice.\u201d What changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answer: So The_Donald is complex, and I think reducing that community or any large political group to one thing or one viewpoint is impossible. One aspect of The_Donald is that it\u2019s a very large political community that, at one point in time, represented the views of many Americans. Political speech is sacred in this country, and we applied that to Reddit as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, that community had rule-breaking content \u2013 content that was harassing or violence or bullying. And so our strategy has been to try to get that community to come in line with our content policies\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techdirt: Google Threatens To Defund Techdirt? Where Are All The Politicians Complaining?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Mike Masnick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, we received yet another notice from Google that some of the pages on Techdirt violated its AdSense policies (AdSense is Google\u2019s program for putting ads on 3rd party pages). We\u2019ll get to what those pages were and what the complaints were in a moment, but the timing struck us as ironic \u2014 as it came a day after we had written about\u00a0why Google sending a similar notice\u00a0to The Federalist was not some conspiracy of \u201canti-conservative bias\u201d to silence them. Yet, when it happened to the Federalist, a bunch of big name politicians and commentators went into overdrive attacking Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my question: where are they now defending Techdirt? Hmm? \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said the following list of stories could not have Google ads, and gave the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;\u2013Yes, Federal Agents Can Identify Anonymous Tor Users, Because Most People -Don\u2019t Know How To Be Anonymous\u00a0Reason: Dangerous or derogatory content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;\u2013Github Nukes Repository Over Use Of The Word \u2018Retard\u2019\u00a0Reason: Dangerous or derogatory content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;\u2013YouTube Takes Down Live Stream Over Copyright Claim\u2026Before Stream Even Starts\u00a0Reason: Dangerous or derogatory content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;\u2013The DOJ\u2019s Plan To \u2018Fix\u2019 The T-Mobile Merger Is Already A Hot Mess\u00a0Reason: Dangerous or derogatory content \u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I]f you look at some of those links, you can probably guess why Google decided it didn\u2019t want ads on those pages, and in other cases, it\u2019s not clear at all, and there\u2019s probably some weird comments in there. Google doesn\u2019t tell us, and it\u2019s too much of an effort to figure it out. But, when it happens to us, it doesn\u2019t become a huge story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Biden campaign assails Facebook for \u2018haggling\u2019 with Trump over his online posts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Craig Timberg and Isaac Stanley-Becker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign demanded in a\u00a0letter\u00a0to Facebook that the company prevent misuse of its platform by President Trump to spread \u201chateful content\u201d and misleading claims about mail-in voting ahead of the November election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter, obtained by The Washington Post and addressed to Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global affairs and communications, is the latest in a series of complaints from the campaign about how Facebook enforces its rules for politicians\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monday communication, signed by Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Biden\u2019s campaign manager, raised particular concern about revelations in a\u00a0Washington Post article\u00a0posted online Sunday about Facebook\u2019s history of reworking its policies to accommodate inflammatory rhetoric and false claims from Trump, dating to his time as a candidate in 2015. The story recounted efforts by Facebook executives to persuade Trump to tweak or delete a post last month about sending in the military to quell the protests in Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in police custody\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter also makes requests, including that Facebook remove previous Trump posts that claimed, without evidence, that voting by mail, which has been widespread in numerous states for years, is a source of electoral fraud.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily Caller: Joe Biden Announces He Will Not Hold Campaign Rallies, Citing Coronavirus Fears&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By William Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will not hold campaign rallies due to concerns over the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden announced the decision Tuesday, at his\u00a0first press conference\u00a0in 89 days, citing advice from his doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is the most unusual campaign, I think, in modern history,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna follow the doc\u2019s orders, not just for me, but for the country.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat means that I am not going to be holding rallies,\u201d Biden continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Republic: Democrats Can\u2019t Quit Their Addiction to Big-Money Donors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By J.C. Pan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s long been a tension between Democrats speaking about the need for campaign finance reform and doing whatever they think they need to do to win-like when Obama, who had long denounced super PACs, embraced his own allied super PACs in 2012. Yet in 2016, Bernie Sanders-then still a curiosity that Democrats expected to fizzle out-disavowed corporate contributions and super PAC money and built a small-dollar fundraising juggernaut so successful that by the 2020 primaries, almost every Democratic contender followed suit (at least initially) in committing not to accept lobbyist or corporate PAC money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats have been increasingly conscious about where their campaign money comes from, at least in public. Every Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, including Biden, pledged not to take large donations from fossil fuel executives, lobbyists, or PACs-though plenty of candidates did take money from people connected to those industries. High-minded promises have often eroded in the face of needing cash: Both Biden and Elizabeth Warren reversed their original positions on accepting money from super PACs as the primary heated up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there briefly seemed to be some interest among Democrats in unshackling campaigns from corporate contributions and other forms of big money, that sentiment has all but vanished in the lead-up to November\u2019s general election. The Biden campaign has amassed a number of super PAC contributions and donations from the wealthy, including $2 million from a recent fundraising Zoom call for big donors where \u201cthe minimum price to get on\u201d was $50,000, according to The New York Times, or a little less than the median household income in Michigan. (The wealthy are encouraged to give up to $620,600 to the \u201cBiden Victory Fund,\u201d a joint venture of the Biden campaign, the Democratic National Party, and state Democratic parties launched last month that is designed so donors can skirt normal donation limits.)\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press: St. Louis mayor blasted for revealing identity of protesters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jim Salter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson knows the trauma of violence \u2013 she and her children were present when her first husband was shot to death 25 years ago during an attempted carjacking. She was elected on a pledge to curb violence in her city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid that backdrop, it\u2019s not surprising that calls to \u201cdefund\u201d police don\u2019t sit well with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Krewson went a step further: She publicly revealed the names and addresses of anti-police protesters, a decision that drew extra criticism in the tense weeks following George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of a white Minneapolis officer who pressed his knee to Floyd\u2019s neck. More than 50,000 people have signed a petition calling for her resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Releasing the names and addresses was dangerous \u201cbecause you never know what someone else will do with that information,\u201d Aldermanic President Lewis Reed said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alderwoman Megan Green said Krewson\u2019s action was \u201cdesigned to intimidate and to quell dissent and to stop a movement that is happening not just locally\u201d but across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenwich Times: Police captain fired after \u2018signgate\u2019 files lawsuit against Greenwich, officials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ken Borsuk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former police Capt. Mark Kordick has filed a lawsuit against the town of Greenwich, First Selectman Fred Camillo, former First Selectman Peter Tesei and two others claiming that his rights were violated when he was fired earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice of the lawsuit was sent to the town Monday, and it was filed Tuesday in Superior Court in Stamford. In it, Kordick says his right to free speech was violated, that the town illegally removed political campaign signs he had put up as a registered voter and that the town retaliated against him for engaging in a protected right to engage in political speech while off-duty\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kordick, a 31-year veteran of the GPD, was terminated in late February. He had been placed on paid leave on Oct. 28 after he admitted to paying for anonymous political signs linking Camillo, who was then the Republican candidate running for first selectman, to President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signs made it seem that Camillo endorsed Trump or vice versa, and included a website address that seemed to be for Camillo but actually directed visitors to a pro-Trump website\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Camillo and Tesei, the lawsuit also names as defendants former Republican Town Committee Chair Richard DiPreta and Jack Kriskey, who ran Camillo\u2019s successful campaign for first selectman. Kordick alleges the four acted \u201cwith malice\u201d to retaliate against him for political speech critical of Camillo by revealing his identity, making a complaint to the police and involving the department in a political matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 7/1 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

President Trump announced he plans to nominate our longtime Legal Director to the Federal Election Commission, and he may be confirmed in late summer or fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a rare opportunity to develop and implement a long-term legal strategy directed toward the protection of Constitutional rights. You would work to create legal precedents clearing away a thicket of laws and regulations that suppress speech about government and candidates for political office, that threaten citizens\u2019 privacy if they speak or join groups, and that impose heavy burdens on organized political activity. The Legal Director will direct our litigation and legal advocacy, lead our in-house legal team, and manage and expand our network of volunteer attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong preference will be given to candidates who can work in our Washington, D.C. headquarters. </p><p>However, we will consider exceptionally strong candidates living and working virtually from anywhere in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[You can learn more about this role and apply for the position\u00a0here.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloomberg Law&lt;/strong&gt;: SCOTUS Curtails Government Power to Regulate Through Speech Restriction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bert W. Rein and Kevin G. Rupy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\u00a0Barr v. American Association of Political Consultants Inc.\u00a0could greatly limit the government\u2019s ability to use speech regulation as a regulatory tool. While the immediate impact of the decision is only to eliminate the government debt exception to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act\u2019s bar on using robocalls for debt collection purposes, its doctrinal underpinning may have far greater consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casper Star-Tribune&lt;/strong&gt;: Advocacy group sues state of Wyoming in effort to overturn political \u2018buffer zones\u2019 near polling places&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nick Reynolds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for the state\u2019s leading libertarian think tank are suing Secretary of State Ed Buchanan and several top Laramie County officials for a conservative advocacy organization\u2019s right to promote conservative candidates and causes inside of a \u201crestricted speech zone\u201d near polling places in Cheyenne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit \u2013 filed by the Wyoming Liberty Group against Buchanan, Laramie County District Attorney Leigh Ann Manlove and Laramie County Clerk Debra Lee in U.S. District Court on Friday \u2013 stems from a complaint by conservative activist John C. Frank, a former Colorado resident and a worker with the conservative organizing service Grassfire. Frank hopes to challenge the state over a provision in Wyoming law preventing people from contacting voters or exercising their political speech within 100 yards of a polling place\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While political buffer zones were initially intended to prevent electioneering or intimidation at polling places, attorneys for Frank argue that the size of Wyoming\u2019s buffer zones \u2013 100 yards for physical polling places, 100 feet for absentee polling places \u2013 provides a distinct disadvantage to political groups hoping to exercise their free speech and engage in the political process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washington Post&lt;/strong&gt;: Barr plans to mount a defiant defense of Trump in showdown with House Democrats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matt Zapotosky and Karoun Demirjian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney General William P. Barr will tell the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that President Trump has not inappropriately intervened in Justice Department business \u2013 even though Barr has more than once moved in criminal cases to help the president\u2019s allies \u2013 and he will defend the administration\u2019s response to civil unrest in the country, according to a copy of his opening statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barr, according to the statement, will take a defiant posture as he testifies before the panel for the first time since Democrats took control of it, alleging that they have attempted to \u201cdiscredit\u201d him since he vowed to investigate the 2016 FBI probe of possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, and the media has been unfair in covering unrest. He is expected to face critical questioning on his response to anti-police brutality protests across the nation, his controversial interventions in high-profile cases involving allies of Trump and many other matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Insider&lt;/strong&gt;: Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz asks the DOJ to launch a criminal investigation into Mark Zuckerberg, accusing the Facebook CEO of lying to Congress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sonam Sheth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz on Monday accused Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg of lying to Congress in 2018 and asked the Justice Department to investigate the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter\u00a0to Attorney General William Barr, Gaetz alleged that Zuckerberg made false statements to Congress about Facebook\u2019s content moderation during two hearings two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOn both occasions, members of Congress asked Mr. Zuckerberg about allegations that Facebook censored and suppressed content supportive of President Donald Trump and other conservatives,\u201d Gaetz wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn his responses, Mr. Zuckerberg repeatedly and categorically denied any bias against conservative speech, persons, policies, or politics,\u201d he added. \u201cMr. Zuckerberg also dismissed the suggestion that Facebook exercises any form of editorial manipulation.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his letter to Barr, Gaetz said that \u201crecent reports from Project Veritas, featuring whistleblowers who worked as Facebook\u2019s \u2018content moderators,\u2019 have shown ample evidence\u201d of Facebook\u2019s purported \u201cbias and manipulation\u201d against conservative speech\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida congressman added that Project Veritas\u2019 investigation also found that Facebook labeled \u201ca great deal of \u2018political speech\u2019 supporting the President\u201d as hate speech in violation of the company\u2019s policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washington Times&lt;/strong&gt;: National Guard major says excessive force, tear gas used in June 1 protest near White House&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Meier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. National Guard major is expected to testify before a House panel Tuesday that excessive force was used on protesters during a clearing operation led by the Park Police outside of the White House on June 1\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a written statement released ahead of the House Committee on Natural Resources hearing on \u201cUnanswered Questions About the U.S. Park Police\u2019s June 1 Attack on Peaceful Protestors at Lafayette Square,\u201d Maj. Adam DeMarco says the use of force involving tear gas and rubber bullets was \u201can unprovoked escalation and excessive use of force.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFrom my observation, those demonstrators \u2013 our fellow American citizens \u2013 were engaged in the peaceful expression of their First Amendment rights,\u201d Maj. DeMarco said in his written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/strong&gt;: Complaint Says Trump Campaign Payments Broke Rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Julie Bykowicz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump\u2019s re-election effort is alleged to have paid more than $170 million to companies affiliated with former campaign manager Brad Parscale without disclosing the ultimate recipients of the money, a campaign-finance oversight group says in a new complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Campaign Legal Center says in the complaint filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission that other records show the campaign has used an external firm to buy TV and radio advertising, but that company isn\u2019t named in disclosure filings, nor were some other vendors that have been publicly connected to the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington oversight group-which has sued Republicans and Democrats in the past over disclosure issues-said that violates the Federal Election Campaign Act requirement that campaigns clearly document their vendors\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also said campaign-relate salaries and expenses for Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., and Lara Trump, Eric Trump\u2019s wife, don\u2019t appear in FEC documents. Both women are working alongside the president\u2019s sons to help re-elect him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe can only speculate about what might be being hidden,\u201d Brendan Fischer, Campaign Legal Center\u2019s director of federal reform. He said it is important to have full disclosure to ensure the campaign isn\u2019t violating rules about overpaying relatives and sharing vendors with super PACs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;: The Latest, Fast-Moving Developments in the 2020 Election Season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Hans A. von Spakovsky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very interesting complaint has been filed with the Federal Election Commission, where I used to be a commissioner, as well as with the U.S. Department of Justice, which is responsible for prosecuting criminal violations of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Loomer is running for Congress in Florida against incumbent Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla. Loomer was banned from Twitter for supposedly violating Twitter\u2019s \u201chateful conduct policy\u201d for saying that Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., is \u201cpro-Sharia\u201d and \u201canti-Jewish.\u201d Yet Frankel has not been banned from Twitter and thus is able to use it for campaigning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loomer claims that Twitter is making a prohibited corporate contribution to Frankel by allowing one candidate to use its site but not the other candidate in the same race. She says that \u201cjust as a radio or television station may not sell time only to a candidate\u2019s opponent, Twitter may not do so either without providing equal access to all candidates running for the same office.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/strong&gt;: The Four Quadrants of Conformism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree and aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate system whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the left to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis runs from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The resulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in the upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively conventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively independent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m biased, I admit, but it seems to me that aggressively conventional-minded people are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the trouble in the world, and that a lot of the customs we\u2019ve evolved since the Enlightenment have been designed to protect the rest of us from them\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Because they have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, for example, it\u2019s not enough just to be right. You have to be right when everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can\u2019t do that\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customs protecting free inquiry have been weakened\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they don\u2019t want to shut down the discussion of all ideas, just the bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You\u2019d think it would be obvious just from that sentence what a dangerous game they\u2019re playing. But I\u2019ll spell it out. There are two reasons why we need to be able to discuss even \u201cbad\u201d ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/strong&gt;: There Is Nothing Conservative About What Trump Is Doing in Portland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Paul Rosenzweig and Arthur Rizer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How greatly have traditional conservative values of federalism and limited government been transformed. Today, a sitting Republican president invokes the power of the federal government to send militarized Department of Homeland Security agents (equipped with military-grade weapons, body armor, tear gas, and camouflage, like armed forces entering a war zone) to swarm American city streets under unwritten rules of engagement. If video evidence now circulating is to be credited, these agents are not merely protecting federal property; they have detained citizens who aren\u2019t violating any law and used the power of their presence to chill civil protests and disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a complete corruption of conservative ideals. There is nothing conservative about unconstitutional police activity, and there is nothing conservative about unilateral federal intervention in state affairs. Those are the acts of an authoritarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason (Volokh Conspiracy)&lt;/strong&gt;: The View from Inside Portland\u2019s Federal Courthouse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan H. Adler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most media coverage of the\u00a0protests and riots in Portland\u00a0(and other cities) is from the vantage point of those outside federal properties, in and among the protesters. Many of these reports characterize the protests as \u201cpeaceful\u201d or \u201clargely\u201d so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AP\u2019s Mike Balsamo has posted a\u00a0valuable twitter thread\u00a0on his experience inside the federal courthouse in Portland. From this vantage point, the protests are anything but peaceful. As Balsamo documents, the federal agents inside the courthouse have come under assault on a nightly basis. It is worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newsweek&lt;/strong&gt;: A Conservative Path Forward on Big Tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Brendan Carr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate will hold a hearing this week on\u00a0reforming\u00a0Section 230-a law that confers special protections on social media companies. And today, the Trump administration, citing concerns that large online platforms like Twitter and YouTube are censoring speech in ways that do not align with their public representations, will file a\u00a0petition\u00a0with the Federal Communications Commission asking the agency to clarify the scope of Section 230\u2019s protections\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Democrats, the path forward is clear. They want to\u00a0break up\u00a0Big Tech. They want a\u00a0moratorium\u00a0on mergers. And they want social media companies to censor even more online\u00a0speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Republicans, this debate is\u00a0about\u00a0our path forward\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with transparency\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or take accountability. When Big Tech represents that, for all of their content moderation practices, they do not engage in partisan, political takedowns, they should be held accountable for those representations\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third guidepost for reform should be user empowerment\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea is to let consumers turn off the bias filters. Right now, Facebook and Twitter bring in outside \u201cfact checkers\u201d (read: political actors) to provide their takes on your posts. Why not let the consumer decide? If you want MSNBC, Fox News or any other entity to filter your feed, click that box. If you want an unfiltered, Wild West timeline, choose that option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Techdirt&lt;/strong&gt;: The First Amendment Bars Regulating Political Neutrality, Even Via Section 230&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Berin Szoka&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of May, President Trump issued an\u00a0Executive Order\u00a0demanding action against social media sites for \u201ccensoring\u201d conservatives. His Department of Justice made a\u00a0more specific proposal\u00a0in mid-June. Clearly coordinating with the White House, Sen. Josh Hawley\u00a0introduced\u00a0a bill that same morning, making clear that his \u201cLimiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act\u201d is essentially the administration\u2019s bill \u2013 as called for in the May Executive Order. The administration is expected to make its next move next week: having NTIA (an executive agency controlled by Trump loyalists and advised by a former law professor intent on cracking down on tech companies) ask the FCC to make rules reinterpreting Section 230 to do essentially the same thing as the Hawley bill. These two approaches, both stemming from the Executive Order, are unconstitutional for essentially the same reasons: they would put a gun to the head of the largest social media websites, forcing them to give up editorial control over their services if they want to stay in business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment would not allow Congress to\u00a0directly\u00a0require websites to be politically \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d: the Supreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment protects the editorial discretion of websites no less than newspapers.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;: Fighting False News in Ukraine, Facebook Fact Checkers Tread a Blurry Line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Anton Troianovski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the complexity of policing online disinformation, consider the small Ukrainian fact-checking group StopFake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Facebook hired StopFake to help curb the flow of Russian propaganda and other false news across its platform in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;StopFake, like all of Facebook\u2019s outside fact checkers, signed\u00a0a pledge\u00a0to be nonpartisan and not to focus its checks \u201con any one side.\u201d But in recent weeks, StopFake has been battling accusations of ties to the Ukrainian far right and of bias in its fact-checking. The episode has raised thorny questions for Facebook over whom it allows to separate truth from lies \u2013 and who is considered a neutral fact checker in a country at war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salon&lt;/strong&gt;: Exclusive: Trump campaign kept paying Kayleigh McEnany after White House hiring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Roger Sollenberger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u00a0received $12,000 in payroll payments from the Trump campaign after\u00a0her official appointment to a position in the\u00a0Trump administration, as federal election filings examined by Salon show. That would be a clear ethical breach, and could indicate violations of the laws governing campaign finance and payments to political appointees\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe campaign\u00a0overpaid me, and I immediately paid them back,\u201d McEnany said, claiming that\u00a0\u201cevery penny has been paid back in the overlap.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf she really gave the money back so quickly in May, before the FEC report was filed in June, the campaign\u00a0probably never would have reported that payment in the first place,\u201d said Kedric Payne, general counsel and senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, in a phone interview.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut if she did pay\u00a0the campaign back, and they did report it like they\u2019re required to do, then that reimbursement should be\u00a0in the FEC filings,\u201d Payne continued.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt to explain where it is, or\u00a0show it later if there was some\u00a0filing mistake, but it\u2019s not clear from what\u00a0I\u00a0see\u00a0in the campaign\u2019s filings that there was any reimbursement received for these payments.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WYSO&lt;/strong&gt;: Lawmakers Set Sights On Dark Money Transparency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Andy Chow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers are introducing bills that require more transparency when it comes to dark money groups in political campaigns. The bills are in reaction to an alleged racketeering scheme involving a dark money organization and Speaker Larry Householder (R-Glenford).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bipartisan bill,\u00a0HB737, would create reporting requirements for entities that make political contributions.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Allison Russo (D-Upper Arlington) is co-sponsoring a similar bill, which would among other things require 501(c)(4)s to disclose their funders\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Gayle Manning (R-North Ridgeville) is co-sponsoring HB737 with Rep. Jessica Miranda (D-Forest Park)\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russo is co-sponsoring her transparency legislation with Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland). That measure has not yet been assigned a bill number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason (Volokh Conspiracy)&lt;/strong&gt;: May Judges \u201cParticipate in Marches, Demonstrations, Vigils, [and] Protests\u201d?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Eugene Volokh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Indiana Commission on Judicial Qualifications,\u00a0Indiana Judicial Ethics Advisory Opinion # 1-20, just posted on Westlaw; recall that Indiana judges, like the judges in most states, run in elections:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of recent events, a number of judicial officers have sought advice about whether, consistent with their ethical obligations under the Code of Judicial Conduct, they may attend and participate in marches, demonstrations, vigils, protests, and other public events aimed at addressing various social issues\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When judicial officers seek to speak out publicly by participating in demonstrations, vigils, protests, or marches, two countervailing interests are at play: the First Amendment rights of the judge versus the state\u2019s interest in preserving the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 7/28 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

President Trump announced he plans to nominate our longtime Legal Director to the Federal Election Commission, and he may be confirmed in late summer or fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a rare opportunity to develop and implement a long-term legal strategy directed toward the protection of Constitutional rights. You would work to create legal precedents clearing away a thicket of laws and regulations that suppress speech about government and candidates for political office, that threaten citizens\u2019 privacy if they speak or join groups, and that impose heavy burdens on organized political activity. </p><p>The Legal Director will direct our litigation and legal advocacy, lead our in-house legal team, and manage and expand our network of volunteer attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong preference will be given to candidates who can work in our Washington, D.C. headquarters. However, we will consider exceptionally strong candidates living and working virtually from anywhere in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[You can learn more about this role and apply for the position\u00a0here.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballotpedia: The Disclosure Digest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 9, Rep.\u00a0Jared Golden\u00a0(D), of Maine\u2019s second congressional district, introduced\u00a0HR7525\u00a0in the U.S. House of Representatives. The legislation proposes new donor disclosure requirements for 501(c)(4) nonprofits that make political expenditures in any amount. The bill also proposes capping a 501(c)(4)\u2019s political spending at 10 percent of its total annual expenditures\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\u00a0Institute for Free Speech\u00a0makes the following argument against expanded donor disclosure requirements: \u201c[Disclosure] laws \u2026 present significant First Amendment harms. If an individual\u2019s personal information is reported to the government and then published on the internet for all to see, they are less likely to contribute, particularly if the speech they are supporting is unpopular or controversial. \u2026Unfortunately, privacy from government disclosure laws for those engaged in issue speech is under attack. Politicians unhappy with that speech seek more and more disclosure rules that have little to do with fighting corruption.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New from the Institute for Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis: Judicial Ads Act Proposes Unprecedented Expansion of Speech Regulation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\u00a0Institute for Free Speech today published an analysis of the Judicial Ads Act (S.4183), a bill that would impose campaign finance regulations on speech about federal judicial nominations. The Institute\u2019s analysis finds that this is \u201cunprecedented and extraordinary\u201d and, if adopted, likely unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Judicial Ads Act brings campaign finance regulation to the judicial nomination process. Courts have never sanctioned such regulation of speech outside of elections,\u201d said Institute for Free Speech Senior Fellow Eric Wang, author of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Judicial Ads Act, any organization that spends over $50,000 in a calendar year on most forms of speech about judicial nominations will be forced to report to the Federal Election Commission. The group would be required to publicly identify any donor who gave $5,000 or more, even if the donations were made for other activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c[T]he sole goal of the Judicial Ads Act appears to be exposing the donors of groups supporting federal judicial nominees that the bill\u2019s sponsors oppose for the purpose of ginning up public disfavor. This is decidedly not a legitimate justification for campaign finance reporting requirements. Indeed, it is precisely why the Supreme Court and lower courts\u2026 have recognized that such laws infringe on core First Amendment rights,\u201d Wang\u2019s analysis explains\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Judicial Ads Act was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it has yet to receive a hearing.

So for example, they know that a particular person is planning to carry out some unlawful activity at a particular protest.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: Zuckerberg: Facebook has \u2018more to do\u2019 on fighting disinformation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Betsy Woodruff Swan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will concede to lawmakers that his company has more work to do in combating disinformation and voter suppression, according to his prepared opening statement for a blockbuster House hearing on the tech industry Wednesday\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICO reviewed the statement ahead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing in the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, which will also feature testimony from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe recognize that we have a responsibility to stop bad actors from interfering with or undermining these conversations through misinformation, attempted voter suppression, or speech that is hateful or incites violence,\u201d Zuckerberg\u2019s statement says. \u201cI understand the concerns people have in these areas, and we are working to address them. While we are making progress \u2013 for example, we have dramatically improved our ability to proactively find and remove harmful content and prevent election interference \u2013 I recognize that we have more to do.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: Republicans tear into panel\u2019s Democrats on eve of major tech hearing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Betsy Woodruff Swan, Cristiano Lima, and Leah Nylen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican staffers on the House Judiciary Committee are blasting the panel\u2019s management of\u00a0Wednesday\u2019s high-stakes hearing into the tech industry, according to a GOP memo obtained by POLITICO\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GOP staffers also call for making conservative allegations of ideological bias a major focus of the hearing, whose stated purpose is to examine complaints of antitrust abuses in the biggest U.S. tech companies\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And [the memo] lists GOP allegations of bias in Silicon Valley \u2013 charges the tech giants deny \u2013 as a top theme for the hearing, which Democrats had scheduled to home in on chargesof anticompetitive conduct by Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. Democrats, including Judiciary Chair\u00a0Jerry Nadler\u00a0of New York, have dismissed the bias allegations as baseless and politically driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cPolitical bias in big tech should be decried, but antitrust won\u2019t solve it,\u201d reads the heading of one section of the memo\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Judiciary\u2019s top Republican, Rep.\u00a0Jim Jordan\u00a0of Ohio]\u00a0made a last-minute plea for the committee to add Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to the hearing line-up. Republican lawmakers are eager to question Dorsey about the social media company\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s tweets. The company offered the committee a briefing instead of his testimony, according to a source familiar with the plans, who spoke anonymously to discuss private deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: Hawley introduces bill targeting behavioral advertising&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chris Mills Rodrigo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen.\u00a0Josh Hawley\u00a0(R-Mo.) introduced legislation Tuesday that would condition legal protections for online platforms that utilize\u00a0behavioral advertising, the\u00a0use of\u00a0browsing habits to\u00a0serve tailored ads to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\u00a0Behavioral Advertising Decisions Are Downgrading Services (BAD ADS) Act would take Section 230 protections away from the\u00a0biggest tech companies that use the advertising method\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation defines behavioral advertising as\u00a0targeting based on the personal traits of the user, past location info on the user, personal information from a profile about a user made to sell ads or the previous online or offline behavior of the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill differentiates behavioral from contextual advertising, which it defines as being based on the the content of the website, the current location of the user or the search terms applied to arrive at the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cBig Tech\u2019s manipulative advertising regime comes with a massive hidden price tag for consumers while providing almost no return to anyone but themselves,\u201d Hawley said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFrom privacy violations to harming children to suppression of speech, the ramifications are very real. These kinds of manipulative ads are not what Congress had in mind when passing Section 230, and now is the time to put a stop to this abuse.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cato: PACT Act Does More Harm than Good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Will Duffield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan, process oriented\u00a0\u201cPlatform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act\u201d joins a\u00a0recent parade of Section 230 reform proposals. Sponsored by Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI) and John Thune (R-SD), the\u00a0PACT Act\u00a0proposes a\u00a0collection of new requirements intended to optimize social media platforms\u2019 governance of user speech. These government mandated practices for handling both illegal speech and that which merely violates platform community standards would upset delicate, platform specific balances between free expression and safety. While more carefully constructed than competing proposals, with provisions actually tailored to the ends of accountability and transparency, the bill threatens to encumber platforms\u2019 moderation efforts while encouraging them to remove more lawful speech\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a\u00a0real danger that the bill may be treated as a\u00a0solution to perceived problems with Section 230 simply because it is less radical or more thoughtfully drafted than competing proposals for reform. The PACT Act may be better than other proposed modifications, but that doesn\u2019t make it, on net, an improvement on the status quo.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Wall of Moms, Black Lives Matter protesters sue Trump administration for use of tear gas, force in Portland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Marissa J. Lang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters who say they were tear-gassed, shot at, pepper-sprayed and assaulted outside a federal courthouse while peacefully demonstrating and rendering aid to others sued the Trump administration Monday over its use of force during nightly demonstrations in downtown Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of five women and two organizations, including longtime Black Lives Matter protesters and the\u00a0yellow-clad Wall of Moms group\u00a0that assembles nightly to stand between protesters and federal law enforcement officers, filed a lawsuit alleging that several agencies \u2013 the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Protective Service \u2013 have violated their constitutional rights of free speech, assembly and due process and against unreasonable seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason (Volokh Conspiracy): Harassing E-Mail to Sen. McConnell Can\u2019t Be Punished as \u201cSpeech Integral to Criminal Conduct\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Eugene Volokh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today\u2019s decision in\u00a0United States v. Weiss, Judge Charles Breyer (N.D. Cal.) dismissed a prosecution for sending harassing e-mails (in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C)) to Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s office. The judge concluded that the e-mails weren\u2019t punishable threats of violence (more on that in a later post); but the government\u2019s chief argument was that they were constitutionally unprotected because they were \u201cspeech integral to criminal conduct\u201d-the criminal conduct being the sending of harassing e-mails, in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C). Judge Weiss rejected that argument on the government\u2019s part, in my view correctly so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PennLive: Flag-burning activist sues Lewisburg, claims its burn law violates free speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By John Beauge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewisburg is now the second community sued this year by activist Gene Stilp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Middle Paxton Twp. resident has sued the borough in U.S. Middle District, claiming his free speech rights have been violated by being charged for burning flags\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His court complaint states he had notified Lewisburg in February he planned to hold a public protest involving the burning of flags and was advised he would be violating the borough\u2019s burn ordinance\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the reasons Stilp alleges the ordinance is constitutional is it violates his First Amendment right of free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also contends it is discriminatory because it allows open burnings by organizations dedicated to the public good but not for individuals like himself who want to publicly protest the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intercept: Rep. Lori Trahan Lied About Campaign Funds. The House Ethics Committee Cleared Her Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Matthew Cunningham-Cook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Rep. Lori] Trahan has little plausible deniability as to campaign finance law \u2013 she wrote it. She was chief of staff to former Rep. Marty Meehan, who was the lead Democratic sponsor of the McCain-Feingold Act in the House. \u201cAs a staffer, I was proud to work on the historic campaign finance reform legislation, Shays-Meehan,\u201d Trahan said in a 2019 release\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTrahan gave a number of conflicting and inconsistent responses\u201d to queries from the Boston Globe, said Brendan Fischer, federal reform director at the Campaign Legal Center, \u201cand ultimately it appeared it came from an account individually owned by her husband. The Office of Congressional Ethics recommended that the Ethics Committee find that Trahan did violate the law, but the Ethics Committee cleared Trahan. A big part of that is that the House Ethics Committee is made up of other members of Congress and there\u2019s often an aversion to members of Congress holding other members accountable for ethics violations.\u201d\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cCommon Cause sees this as a public disclosure issue that has to be done in real time for everyday Americans to evaluate somebody running for office,\u201d said [Beth Rotman, national director of Money in Politics and Ethics for Common Cause]. \u201cThe public lost here. To figure all of this out many months later is a loss for the public. In this case, delayed disclosure equated to nondisclosure.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s very challenging to have an in-house Ethics Committee do the investigation,\u201d Rotman continued, \u201cas they can absolutely bend over backwards to see themselves in the same shoes as the person they are evaluating. They all find the campaign finance laws burdensome. It\u2019s very difficult to ask the legislature to police itself when it comes to campaign finance. Watchdog agencies like the OCE are not burdened by subconscious awareness where they could see themselves making the same mistake.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FCC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forbes: Trump\u2019s Plans For More Social Media Regulation Move Forward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Emma Woollacott&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After calls from Donald Trump for reform of the way social media content is moderated, the US National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA)\u2026has take the first steps to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTIA has filed a formal\u00a0petition\u00a0to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), asking it to issue rules on when internet platforms are liable for user content posted on their sites\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The petition has been welcomed by FCC commissioner Brendan Carr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe federal government has provided virtually no guidance on how the unique and conditional set of legal privileges Congress conferred on social media companies should be interpreted today,\u201d he\u00a0says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Section 230 petition provides an opportunity to bring much-needed clarity to the statutory text. And it allows us to move forward in a way that will empower speakers to engage in \u2018a forum for a true diversity of political discourse,\u2019 as Congress envisioned when it passed Section 230.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many \u2013 including Carr\u2019s fellow commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel \u2013 have deep concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe First Amendment is not present to protect the president from media. It\u2019s present to protect media from the president,\u201d she\u00a0says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIn the United States we are a democratic, open society in which people can hold their government accountable, even if imperfectly. Whether we can keep it that way depends on the survival of a robust, independent digital space for activism and public discourse. These spaces only thrive if we say no to the President\u2019s invitation to make our networks less open and more closed to civic debate.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And some, such as campaign group TechFreedom, claim the aims of the petition are unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily Beast: America\u2019s Elections Are Becoming Contaminated With Untraceable Cash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lachlan Markay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political donations by non-disclosing groups-including LLCs\u2026and 501(c)(4) nonprofits, commonly referred to as \u201cdark money\u201d groups-have skyrocketed in recent years. During the 2018 election cycle, such groups provided roughly $178 million to federal political committees, according to data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2020, they\u2019re on track to far surpass that total. By the end of June, non-disclosing groups had donated $177 million to federal political committees, per CRP data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result, experts say, has been an erosion of fundamental rules governing American elections and the growing amounts of money spent to affect their outcomes.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThese dark money structures create opportunities for actors who want to undermine American Democracy,\u201d according to Sheila Krumholz, CRP\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe U.S. must be a leader on this issue, setting an incontrovertible example of functional democratic systems and oversight,\u201d Krumholz\u00a0told a congressional committee\u00a0last year. \u201cWe cannot ignore these weaknesses that have been allowed to creep into the funding of U.S. elections.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTransparency allows the public to assess who is behind the political ads they see from super PACs,\u201d according to a\u00a0new report on opaque political donors\u00a0from Issue One, a nonpartisan good government group. \u201cWhen super PACs simply list opaque shell companies or secretive dark money groups as contributors, the public is left in the dark about the true identity of the sources of the money being spent to influence elections.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Twitter penalizes Donald Trump Jr. for posting hydroxychloroquine misinformation amid coronavirus pandemic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By\u00a0Rachel Lerman, Katie Shepherd and Taylor Telford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter on Tuesday penalized Donald Trump Jr. for posting misinformation about hydroxychloroquine, the social media giant said, underlining the tough stance it has taken in policing misleading posts from high-profile users, including President Trump, in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter said that it ordered the president\u2019s son to delete the misleading tweet and that it would \u201climit some account functionality for 12 hours.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tweet, which featured a viral video showing a group of doctors making misleading and false claims about the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, was directly tweeted by Trump Jr.\u2019s account. That contrasts with his father, who retweeted multiple tweets from others showing clips of the same video to his 84.2 million followers Monday night\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter removed the videos, deleting several of the tweets that President Trump shared, and added a note to its trending topics warning about the potential risks of hydroxychloroquine use\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump Jr. spokesman Andy Surabian said the restriction was \u201cfurther proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: The moment of reckoning for the Facebook advertiser boycott&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Steven Overly and Laura Kayali&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The widely publicized advertiser boycott against Facebook has less than a week to show it has become a global coalition solid enough, and strong enough, to take on the social media giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Civil rights groups persuaded more than 1,100 companies and organizations from the U.S. to Germany to Australia to pull their money from the social network during July to pressure Facebook to take more action on hate speech and deceptive posts from politicians. But the month is almost over without Facebook meeting many of their demands. If the movement can\u2019t up the ante, it risks watching its work evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: Tech CEOs Deserve an Apology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Andy Kessler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t be Jack Dorsey. During 2018 testimony, the Twitter CEO swore up and down that the site didn\u2019t \u201cshadow ban,\u201d or stop certain users, mainly on the political right, from trending or showing up in searches. Twitter\u2019s algorithms, he claimed, were merely tracking \u201cbehavioral signals.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then-whoops-hackers last week accessed the accounts of Joe Biden, Elon Musk, Barack Obama and others, and released screenshots showing a \u201csecret admin panel.\u201d Twitter hasn\u2019t denied the images were real and quickly took them down. The panel has buttons for \u201cTrends Blacklist\u201d and \u201cSearch Blacklist\u201d-the definition of shadow banning. It makes Mr. Dorsey\u2019s denials sound fact-challenged at best. Maybe that\u2019s why he said he plans to work from Africa. So his fellow CEOs should stick with facts.

Mike DeWine wants state law to demand more transparency from \u201cdark money\u201d groups such as those at the center of Ohio\u2019s biggest-ever public corruption case, but he is uncertain how to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m for as much openness as possible,\u201d DeWine said. But, \u201cthe mere existence of these dark groups is not illegal today. \u2026 I would favor total transparency so the contributions that are given are fully disclosed.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Citizens United permits corporations and other groups to spend unlimited funds on elections and issue advocacy without disclosing sources of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeWine said he has asked his staffers to explore what Ohio might do to rein in dark money or require donations, such as those to Generation Now in the scandal involving House Speaker Larry Householder, to be disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat kind of legislation can we actually get through that would be constitutional?\u201d the governor asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe will do whatever we can to have more openness and we will come back with a recommendation to the General Assembly,\u201d DeWine said Tuesday during his coronavirus news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 7/29 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

This trend has only intensified in an era of internet and video communication brought forth by COVID-19. Social media, in particular, has been an incredible driving force for building coalitions and organizing people that share common interests. This has dramatically changed and improved the ability of Americans to associate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology, however, is a double-edged sword, and the ability to more openly communicate with others has also exposed large amounts of our private lives to scrutiny. Social media allows us to share more of ourselves with others but can open a window into aspects of our lives that we may not want to be public. This loss of privacy comes at a serious cost, and there is a danger of individuals who want to preserve their privacy self-silencing and refraining from exercising their First Amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want more speech and association in our society (and we should), then we need to focus on bringing down the costs for individuals who wish to speak out. </p><p>Protecting privacy while allowing individuals to speak is an important way we can lower the cost of speech and promote more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politico&lt;/strong&gt;: Senators say intel officials will give more details on 2020 election interference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Andrew Desiderio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. intelligence community is preparing to disclose more information to the public about foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election, top senators said Monday, as Democrats continue to push the Trump administration to detail Russia\u2019s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their assessments came after senior officials, including Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, briefed senators in a classified setting in the Capitol on Monday about foreign efforts to meddle in the campaign, in addition to other issues related to election security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion in both sessions Monday afternoon centered on how much information to share with the public, according to two sources familiar with the briefings. National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina, the nation\u2019s top counterintelligence official, was also in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reclaim The Net&lt;/strong&gt;: New bill aims to punish tech companies that censor \u201clawful speech\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Didi Rankovic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of Republican members of US Congress just proposed a new legislation \u2013 \u201cStop the Censorship Act of 2020\u201d aimed at stripping tech and social media giants of Section 230 protections \u2013 but only where they remove \u201clawful speech on their platform.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We obtained a copy of the bill for you\u00a0here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOnline platforms should not have special immunity to censor competition and lawful political speech,\u201d said Rep. Gosar. \u201cThe broad and undue immunity for content and user removal granted by Section 230 must be reined in by Congress. We cannot continue to subsidize, deputize, or blackmail Silicon Valley to decide what is or isn\u2019t an allowable conversation. Stop the Censorship Act of 2020 empowers users and limits Big Tech to the same rights and liabilities as everyone else.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFreedom of speech and market competition are two of the strongest pillars of American freedom. But \u2018Big Tech,\u2019 has shown little regard for either. Congress must protect the values that make America great.\u201d said Rep. Banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politico&lt;/strong&gt;: House panel launches probe into DHS intel office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Betsy Woodruff Swan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House Intelligence Committee has opened an investigation into the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s intelligence arm, according to a letter its chairman sent to top DHS officials on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probe will scrutinize how the department\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis has responded to protests against racism and police brutality in Portland and around the country. In the letter, the panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), cited reports that the office had disseminated intelligence about journalists and protesters\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schiff\u2019s letter also cited\u00a0a POLITICO article\u00a0from the weekend that reported that DHS\u2019s second-in-command, Ken Cuccinelli, limited the ability of department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to oversee I&amp;A;\u2019s work. That move came several months before the office\u2019s reports on journalists and protesters drew national criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schiff\u2019s letter asked for a host of documents, as well as transcribed interviews with a number of DHS officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;: Homeland Security Shuts Down \u2018Intelligence\u2019 Reports on Journalists&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Marc Tracy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acting secretary of homeland security said on Friday that he had shut down an intelligence examination of the work of reporters covering the government\u2019s response to protests in Portland, Ore., beginning an investigation into what he suggested was an infringement on First Amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s intelligence and analysis directorate \u2013 first revealed by\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0\u2013 in part targeted\u00a0The New York Times\u2019s release\u00a0of an intelligence analysis indicating that even as federal agents in camouflage deployed to quell the protests in Portland, the administration had little understanding of what it was facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acting secretary, Chad F. Wolf, \u201cis committed to ensuring that all D.H.S. personnel uphold the principles of professionalism, impartiality and respect for civil rights and civil liberties, particularly as it relates to the exercise of First Amendment rights,\u201d said Alexei Woltornist, the department\u2019s spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intelligence office issued three \u201copen-source intelligence reports\u201d in the past week that summarized the Twitter posts of a Times reporter and the editor in chief for the blog Lawfare, noting that they had published leaked unclassified documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wolf ordered the intelligence arm to \u201cimmediately discontinue collecting information involving members of the press\u201d once he found out about the practice, Mr. Woltornist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason (Volokh Conspiracy)&lt;/strong&gt;: No Claim Against Facebook Based on President\u2019s Social Media Executive Order&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Eugene Volokh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Report-Recommendation by Magistrate Judge Ther\u00e8se Wiley Dancks (N.D.N.Y.) in\u00a0Gomez v. Zuckenburg [sic]:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Plaintiff, Defendants are preventing him from logging into his old Facebook account or opening a new account. He asserts his difficulties with Facebook started after President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 139251\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff asserts his claim arises under EO 13925 for purposes of asserting subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given EO 13925\u2019s purpose and impact, the Court is unclear how it provides Plaintiff with a cause of action against Defendants. Even assuming Facebook removed his account without a \u201cgood faith\u201d reason to do so, EO 13925, at best, would provide a basis for a defamation plaintiff to argue Facebook is not entitled to protection under Section 230(c).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, EO 13925 was not intended to-and specifically precluded-a private right of action for individuals who assert an online platform targeted their accounts. To that end, EO 13925, Section 8(c) provides \u201c[t]his order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\u201d Thus, the Court finds EO 13925 does not provide a basis for Plaintiff\u2019s claim even if Defendants arbitrarily removed his account or prevented him from creating a new account\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly correct, especially since all the Executive Order can do with regard to the platforms\u2019 liability is to instruct government officials to ask the FCC to interpret \u00a7 230 in a particular way, which hasn\u2019t yet happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republican National Lawyers Association&lt;/strong&gt;: RNLA Thanks Caroline Hunter For Her Service On The Federal Election Commission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican National Lawyers Association (RNLA) thanks former Federal Election Commission (FEC) Commissioner Caroline Hunter for her years of public service on the FEC. Ms. Hunter resigned from the FEC earlier this month\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNLA President David Warrington praised Ms. Hunter: \u201cThroughout her service at the FEC, Caroline demonstrated her commitment to public service, to protecting the First Amendment rights of all Americans, and to ensuring due process and fair procedures for everyone who is regulated by the FEC. She refused to bow to political pressure, even when she was the sole voice standing up for the rule of law as the only Republican on the Commission.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two former FEC Chairmen who are members of the RNLA Board of Governors and who served with Ms. Hunter on the FEC agreed. Matt Petersen said: \u201cFor 11 years, I had the privilege of serving alongside Caroline at the FEC. Not only was Caroline an esteemed colleague, she was also a valued friend. As she departs the Commission, Caroline will leave behind a legacy of principled decision-making, keen judgment, and a commitment to the rule of law. Those characteristics will serve her well in the next chapter of her career, and I wish her all the best.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Goodman added: \u201cCaroline was a stalwart defender of the First Amendment for citizens and limited government. She served long and well and left a lasting imprint on the agency.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FCC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline&lt;/strong&gt;: White House Withdraws Nomination Of FCC Commissioner Michael O\u2019Rielly, Who Doubted Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order On Social Media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ted Johnson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House withdrew the nomination of Michael O\u2019Rielly to serve another term as commissioner at the\u00a0FCC, just days after he gave a speech in which he signaled his opposition to President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s executive order to try to limit liability protections for social media companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O\u2019Rielly, a Republican who joined the commission in 2013, was facing Senate confirmation for another term that would have extended through 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House did not give a reason for the withdrawal of the nomination, and it was unclear if it was related to O\u2019Rielly\u2019s comments on Trump\u2019s social media order\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, O\u2019Rielly addressed in a speech he gave to the Media Institute in which he criticized the effort to target the social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe First Amendment protects us from limits on speech imposed by the government-not private actors-and we should all reject demands, in the name of the First Amendment, for private actors to curate or publish speech in a certain way,\u201d he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cLike it or not, the First Amendment\u2019s protections apply to corporate entities, especially when they engage in editorial decision making. I shudder to think of a day in which the Fairness Doctrine could be reincarnated for the Internet, especially at the ironic behest of so-called free speech \u2018defenders.'\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/strong&gt;: Ajit Pai calls for \u201cvigorous debate\u201d on Trump\u2019s social media crackdown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jon Brodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission today asked the public for responses to the Trump administration\u2019s\u00a0attempt to punish social media websites\u00a0for alleged anti-conservative bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cLongstanding rules require the agency to put such petitions out for public comment \u2018promptly,\u2019 and we will follow that requirement here,\u201d FCC Chairman Ajit Pai\u00a0said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump issued an\u00a0executive order\u00a0in May, instructing the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to petition the FCC for a new interpretation of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that would limit social media platforms\u2019 legal protections for hosting third-party content when the platforms take down content they consider objectionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTIA\u00a0filed that petition\u00a0last week, asking the FCC to define \u201cinformation content provider\u201d more broadly to include entities that make \u201ceditorial decisions that modify or alter content.\u201d Under that interpretation, websites like Facebook and Twitter would be treated as the publisher or speaker of information posted by their users, and they would lose the legal protections Section 230 provides when websites block and screen offensive material. Lawyers who work at several advocacy groups\u00a0say\u00a0that the FCC doesn\u2019t have this authority, that the Trump petition \u201cis\u00a0utterly incompatible with the plain language\u201d of Section 230, and that the petition\u2019s proposal would violate the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC\u2019s\u00a0public notice\u00a0asking for comments says that \u201cInterested persons may file statements opposing or supporting the Petition for Rulemaking.\u201d The deadline for initial statements is 30 days from today, and another 15 days will be provided for replies. The docket is\u00a0available here\u00a0(click \u201cNew Filing\u201d or \u201cExpress\u201d to file a comment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washington Post&lt;/strong&gt;: Two protesters arrested while chalking \u2018Black Pre-Born Lives Matter\u2019 on sidewalk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Emily Davies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two protesters outside a Planned Parenthood facility were arrested and charged with defacing public or private property early Saturday, according to D.C. police and video footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Caporaletti, a 22-year-old student at Towson University, and Warner DePriest, a 29-year-old D.C. resident, were writing \u201cBlack Pre-Born Lives Matter\u201d with chalk on the sidewalk when police arrested them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrests happened just before 6 a.m., soon after a group of about two dozen people, led by the antiabortion advocacy group Students for Life of America, showed up to paint in the street of the 1200 block of Fourth Street NE as part of what they called a campaign to highlight the impact of abortion on Black communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tina Whittington, executive vice president of Students for Life of America, said police first warned that they would detain the group if they painted the street and then told them they could not write on the sidewalk with chalk\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is government censorship,\u201d Caporaletti said through a bullhorn\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Students for Life of America said they plan to sue D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) on the grounds that the police action violated their First Amendment rights\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrest provides a window into ongoing controversy surrounding the painting of slogans on streets. Ever since Bowser\u00a0commissioned the painting of \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d\u00a0on 16th Street NW near the White House in June, activists across the country have demanded the right to paint their own messages. City officials have conceded in some cases, allowing protesters in the District, for example, to\u00a0paint \u201cDefund the police\u201d\u00a0next to Bowser\u2019s original declaration.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politico&lt;/strong&gt;: Silicon Valley is losing the battle against election misinformation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Mark Scott and Steven Overly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years after an election in which Russia and some far-right groups unleashed a wave of false, misleading and divisive online messages, Silicon Valley is losing the battle to eliminate online misinformation that could sway the vote in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media companies are struggling with an onslaught of deceptive and divisive messaging from political parties, foreign governments and hate groups as the months tick down to this year\u2019s presidential election, according to more than two dozen national security policymakers, misinformation experts, hate speech researchers, fact-checking groups and tech executives, as well as a review of thousands of social media posts by POLITICO\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to contain the new forms of fakery have so far fallen short, researchers and some lawmakers say. And the challenges are only increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNovember is going to be like the Super Bowl of misinformation tactics,\u201d said Graham Brookie, director of the D.C.-based Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensics Lab, which tracks online falsehoods. \u201cYou name it, the U.S. election is going to have it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger at the social media giants\u2019 inability to win the game of Whac-A-Mole against false information was a recurring theme at last week\u2019s congressional hearing with big tech CEOs, where Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg attempted to bat down complaints that his company is profiting from disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salon&lt;/strong&gt;: Trump suggests Microsoft should pay Treasury big money amid talks to acquire TikTok\u2019s business in US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matthew Rozsa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American technology company Microsoft confirmed Sunday that it is in discussions to purchase the Chinese social media app TikTok. The news came days after President Donald Trump\u00a0threatened\u00a0to ban the popular video-sharing company from operating in the U.S\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salon reached out to\u00a0Kurt Opsahl, the deputy executive director and general counsel of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, about the legal implications of a potential ban of\u00a0TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cBanning Americans from using the TikTok app would infringe the First Amendment rights of those users\u00a0as an overly broad restriction on a means of expression (and on reaching the TikTok audience) unnecessary to achieve the government\u2019s national security purpose,\u201d Opsahl said by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prohibiting the app in stores would violate the\u00a0First Amendment right to distribute software, Opsahl added, since courts have argued that software is a form of speech. He pointed out that \u201cif the Trump administration\u2019s motives were based on anti-Trump content, this is obviously not a legitimate government purpose. Courts would not balance the ban against that purpose. If censoring political speech was shown to be the true purpose, courts would subject the ban to closer constitutional scrutiny, which the ban would not survive.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to Salon at the time of Pompeo\u2019s comments, Leonard M. Niehoff, a professor from practice at the University of Michigan Law School who specializes in the First Amendment, explained that there were constitutional concerns about a potential ban amid Trump\u2019s pattern of retaliation against social media companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOne of the primary concerns is that this is part of a pattern of retaliation against social media platforms that the president does not like, either because of how the platform has treated his speech or because of how users have deployed the platform against him,\u201d Niehoff told Salon.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politico&lt;/strong&gt;: Google announces steps to counter spread of hacked materials before election&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Leah Nylen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google will penalize websites that distribute hacked materials and advertisers who take part in coordinated misinformation campaigns, the search and advertising giant announced Friday in an effort to crack down on deception in the months ahead of the November U.S. elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes will go into effect on Sept. 1 and will affect all advertising\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had the policies been in place in 2016, advertisers wouldn\u2019t have been able to include screenshots of e-mails from the massive, Russian-sponsored hacks of the Democratic Party and then-presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Publishers who accept Google advertising also can\u2019t\u00a0directly distribute hacked materials, though links to places like Wikileaks or\u00a0BlueLeaks\u00a0\u2013 a collection of information leaked from police departments \u2013 would be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy still allows ads that mention or quote from leaked documents, but seeks to prevent ones that directly facilitate or advertise access to illegally obtained materials\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cToday we are expanding our policies to prevent the coordinated spread of disinformation from domestic actors who conceal their identity and illegally obtained materials via ads,\u201d Google spokesperson Charlotte Smith said. \u201cWe believe these new measures strike the right balance in helping preserve trust in our elections while allowing for robust dialogue and public discourse about current events.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michigan Capitol Confidential&lt;/strong&gt;: Big Power Company Looks To Be Pursuing Best Legislature Money Can Buy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Zeiser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who live in Michigan\u2019s 58th House of Representatives district have almost certainly seen social media ads for Republican state representative candidate Andrew Fink, sponsored by a lobbying group called Citizens for Energizing Michigan\u2019s Economy, or CEME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group, which is\u00a0funded by the energy industry, is also flooding the district with mailers, [TV commercials, and internet ads.] \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ads make no mention that Fink is running for office. Instead, they ask people to call their representatives and tell them to support Fink\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d to defend Michigan\u2019s Christian conservative values. The plan is not explained in the ads, nor on a CEME website about Fink, despite the fact that at least one of the ads encourages readers to visit the site to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEME is what is sometimes called a \u201cdark money\u201d organization. Established under section 501(c)(4) of the federal government\u2019s Internal Revenue Code, such groups are allowed to receive unlimited donations from corporations and individuals in order to fulfill a mission of \u201csocial welfare.\u201d These organizations are distinct from political campaigns which have strict limits on how much money they can receive from donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, these groups are only required to disclose very limited information about their donors, which is how those that do not make disclosures earned the \u201cdark money\u201d sobriquet. They are also allowed to spend unlimited money on lobbying, provided that they do so in support of their social welfare mission. That is why the ads about Fink mention a \u201cplan,\u201d but never say what he is running for, or even that he is a candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toledo Blade&lt;/strong&gt;: LaRose seeks to shine light on \u2018dark money\u2019 entities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jim Provance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money spent to influence elections or policy in Ohio would have to be publicly disclosed \u2013 regardless of the entity\u2019s source or tax status \u2013 under a bill pushed by Secretary of State Frank LaRose in the wake of the largest public bribery scandal in state history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal unveiled Monday would also require the registration with the state of individuals or firms hired to block petitioners from gathering signatures.\u00a0The secretary of state would have subpoena power to go after such entities\u2019 financial records too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe don\u2019t do our jobs anonymously,\u201d said Mr. LaRose, Ohio\u2019s top elections official. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to spend your money, then you should own it. You should put your name on it. You should be proud of it. Otherwise, why are you doing it?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reps. Gayle Manning (R., North Ridgeville) and Jessica Miranda (D., Forest Park) have already introduced House Bill 737, one of multiple proposals unveiled since now former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder (R., Glenford) and four other allies were charged in an alleged $61 million racketeering scheme\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTo us your tax status is irrelevant,\u201d Mr. LaRose said.\u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019re spending money in Ohio to influence the political life of our state, you need to disclose the original source of your funds.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. LaRose met with the bill\u2019s sponsors on Monday to expand its scope to take advantage of any momentum from the current scandal\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade state lawmakers have used a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that equated corporate money with protected political speech as an excuse not to force disclosure.\u00a0But Mr. LaRose argues nothing in that decision blocked states from requiring transparency of such activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Techdirt&lt;/strong&gt;:\u00a0Tennessee Court Strikes Down Law Criminalizing Calling Political Candidates \u2018Literally Hitler\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tim Cushing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free speech keeps getting freer in Tennessee. The state was once home to a host of\u00a0vexatious defamation lawsuits\u00a0\u2014 including one where someone subjected to mild criticism\u00a0sued a journalist\u00a0over things\u00a0someone else\u00a0said. Thanks to the state\u2019s new\u00a0anti-SLAPP law, litigation is slightly less vexatious these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are still state laws posing threats to free speech by criminalizing stuff the First Amendment says is perfectly acceptable.\u00a0Tennesseans for Sensible Election Laws\u00a0(represented by Daniel Horwitz,\u00a0whose work\u00a0has made\u00a0multiple headlines\u00a0here at Techdirt) sued the state over a campaign law that made it a misdemeanor to publish false information about candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statute says this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"&gt;It is a Class C misdemeanor for any person to publish or distribute or cause to be published or distributed any campaign literature in opposition to any candidate in any election if such person knows that any such statement, charge, allegation, or other matter contained therein with respect to such candidate is false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs argued the law effectively criminalized satire and hyperbole.

In vogue on the right and left is rewriting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which empowers social-media companies to scrub objectionable content and shields them from liability for what users say on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump and allies are eager to rewrite this standard to punish online platforms that have applied selective treatment to mainstream political views. The White House earlier this year issued an executive order on \u201cPreventing Online Censorship\u201d that, among other things, calls for the Commerce Secretary to petition the FCC to regulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. O\u2019Rielly said in a June C-SPAN interview that he was talking to experts but had \u201cdeep reservations\u201d that Congress intended the FCC to have such authority. This modesty is unusual for a regulator, and conservatives are supposed to respect the limits of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 29 remarks to the Media Institute, Mr. O\u2019Rielly pressed a broader First Amendment case\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The episode is a warning that the left isn\u2019t the only movement that demands ideological conformity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treasury Department&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIRE: The President asking the Treasury Department to investigate a college\u2019s tax-exempt status is asking for trouble&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tyler Coward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 10, President Donald Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that he was directing the Treasury Department to scrutinize the tax-exempt status of universities for \u201cRadical Left Indoctrination, not Education.\u201d Colin Wilhelm, a reporter for Bloomberg Tax,\u00a0recently tweeted\u00a0that the Treasury Department is beginning the process of reviewing \u201cthe generally applicable regulations and guidance implicated by the President\u2019s comment.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he department should make explicit that a faculty member\u2019s pedagogical approach or curricular choices in accord with constitutional rights and the principles of academic freedom will not be the basis for any investigation or revocation of an institution\u2019s tax-exempt status. Even more significantly, Treasury should affirm that faculty research, publication, and extramural expression will remain fully protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, universities may come under tremendous pressure to regulate faculty speech, posing a grave threat to academic freedom. Such an outcome would be at odds with the First Amendment as well as with the administration\u2019s stated policy to\u00a0promote free speech and open inquiry\u00a0at institutions of higher education\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t so long ago that the Treasury Department and the IRS were embroiled in a controversy subjecting\u00a0conservative educational nonprofit organizations\u00a0to \u201cheightened scrutiny and inordinate delays\u201d based on these organizations\u2019 names or perceived conservative viewpoints\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the President\u2019s tweet singling out \u201cRadical Left Indoctrination\u201d invites accusations of a viewpoint-discriminatory basis for any investigation, as it explicitly targets only indoctrination that comes from the President\u2019s political adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIRO 7 News: Protesters sue Seattle, claim they need \u2018expensive\u2019 protective gear to safely protest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Michael Spears&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit filed\u00a0Monday against the city of Seattle\u00a0argues protesters\u2019 constitutional rights have been violated by the police department\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate\u201d use of chemical and less-lethal crowd control tactics, which have forced demonstrators to buy \u201cexpensive\u201d protective gear in order to safely bring their message against police brutality to the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cBecause the Seattle Police Department has acted above and outside the law in dispensing its unbridled force, and the City has failed to prevent same, the government effect is to establish a de facto protest tax,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cIndividual protesters subjected to SPD\u2019s unabated and indiscriminate violence now must purchase cost-prohibitive gear to withstand munitions \u2013 even when peacefully protesting \u2013 as a condition to exercising their right to free speech and peaceable assembly.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed on behalf of five protesters who attended the July 25 protest on Capitol Hill\u00a0that police later declared a riot, seeks an order from a judge to stop the city from using controversial crowd control tactics on protesters, including blast balls and pepper spray\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut the continued misuse of war munitions by SPD against civilians turns the streets \u2013 a public forum and site of protest \u2013 into a pay-to-protest racket where only a privileged few who are wealthy enough or popular enough to crowdsource funds to purchase gear akin to that used by the police department they fund can truly be in the streets,\u201d the lawsuit claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason: What\u2019s the Best Way To Protect Free Speech? Ken White and Greg Lukianoff Debate Cancel Culture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ken White and Greg Lukianoff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as debates over cancel culture have swept the nation, free speech defenders have disagreed about what, exactly, cancel culture is, and what it means for freedom of speech. In many ways, these disagreements represent differences of opinion about how best to protect and uphold true freedom of speech.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what better way to deal with questions about free speech than with a debate? Ken White is an attorney, a co-host of\u00a0All the President\u2019s Lawyers, and a frequent commenter on issues of speech and law. Greg Lukianoff is\u00a0the president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a nonprofit whose mission is to \u201cdefend and sustain the individual rights of students and faculty members at America\u2019s colleges and universities.\u201d In the following exchange, the pair debate the resolution:\u00a0Free speech law is the best defense against cancel culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC News: \u2018Cancel culture\u2019 censorship can be most dangerous for those who promote social justice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Suzanne Nossel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As social movements gain momentum\u2026their supporters should recognize that the free speech rights that make possible their progress should form a part of what they are fighting for. Instead, in some instances, we see the opposite: an attempt to silence those who question or buck the cause through demands for institutional punishments directed at speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign for a more just and equitable society is vital. Those who campaign against offending speech are themselves exercising their free speech rights; a noxious opinion revealing racism or misogyny deserves a scathing rebuke. But when citizen-led campaigns cross over into demanding official retribution for offending speech, they can yield unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflexive demands to punish errant speech discourage people from engaging in the kinds of dissent and deliberation that keep a society dynamic and prevent rigid orthodoxies from hardening. Even more dangerously, demands for such reprisals reinforce the notion that society\u2019s powerful institutions should act as gatekeepers defining the bounds of acceptable ideas and discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s risky to assume that institutional authorities can be empowered to suppress the expression of odious views on issues such as race and gender, without that license someday being used to stamp out the views of those advocating social justice, challenging officialdom or demanding reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the very premise of free speech protections is that without them \u2013 if authorities are at liberty to punish expression \u2013 they will, on balance, deploy that prerogative self-servingly to suppress critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: Is antifa the greatest movement against free speech in America?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Turley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fact is that antifa works to strike fear\u2026in the heart of anyone who will oppose the movement. The antifa handbook states how the group has rejected the idea of free speech and has spent years organizing protests to prevent opposing views from getting heard. That practice has been adopted by other groups as well. Antifa violence can give colleges or politicians cover for barring conservative speakers\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silence hurts free speech. Antifa knows that. It is the silence of professors who watch as their colleagues are harassed, investigated, or threatened. It is the silence of students who watch as others are attacked for dissenting ideas. It is the silence of reporters who watch as other journalists are fired or forcibly retired for challenging orthodox views. Finally, it is the silence of those politicians who dismiss the destruction of property as a case, in the words of Pelosi, that \u201cpeople will do what people will do.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antifa will do a great deal of damage if allowed. It is why, for academics and writers, its existence is frightening. As Virgil explained, Keyser Soze became the \u201cspook story that criminals tell their kids at night.\u201d Antifa has achieved the agenda against free speech to a degree that even critics like me never imagined possible. It simply took inaction from our government and silence from our citizens. Threats against free speech are reaching a critical mass in our schools and on our streets. We can either take action or remain passive bystanders to what inevitably comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Review: Americans Think \u2018Fake News\u2019 Is More Prevalent Than Ever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tobias Hoonhout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent iteration of a multiyear project conducted by\u00a0Gallup\u00a0and the Knight Foundation on \u201cTrust, Media and Democracy\u201d shows that Americans are increasingly likely to believe that \u201cfake news\u201d is a real and damaging phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest version of the poll, conducted between Nov. 8, 2019, and Feb. 16, 2020,\u00a0shows\u00a0a four-point increase in the number of respondents who perceive a heavy bias in political media coverage compared to the last\u00a0Gallup/Knight survey, which was released in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the number of Americans who believe the media is biased is six times as large as the group that perceives no bias whatsoever. Among that group, 49 percent see \u201ca great deal\u201d of bias while 37 percent see \u201ca fair amount.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans perceive media bias at a much greater rate than their Democratic counterparts: A whopping 94 percent of self-identified Republicans believe the media is biased compared to 79 percent of Democrats. Republicans are also much more willing to acknowledge that their primary news sources are compromised: 63 percent of Republicans are willing to acknowledge bias in their primary source of news coverage, compared to just 46 percent of Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly three out of every four respondents (74 percent) believe \u201cowners of news outlets attempting to influence the way stories are reported\u201d is \u201ca major problem,\u201d a five-point increase from the 2017 survey\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new poll found that Americans who detect inaccuracies in a news story are more than five times as likely \u2013 82 percent to 16 percent \u2013 to believe that the mistakes are intentional rather than the product of good faith error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ariana N. Pekary: Personal news: why I\u2019m now leaving MSNBC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 24th was my last day at MSNBC. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do next exactly but I simply couldn\u2019t stay there anymore. My colleagues are very smart people with good intentions. The problem is the job itself. It forces skilled journalists to make bad decisions on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not watch MSNBC but just know that this problem still affects you, too. All the commercial networks function the same \u2013 and no doubt that content seeps into your social media feed, one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s possible that I\u2019m more sensitive to the editorial process due to my background in public radio, where no decision I ever witnessed was predicated on how a topic or guest would \u201crate.\u201d The longer I was at MSNBC, the more I saw such choices \u2013 it\u2019s practically baked in to the editorial process \u2013 and those decisions affect news content every day\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe are a cancer and there is no cure,\u201d a successful and insightful TV veteran said to me. \u201cBut if you could find a cure, it would change the world.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is, this cancer stokes national division, even in the middle of a civil rights crisis. The model blocks diversity of thought and content because the networks have incentive to amplify fringe voices and events, at the expense of others\u2026 all because it pumps up the ratings\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context and factual data are often considered too cumbersome for the audience\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve even heard producers deny their role as journalists. A very capable senior producer once said: \u201cOur viewers don\u2019t really consider us the news. They come to us for comfort.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill: Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chris Talgo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, Google has more power over information than the social media companies because Google completely dominates internet searches. Over the past year,\u00a0Google\u2019s market share of worldwide internet searches has hovered around 92 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0titled \u201cAn analysis of political bias in search engine results,\u201d Google\u2019s \u201ctop search results were almost 40% more likely to contain pages with a \u2018Left\u2019 or \u2018Far Left\u2019 slant than they were pages from the right. Moreover, 16% of political keywords contained no right-leaning pages at all within the first page of results.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, according to that study, Google\u2019s algorithm is politically biased to favor the left over the right. Maybe that explains why Google and other Big Tech companies contribute so much money to the Democratic Party compared to the Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Center for Responsive Politics,\u00a070 percent\u00a0of donations by Facebook and its employees in the 2020 campaign cycle have gone to Democrats. Eighty-one percent of Google\u2019s political contributions have gone to Democrats. The same trend applies to Amazon (74 percent) and Apple (91 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Big Tech\u2019s bias is becoming more and more apparent. Most Americans are well aware that in general, Big Tech favors leftwing causes, politicians and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News: Facebook removes pro-Trump ad aimed at Joe Biden, claiming false information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sally Persons and Brooke Singman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pro-Trump ad was removed from Facebook after claims that it contained false information, Fox News has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America\u00a0First Action PAC on Tuesday told Fox News that Facebook removed one of its ads, titled \u201cOn Hold,\u201d\u00a0which was placed in Arizona, Pennsylvania\u00a0and Wisconsin on July 24. The ad was flagged by Politifact on July 29, according to the PAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFacebook\u2019s decision to take down this ad shows its anti-conservative bias,\u201d\u00a0America First Communications Director Kelly Sadler told Fox News\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the ad had, in fact, been fact-checked. A Facebook spokesperson told Fox News that ads that are fact-checked and found to contain false information are not eligible to run as a paid ad on the social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman added that the videos can, instead, run as original content on the group\u2019s page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: Trump\u2019s campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden\u2019s knocks on 0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alex Thompson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump\u2019s campaign says it knocked on over 1 million doors in the past week alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says it knocked on zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican and Democratic parties \u2013 from the presidential candidates on down \u2013 are taking polar opposite approaches to door-to-door canvassing this fall. The competing bets on the value of face-to-face campaigning during a pandemic has no modern precedent, making it a potential wild card in November, especially in close races.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden and the Democratic National Committee aren\u2019t sending volunteers or staffers to talk with voters at home, and don\u2019t anticipate doing anything more than dropping off literature unless the crisis abates. The campaign and the Democratic National Committee think they can compensate for the lack of in-person canvassing with phone calls, texts, new forms of digital organizing, and virtual meet-ups with voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States\u00a0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houston Chronicle: Court case could reveal unprecedented insight into dark money group Empower Texans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Taylor Goldenstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empower Texans, the deep-pocketed conservative advocacy group, is well-known for its heavy hand in steering the Texas GOP further to the right and for its shadowy setup that hides its funding sources from the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a court case seeking to force the group\u2019s leader to register as a lobbyist could reveal more about the inner workings of the organization \u2013 and others like it in Texas \u2013 than ever known before, after the Texas Supreme Court last month ruled that it must divulge communications and financial records to the state ethics commission\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit stems from a 2014 fine the Texas Ethics Commission assessed against [Empower Texans CEO Michael Quinn] Sullivan for failing to register as a lobbyist starting in 2010. Sullivan appealed, and a series of delays have held up the case from going to trial, including a fight over the county where it should be held and attempts by Sullivan to have it dismissed\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a parallel court case, Sullivan is trying to gut the state agency, alleging that the Texas Ethics Commission does not have the legal authority to carry out actions such as levying fines for campaign finance law violations, saying only an executive branch agency, not a legislative branch agency, can enforce laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suit, which is before the 8th Court of Appeals in El Paso, also has the potential to reorganize the ethics commission, which already has some of the weakest enforcement capabilities in the country\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Attorney General Ken] Paxton, who has received more than $400,000 in campaign contributions from Empower Texans since 2009, has sided with Sullivan \u2013 saying he agrees with the group\u2019s legal stand and has a \u201cduty to uphold the Constitution,\u201d despite his obligation by statute to defend challenges to state laws, state agencies and state employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Post: De Blasio admits city skipped permit process to paint Black Lives Matter murals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Julia Marsh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City officials ignored their own application process for public art projects to paint Black Lives Matter murals around the five boroughs, in order to mark an important moment in history, Mayor Bill de Blasio said as his administration faces claims of First Amendment violations for refusing to green-light other proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe haven\u2019t said \u2018no\u2019 to people, we\u2019ve said, \u2018If you want to apply, you can apply, but there\u2019s a process,'\u201d de Blasio said during his City Hall press briefing Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pro-President Trump group Women for America First has\u00a0sued City Hall\u00a0for blocking a mural of their slogan \u201cEngaging, Inspiring and Empowering Women to Make a Difference!\u201d on a Manhattan roadway, while allowing multiple BLM paintings throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hizzoner insists he didn\u2019t block the move, just referred groups like Women for America First and the pro-police Blue Lives Matter to the Department of Transportation\u2019s permitting process. But there was no approval required for the BLM movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat is something that again transcends all normal realities because we are at a moment of history when that had to be said and done, that\u2019s a decision I made,\u201d de Blasio said.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut the normal process continues for anyone who wants to apply,\u201d he added\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]ivil liberties lawyer Norman Siegel predicted de Blasio\u2019s argument won\u2019t hold up in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOnce you open the door and allow Black Lives Matter murals to be on the streets of New York, you can\u2019t now turn down Blue Lives Matter. That would be a violation of the free speech provision of the Constitution,\u201d Siegel told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voice of San Diego: SDPD Is Punishing Speech Using a 102-Year-Old City Law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kate Nucci&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2013, as far back as the city would provide records, San Diego Police Department officers have issued 83 tickets to people they accused of using seditious language. The most recent was written in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seditious language is generally defined as speech that aims to overthrow the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that seditious language can only be regulated if authorities can prove that it\u2019s used as part of an imminent crime against the government. Legal experts questioned the constitutionality of the charge and one wondered whether police weren\u2019t simply writing tickets against people who mouthed off\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 83 San Diegans since 2013 may have been actively plotting to overthrow city government, said David Loy, the legal director at the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial Counties, it\u2019s more likely police officers have been using the charge to punish people who insult or talk back to them\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s well known in some situations that some officers give out citations for so-called \u2018contempt of cop,'\u201d Loy said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re citing this statute, or a disorderly conduct statute, what they\u2019re really getting citations for is people being rude to cops in the eyes of a police officer.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being rude to police officers, however, is protected speech in the United States. The Supreme Court in\u00a0Houston v. Hill\u00a0struck down a Houston municipal code that prohibited \u201ccontempt of police officer,\u201d arguing it violated the defendants\u2019 First Amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC 7 News: \u2018Outrageous &amp;politicized;\u2019: Martinez couple seen defacing BLM mural pleads not guilty to hate crime charge &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Amy Hollyfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Martinez couple accused of a hate crime for painting over a Black Lives Matter mural appeared in court Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Anderson and David Nelson entered not guilty pleas to three misdemeanor charges. Their attorney calls the charges \u201coutrageous and politicized.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust as peaceful protestors have the right to march and display their political views in a myriad of different ways, they have the same right to display their dissatisfaction and disagreement with their tax dollars being used to sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matter,\u201d defense attorney Bill Essayli said outside the courthouse\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt is a problem when you have elected officials using tax dollars to politicize an issue and now you have a District Attorney who is making it a crime to disagree with a political message and that\u2019s a real problem,\u201d Essayli said. \u201cWe cannot have two standards of justice in our country.

Its effectiveness lies in its ability to channel deep disagreements towards productive social changes. While free societies need legal protections for speech, laws are only as effective as the cultural influences that safeguard them. A\u00a0culture\u00a0of free expression characterizes the level of tolerance a society extends to individuals and their willingness to voice dissenting opinions. Our society\u00a0needs both\u00a0strong laws and a robust culture that protects free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment prevents censorship from the government, but a culture of free expression goes beyond the law. </p><p>It promotes open discourse in society, even in many private settings where the First Amendment does not apply. After all, it does not violate the First Amendment if an employer fires someone for their political opinions or if someone is shunned by their neighbors for their beliefs. Nevertheless, if these practices become widespread, then we will be less likely to hear unorthodox ideas and more likely to see a decline in political engagement as people self-censor\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we can take action to limit the threat our culture poses to political expression. If citizens face calls to be fired for a political donation or everyday Americans fear speaking out about politics, then perhaps we should rethink the\u00a0laws that expose\u00a0Americans\u2019 identities, home addresses, and employers just for supporting a candidate or party.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonprofits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hill:\u00a0Turley: The tragic irony of the New York state lawsuit against the NRA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Turley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[New York Attorney General Letitia] James is not disregarding the implications of a Democratic official seeking to destroy one of the most powerful conservative groups in the country in an election year. By contrast, she seems to revel in that image. She knows liberals are thrilled by the idea of disbanding the NRA\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those same political supporters, of course, would be justifiably outraged by any clear action of the administration to dissolve liberal organizations such as Planned Parenthood\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to dissolve an organization engaged in political speech should not occur absent overwhelming proof that it is a criminal enterprise, which is why this has never happened with a group like the NRA. James may point to the voluntary dissolution of the Donald Trump Foundation, a small and mostly inactive nonprofit, or the dissolution of Ku Klux Klan groups in the 1940s, but there is little comparison with the NRA in these cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many liberals celebrating the lawsuit against the NRA condemned Trump for trying to declare the radical movement antifa a terrorist organization. They were as right then as they are wrong now. I recently testified for the Senate to oppose such a designation for antifa. While I have been a vocal critic of antifa and its tactics, it is a dangerous power for the government to openly wield against organizations engaged in political speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: \u2018Somebody Needs to Go to Jail for This\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By James Freeman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) presented new evidence suggesting that in 2018 the FBI lied to the Senate Intelligence Committee about the bureau\u2019s investigation of the 2016 Trump campaign. Specifically, the FBI appears to have made a series of claims directly contradicting information in its possession about the key source for the dossier of anti-Trump rumors compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearing on Maria Bartiromo\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d program on Fox News, Sen. Graham said that highly misleading information was given to senators after the FBI had misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court in obtaining a warrant to surveil a Trump campaign associate and long after the FBI had learned its alleged evidence of collusion with Russia was garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSomebody needs to go to jail for this. This is a second lie. This is a second crime. They lied to the FISA court,\u201d said Graham, who adds that the FBI was then \u201clying to the Senate Intel Committee.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic: The Whole Concept of \u2018Unlawful Assembly\u2019 Is a Mess&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Garrett Epps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]extually, the words\u00a0unlawful assembly\u00a0embody a tension, even a contradiction-because the First Amendment, in its very terms, protects \u201cthe right of the people peaceably to assemble.\u201d So \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d is like \u201cillegal writing\u201d or \u201cforbidden religious exercise\u201d: There surely may be such a thing, but, in each case, the burden has to be on the authorities to explain why this assembly, this writing, this religious exercise is an exception to the broad protection afforded to these important political rights\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scholars have argued recently that Americans have lost sight of \u201cpeaceable assembly\u201d as an important constitutional right. One of them is Tabatha Abu El-Haj, a professor at the Drexel University Thomas R. Kline School of Law, whom I spoke with last week. Abu El-Haj has written extensively about the First Amendment and the right to assemble in particular, including a 2009 article called \u201cThe Neglected Right of Assembly.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abu El-Haj said that contemporary First Amendment doctrine has concentrated on freedom of speech, treating the right of groups to assemble as merely a subset of the right of individuals to speak. That\u2019s not in accordance with the words of the Constitution, she pointed out. \u201cCourts should take a textual approach and thus disaggregate peaceable assembly from freedom of speech,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press-Enterprise: There\u2019s nothing new about federal meddling in protest movements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Brian Bensimon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The targeting of protesters based on ideological grounds hearkens back to a darker era in history where it was common for the FBI to disrupt and discredit various activist movements through measures of state repression. Under a young agent J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI routinely cracked down on dissidents in a number of infamous episodes, including the Palmer Raids, where citizens were rounded up without due process on the basis of their political speech. Similarly, in the 1920s and 30s, Italian and Eastern European immigrants were accused of being \u201cBolshevists\u201d and \u201cleftists,\u201d with nearly 10,000 citizens arrested, thousands forced into detention, and hundreds forcibly removed\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One only has to look at the case of Rakem Balogun, the operator of Guerilla Mainframe, a Black self-defense organization, to understand the dangerous trajectory the FBI has been heading in the last few years. Despite no federal convictions on his record, the FBI used Balogun\u2019s social media postings and an Infowars video of him protesting at a 2015 rally, to establish his designation as the first (public) \u201cBlack Identity Extremist.\u201d While the FBI eventually dropped all charges against Balogun, the mere fact that such an investigation occurred is likely to produce a chilling effect on free speech, especially among Black and minority activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: American Bridge posts 1,043-page Trump oppo book online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alex Thompson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign paid for the opposition research book on Donald Trump compiled by the liberal Super PAC American Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, American Bridge is putting it online for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group on Friday published 1,043 pages of its research document on Trump on a new\u00a0website\u00a0that was used internally before. It wants the material in public view not so much for voters, but for other Democratic groups to use to campaign against the president\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition research files used to be closely held by party operatives. But American Bridge is joining a growing number of outside political groups uploading their documents online so that campaigns can access them without breaking campaign finance rules\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Election laws prevent coordination between independent expenditure groups and campaigns. So campaigns and outside groups have been devising methods to get around those rules: posting b-roll of candidates for use in super PAC ads or posting ad scripts online for other outside groups to see. Uploading the documents online is the latest method to pass on help without technically coordinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealClearPolitics: Social Media Imposing Modern-Day Hays Code on Political Speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kalev Leetaru&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, social media platforms have become modern-day incarnations of the\u00a0Hays Code\u00a0that governed Hollywood from the 1930s to 1960s, establishing \u201cmorality\u201d standards and enforcing them with an army of censors. By shaping popular culture through its control of movies, the Hays Code ensured that generations of Americans were presented an idealized world of benevolent public institutions, including police and politicians whose good works were spotlighted and any wrongdoing was punished. Moreover, as an extrajudicial speech regulation, studios could modify the rules and exempt content at will, much as social platforms do today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hays Code\u2019s influence came from the fact that the studio system was largely centralized, meaning a small number of companies largely controlled what audiences saw. While niche independent studios could set their own rules, the dominance of the major studios ensured the code had an outsized effect over entertainment speech, the same as Twitter and Facebook\u2019s rules are far more influential than those of upstarts like Parler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly a century later, lawmakers are once again awakening to the power of centralized speech controls by turning to social media companies to impose constraints traditionally prohibited under the First Amendment.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Times: Big Tech Makes Inroads With the Biden Campaign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David McCabe and Kenneth P. Vogel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been critical of Big Tech,\u00a0admonishing Facebook\u00a0for mishandling misinformation and saying internet companies\u00a0should lose a central legal protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his campaign has quietly welcomed onto its staff and policy groups people who have worked with or for Silicon Valley giants, raising concerns among the industry\u2019s critics that the companies are seeking to co-opt a potential Biden administration\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The Biden campaign] stressed that members of its policy committees were not there to represent their employers or clients, and that lobbyists \u2013 except those who represent labor unions \u2013 were barred from participating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After The Times asked members of the tech policy volunteer group about their work, some of them received a message \u201cto remind everyone that the work we are doing here is for the purpose of developing policy positions that are sound and in the best interest of the candidate and his election as president.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message noted that there were \u201ca variety of rumors floating around\u201d about how \u201cthe campaign is managing conflicts of interest and lobbying by corporate and other interests.\u201d And it acknowledged that while \u201cit is sometimes hard to separate one\u2019s personal views from those of one\u2019s employer or clients,\u201d members should do their \u201cabsolute best to ensure that the ideas that you offer up and the contributions that you make are consistent with what is best for the candidate and not what is best for you or your clients or your employer.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg Government: Defeated Senators Target Former Colleagues With Leftover Cash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Kenneth P. Doyle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly are tapping their leftover campaign funds to help flip Republican Senate seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Democratic senators from North Dakota and Indiana founded a super PAC called One Country Fund, which is supporting candidates who will stand up for rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political action committee launched its opening salvo over the weekend in Iowa, where it plans to spend $1 million to air for three weeks a\u00a0TV and radio ad\u00a0that criticizes Sen.\u00a0Joni Ernst\u00a0(R) for backing President Donald Trump rather than looking out for the state\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only reported funding for One Country Fund so far is a $500,000 contribution from Heitkamp\u2019s Senate campaign committee\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The super PAC also is set to receive money from Donnelly, who had about $210,000 in leftover cash at the end of June. He was also unseated in 2018\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of leftover campaign funds is restricted by FEC rules, and tapping this money for campaign ads has rarely been done before. The commission approved an advisory opinion request in 2012 allowing a former candidate to contribute leftover money to a super PAC, but the request made a point of saying the candidate wouldn\u2019t control how the money was spent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the FEC deadlocked over an advisory request from former congressman and HHS Secretary Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, asking to shift $1.7 million in leftover campaign cash to a nonprofit intended to promote his policy ideas on health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic: The Facts Just Aren\u2019t Getting Through&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Anne Applebaum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[People in information bubbles]\u00a0read and hear completely different media, respect different authorities, and search for a different sort of news\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[H]ow is it possible to reach people who can\u2019t hear you? This is not merely a question of how to convince people, how to use a better argument, or how to change minds. This is a question about how to get people to listen at all. Just shouting about \u201cfacts\u201d will get you nowhere with those who no longer trust the sources that produce them\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the noisy and chaotic modern information sphere, the message doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much as the messenger. Many people no longer trust major media outlets to give them valuable information-and they may never do so again. They no longer trust politicians or groups they perceive to be outside their tribe either-and the days when a president got a respectful audience just for being the president may never return again\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way or another, all successful campaigns-political campaigns, activist campaigns, even commercial advertising campaigns-need to reckon with the fact that audiences live in different information spheres. The era of mass media and unitary campaign slogans is drawing to an end. This is not news: The Russian operatives who intervened in the 2016 election were telling members of Black Lives Matter Facebook groups different things from what they told the anti-immigration activists they targeted in Idaho\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeted advertising makes it much easier to splice and dice the electorate, and it isn\u2019t hard to create misunderstandings between groups who no longer speak to each other.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WKYC: Cleveland City Council considers investigating groups critical of Cleveland Public Power&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Mark Naymik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u00a0Cleveland\u00a0City Council should investigate whether special interest groups critical of Cleveland Public Power have ties to the passage of last year\u2019s controversial House Bill 6, the nuclear bailout law sought by FirstEnergy, Council President Kevin Kelley said Monday\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During council\u2019s finance committee on Monday afternoon, Kelley complained that two groups active in the city \u2013 Consumers Against Deceptive Fees and Clevelanders First \u2013 have one thing in common: Attacking the city-owned utility\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAll I want to know is how is this operation being funded,\u201d Kelley said during the meeting, referring to Consumers Against Deceptive Fees. \u201cIs it morally repugnant but legal dark money or is there something more to it.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelley also cited work by Clevelanders First, the group behind an effort last year to cut the pay and size of city council\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolution [passed by Council\u2019s finance committee on Monday] reads in part: \u201cCouncil has reason to believe that Company A has other long-term public policy goals specific to the City of Cleveland: to restrict or destroy Cleveland Public Power and to influence or control the City\u2019s legislative body as well as its executive branch. The tactics used in the racketeering conspiracy to enact HB 6 are similar to those used by Company A and its allies against the City of Cleveland: applying political pressure using phony citizen groups and paying out significant dollars to fund its objectives.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the full council will consider a vote on the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 8/11 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

But when Harris became California Attorney General the office rejected the report as incomplete because it didn\u2019t include the donor lists \u2013 lists the Supreme Court held could remain confidential in the landmark case of\u00a0NAACP v. Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe First Amendment grants individuals who donate to private advocacy organizations the right to remain anonymous lest public disfavor and harassment chill their speech,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Yet the group said Harris gave it an ultimatum: disclose donors and threaten such speech, or refuse and be put out of business in California observed Steven Greenhut in\u00a0a column\u00a0for the San Diego Union-Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;District court judge Manuel Real later ruled that attorney general Kamala Harris\u2019 office did not demonstrate a sufficient need for that information when it sought to bar the conservative Americans for Prosperity Foundation from raising money in the state unless it turned over that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Real\u2019s decision was particularly useful in giving conservatives a preview of what a Kamala Harris presidency might look like \u2013 the Lois Lerner IRS scandal on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Insider: If wanting to fire people for supporting Trump or Biden isn\u2019t cancel culture, then nothing is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Anthony L. Fisher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a July poll by YouGov and the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, nearly one-third (32%) of Americans fear that their political opinions \u2013 if publicly known \u2013 could cost them their job or otherwise hinder their careers. The fear is spread roughly equally among broad political ideologies, with about one-third each of liberal, conservative, and moderate respondents worried about making their politics known\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same poll shows an alarming percentage of Americans think an executive donating to the political campaigns of either the Republican or Democratic nominee should be a fireable offense\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I generally try to be optimistic about America\u2019s culture of free speech, in all its messy and unpredictable forms, but this poll is chilling\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting a presidential candidate is the basic form of political expression. </p><p>It\u2019s considered a dereliction of civic duty to not participate in the electoral process. And in our system of government, like it or not, political donations are a constitutionally protected form of expression\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences, and executives shouldn\u2019t be exempt from speech (or even outrage) criticizing their actions. But it\u2019s important to resist taking such an extreme stance as to take someone\u2019s job over their participation in the legal political processes of a two-party system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If such limitations on speech were normalized against the executive class, it wouldn\u2019t take very long for the cancelers to come for the working class\u2019 political participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal: Law Alone Can\u2019t Protect Free Speech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Greg Lukianoff and Adam Goldstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancel culture notwithstanding, legal commentator Ken White argues that \u201cthis is a golden age for free speech in America.\u201d For decades, he notes, the Supreme Court has protected all manner of objectionable speech, from burning the American flag to homophobic protests outside servicemen\u2019s funerals. That\u2019s true-but those victories rest on a broad cultural consensus. If campus norms continue to displace free speech culture, judges and lawyers will eventually start to ignore the First Amendment or, worse, chip away at it until it is meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free-speech culture gave us the First Amendment to begin with. It kept free speech alive in the tumultuous 19th century. It reinvigorated the First Amendment in the 20th century. It informs interpretations of the First Amendment today-and it will determine whether free-speech protections will survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law360: Ill. Republicans Urge 7th Circ. To Revive Bid For Large Groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lauraann Wood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Seventh Circuit Judge pushed back Tuesday on Illinois Republicans\u2019 claim that they should be exempted from group-size limits like religious gatherings are under Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s latest COVID-19 safety order, saying the party isn\u2019t comparing apples to apples under the First Amendment.&lt;br /&gt;Counsel for the Illinois Republican Party urged a three-judge panel during oral argument to revive its bid to hold gatherings larger than the 50-person limit set in the latest coronavirus safety order, arguing the exemption for religious gatherings should apply to all protected First Amendment expression. But U.S. Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett said the party seems to be comparing its asserted speech rights to a group that has \u201can additional interest\u201d under the amendment, which is the right to freely exercise religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Barrett said she\u2019d be \u201cvery concerned\u201d if, for example, the governor\u2019s group-size limits exempted movements such as the Black Lives Matter protests that have been conducted while his executive order has been in place, \u201cbecause then you\u2019re talking apples to apples, you\u2019re talking political speech to political speech, and it\u2019s the same right at issue.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut here, the exception that\u2019s been carved out for churches isn\u2019t just speech to speech, it\u2019s not apples to apples,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s speech plus free exercise, against speech.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters: Exclusive: Trump administration asks court to dismiss Big Tech\u2019s challenge to social media executive order&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nandita Bose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has filed a motion asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit against the president\u2019s executive order targeting social media companies, calling it a \u201cprofound misunderstanding,\u201d according to a copy of the motion seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Twitter Inc. It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump\u2019s directive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump\u2019s social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonprofits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawfare: The Attempt to Dissolve the NRA Threatens Democratic Norms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alan Z. Rozenshtein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there\u2019s a strong case for removing the NRA\u2019s leadership and fundamentally reforming the organization itself, [New York Attorney General Letitia] James\u2019s attempt to dissolve the NRA in its entirety is a violation of key democratic and rule-of-law norms and should be troubling to people who value these norms no matter one\u2019s place on the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two distinct norms that the lawsuit threatens. The first is that the state should preserve, to the extent possible, the free exchange of ideas and an open political arena. That doesn\u2019t, of course, mean that the NRA, or any other political group, is\u00a0above the law\u00a0simply because it\u2019s engaged in politics. But it does mean that a lawsuit threatening to destroy\u00a0any\u00a0major political group should be held to a high standard. In particular, the government should bend over backwards, even while it enforces the law, to preserve the institution if at all possible. If the allegations in the complaint are true (and they have been supported by years of investigative reporting), James is absolutely right to hold the NRA and its leadership accountable. But the priority should be\u00a0reform, not dissolution. To seek dissolution, especially out of the gate, is to ignore the millions of Americans for whom the NRA is a vital avenue for political participation\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second norm that the NRA lawsuit threatens is that of impartial justice: officials should not use their powers to go after targets simply because they disagree with their politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: Protesters have camped for months at Tennessee\u2019s capitol. So lawmakers made it a felony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tim Elfrink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 61 straight days, protesters have camped outside the Tennessee Capitol in Nashville, demanding a meeting with the governor to discuss racial inequality and police brutality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the GOP-dominated legislature responded \u2013 by passing a bill making camping on state property, including the capitol grounds, a felony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill\u2019s backers described the legislation, which also stiffens penalties for protesters who spit on police, block streets, and disrupt meetings, as a necessary tool to battle violent demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt is to prevent what has happened in other cities like Portland and Washington, D.C.,\u201d Lt. Gov. Randy McNally (R)\u00a0said Wednesday after the measure passed. \u201cIf people \u2026 knowingly thumb their nose at authority and don\u2019t do what authorities have requested they do, they should be charged with a serious crime.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new camping laws passed Wednesday, protesters would first be issued a warning. Any who refuse to leave would then be charged with a Class E felony, which could carry up to 6 years in prison, the Nashville Tennessean reported; those convicted also lose their right to vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the capitol this week, some GOP legislators pointed to protesters who have heckled lawmakers to justify the harsh new punishments in the bill, which would also mandate that protesters charged with a variety of offenses must be held without bond for at least 12 hours. Protesters recently blocked the garage used by legislators and surrounded one senator\u2019s car, waving signs, until police intervened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FCC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multichannel News: Vimeo Asks FCC to Ignore Sec. 230 Rulemaking Petition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By John Eggerton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online video streaming site Vimeo has asked the FCC to \u201csummarily and promptly\u201d dismiss a petition by the Trump Administration asking the FCC to come up with a regime for regulating online speech.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the Administration does not have the authority to ask the FCC for the framework and the FCC does not have the authority to comply.\u00a0\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its request,\u00a0Vimeo called the petition \u201cretaliation by the highest government official in the country [President Trump] against a private speaker\u2019s unquestionable exercise of free speech.\u201d\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The President issued his executive order on regulating social media following Twitter\u2019s flagging of one of his tweets about mail-in voting being a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC sought input on the petition Aug. 3, but Vimeo suggests it should not even dignify it with a comment period.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Speech Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axios: Facebook cracks down on political content disguised as local news&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sara Fischer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook is rolling out a new policy that will prevent U.S. news publishers with \u201cdirect, meaningful ties\u201d to political groups from claiming the\u00a0news exemption\u00a0within its political ads authorization process, executives tell Axios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the 2016 election, reporters and researchers have uncovered\u00a0over 1,200 instances\u00a0in which political groups use websites disguised as local news outlets to push their point of view to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Facebook is ensuring that Pages connected to those groups are held to the same standard as political entities when it comes to advertising on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The \u201cnews exemption\u201d means that promoted content about social issues, elections or politics from news publishers\u00a0is not labeled as political\u00a0within Facebook\u2019s political archive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new policy, Pages on Facebook belonging to news outlets that are backed by political groups or people will still be allowed to\u00a0register as a news Page\u00a0and advertise on Facebook, but they will no longer be eligible for inclusion in the\u00a0Facebook News\u00a0tab, and they won\u2019t have access to news messaging on the Messenger Business Platform or the WhatsApp business API\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes\u00a0days after Google\u00a0confirmed to Axios that come September, it will ban politically-motivated advertisers that disguise themselves as local news websites to promote their political point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politico: Silicon Valley game-plans for a messy election night&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nancy Scola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, Facebook, Twitter and other major social media companies are working together to scenario-plan for the last three months before Election Day in the United States \u2013 including gaming out what to do if there\u2019s no quickly declared winner in the contest between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden on election night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The close collaboration between Silicon Valley companies in the run-up to election day is detailed in an unusual cross-industry statement put out Wednesday. Pinterest, LinkedIn-owner Microsoft, and Reddit are also among its signatories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe discussed preparations for the upcoming conventions and scenario planning related to election results. We will continue to stay vigilant on these issues and meet regularly ahead of the November election,\u201d\u00a0reads the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among dozens of scenarios being contemplated by the companies for election night in particular are a \u201chack and leak\u201d operation where stolen materials are quickly spread through online networks and addressing the distribution of manipulated videos, according to a person involved in the planning who spoke anonymously so as to not speak on behalf of the full industry coalition. The scenario planning is \u201ccandidate agnostic,\u201d they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Facebook and Other Tech Giants Gird for Chaotic Election&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Dustin Volz and Emily Glazer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook\u00a0Inc.,\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0Inc.\u2019s\u00a0Google and\u00a0Twitter\u00a0Inc.\u00a0have discussed with federal officials how the social-media platforms can prevent the spread of misinformation in the days before and after the election, after the U.S. intelligence community warned of foreign interference and President Trump called the vote\u2019s integrity into question\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the possibilities being discussed at Facebook and other tech platforms are putting in place procedures to act more quickly on misinformation, because false posts can sometimes exist online for hours before platforms take them down\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, for instance, is looking at updating policies related to the time between voting and when results are announced, one of the people said. It is also examining potential product updates through its Voting Information Center and additional labels added to posts from politicians, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Post: The Technology 202: Trump\u2019s TikTok order sparks questions about future of online expression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Cat Zakrzewski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump\u2019s executive order targeting TikTok is already sparking thinly veiled threats of legal action, as the company and civil liberties advocates warn it could have a chilling effect on free expression.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics scrambling to respond to the\u00a0the unexpected executive order, which would effectively shutter the U.S. operation of the viral video-sharing app in 45 days unless it\u2019s sold, see it as a potential violation of the First Amendment. They say it could could significantly curtail Americans\u2019 abilities to access media and share their own videos online.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe should be careful about giving the president the unfettered power to shut down a foreign communications platform,\u201d said\u00a0Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.\u00a0\u201cThat kind of shutdown has a real effect on Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights.\u201d \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPR\u00a0reports\u00a0that TikTok is planning to sue the administration in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, where the company\u2019s American operations are located. TikTok declined to comment on that report\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union is \u201cexploring all options in response,\u201d\u00a0said spokesman Abdullah Hasan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates and Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Townhall: David Daleiden Explains Why Harris Is the \u2018Greatest Threat to Civil Rights\u2019 in US History&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Leah Barkoukis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for Medical Progress\u2019s David Daleiden, who helped expose Planned Parenthood\u2019s harvesting and sale of fetal body parts in 2015, spoke out Tuesday night after Joe Biden announced California Sen. Kamala Harris would be his running mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cLots of people are asking me what I think of the news tonight,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201c[Kamala Harris] is the greatest threat to First Amendment civil rights our country has ever seen. I know because she had my home raided for speaking the truth about her political patrons at Planned Parenthood.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, as Attorney General of California, Harris was behind the raid of his apartment, in which authorities seized a laptop and several hard drives that contained the videos he filmed as part of his expose of Planned Parenthood. Some of the confiscated drives contained \u201csome very damning footage that has yet to be released to the public,\u201d he said at the time.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salon: Trump campaign appears to be hiding massive Facebook spending \u2013 but why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Roger Sollenberger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on Facebook ads, but has not reported any of\u00a0that spending to the Federal Election Commission, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with a number of affiliated committees, the campaign appears to be funneling payments to Facebook\u00a0through shell companies. Official committees affiliated with presumptive Democratic nominee\u00a0Joe Biden have also apparently used shell companies to foot\u00a0Facebook ads, but those committees have\u00a0reported a much larger proportion of their spending\u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt is not terribly uncommon for campaigns to not report direct payments to Facebook or Google,\u201d [Campaign Legal Center\u2019s Brendan] Fischer told Salon in an email.\u00a0\u201cUsually, what\u2019s happening is that the campaign is reporting payments to a digital consulting firm, and the firm creates the ads and also pays the platform as part of their contract. That\u2019s the kind of situation where the FEC has said that sub-vendor reporting is not required.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWith the Trump campaign, the Facebook payments are probably buried under a few layers: the campaign is reporting payments to American Made, and American Made is then paying the digital firm, and the digital firm is then paying Facebook and Google,\u201d he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fischer said, however, that he could not explain the situation with Digital Consulting Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post Daily Media Links 8/13 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

Would these senators condemn the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP, or their supporters on the same grounds? Would they say the money received by progressive organizations makes their legal arguments invalid? \u2026<br/>In the senators\u2019 view, the differences between the majority and the minority in these cases cannot be explained by honest disagreement. The justices who reached conclusions the senators favored were conscientiously applying the law, while the justices who reached conclusions that the senators opposed were simply following the marching orders of the Republican Party.</p><p><br/>Regarding this particular case, the senators say, the NRA worked hard to win the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, who had taken a strong position in favor of the Second Amendment as an appeals court judge. The NRA \u201cpromoted the confirmation (and perhaps selection) of nominees to this Court who, it believed, would \u2018break the tie\u2019 in Second Amendment cases,\u201d Whitehouse et al. say. \u201cDuring last year\u2019s confirmation proceedings, the NRA spent $1.2 million on television advertisements declaring exactly that.\u201d<br/>Furthermore, they say, the Federalist Society (which also has a budget!) published an article suggesting that the replacement of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy with Kavanaugh could have a crucial impact on the Court\u2019s willingness to hear Second Amendment cases.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Amendment\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Oregon officials request criminal investigation into newspaper reporters over after-hours phone calls, emails<br/>By\u00a0Meagan Flynn<br/>The Malheur Enterprise, a small newspaper in eastern Oregon, spent months investigating a state lawmaker\u2019s business deals and contract work in Malheur County. But on Monday, the newspaper reported an unusual development: Now the county wants to investigate the Malheur Enterprise \u2013 for harassment\u2026<br/>But Les Zaitz, the editor and publisher of the Enterprise, said in a statement that reporters were only trying to do their jobs.<br/>\u201cSuggesting that professional journalists are behaving as criminals in gathering vital information for the community appears to be an effort to silence and intimidate the Enterprise,\u201d said Zaitz, a two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist while a reporter at the Oregonian. He added: \u201cWe are a small, independently owned news source trying to hold public officials accountable. Rather than provide information and truth, local officials appear more interested in criminalizing a profession protected by the First Amendment.\u201d<br/>Malheur County Sheriff Brian E. Wolfe told the Enterprise that his office had not yet decided whether to begin an investigation as of Monday morning, but he pointed the paper to Oregon\u2019s \u201ctelephonic harassment\u201d criminal statute for its review\u2026<br/>If pursued, the investigation would fit into a larger pattern of intimidation of journalists by government officials, notably the president, over the past several years, argued Kyu Ho Youm, a communications law professor focused on the First Amendment at the University of Oregon\u2026<br/>\u201cThey\u2019re undoubtedly overreaching their boundaries as government officials and criminalizing ordinary phone calls and emails that are apart of news reporting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is fundamentally antithetical to freedom of the press in the United States, and this is more intimidation than anything that responsible government authorities [would do].\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>McClatchy DC:\u00a0Republicans use McConnell allies to try and force his hand on election security<br/>By\u00a0Lesley Clark<br/>Republicans for the Rule of Law is unveiling new spots that urge Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, to push McConnell for a vote, urging them \u201cdon\u2019t let Mitch McConnell stand in your way.\u201d The group is also re-airing a 60-second ad that calls on McConnell to act\u2026<br/>Rubio, Graham and Lankford all support various election security bills to counter election tampering by foreign governments in the wake of the 2016 election and Blunt chairs the Senate Rules Committee that has jurisdiction over the legislation\u2026<br/>Blunt has blamed House Democrats for McConnell\u2019s hardline stance, saying they overreached in January when they passed a sweeping measure focused on voting rights, campaign finance, and government ethics. Blunt accused Democrats in a July floor speech of trying to turn a serious issue into a \u201cpolitical football\u201d and said that the Senate is committed to election security\u2026<br/>The legislation referenced in the ads include a bill sponsored by Rubio and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland which would impose stiff sanctions on Russia\u2019s banking, energy and defense industries if there was evidence of election meddling.<br/>The legislation, known as the DETER act, also calls on the administration to present Congress with a strategy on preventing interference in U.S. elections for China, Iran, North Korea and \u201cany other foreign state of significant concern.\u201d\u2026<br/>Another bill is co-sponsored by Graham which would boost transparency of political and campaign ads that run on the web by requiring them to publicly disclose who paid for them.<br/>Some conservatives, however, say the legislation, dubbed the Honest Ads Act, overreaches and could stifle free speech.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online Speech Platforms\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Why Conservatives Don\u2019t Trust Facebook<br/>By\u00a0Jon Kyl<br/>In response to mounting criticism, Facebook asked me to conduct a survey to hear from conservatives directly\u2026<br/>Facebook placed no restrictions on how I could conduct the work. My team at the law firm Covington &amp;Burling; LLP began conducting interviews in May 2018. We cast a wide net to include as many aspects of conservatism as possible-from organizations focused on Christian values or protecting free expression to those focused on tax policy and small government. We identified individuals, groups and lawmakers who either use, study or could potentially regulate Facebook, and interviewed 133 of them. To encourage them to speak freely, we told interviewees we wouldn\u2019t publish their identities\u2026<br/>We found conservatives\u2019 concerns generally fall within the following six buckets:\u2026<br/>\u2013 Ad policies. In the wake of strong evidence from the U.S. intelligence community that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election with fake social-media accounts and inflammatory content, Facebook required advertisers to register as \u201cpolitical\u201d organizations in order to post ads with a political or policy focus. Some conservative interviewees said this new rule jeopardized their status as nonprofits under Section 501(c)(3) of the tax code\u2026<br/>Facebook has made several changes that are responsive to our findings, and we understand more are being considered. For now, changes include:\u2026<br/>\u2013 Ad labeling requirements. To avoid incorrectly branding ads as \u201cpolitical,\u201d Facebook renamed its ads library and now refers instead to ads \u201cabout social issues, elections or politics.\u201d\u2026<br/>We believe these and other measures described in our interim report are steps in the right direction. Yet these are complicated issues, some of which involve conflicting opinions even among conservatives. For that reason, restoring trust fully may remain an elusive goal.<br/>Business Insider:\u00a0The new report that Trump says shows Google \u2018manipulated\u2019 2.6 million votes for Hillary Clinton is a 2-year-old study that a San Diego psychologist based on 95 people<br/>By\u00a0Nick Bastone<br/>On Monday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted that a \u201creport just out\u201d showed that Google \u201cmanipulated\u201d millions of votes in favor of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election.<br/>\u201cGoogle should be sued,\u201d the president declared in his tweet, which said Google manipulated 2.6 million to 16 million votes in Clinton\u2019s favor\u2026<br/>One of the figures Trump cited in his tweet, the 2.6 million votes, tied his comments to the recent testimony of the San Diego psychologist Robert Epstein, who appeared before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in July titled \u201cGoogle and Censorship through Search Engines.\u201d<br/>In his testimony, Epstein \u2013 a self-proclaimed Democrat \u2013 said that at a \u201crock-bottom minimum\u201d Google swayed 2.6 million votes in favor of Clinton because of biases in its search results\u2026<br/>But Epstein told CNN on Monday that Trump misrepresented his findings, saying that they didn\u2019t prove Google actively \u201cmanipulated\u201d millions of voters but rather that the bias he found in its search results was \u201csufficient to have shifted between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes\u201d to Clinton\u2026<br/>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if this really applies to US elections where we have partisan politics going on and lots of other information that people have,\u201d [Dr. Michael McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida]\u00a0said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to look at the top of Google search results for your information about how you\u2019re going to cast your vote for president.\u201d\u2026<br/>\u201cWe absolutely have to worry about the social-media giants manipulating election-related information, whether intentionally or not,\u201d [Rick Pildes, a New York University law professor]\u00a0said. \u201cBut it\u2019s massively irresponsible to claim to know anything this specific and concrete about what information moved millions of voters to cast votes as they did.\u201d<br/>Axios:\u00a0Scoop: Inside Facebook\u2019s new plan for news<br/>By Mike Allen<br/>Facebook executives tell Axios they\u2019re hiring seasoned journalists to help curate a forthcoming \u201cNews Tab\u201d that they hope will change how millions get news\u2026<br/>News Tab, a personal passion of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is also an effort by Facebook to develop a healthier relationship with publishers, many of whom have had their business models destroyed by social platforms.<br/>Facebook will pay dozens of publishers to license content for News Tab, and news from many more will be included.<br/>The Wall Street Journal reported that the largest partners will be paid millions of dollars a year.<br/>News Tab will try to give credit to the outlet that broke a story, rather than an aggregator.<br/>Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s head of news partnerships, said: \u201cOur goal with the News tab is to provide a personalized, highly relevant experience \u2026 The majority of stories people will see will appear in the tab via algorithmic selection.\u201d<br/>A small team of journalists will pick stories for a Top News section.<br/>Last year, Facebook killed Trending Topics, populated by contractors, after being accused of bias.<br/>\u201cWe learned a lot from Trending,\u201d a Facebook executive told me. \u201cThis is a completely different product.\u201d<br/>A News Tab test for 200,000 users will begin in October, with a rollout to all U.S. users early next year.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candidates and Campaigns\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Think Progress:\u00a0America\u2019s broken campaign finance system is a 2020 issue (Video)<br/>Presidential elections are expensive. With the help of a broken campaign finance system, candidates are often forced to pander to the wealthy to raise funds for their campaigns. But the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are starting to push back against the broken system. They\u2019re taking stands against using corporate PAC money, opposing Super PACs, and making other moves to reduce the influence of money in politics. So how meaningful are these pledges and proposals? And what happens when the primary ends?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0States to Move Forward With Antitrust Probe of Big Tech Firms<br/>By\u00a0John D. McKinnon\u00a0and\u00a0Brent Kendall<br/>A group of states is preparing to move forward with a joint antitrust investigation of big technology companies, according to people familiar with the situation, adding another layer of scrutiny to an industry already under a federal spotlight.<br/>The effort involving state attorneys general is expected to be formally launched as soon as next month, the people said. It is likely to focus on whether a handful of dominant technology platforms use their marketplace powers to stifle competition.<br/>As part of the probe, the states are likely to issue civil investigative demands, similar to subpoenas, to tech companies and other businesses, the people said\u2026<br/>The specific number of states that might join the investigation couldn\u2019t be learned, though one person familiar with the effort said up to 20 or more may participate\u2026<br/>The political makeup of the multistate group isn\u2019t set. A bipartisan probe could give the investigation broader leverage and help insulate GOP officials from questions over whether their actions are motivated by political concerns, such as how online platforms treat conservative speech.<br/>New Mexico Political Report:\u00a0State agency says political parties can\u2019t hold raffles<br/>By Andy Lyman<br/>On August 6, Gaming Control Special Agent Robert Zajac told Los Alamos Republican Party Chairman Bill McKerley in an email that the party did not qualify to hold a raffle.<br/>\u201cUpon a review of the Los Alamos GOP, it does not fall under the definition of a \u2018qualified organization,'\u201d Zajac wrote.<br/>In an email days later, Zajac\u2019s boss, Commander Terry McGaha responded to concerns from the Los Alamos GOP that they did indeed fall into the \u201cqualified organization\u201d category.<br/>\u201cBased on state law as a whole, it does not appear that a political organization or a political committee meets the statutory definition for being qualified as a civic or service organization,\u201d McGaha wrote. \u201cSince the Bingo and Raffle act has not included political organizations as a permissible category of nonprofit organizations that are permitted to conduct games of chance under the Bingo and Raffle Act, we must insist that you immediately cease and desist from further sales or activity with respect to the raffle you are currently conducting.\u201d\u2026<br/>But, searches through campaign finance reports show numerous contributions to both local Democratic and Republican Party chapters for raffle tickets. [Richard Kottenstette, a spokesman for the Gaming Board] said he knows raffles like these happen often and even though he scours the internet for illegal gambling operations, he can\u2019t find them all and likened the issue to drivers who drive over the speed limit.<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s really about who gets caught,\u201d Kottenstette said.<br/>In this case, he added, the Gaming Board received an anonymous tip on it\u2019s tip line.<br/>The post Daily Media Links 8/20 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-72460</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVX-D8F1-JBJN-M04B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 20, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

McCarthy<br/>There is a superficial appeal to the notion that if Cohen is guilty, Trump must be guilty. But of course, such logic must work reciprocally, too. That is, if Trump is innocent, Cohen must have pled guilty to a non-crime.</p><p><br/>This theory is championed by some whip-smart lawyers, such as my friend Mark Levin and the eminent Bradley Smith, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, who wrote a fine Washington Post op-ed on the subject this week. They argue that, despite his guilty plea, Cohen did not violate the campaign-finance laws. The idea is that paying hush money is not an \"in-kind\" campaign contribution even though the concealment of embarrassing conduct may have been intended, at least in part, to influence an election. Smith explains that paying for silence is more in the nature of a \"personal use\" expenditure - defined in the law as an obligation or expense that would exist even if the person for whom it is paid were not a candidate in an election campaign.<br/>A candidate is not permitted to divert campaign funds to his personal use. Given that, Smith posits a deft \"they get you coming or going\" argument. Sure, Donald Trump's political opponents are now saying he violated campaign-finance laws by failing to disclose the election-eve hush-money payments as campaign expenses. Yet what would have happened if Trump had regarded these payments as campaign expenses and used campaign funds to pay them? Does anyone doubt that many of these same opponents would insist that he violated campaign-finance laws by diverting campaign funds to his personal use?<br/>I am persuaded by Smith's and Levin's reasoning. In a perfect world, it would carry the day. But far from a perfect world, ours is one in which this solid interpretation is not accepted by everyone who matters.<br/>Reason:\u00a0Ignorance Is Trump's Excuse<br/>By Jacob Sullum<br/>Trump's reimbursement, [Trevor] Potter explained, \"would just make Cohen's payment a loan to the Trump campaign,\" and \"federal law treats a loan to a campaign as a contribution, subject to contribution limits and disclosure requirements.\"<br/>Trump's confusion on this point suggests he did not deliberately flout the rules, which is the difference between a civil and a criminal violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). Nor is it clear that Trump needed to handle the Clifford payment the way he did to keep it hidden from voters: Another former FEC chairman, Brad Smith, suggests Trump could have reported the payment as a campaign expenditure under the boring heading of \"legal services.\"<br/>Smith is not convinced the hush payment should have been treated as a campaign expenditure. While Cohen said he paid Clifford \"for the principal purpose of influencing the election,\" Smith notes that FECA prohibits the use of campaign funds \"to fulfill any commitment, obligation, or expense of a person that would exist irrespective of the candidate's election campaign.\"<br/>Even if paying Clifford helped Trump win the election, then, treating it as campaign expense would have been illegal unless it happened only because he was running for president. \"At a minimum,\" Smith wrote in a Reason essay, \"it is unclear whether paying blackmail to a mistress is 'for the purpose of influencing an election,' and so must be paid with campaign funds, or a 'personal use,' and so prohibited from being paid with campaign funds.\"<br/>As the disagreement between Potter and Smith suggests, campaign finance law is complicated. Since even experts argue about what FECA requires, it is plausible that Trump, who shows little interest in fine points of law or policy, did not know.<br/>CBC News:\u00a0Did Trump break laws with hush-money payments? Here's what legal experts are saying<br/>By Matt Kwong<br/>In interviews with CBC News, six election-law experts weigh in. The experts are:<br/>Bradley Smith, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission<br/>Charles Spies, head of national political law at Clark Hill in Washington, D.C.<br/>Edward Foley, head of election law at Ohio State University's Moritz College<br/>Sam Isaacharoff, Reiss Professor of Constitutional Law at New York University<br/>Dan Tokaji, author of Election Law in a Nutshell<br/>Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, Stetson University election law professor<br/>On Trump arguing that the money didn't come from his\u00a0campaign: ...<br/>SMITH:\u00a0If they're not campaign expenditures, they're not subject to disclosure. My view is that this is not a campaign expenditure, and once you hit that point, it doesn't matter how you paid for it.\u00a0<br/>On personal expenses versus campaign expenditures: ...<br/>SMITH:\u00a0You can't make an argument like I need to have my teeth whitened so I look good on\u00a0the campaign trail, or I need a new suit. A part of the statute defines \"personal use\" as any abdication that would exist even if you weren't running for office. You've still gotta have clothes, still gotta keep your teeth, these are things that existed before you ran for office. The obligation has to exist solely because he's running for president. It's the idea of, 'I want to settle these lawsuits because I don't want this to hang over me.'<br/>On the amounts of the payouts: ...<br/>SMITH:\u00a0Typically, a candidate can spend whatever he wants on his own campaign. Now, if it's a reporting violation, an argument I hear is people saying the public had a right to know. Had they taken that approach, they would have probably recorded it as \"legal services.\" So I'm not sure that the public actually would have gained much knowledge had it been disclosed.<br/>Bloomberg:\u00a0Trump's Best Defense in Cohen Case May Point to More Hush Money<br/>By Bill Allison<br/>If prosecutors want to explore criminal charges against Trump for accepting illegal campaign contributions in the payoff of two women who say they had sexual encounters with him, he may be able to fend them off by saying he has a history of making hush-money payments...<br/>The president could argue - if true - that his associates made the same kind of payments when he wasn't a candidate as a way to protect his image, said Larry Noble, a former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, who has been a critic of Trump. \"If they can show three or four instances over the past five years that follow the same pattern, then I think they have an argument,\" Noble said...<br/>Bradley Smith, a former Republican FEC commissioner, says the agency has adopted narrow criteria for determining if campaign funds should be used for making a payment. \"The more objective approach that the FEC has adopted is, does this expense exist solely because of the election, like renting office space for the campaign or buying TV ads,\" he said.\u00a0But prosecutors have taken a broader view of the law in at least one case.<br/>In 2011, John Edwards was indicted on election law charges stemming from the 2008 presidential race similar to those that Cohen faced. . .\u00a0The Justice Department dropped charges in 2012 after a jury deadlocked on most of the charges.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New from the Institute for Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Government Should Not Enable Political Violence<br/>By\u00a0Alex Baiocco<br/>Earlier this month, the Berkeley Police Department published on Twitter the names, photos, ages, and cities of residence of protesters arrested at a \"No to Marxism\" rally that took place in the city. According to reports, the photos were of \"Antifa\" (short for anti-fascist) counter-protesters who were at the rally to oppose the message of the \"alt-right\" organizers...<br/>It is the job of the police to prevent and respond to violence. But selectively posting the names and photos of activists whom some political opponents may wish to harm is by no means an effective violence prevention effort. In fact, publicly identifying individuals associated with controversial causes only increases the chances of violent political retaliation.<br/>For this very reason, many left-leaning activists, university professors, and lawyers were outraged at the actions of the Berkeley police...<br/>Predictably, some on the political right mocked the outrage over outing Antifa activists. But as former Republican Federal Election Commission Chairman Michael Toner said, this is \"[a] disturbing development that should be of concern to those on the right and left alike.\"<br/>Even more concerning are calls to publicly expose the names, home addresses, and employers of Americans who choose to support and associate with nonprofit organizations advocating for social and political change. A group should not have to promote violence before there is concern about violent retaliation against its members...<br/>The public posting of the names and photos of those arrested in Berkeley is unacceptable for many of the same reasons that public disclosure of nonprofit donors is unacceptable. But unlike those arrested in Berkeley, nonprofit donors are accused of nothing more than peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Speech</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Free speech's worst enemies aren't who you'd expect<br/>By\u00a0Mitch Daniels<br/>Within weeks of each other, two prominent speakers visited the university where I work and made strikingly similar observations. Nadine Strossen,\u00a0former longtime president of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Geoffrey\u00a0R. Stone,\u00a0a renowned constitutional scholar at the University of Chicago, each noted with bemusement that the people whose freedom of speech they had most often labored to protect are now too often its worst enemies. Their careers had begun by defending leftist causes against autocratic rules and institutions, they said, but now involve arguing against the intolerance of those who had typically been allies.<br/>Thank goodness we still have thinkers such as these, ones who are willing to stay engaged with the free-speech debate. The resolute advocacy of people such as Strossen and Stone - invaluable in its credibility and admirable in their courage to express it - is the nation's best hope to veer away from the new authoritarianism now threatening our democratic system.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Courts</emphasis><br/>New Republic:\u00a0Andrew Cuomo's Trumpian War on the NRA<br/>By Matt Ford<br/>The American Civil Liberties Union last week joined a closely watched court case, taking sides with a national advocacy organization against a powerful New Yorker who's accused of enacting a retaliatory and unconstitutional policy. For once, this person wasn't President Donald Trump.<br/>The ACLU's latest opponent is Andrew Cuomo. In May, the National Rifle Association sued the New York governor on First Amendment grounds, alleging that he's trying to force the gun-rights organization into financial ruin by pressuring banks and insurance companies into severing their business ties with it...<br/>The governor responded with a sarcastic tweet that the organization would be in his \"thoughts and prayers,\" and has asked the federal court considering the lawsuit to dismiss it. Last Friday, the ACLU filed a brief urging the court to reject Cuomo's request...<br/>\"There are acceptable measures that the state can take to curb gun violence,\" David Cole, the ACLU's legal director, wrote last week. \"But using its extensive financial regulatory authority to penalize advocacy groups because they 'promote' guns isn't one of them.\" ...<br/>It's not impossible to imagine a hardline Republican governor taking similar steps with state financial regulators to blacklist legal-aid groups that represent undocumented immigrants, or nonprofit organizations that advocate for reproductive rights, or even the ACLU itself.<br/>Portland Press Herald:\u00a0Judge denies LePage motion to dismiss lawsuit by women blocked from his Facebook page<br/>By Dennis Hoey<br/>Judge John A. Woodcock Jr. denied LePage's motion to have the suit dismissed in a ruling issued in U.S. District Court on Wednesday.<br/>Woodcock found merit in the plaintiff's allegations that the governor's censorship of their comments on his Facebook page violated their First Amendment right to free speech.<br/>His ruling also means that their lawsuit will be allowed to proceed through the courts, regardless of the fact that LePage's second term is coming to an end in January.<br/>Woodcock in his ruling pointed out that the parties do not agree on whether the Facebook page is the governor's official page that he uses to discuss policy issues or whether it is a \"holdover campaign page that the governor uses to communicate with his base and his base with him. Is it somewhere in between?\"<br/>\"On a motion to dismiss a complaint, the court must assume that the social media page is the governor's official social media page. In doing so, the court is not able to squarely reach the merits of the issues in the governor's motion to dismiss,\" Woodcock wrote.<br/>The lawsuit was filed in August 2017 by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine...<br/>\"By blocking access to this forum and deleting comments based on the viewpoint of the speaker, Governor LePage has violated plaintiffs' rights to free expression and to petition the government for a redress of wrongs and grievances,\" the ACLU complaint argues.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Internet Speech Regulation\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Washington Post:\u00a0Keep the government out of Google searches<br/>By\u00a0Floyd Abrams<br/>Google's fairness is not only an apt topic for public debate but also an essential one. If it were true, as the president claims, that with biased search results the company is \"hiding information and news that is good\" about his administration, Google would deserve harsh criticism. And if, on the contrary, the president's tweets were themselves not only unsubstantiated but simply a reflection of the fact that more critical than supportive articles appear in major media, so would he.<br/>That sort of debate is healthy. What is potentially dangerous is the assertion in the president's tweets that \"This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!\" and Kudlow's intimation that a regulatory response was actually being considered. Of course, Trump and Kudlow may not mean it. Or they may mean it and will not pursue it further. But one cannot tell, and so when such statements are made, it is worth responding immediately: Any such government action would constitute a particularly egregious violation of the First Amendment.<br/>Think of it. Shall we really allow the government, any government, to pass judgment as a matter of law on the choices made by Google and Facebook and the like in providing information to people who seek news about a public official? The very search results objected to by Trump were in response to the words \"Trump News.\" Is it conceivable that we would allow a Trump administration-appointed official body of some sort to decide whether the president was accurate in his complaints that \"bad\" news about his administration was being exaggerated while \"Google &amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good\"? Or that \"96% of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media\"? More broadly, how could any such governmental action be consistent with the First Amendment, which was adopted as a protection against government itself?<br/>Washington Post:\u00a0I wrote the article about media bias in Google searches. Regulation isn't the answer.<br/>By\u00a0Paula Bolyard<br/>President Trump started off Tuesday on Twitter with a new target: Google, which he accused of rigging its search engines to promote negative coverage of his administration.<br/>\"Republican/Conservative &amp; Fair Media is shut out. Illegal?\" Trump said in his tweet, adding that \"96% of results on \u2018Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google &amp; others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good.\"<br/>That 96 percent figure probably comes from an article I wrote at PJ Media about what happened when I plugged \"Trump\" into the search engine's \"News\" tab. Let me be clear: While suspicions about inherent biases being baked into the systems at Google and other tech platforms are certainly warranted, I do not believe that government regulations are the answer to that problem...<br/>The government has no business regulating private companies for their political views, and it would set a dangerous precedent to do so in this case. Government regulation would only make things worse. The Internet would be less free, and fewer voices would be allowed to have a say...<br/>I wrote in my article at PJ Media that these big tech companies have the power to influence elections and even the state of democracy itself. I stand by that statement. And while the president might have gone too far in calling for government intervention, I agree that Americans need to pay attention to this issue.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Congress</emphasis><br/>NBC News:\u00a0Trump's claim that campaign finance violations 'are not a crime' is an attack on the laws that protect democracy<br/>By\u00a0Rep. Ted Lieu and Rep. Kathleen Rice<br/>Attempting to minimize the damage, Trump tweeted that Cohen's campaign finance violations \"are not a crime.\" Anyone who understands the law knows that Trump is wrong from a legal perspective. But just as importantly, this response underscores Trump's lack of respect for and understanding of the way campaign finance laws protect our democracy and maintain the integrity of our electoral process...<br/>Trump is undermining not just the rule of law, but specifically laws that are specifically designed to prevent candidates from rigging the system to get elected...<br/>We felt strongly enough about the excessive amount and timing of these payments to urge the FBI to open an investigation into the matter back in March of this year. As it turns out, we were right to be concerned...<br/>Trump's attempts at misdirection notwithstanding, Cohen's guilty plea proves why campaign finance laws are so critical to our system of government. These laws help ensure elections are fair and transparent, and that wealthy individuals can't play an outsized role in electing our leaders. There's obviously more we could do to fix the problem of money in politics, but Trump falsely intimating that campaign finance violations are routine or not a crime is deeply corrosive to our democracy and justice system...<br/>We don't expect Trump to change. Which is why it is so important that Congress fulfill its constitutional obligation to be a check and balance on the culture of corruption within the executive branch. Congress must call hearings to investigate whether Trump committed felony violations of our nation's campaign finance laws.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FEC</emphasis><br/>Republican National Lawyers Association:\u00a0Like Strozk, FEC Commissioner Weintraub Should Be Recused from Trump Cases<br/>By\u00a0Michael B. Thielen<br/>Commissioner Weintraub has joined the political opposition to President Trump. Weintraub started lobbing gratuitous political volleys at President Trump soon after he took office. She publicly jousted with President Trump over claims of voter fraud, an issue outside the jurisdiction of the FEC. That drew a complaint to the FEC Inspector General. Weintraub quickly - and lamely - attempted to link her foray into the President's voter fraud politics to her official duties as a Commissioner, while at the same time rallying her own political support on Twitter and elsewhere, declaring that she would not be \"silenced.\"<br/>But Weintraub's post hoc effort at legitimization was transparent. A single Commissioner has no authority to launch an investigation by letter to the President (or any other witness). Her missives to the President could not possibly constitute the conduct of official FEC business because it was unauthorized and out of order...<br/>Weintraub also published a mean-spirited diatribe against the President's legal counsel in a Washington Post op-ed at the beginning of the administration. That's far afield from the business of the FEC, and its terms were so personal and nasty that Weintraub's hatred for the Trump campaign and its lawyer were on full display.<br/>All this political jousting indicates one thing: that Commissioner Weintraub started off with a clear bias against Donald Trump, his lawyer, and his administration.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump Administration\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Wall Street Journal:\u00a0Don McGahn's Quiet Achievement<br/>By\u00a0Editorial Board<br/>The veteran lawyer has steered the most successful parts of the President's agenda despite the threats and distractions of the Robert Mueller investigation and the President's frequent unwillingness to accept legal advice.<br/>Judicial selection has in particular been a model of political execution. Working with Leonard Leo from the Federalist Society, Mr. McGahn created a conveyor belt to fill openings on the federal bench.<br/>If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, Mr. Trump will have gone two for two with high-quality Supreme Court selections. This is better than Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, George H.W. Bush and even George W. Bush, depending on how you feel about Chief Justice John Roberts. (We're still deciding.)<br/>Almost as important, Mr. Trump has nominated 32 judges for the federal appellate circuits, and the Senate has confirmed 26 with the other six likely to be confirmed this year. The Senate has also confirmed 33 federal district court judges and 73 more nominees are pending. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley have kept the confirmations moving despite unprecedented Democratic obstruction.<br/>But their job would have been much harder if not for the quality of the nominees Mr. McGahn has helped to vet and recommend. These judges-many in their 30s or 40s-will be the bench from which a future GOP President will fill Supreme Court openings.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The States</emphasis><br/>Arizona Republic:\u00a0Anti-'dirty money' initiative knocked off ballot in Arizona, Supreme Court rules<br/>By Dustin Gardiner<br/>The decision is final: A citizens initiative that aimed\u00a0to eliminate \"dirty money,\" or anonymous political spending, in\u00a0Arizona elections won't appear on the Nov. 6 ballot.<br/>In a ruling Wednesday afternoon, the Arizona Supreme Court ordered that the\u00a0\"Outlaw Dirty Money Act\" not appear\u00a0on the ballot because\u00a0supporters didn't submit enough valid voter signatures to qualify...<br/>Wednesday's ruling didn't come as\u00a0a surprise;\u00a0the initiative's fate was\u00a0hanging by a thread.<br/>State elections officials announced\u00a0earlier this month that the act failed to qualify for\u00a0the ballot because supporters didn't submit enough valid signatures.<br/>The Outlaw Dirty Money campaign challenged that ruling and the lower court's decision.<br/>Fortune:\u00a0Left-Leaning Fast Food Fans Lose Appetite After In-N-Out Burger Donates To California Republicans<br/>By Grace Dobush<br/>Cult fast food chain In-N-Out Burger is getting served after it was revealed the restaurant chain donated $25,000 to the California Republican Party.<br/>Journalist Gabe Schneider found the filing this week and posted it on Twitter...<br/>California Democratic Party chairman Eric Bauman called for an In-N-Out boycott...<br/>The late CEO, Rich Snyder, was an evangelical Christian and supporter of Republican candidates, and current president Lynsi Snyder is also devout. Like cult chain Chick-fil-A, In-N-Out doesn't make its founders' Christian values a secret, per se. Customers just might be so focused on their Animal Style burgers that they don't notice the references to Bible quotes printed on the wrappers.<br/>However, it's not clear that the company's current leadership is nearly as aligned with the Republicans as that of Chick-fil-A, a company that has publicly come out against LGBT rights.\u00a0According to campaign finance filings, In-N-Out Burger also donated $30,000 last year and $50,000 this year to Californians for Jobs and a Strong Economy, a political action committee that supports business-friendly Democratic candidates.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-34203</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRN1-F03R-W1SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3908\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Speech, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Institute For Free Speech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 30, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
