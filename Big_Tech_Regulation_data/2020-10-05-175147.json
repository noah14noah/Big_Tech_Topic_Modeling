On at least a couple of occasions, someone had crossed out the words \"Black Lives Matter\" and replaced them with \"All Lives Matter.\" Zuckerberg wanted whoever was responsible to cut it out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\" 'Black Lives Matter' doesn't mean other lives don't,\" he wrote. \"We've never had rules around what people can write on our walls,\" the memo went on. But \"crossing out something means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's.\" The defacement, he said, was being investigated.</p><p>All around the country at about this time, debates about race and politics were becoming increasingly raw. Donald Trump had just won the South Carolina primary, lashed out at the Pope over immigration, and earned the enthusiastic support of David Duke. Hillary Clinton had just defeated Bernie Sanders in Nevada, only to have an activist from Black Lives Matter interrupt a speech of hers to protest racially charged statements she'd made two decades before. And on Facebook, a popular group called Blacktivist was gaining traction by blasting out messages like \"American economy and power were built on forced migration and torture.\"</p><p>So when Zuckerberg's admonition circulated, a young contract employee named Benjamin Fearnow decided it might be newsworthy. He took a screenshot on his personal laptop and sent the image to a friend named Michael Nu\u00f1ez, who worked at the tech-news site Gizmodo. Nu\u00f1ez promptly published a brief story about Zuckerberg's memo.</p><p>A week later, Fearnow came across something else he thought Nu\u00f1ez might like to publish. In another internal communication, Facebook had invited its employees to submit potential questions to ask Zuckerberg at an all-hands meeting. One of the most up-voted questions that week was \"What responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017?\" Fearnow took another screenshot, this time with his phone.</p><p>Fearnow, a recent graduate of the Columbia Journalism School, worked in Facebook's New York office on something called Trending Topics, a feed of popular news subjects that popped up when people opened Facebook. The feed was generated by an algorithm but moderated by a team of about 25 people with backgrounds in journalism. If the word \"Trump\" was trending, as it often was, they used their news judgment to identify which bit of news about the candidate was most important. If <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Onion</emphasis> or a hoax site published a spoof that went viral, they had to keep that out. If something like a mass shooting happened, and Facebook's algorithm was slow to pick up on it, they would inject a story about it into the feed.</p><p>Facebook prides itself on being a place where people love to work. But Fearnow and his team weren't the happiest lot. They were contract employees hired through a company called BCforward, and every day was full of little reminders that they weren't really part of Facebook. Plus, the young journalists knew their jobs were doomed from the start. Tech companies, for the most part, prefer to have as little as possible done by humans-because, it's often said, they don't scale. You can't hire a billion of them, and they prove meddlesome in ways that algorithms don't. They need bathroom breaks and health insurance, and the most annoying of them sometimes talk to the press. Eventually, everyone assumed, Facebook's algorithms would be good enough to run the whole project, and the people on Fearnow's team-who served partly to train those algorithms-would be expendable.</p><p>The day after Fearnow took that second screenshot was a Friday. When he woke up after sleeping in, he noticed that he had about 30 meeting notifications from Facebook on his phone. When he replied to say it was his day off, he recalls, he was nonetheless asked to be available in 10 minutes. Soon he was on a videoconference with three Facebook employees, including Sonya Ahuja, the company's head of investigations. According to his recounting of the meeting, she asked him if he had been in touch with Nu\u00f1ez. He denied that he had been. Then she told him that she had their messages on Gchat, which Fearnow had assumed weren't accessible to Facebook. He was fired. \"Please shut your laptop and don't reopen it,\" she instructed him.</p><p>That same day, Ahuja had another conversation with a second employee at Trending Topics named Ryan Villarreal. Several years before, he and Fearnow had shared an apartment with Nu\u00f1ez. Villarreal said he hadn't taken any screenshots, and he certainly hadn't leaked them. But he <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">had</emphasis> clicked \"like\" on the story about Black Lives Matter, and he was friends with Nu\u00f1ez on Facebook. \"Do you think leaks are bad?\" Ahuja demanded to know, according to Villarreal. He was fired too. The last he heard from his employer was in a letter from BCforward. The company had given him $15 to cover expenses, and it wanted the money back.</p><p>The firing of Fearnow and Villarreal set the Trending Topics team on edge-and Nu\u00f1ez kept digging for dirt. He soon published a story about the internal poll showing Facebookers' interest in fending off Trump. Then, in early May, he published an article based on conversations with yet a third former Trending Topics employee, under the blaring headline \"FORMER FACEBOOK WORKERS: WE ROUTINELY SUPPRESSED CONSERVATIVE NEWS.\" The piece suggested that Facebook's Trending team worked like a Fox News fever dream, with a bunch of biased curators \"injecting\" liberal stories and \"blacklisting\" conservative ones. Within a few hours the piece popped onto half a dozen highly trafficked tech and politics websites, including Drudge Report and Breitbart News.</p><p>The post went viral, but the ensuing battle over Trending Topics did more than just dominate a few news cycles. In ways that are only fully visible now, it set the stage for the most tumultuous two years of Facebook's existence-triggering a chain of events that would distract and confuse the company while larger disasters began to engulf it.</p><p>This is the story of those two years, as they played out inside and around the company. WIRED spoke with 51 current or former Facebook employees for this article, many of whom did not want their names used, for reasons anyone familiar with the story of Fearnow and Villarreal would surely understand. (One current employee asked that a WIRED reporter turn off his phone so the company would have a harder time tracking whether it had been near the phones of anyone from Facebook.)</p><p>The stories varied, but most people told the same basic tale: of a company, and a CEO, whose techno-optimism has been crushed as they've learned the myriad ways their platform can be used for ill. Of an election that shocked Facebook, even as its fallout put the company under siege. Of a series of external threats, defensive internal calculations, and false starts that delayed Facebook's reckoning with its impact on global affairs and its users' minds. And-in the tale's final chapters-of the company's earnest attempt to redeem itself.</p><p>In that saga, Fearnow plays one of those obscure but crucial roles that history occasionally hands out. He's the Franz Ferdinand of Facebook-or maybe he's more like the archduke's hapless young assassin. Either way, in the rolling disaster that has enveloped Facebook since early 2016, Fearnow's leaks probably ought to go down as the screenshots heard round the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">II</emphasis></p><p>By now, the story of Facebook's all-consuming growth is practically the creation myth of our information era. What began as a way to connect with your friends at Harvard became a way to connect with people at other elite schools, then at all schools, and then everywhere. After that, your Facebook login became a way to log on to other internet sites. Its Messenger app started competing with email and texting. It became the place where you told people you were safe after an earthquake. In some countries like the Philippines, it effectively <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis> the internet.</p><p>The furious energy of this big bang emanated, in large part, from a brilliant and simple insight. Humans are social animals. But the internet is a cesspool. That scares people away from identifying themselves and putting personal details online. Solve that problem-make people feel safe to post-and they will share obsessively. Make the resulting database of privately shared information and personal connections available to advertisers, and that platform will become one of the most important media technologies of the early 21st century.</p><p>But as powerful as that original insight was, Facebook's expansion has also been driven by sheer brawn. Zuckerberg has been a determined, even ruthless, steward of the company's manifest destiny, with an uncanny knack for placing the right bets. In the company's early days, \"move fast and break things\" wasn't just a piece of advice to his developers; it was a philosophy that served to resolve countless delicate trade-offs-many of them involving user privacy-in ways that best favored the platform's growth. And when it comes to competitors, Zuckerberg has been relentless in either acquiring or sinking any challengers that seem to have the wind at their backs.</p><p>In fact, it was in besting just such a rival that Facebook came to dominate how we discover and consume news. Back in 2012, the most exciting social network for distributing news online wasn't Facebook, it was Twitter. The latter's 140-character posts accelerated the speed at which news could spread, allowing its influence in the news industry to grow much faster than Facebook's. \"Twitter was this massive, massive threat,\" says a former Facebook executive heavily involved in the decisionmaking at the time.</p><p>So Zuckerberg pursued a strategy he has often deployed against competitors he cannot buy: He copied, then crushed. He adjusted Facebook's News Feed to fully incorporate news (despite its name, the feed was originally tilted toward personal news) and adjusted the product so that it showed author bylines and headlines. Then Facebook's emissaries fanned out to talk with journalists and explain how to best reach readers through the platform. By the end of 2013, Facebook had doubled its share of traffic to news sites and had started to push Twitter into a decline. By the middle of 2015, it had surpassed Google as the leader in referring readers to publisher sites and was now referring 13 times as many readers to news publishers as Twitter. That year, Facebook launched Instant Articles, offering publishers the chance to publish directly on the platform. Posts would load faster and look sharper if they agreed, but the publishers would give up an element of control over the content. The publishing industry, which had been reeling for years, largely assented. Facebook now effectively owned the news. \"If you could reproduce Twitter inside of Facebook, why would you go to Twitter?\" says the former executive. \"What they are doing to Snapchat now, they did to Twitter back then.\"</p><p>It appears that Facebook did not, however, carefully think through the implications of becoming the dominant force in the news industry. Everyone in management cared about quality and accuracy, and they had set up rules, for example, to eliminate pornography and protect copyright. But Facebook hired few journalists and spent little time discussing the big questions that bedevil the media industry. What is fair? What is a fact? How do you signal the difference between news, analysis, satire, and opinion? Facebook has long seemed to think it has immunity from those debates because it is just a technology company-one that has built a \"platform for all ideas.\"</p><p>This notion that Facebook is an open, neutral platform is almost like a religious tenet inside the company. When new recruits come in, they are treated to an orientation lecture by Chris Cox, the company's chief product officer, who tells them Facebook is an entirely new communications platform for the 21st century, as the telephone was for the 20th. But if anyone inside Facebook is unconvinced by religion, there is also Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act to recommend the idea. This is the section of US law that shelters internet intermediaries from liability for the content their users post. If Facebook were to start creating or editing content on its platform, it would risk losing that immunity-and it's hard to imagine how Facebook could exist if it were liable for the many billion pieces of content a day that users post on its site.</p><p>And so, because of the company's self-image, as well as its fear of regulation, Facebook tried never to favor one kind of news content over another. But neutrality is a choice in itself. For instance, Facebook decided to present every piece of content that appeared on News Feed-whether it was your dog pictures or a news story-in roughly the same way. This meant that all news stories looked roughly the same as each other, too, whether they were investigations in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis>, gossip in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Post</emphasis>, or flat-out lies in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Denver Guardian</emphasis>, an entirely bogus newspaper. Facebook argued that this democratized information. You saw what your friends wanted you to see, not what some editor in a Times Square tower chose. But it's hard to argue that this wasn't an editorial decision. It may be one of the biggest ever made.</p><p>In any case, Facebook's move into news set off yet another explosion of ways that people could connect. Now Facebook was the place where publications could connect with their readers-and also where Macedonian teenagers could connect with voters in America, and operatives in Saint Petersburg could connect with audiences of their own choosing in a way that no one at the company had ever seen before.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">III</emphasis></p><p>In February of 2016, just as the Trending Topics fiasco was building up steam, Roger McNamee became one of the first Facebook insiders to notice strange things happening on the platform. McNamee was an early investor in Facebook who had mentored Zuckerberg through two crucial decisions: to turn down Yahoo's offer of $1 billion to acquire Facebook in 2006; and to hire a Google executive named Sheryl Sandberg in 2008 to help find a business model. McNamee was no longer in touch with Zuckerberg much, but he was still an investor, and that month he started seeing things related to the Bernie Sanders campaign that worried him. \"I'm observing memes ostensibly coming out of a Facebook group associated with the Sanders campaign that couldn't possibly have been from the Sanders campaign,\" he recalls, \"and yet they were organized and spreading in such a way that suggested somebody had a budget. And I'm sitting there thinking, 'That's really weird. I mean, that's not good.' \"</p><p>But McNamee didn't say anything to anyone at Facebook-at least not yet. And the company itself was not picking up on any such worrying signals, save for one blip on its radar: In early 2016, its security team noticed an uptick in Russian actors attempting to steal the credentials of journalists and public figures. Facebook reported this to the FBI. But the company says it never heard back from the government, and that was that.</p><p>Instead, Facebook spent the spring of 2016 very busily fending off accusations that it might influence the elections in a completely different way. When Gizmodo published its story about political bias on the Trending Topics team in May, the article went off like a bomb in Menlo Park. It quickly reached millions of readers and, in a delicious irony, appeared in the Trending Topics module itself. But the bad press wasn't what really rattled Facebook-it was the letter from John Thune, a Republican US senator from South Dakota, that followed the story's publication. Thune chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, which in turn oversees the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that has been especially active in investigating Facebook. The senator wanted Facebook's answers to the allegations of bias, and he wanted them promptly.</p><p>The Thune letter put Facebook on high alert. The company promptly dispatched senior Washington staffers to meet with Thune's team. Then it sent him a 12-page single-spaced letter explaining that it had conducted a thorough review of Trending Topics and determined that the allegations in the Gizmodo story were largely false.</p><p>Facebook decided, too, that it had to extend an olive branch to the entire American right wing, much of which was raging about the company's supposed perfidy. And so, just over a week after the story ran, Facebook scrambled to invite a group of 17 prominent Republicans out to Menlo Park. The list included television hosts, radio stars, think tankers, and an adviser to the Trump campaign. The point was partly to get feedback. But more than that, the company wanted to make a show of apologizing for its sins, lifting up the back of its shirt, and asking for the lash.</p><p>According to a Facebook employee involved in planning the meeting, part of the goal was to bring in a group of conservatives who were certain to fight with one another. They made sure to have libertarians who wouldn't want to regulate the platform and partisans who would. Another goal, according to the employee, was to make sure the attendees were \"bored to death\" by a technical presentation after Zuckerberg and Sandberg had addressed the group.</p><p>The power went out, and the room got uncomfortably hot. But otherwise the meeting went according to plan. The guests did indeed fight, and they failed to unify in a way that was either threatening or coherent. Some wanted the company to set hiring quotas for conservative employees; others thought that idea was nuts. As often happens when outsiders meet with Facebook, people used the time to try to figure out how they could get more followers for their own pages.</p><p>Afterward, Glenn Beck, one of the invitees, wrote an essay about the meeting, praising Zuckerberg. \"I asked him if Facebook, now or in the future, would be an open platform for the sharing of all ideas or a curator of content,\" Beck wrote. \"Without hesitation, with clarity and boldness, Mark said there is only one Facebook and one path forward: 'We are an open platform.'\"</p><p>Inside Facebook itself, the backlash around Trending Topics did inspire some genuine soul-searching. But none of it got very far. A quiet internal project, codenamed Hudson, cropped up around this time to determine, according to someone who worked on it, whether News Feed should be modified to better deal with some of the most complex issues facing the product. Does it favor posts that make people angry? Does it favor simple or even false ideas over complex and true ones? Those are hard questions, and the company didn't have answers to them yet. Ultimately, in late June, Facebook announced a modest change: The algorithm would be revised to favor posts from friends and family. At the same time, Adam Mosseri, Facebook's News Feed boss, posted a manifesto titled \"Building a Better News Feed for You.\" People inside Facebook spoke of it as a document roughly resembling the Magna Carta; the company had never spoken before about how News Feed really worked. To outsiders, though, the document came across as boilerplate. It said roughly what you'd expect: that the company was opposed to clickbait but that it wasn't in the business of favoring certain kinds of viewpoints.</p><p>The most important consequence of the Trending Topics controversy, according to nearly a dozen former and current employees, was that Facebook became wary of doing anything that might look like stifling conservative news. It had burned its fingers once and didn't want to do it again. And so a summer of deeply partisan rancor and calumny began with Facebook eager to stay out of the fray.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IV</emphasis></p><p>Shortly after Mosseri published his guide to News Feed values, Zuckerberg traveled to Sun Valley, Idaho, for an annual conference hosted by billionaire Herb Allen, where moguls in short sleeves and sunglasses cavort and make plans to buy each other's companies. But Rupert Murdoch broke the mood in a meeting that took place inside his villa. According to numerous accounts of the conversation, Murdoch and Robert Thomson, the CEO of News Corp, explained to Zuckerberg that they had long been unhappy with Facebook and Google. The two tech giants had taken nearly the entire digital ad market and become an existential threat to serious journalism. According to people familiar with the conversation, the two News Corp leaders accused Facebook of making dramatic changes to its core algorithm without adequately consulting its media partners, wreaking havoc according to Zuckerberg's whims. If Facebook didn't start offering a better deal to the publishing industry, Thomson and Murdoch conveyed in stark terms, Zuckerberg could expect News Corp executives to become much more public in their denunciations and much more open in their lobbying. They had helped to make things very hard for Google in Europe. And they could do the same for Facebook in the US.</p><p>Facebook thought that News Corp was threatening to push for a government antitrust investigation or maybe an inquiry into whether the company deserved its protection from liability as a neutral platform. Inside Facebook, executives believed Murdoch might use his papers and TV stations to amplify critiques of the company. News Corp says that was not at all the case; the company threatened to deploy executives, but not its journalists.</p><p>Zuckerberg took Murdoch's threats seriously-he had firsthand knowledge of the older man's skill in the dark arts.</p><p>Zuckerberg had reason to take the meeting especially seriously, according to a former Facebook executive, because he had firsthand knowledge of Murdoch's skill in the dark arts. Back in 2007, Facebook had come under criticism from 49 state attorneys general for failing to protect young Facebook users from sexual predators and inappropriate content. Concerned parents had written to Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal, who opened an investigation, and to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis>, which published a story. But according to a former Facebook executive in a position to know, the company believed that many of the Facebook accounts and the predatory behavior the letters referenced were fakes, traceable to News Corp lawyers or others working for Murdoch, who owned Facebook's biggest competitor, MySpace. \"We traced the creation of the Facebook accounts to IP addresses at the Apple store a block away from the MySpace offices in Santa Monica,\" the executive says. \"Facebook then traced interactions with those accounts to News Corp lawyers. When it comes to Facebook, Murdoch has been playing every angle he can for a long time.\" (Both News Corp and its spinoff 21st Century Fox declined to comment.)</p><p>When Zuckerberg returned from Sun Valley, he told his employees that things had to change. They still weren't in the news business, but they had to make sure there would <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">be</emphasis> a news business. And they had to communicate better. One of those who got a new to-do list was Andrew Anker, a product manager who'd arrived at Facebook in 2015 after a career in journalism (including a long stint at WIRED in the '90s). One of his jobs was to help the company think through how publishers could make money on the platform. Shortly after Sun Valley, Anker met with Zuckerberg and asked to hire 60 new people to work on partnerships with the news industry. Before the meeting ended, the request was approved.</p><p>But having more people out talking to publishers just drove home how hard it would be to resolve the financial problems Murdoch wanted fixed. News outfits were spending millions to produce stories that Facebook was benefiting from, and Facebook, they felt, was giving too little back in return. Instant Articles, in particular, struck them as a Trojan horse. Publishers complained that they could make more money from stories that loaded on their own mobile web pages than on Facebook Instant. (They often did so, it turned out, in ways that short-changed advertisers, by sneaking in ads that readers were unlikely to see. Facebook didn't let them get away with that.) Another seemingly irreconcilable difference: Outlets like Murdoch's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wall Street Journal</emphasis> depended on paywalls to make money, but Instant Articles banned paywalls; Zuckerberg disapproved of them. After all, he would often ask, how exactly do walls and toll booths make the world more open and connected?</p><p>The conversations often ended at an impasse, but Facebook was at least becoming more attentive. This newfound appreciation for the concerns of journalists did not, however, extend to the journalists on Facebook's own Trending Topics team. In late August, everyone on the team was told that their jobs were being eliminated. Simultaneously, authority over the algorithm shifted to a team of engineers based in Seattle. Very quickly the module started to surface lies and fiction. A headline days later read, \"FOX NEWS EXPOSES TRAITOR MEGYN KELLY, KICKS HER OUT FOR BACKING HILLARY.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">V</emphasis></p><p>While Facebook grappled internally with what it was becoming-a company that dominated media but didn't want to be a media company-Donald Trump's presidential campaign staff faced no such confusion. To them Facebook's use was obvious. Twitter was a tool for communicating directly with supporters and yelling at the media. Facebook was the way to run the most effective direct-marketing political operation in history.</p><p>In the summer of 2016, at the top of the general election campaign, Trump's digital operation might have seemed to be at a major disadvantage. After all, Hillary Clinton's team was flush with elite talent and got advice from Eric Schmidt, known for running Google. Trump's was run by Brad Parscale, known for setting up the Eric Trump Foundation's web page. Trump's social media director was his former caddie. But in 2016, it turned out you didn't need digital experience running a presidential campaign, you just needed a knack for Facebook.</p><p>Over the course of the summer, Trump's team turned the platform into one of its primary vehicles for fund-raising. The campaign uploaded its voter files-the names, addresses, voting history, and any other information it had on potential voters-to Facebook. Then, using a tool called Lookalike Audiences, Facebook identified the broad characteristics of, say, people who had signed up for Trump newsletters or bought Trump hats. That allowed the campaign to send ads to people with similar traits. Trump would post simple messages like \"This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!\" that got hundreds of thousands of likes, comments, and shares. The money rolled in. Clinton's wonkier messages, meanwhile, resonated less on the platform. Inside Facebook, almost everyone on the executive team wanted Clinton to win; but they knew that Trump was using the platform better. If he was the candidate for Facebook, she was the candidate for LinkedIn.</p><p>Trump's candidacy also proved to be a wonderful tool for a new class of scammers pumping out massively viral and entirely fake stories. Through trial and error, they learned that memes praising the former host of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Apprentice</emphasis> got many more readers than ones praising the former secretary of state. A website called Ending the Fed proclaimed that the Pope had endorsed Trump and got almost a million comments, shares, and reactions on Facebook, according to an analysis by BuzzFeed. Other stories asserted that the former first lady had quietly been selling weapons to ISIS, and that an FBI agent suspected of leaking Clinton's emails was found dead. Some of the posts came from hyperpartisan Americans. Some came from overseas content mills that were in it purely for the ad dollars. By the end of the campaign, the top fake stories on the platform were generating more engagement than the top real ones.</p><p>Even current Facebookers acknowledge now that they missed what should have been obvious signs of people misusing the platform. And looking back, it's easy to put together a long list of possible explanations for the myopia in Menlo Park about fake news. Management was gun-shy because of the Trending Topics fiasco; taking action against partisan disinformation-or even identifying it as such-might have been seen as another act of political favoritism. Facebook also sold ads against the stories, and sensational garbage was good at pulling people into the platform. Employees' bonuses can be based largely on whether Facebook hits certain growth and revenue targets, which gives people an extra incentive not to worry too much about things that are otherwise good for engagement. And then there was the ever-present issue of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. If the company started taking responsibility for fake news, it might have to take responsibility for a lot more. Facebook had plenty of reasons to keep its head in the sand.</p><p>Roger McNamee, however, watched carefully as the nonsense spread. First there were the fake stories pushing Bernie Sanders, then he saw ones supporting Brexit, and then helping Trump. By the end of the summer, he had resolved to write an op-ed about the problems on the platform. But he never ran it. \"The idea was, look, these are my friends. I really want to help them.\" And so on a Sunday evening, nine days before the 2016 election, McNamee emailed a 1,000-word letter to Sandberg and Zuckerberg. \"I am really sad about Facebook,\" it began. \"I got involved with the company more than a decade ago and have taken great pride and joy in the company's success &amp;#230; until the past few months. Now I am disappointed. I am embarrassed. I am ashamed.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VI</emphasis></p><p>It's not easy to recognize that the machine you've built to bring people together is being used to tear them apart, and Mark Zuckerberg's initial reaction to Trump's victory, and Facebook's possible role in it, was one of peevish dismissal. Executives remember panic the first few days, with the leadership team scurrying back and forth between Zuckerberg's conference room (called the Aquarium) and Sandberg's (called Only Good News), trying to figure out what had just happened and whether they would be blamed. Then, at a conference two days after the election, Zuckerberg argued that filter bubbles are worse offline than on Facebook and that social media hardly influences how people vote. \"The idea that fake news on Facebook-of which, you know, it's a very small amount of the content-influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,\" he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg declined to be interviewed for this article, but people who know him well say he likes to form his opinions from data. And in this case he wasn't without it. Before the interview, his staff had worked up a back-of-the-envelope calculation showing that fake news was a tiny percentage of the total amount of election-related content on the platform. But the analysis was just an aggregate look at the percentage of clearly fake stories that appeared across all of Facebook. It didn't measure their influence or the way fake news affected specific groups. It was a number, but not a particularly meaningful one.</p><p>Zuckerberg's comments did not go over well, even inside Facebook. They seemed clueless and self-absorbed. \"What he said was incredibly damaging,\" a former executive told WIRED. \"We had to really flip him on that. We realized that if we didn't, the company was going to start heading down this pariah path that Uber was on.\"</p><p>A week after his \"pretty crazy\" comment, Zuckerberg flew to Peru to give a talk to world leaders about the ways that connecting more people to the internet, and to Facebook, could reduce global poverty. Right after he landed in Lima, he posted something of a mea culpa. He explained that Facebook did take misinformation seriously, and he presented a vague seven-point plan to tackle it. When a professor at the New School named David Carroll saw Zuckerberg's post, he took a screenshot. Alongside it on Carroll's feed ran a headline from a fake CNN with an image of a distressed Donald Trump and the text \"DISQUALIFIED; He's GONE!\"</p><p>At the conference in Peru, Zuckerberg met with a man who knows a few things about politics: Barack Obama. Media reports portrayed the encounter as one in which the lame-duck president pulled Zuckerberg aside and gave him a \"wake-up call\" about fake news. But according to someone who was with them in Lima, it was Zuckerberg who called the meeting, and his agenda was merely to convince Obama that, yes, Facebook was serious about dealing with the problem. He truly wanted to thwart misinformation, he said, but it wasn't an easy issue to solve.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Facebook, the gears churned. For the first time, insiders really began to question whether they had too much power. One employee told WIRED that, watching Zuckerberg, he was reminded of Lennie in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Of Mice and Men</emphasis>, the farm-worker with no understanding of his own strength.</p><p>Very soon after the election, a team of employees started working on something called the News Feed Integrity Task Force, inspired by a sense, one of them told WIRED, that hyperpartisan misinformation was \"a disease that's creeping into the entire platform.\" The group, which included Mosseri and Anker, began to meet every day, using whiteboards to outline different ways they could respond to the fake-news crisis. Within a few weeks the company announced it would cut off advertising revenue for ad farms and make it easier for users to flag stories they thought false.</p><p>In December the company announced that, for the first time, it would introduce fact-checking onto the platform. Facebook didn't want to check facts itself; instead it would outsource the problem to professionals. If Facebook received enough signals that a story was false, it would automatically be sent to partners, like Snopes, for review. Then, in early January, Facebook announced that it had hired Campbell Brown, a former anchor at CNN. She immediately became the most prominent journalist hired by the company.</p><p>One employee compared Zuckerberg to Lennie in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Of Mice and Men</emphasis>-a man with no understanding of his own strength.</p><p>Soon Brown was put in charge of something called the Facebook Journalism Project. \"We spun it up over the holidays, essentially,\" says one person involved in discussions about the project. The aim was to demonstrate that Facebook was thinking hard about its role in the future of journalism-essentially, it was a more public and organized version of the efforts the company had begun after Murdoch's tongue-lashing. But sheer anxiety was also part of the motivation. \"After the election, because Trump won, the media put a ton of attention on fake news and just started hammering us. People started panicking and getting afraid that regulation was coming. So the team looked at what Google had been doing for years with News Lab\"-a group inside Alphabet that builds tools for journalists-\"and we decided to figure out how we could put together our own packaged program that shows how seriously we take the future of news.\"</p><p>Facebook was reluctant, however, to issue any mea culpas or action plans with regard to the problem of filter bubbles or Facebook's noted propensity to serve as a tool for amplifying outrage. Members of the leadership team regarded these as issues that couldn't be solved, and maybe even shouldn't be solved. Was Facebook really more at fault for amplifying outrage during the election than, say, Fox News or MSNBC? Sure, you could put stories into people's feeds that contradicted their political viewpoints, but people would turn away from them, just as surely as they'd flip the dial back if their TV quietly switched them from Sean Hannity to Joy Reid. The problem, as Anker puts it, \"is not Facebook. It's humans.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VII</emphasis></p><p>Zuckerberg's \"pretty crazy\" statement about fake news caught the ear of a lot of people, but one of the most influential was a security researcher named Ren\u00e9e DiResta. For years, she'd been studying how misinformation spreads on the platform. If you joined an antivaccine group on Facebook, she observed, the platform might suggest that you join flat-earth groups or maybe ones devoted to Pizzagate-putting you on a conveyor belt of conspiracy thinking. Zuckerberg's statement struck her as wildly out of touch. \"How can this platform say this thing?\" she remembers thinking.</p><p>Roger McNamee, meanwhile, was getting steamed at Facebook's response to his letter. Zuckerberg and Sandberg had written him back promptly, but they hadn't said anything substantial. Instead he ended up having a months-long, ultimately futile set of email exchanges with Dan Rose, Facebook's VP for partnerships. McNamee says Rose's message was polite but also very firm: The company was doing a lot of good work that McNamee couldn't see, and in any event Facebook was a platform, not a media company.</p><p>\"And I'm sitting there going, 'Guys, seriously, I don't think that's how it works,'\" McNamee says. \"You can assert till you're blue in the face that you're a platform, but if your users take a different point of view, it doesn't matter what you assert.\"</p><p>As the saying goes, heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, and McNamee's concern soon became a cause-and the beginning of an alliance. In April 2017 he connected with a former Google design ethicist named Tristan Harris when they appeared together on Bloomberg TV. Harris had by then gained a national reputation as the conscience of Silicon Valley. He had been profiled on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">60 Minutes</emphasis> and in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Atlantic</emphasis>, and he spoke eloquently about the subtle tricks that social media companies use to foster an addiction to their services. \"They can amplify the worst aspects of human nature,\" Harris told WIRED this past December. After the TV appearance, McNamee says he called Harris up and asked, \"Dude, do you need a wingman?\"</p><p>The next month, DiResta published an article comparing purveyors of disinformation on social media to manipulative high-frequency traders in financial markets. \"Social networks enable malicious actors to operate at platform scale, because they were designed for fast information flows and virality,\" she wrote. Bots and sock puppets could cheaply \"create the illusion of a mass groundswell of grassroots activity,\" in much the same way that early, now-illegal trading algorithms could spoof demand for a stock. Harris read the article, was impressed, and emailed her.</p><p>The three were soon out talking to anyone who would listen about Facebook's poisonous effects on American democracy. And before long they found receptive audiences in the media and Congress-groups with their own mounting grievances against the social media giant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VIII</emphasis></p><p>Even at the best of times, meetings between Facebook and media executives can feel like unhappy family gatherings. The two sides are inextricably bound together, but they don't like each other all that much. News executives resent that Facebook and Google have captured roughly three-quarters of the digital ad business, leaving the media industry and other platforms, like Twitter, to fight over scraps. Plus they feel like the preferences of Facebook's algorithm have pushed the industry to publish ever-dumber stories. For years, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis> resented that Facebook helped elevate BuzzFeed; now BuzzFeed is angry about being displaced by clickbait.</p><p>And then there's the simple, deep fear and mistrust that Facebook inspires. Every publisher knows that, at best, they are sharecroppers on Facebook's massive industrial farm. The social network is roughly 200 times more valuable than the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis>. And journalists know that the man who owns the farm has the leverage. If Facebook wanted to, it could quietly turn any number of dials that would harm a publisher-by manipulating its traffic, its ad network, or its readers.</p><p>Emissaries from Facebook, for their part, find it tiresome to be lectured by people who can't tell an algorithm from an API. They also know that Facebook didn't win the digital ad market through luck: It built a better ad product. And in their darkest moments, they wonder: What's the point? News makes up only about 5 percent of the total content that people see on Facebook globally. The company could let it all go and its shareholders would scarcely notice. And there's another, deeper problem: Mark Zuckerberg, according to people who know him, prefers to think about the future. He's less interested in the news industry's problems right now; he's interested in the problems five or 20 years from now. The editors of major media companies, on the other hand, are worried about their next quarter-maybe even their next phone call. When they bring lunch back to their desks, they know not to buy green bananas.</p><p>This mutual wariness-sharpened almost to enmity in the wake of the election-did not make life easy for Campbell Brown when she started her new job running the nascent Facebook Journalism Project. The first item on her to-do list was to head out on yet another Facebook listening tour with editors and publishers. One editor describes a fairly typical meeting: Brown and Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, invited a group of media leaders to gather in late January 2017 at Brown's apartment in Manhattan. Cox, a quiet, suave man, sometimes referred to as \"the Ryan Gosling of Facebook Product,\" took the brunt of the ensuing abuse. \"Basically, a bunch of us just laid into him about how Facebook was destroying journalism, and he graciously absorbed it,\" the editor says. \"He didn't much try to defend them. I think the point was really to show up and seem to be listening.\" Other meetings were even more tense, with the occasional comment from journalists noting their interest in digital antitrust issues.</p><p>As bruising as all this was, Brown's team became more confident that their efforts were valued within the company when Zuckerberg published a 5,700-word corporate manifesto in February. He had spent the previous three months, according to people who know him, contemplating whether he had created something that did more harm than good. \"Are we building the world we all want?\" he asked at the beginning of his post, implying that the answer was an obvious no. Amid sweeping remarks about \"building a global community,\" he emphasized the need to keep people informed and to knock out false news and clickbait. Brown and others at Facebook saw the manifesto as a sign that Zuckerberg understood the company's profound civic responsibilities. Others saw the document as blandly grandiose, showcasing Zuckerberg's tendency to suggest that the answer to nearly any problem is for people to use Facebook more.</p><p>Shortly after issuing the manifesto, Zuckerberg set off on a carefully scripted listening tour of the country. He began popping into candy shops and dining rooms in red states, camera crew and personal social media team in tow. He wrote an earnest post about what he was learning, and he deflected questions about whether his real goal was to become president. It seemed like a well-meaning effort to win friends for Facebook. But it soon became clear that Facebook's biggest problems emanated from places farther away than Ohio.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IX</emphasis></p><p>One of the many things Zuckerberg seemed not to grasp when he wrote his manifesto was that his platform had empowered an enemy far more sophisticated than Macedonian teenagers and assorted low-rent purveyors of bull. As 2017 wore on, however, the company began to realize it had been attacked by a foreign influence operation. \"I would draw a real distinction between fake news and the Russia stuff,\" says an executive who worked on the company's response to both. \"With the latter there was a moment where everyone said 'Oh, holy shit, this is like a national security situation.'\"</p><p>That holy shit moment, though, didn't come until more than six months after the election. Early in the campaign season, Facebook was aware of familiar attacks emanating from known Russian hackers, such as the group APT28, which is believed to be affiliated with Moscow. They were hacking into accounts outside of Facebook, stealing documents, then creating fake Facebook accounts under the banner of DCLeaks, to get people to discuss what they'd stolen. The company saw no signs of a serious, concerted foreign propaganda campaign, but it also didn't think to look for one.</p><p>During the spring of 2017, the company's security team began preparing a report about how Russian and other foreign intelligence operations had used the platform. One of its authors was Alex Stamos, head of Facebook's security team. Stamos was something of an icon in the tech world for having reportedly resigned from his previous job at Yahoo after a conflict over whether to grant a US intelligence agency access to Yahoo servers. According to two people with direct knowledge of the document, he was eager to publish a detailed, specific analysis of what the company had found. But members of the policy and communications team pushed back and cut his report way down. Sources close to the security team suggest the company didn't want to get caught up in the political whirlwind of the moment. (Sources on the politics and communications teams insist they edited the report down, just because the darn thing was hard to read.)</p><p>On April 27, 2017, the day after the Senate announced it was calling then FBI director James Comey to testify about the Russia investigation, Stamos' report came out. It was titled \"Information Operations and Facebook,\" and it gave a careful step-by-step explanation of how a foreign adversary could use Facebook to manipulate people. But there were few specific examples or details, and there was no direct mention of Russia. It felt bland and cautious. As Ren\u00e9e DiResta says, \"I remember seeing the report come out and thinking, 'Oh, goodness, is this the best they could do in six months?'\"</p><p>One month later, a story in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Time</emphasis> suggested to Stamos' team that they might have missed something in their analysis. The article quoted an unnamed senior intelligence official saying that Russian operatives had bought ads on Facebook to target Americans with propaganda. Around the same time, the security team also picked up hints from congressional investigators that made them think an intelligence agency was indeed looking into Russian Facebook ads. Caught off guard, the team members started to dig into the company's archival ads data themselves.</p><p>Eventually, by sorting transactions according to a series of data points-Were ads purchased in rubles? Were they purchased within browsers whose language was set to Russian?-they were able to find a cluster of accounts, funded by a shadowy Russian group called the Internet Research Agency, that had been designed to manipulate political opinion in America. There was, for example, a page called Heart of Texas, which pushed for the secession of the Lone Star State. And there was Blacktivist, which pushed stories about police brutality against black men and women and had more followers than the verified Black Lives Matter page.</p><p>Numerous security researchers express consternation that it took Facebook so long to realize how the Russian troll farm was exploiting the platform. After all, the group was well known to Facebook. Executives at the company say they're embarrassed by how long it took them to find the fake accounts, but they point out that they were never given help by US intelligence agencies. A staffer on the Senate Intelligence Committee likewise voiced exasperation with the company. \"It seemed obvious that it was a tactic the Russians would exploit,\" the staffer says.</p><p>When Facebook finally did find the Russian propaganda on its platform, the discovery set off a crisis, a scramble, and a great deal of confusion. First, due to a miscalculation, word initially spread through the company that the Russian group had spent millions of dollars on ads, when the actual total was in the low six figures. Once that error was resolved, a disagreement broke out over how much to reveal, and to whom. The company could release the data about the ads to the public, release everything to Congress, or release nothing. Much of the argument hinged on questions of user privacy. Members of the security team worried that the legal process involved in handing over private user data, even if it belonged to a Russian troll farm, would open the door for governments to seize data from other Facebook users later on. \"There was a real debate internally,\" says one executive. \"Should we just say 'Fuck it' and not worry?\" But eventually the company decided it would be crazy to throw legal caution to the wind \"just because Rachel Maddow wanted us to.\"</p><p>Ultimately, a blog post appeared under Stamos' name in early September announcing that, as far as the company could tell, the Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 for roughly 3,000 ads aimed at influencing American politics around the time of the 2016 election. Every sentence in the post seemed to downplay the substance of these new revelations: The number of ads was small, the expense was small. And Facebook wasn't going to release them. The public wouldn't know what they looked like or what they were really aimed at doing.</p><p>This didn't sit at all well with DiResta. She had long felt that Facebook was insufficiently forthcoming, and now it seemed to be flat-out stonewalling. \"That was when it went from incompetence to malice,\" she says. A couple of weeks later, while waiting at a Walgreens to pick up a prescription for one of her kids, she got a call from a researcher at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism named Jonathan Albright. He had been mapping ecosystems of misinformation since the election, and he had some excellent news. \"I found this thing,\" he said. Albright had started digging into CrowdTangle, one of the analytics platforms that Facebook uses. And he had discovered that the data from six of the accounts Facebook had shut down were still there, frozen in a state of suspended animation. There were the posts pushing for Texas secession and playing on racial antipathy. And then there were political posts, like one that referred to Clinton as \"that murderous anti-American traitor Killary.\" Right before the election, the Blacktivist account urged its supporters to stay away from Clinton and instead vote for Jill Stein. Albright downloaded the most recent 500 posts from each of the six groups. He reported that, in total, their posts had been shared more than 340 million times.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">X</emphasis></p><p>To McNamee, the way the Russians used the platform was neither a surprise nor an anomaly. \"They find 100 or 1,000 people who are angry and afraid and then use Facebook's tools to advertise to get people into groups,\" he says. \"That's exactly how Facebook was designed to be used.\"</p><p>McNamee and Harris had first traveled to DC for a day in July to meet with members of Congress. Then, in September, they were joined by DiResta and began spending all their free time counseling senators, representatives, and members of their staffs. The House and Senate Intelligence Committees were about to hold hearings on Russia's use of social media to interfere in the US election, and McNamee, Harris, and DiResta were helping them prepare. One of the early questions they weighed in on was the matter of who should be summoned to testify. Harris recommended that the CEOs of the big tech companies be called in, to create a dramatic scene in which they all stood in a neat row swearing an oath with their right hands in the air, roughly the way tobacco executives had been forced to do a generation earlier. Ultimately, though, it was determined that the general counsels of the three companies-Facebook, Twitter, and Google-should head into the lion's den.</p><p>And so on November 1, Colin Stretch arrived from Facebook to be pummeled. During the hearings themselves, DiResta was sitting on her bed in San Francisco, watching them with her headphones on, trying not to wake up her small children. She listened to the back-and-forth in Washington while chatting on Slack with other security researchers. She watched as Marco Rubio smartly asked whether Facebook even had a policy forbidding foreign governments from running an influence campaign through the platform. The answer was no. Rhode Island senator Jack Reed then asked whether Facebook felt an obligation to individually notify all the users who had seen Russian ads that they had been deceived. The answer again was no. But maybe the most threatening comment came from Dianne Feinstein, the senior senator from Facebook's home state. \"You've created these platforms, and now they're being misused, and you have to be the ones to do something about it,\" she declared. \"Or we will.\"</p><p>After the hearings, yet another dam seemed to break, and former Facebook executives started to go public with their criticisms of the company too. On November 8, billionaire entrepreneur Sean Parker, Facebook's first president, said he now regretted pushing Facebook so hard on the world. \"I don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying,\" he said. \"God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.\" Eleven days later, Facebook's former privacy manager, Sandy Parakilas, published a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> op-ed calling for the government to regulate Facebook: \"The company won't protect us by itself, and nothing less than our democracy is at stake.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XI</emphasis></p><p>The day of the hearings, Zuckerberg had to give Facebook's Q3 earnings call. The numbers were terrific, as always, but his mood was not. Normally these calls can put someone with 12 cups of coffee in them to sleep; the executive gets on and says everything is going well, even when it isn't. Zuckerberg took a different approach. \"I've expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust. We build these tools to help people connect and to bring us closer together. And they used them to try to undermine our values. What they did is wrong, and we are not going to stand for it.\" The company would be investing so much in security, he said, that Facebook would make \"significantly\" less money for a while. \"I want to be clear about what our priority is: Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.\" What the company really seeks is for users to find their experience to be \"time well spent,\" Zuckerberg said-using the three words that have become Tristan Harris' calling card, and the name of his nonprofit.</p><p>Other signs emerged, too, that Zuckerberg was beginning to absorb the criticisms of his company. The Facebook Journalism Project, for instance, seemed to be making the company take its obligations as a publisher, and not just a platform, more seriously. In the fall, the company announced that Zuckerberg had decided-after years of resisting the idea-that publishers using Facebook Instant Articles could require readers to subscribe. Paying for serious publications, in the months since the election, had come to seem like both the path forward for journalism and a way of resisting the post-truth political landscape. (WIRED recently instituted its own paywall.) Plus, offering subscriptions arguably helped put in place the kinds of incentives that Zuckerberg professed to want driving the platform. People like Alex Hardiman, the head of Facebook news products and an alum of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis>, started to recognize that Facebook had long helped to create an economic system that rewarded publishers for sensationalism, not accuracy or depth. \"If we just reward content based on raw clicks and engagement, we might actually see content that is increasingly sensationalist, clickbaity, polarizing, and divisive,\" she says. A social network that rewards only clicks, not subscriptions, is like a dating service that encourages one-night stands but not marriages.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XII</emphasis></p><p>A couple of weeks before Thanksgiving 2017, Zuckerberg called one of his quarterly all-hands meetings on the Facebook campus, in an outdoor space known as Hacker Square. He told everyone he hoped they would have a good holiday. Then he said, \"This year, with recent news, a lot of us are probably going to get asked: 'What is going on with Facebook?' This has been a tough year &amp;#230; but &amp;#230; what I know is that we're fortunate to play an important role in billions of people's lives. That's a privilege, and it puts an enormous responsibility on all of us.\" According to one attendee, the remarks came across as blunter and more personal than any they'd ever heard from Zuckerberg. He seemed humble, even a little chastened. \"I don't think he sleeps well at night,\" the employee says. \"I think he has remorse for what has happened.\"</p><p>During the late fall, criticism continued to mount: Facebook was accused of becoming a central vector for spreading deadly propaganda against the Rohingya in Myanmar and for propping up the brutal leadership of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines. And December brought another haymaker from someone closer by. Early that month, it emerged that Chamath Palihapitiya, who had been Facebook's vice president for user growth before leaving in 2011, had told an audience at Stanford that he thought social media platforms like Facebook had \"created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric\" and that he feels \"tremendous guilt\" for being part of that. He said he tries to use Facebook as little as possible and doesn't permit his children to use such platforms at all.</p><p>The criticism stung in a way that others hadn't. Palihapitiya is close to many of the top executives at Facebook, and he has deep cachet in Silicon Valley and among Facebook engineers as a part-owner of the Golden State Warriors. Sheryl Sandberg sometimes wears a chain around her neck that's welded together from one given to her by Zuckerberg and one given to her by Palihapitiya after her husband's death. The company issued a statement saying it had been a long time since Palihapitiya had worked there. \"Facebook was a very different company back then and as we have grown we have realized how our responsibilities have grown too.\" Asked why the company had responded to Palihapitiya, and not to others, a senior Facebook executive said, \"Chamath is-was-a friend to a lot of people here.\"</p><p>Roger McNamee, meanwhile, went on a media tour lambasting the company. He published an essay in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Monthly</emphasis> and then followed up in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis>. Facebook was less impressed with him. Executives considered him to be overstating his connection to the company and dining out on his criticism. Andrew Bosworth, a VP and member of the management team, tweeted, \"I've worked at Facebook for 12 years and I have to ask: Who the fuck is Roger McNamee?\"</p><p>Zuckerberg did seem to be eager to mend one fence, though. Around this time, a team of Facebook executives gathered for dinner with executives from News Corp at the Grill, an upscale restaurant in Manhattan. Right at the start, Zuckerberg raised a toast to Murdoch. He spoke charmingly about reading a biography of the older man and of admiring his accomplishments. Then he described a game of tennis he'd once played against Murdoch. At first he had thought it would be easy to hit the ball with a man more than 50 years his senior. But he quickly realized, he said, that Murdoch was there to compete.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">XIII</emphasis></p><p>On January 4, 2018, Zuckerberg announced that he had a new personal challenge for the year. For each of the past nine years, he had committed himself to some kind of self-improvement. His first challenge was farcical-wear ties-and the others had been a little preening and collegiate. He wanted to learn Mandarin, read 25 books, run 365 miles. This year, though, he took a severe tone. \"The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do-whether it's protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation-states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent,\" Zuckerberg declared. The language wasn't original-he had borrowed from Tristan Harris again-but it was, by the accounts of many people around him, entirely sincere.</p><p>That New Year's challenge, it turned out, was a bit of carefully considered choreography setting up a series of announcements, starting with a declaration the following week that the News Feed algorithm would be rejiggered to favor \"meaningful interactions.\" Posts and videos of the sort that make us look or like-but not comment or care-would be deprioritized. The idea, explained Adam Mosseri, is that, online, \"interacting with people is positively correlated with a lot of measures of well-being, whereas passively consuming content online is less so.\"</p><p>To numerous people at the company, the announcement marked a huge departure. Facebook was putting a car in reverse that had been driving at full speed in one direction for 14 years. Since the beginning, Zuckerberg's ambition had been to create another internet, or perhaps another world, inside of Facebook, and to get people to use it as much as possible. The business model was based on advertising, and advertising was insatiably hungry for people's time. But now Zuckerberg said he expected these new changes to News Feed would make people use Facebook <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">less</emphasis>.</p><p>The announcement was hammered by many in the press. During the rollout, Mosseri explained that Facebook would downgrade stories shared by businesses, celebrities, and publishers, and prioritize stories shared by friends and family. Critics surmised that these changes were just a way of finally giving the publishing industry a middle finger. \"Facebook has essentially told media to kiss off,\" Franklin Foer wrote in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Atlantic</emphasis>. \"Facebook will be back primarily in the business of making us feel terrible about the inferiority of our vacations, the relative mediocrity of our children, teasing us into sharing more of our private selves.\"</p><p>But inside Facebook, executives insist this isn't remotely the case. According to Anker, who retired from the company in December but worked on these changes, and who has great affection for the management team, \"It would be a mistake to see this as a retreat from the news industry. This is a retreat from 'Anything goes if it works with our algorithm to drive up engagement.'\" According to others still at the company, Zuckerberg didn't want to pull back from actual journalism. He just genuinely wanted there to be less crap on the platform: fewer stories with no substance; fewer videos you can watch without thinking.</p><p>And then, a week after telling the world about \"meaningful interactions,\" Zuckerberg announced another change that seemed to answer these concerns, after a fashion. For the first time in the company's history, he said in a note posted to his personal page, Facebook will start to boost certain publishers-ones whose content is \"trustworthy, informative, and local.\" For the past year, Facebook has been developing algorithms to hammer publishers whose content is fake; now it's trying to elevate what's good. For starters, he explained, the company would use reader surveys to determine which sources are trustworthy. That system, critics were quick to point out, will surely be gamed, and many people will say they trust sources just because they recognize them. But this announcement, at least, went over a little better in boardrooms and newsrooms. Right after the post went up, the stock price of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times</emphasis> shot up-as did that of News Corp.</p><p>People who know him say Zuckerberg has truly been altered in the crucible of the past several months.</p><p>Zuckerberg has hinted-and insiders have confirmed-that we should expect a year of more announcements like this. The company is experimenting with giving publishers more control over paywalls and allowing them to feature their logos more prominently to reestablish the brand identities that Facebook flattened years ago. One somewhat hostile outside suggestion has come from Facebook's old antagonist Murdoch, who said in late January that if Facebook truly valued \"trustworthy\" publishers, it should pay them carriage fees.</p><p>The fate that Facebook really cares about, however, is its own. It was built on the power of network effects: You joined because everyone else was joining. But network effects can be just as powerful in driving people off a platform. Zuckerberg understands this viscerally. After all, he helped create those problems for MySpace a decade ago and is arguably doing the same to Snap today. Zuckerberg has avoided that fate, in part, because he has proven brilliant at co-opting his biggest threats. When social media started becoming driven by images, he bought Instagram. When messaging took off, he bought WhatsApp. When Snapchat became a threat, he copied it. Now, with all his talk of \"time well spent,\" it seems as if he's trying to co-opt Tristan Harris too.</p><p>But people who know him say that Zuckerberg has truly been altered in the crucible of the past several months. He has thought deeply; he has reckoned with what happened; and he truly cares that his company fix the problems swirling around it. And he's also worried. \"This whole year has massively changed his personal techno-optimism,\" says an executive at the company. \"It has made him much more paranoid about the ways that people could abuse the thing that he built.\"</p><p>The past year has also altered Facebook's fundamental understanding about whether it's a publisher or a platform. The company has always answered that question defiantly-platform, platform, platform-for regulatory, financial, and maybe even emotional reasons. But now, gradually, Facebook has evolved. Of course it's a platform, and always will be. But the company also realizes now that it bears some of the responsibilities that a publisher does: for the care of its readers, and for the care of the truth. You can't make the world more open and connected if you're breaking it apart. So what is it: publisher or platform? Facebook seems to have finally recognized that it is quite clearly both.</p><h>Facebook's Reckoning</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Two years that forced the platform to change</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">by Blanca Myers</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2016</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">March</emphasis><br/>Facebook suspends Benjamin Fearnow, a journalist-curator for the platform's Trending Topics feed, after he leaks to Gizmodo.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">May</emphasis><br/>Gizmodo reports that Trending Topics \"routinely suppressed conservative news.\" The story sends Facebook scrambling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2016</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">July</emphasis><br/>Rupert Murdoch tells Zuckerberg that Facebook is wreaking havoc on the news industry and threatens to cause trouble.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">August</emphasis><br/>Facebook cuts loose all of its Trending Topics journalists, ceding authority over the feed to engineers in Seattle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">November</emphasis><br/>Donald Trump wins.

Dozens of states, expected to target Google in an antitrust investigation.</p><p>[10:35:17]</p><p>HARLOW: All right, welcome back. This morning, big tech under the microscope. As many as 40 state attorneys general, expected, today, to announce an antitrust probe, targeting Google. They'll reportedly look into whether Google has stifled competition, harmed consumers.</p><p>SCIUTTO: A separate group of states announced a probe into Facebook's dominance on Friday. Joining us now to discuss, Douglas Gansler. He's a former Maryland attorney general. Doug, always good to have you on.</p><p>So my layman's understanding of the way antitrust law has been, is that for years, it's been focused on price. And if, you know, oligopolies or monopolies, whatever, aren't driving up price, they kind of -- they give leeway. But are these indications that that thinking is changing, that there are other forms of dominance that affects consumers like you and me and need to be challenged?</p><p>DOUGLAS GANSLER, FORMER MARYLAND ATTORNEY GENERAL: I mean, not really. And that's why this case is actually going to be very tricky for the state attorneys general. There's two things, in your layman's understanding of antitrust. One thing you have to show is, there's a market share problem.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>GANSLER: And what is -- where is the dominance. And, here, what they're looking at, purportedly (ph), is advertising. And companies can advertise everywhere. They can advertise on CNN, \"The New York Times,\" they can advertise other places and other platforms on the internet.</p><p>So they're going to have to -- that's one hurdle they're going to get -- have to go after. And the second is the pricing. And what's interesting about Facebook, Google and other big tech, is it's free. And New York Attorney General Tish James, for example, said they're trying to protect consumer data from being endangered.</p><p>The question is, what is the harm? And in this case --</p><p>HARLOW: Well --</p><p>GANSLER: -- it's -- go ahead.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, I just think it's free. I mean, nothing's free. Your data is actually --</p><p>SCIUTTO: Your information, yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- a product, right? And that's the -- that's the counterargument here, Doug. And you made the good point that when you look back at the Microsoft probe, it was the states that really helped, you know, five leverage to the Feds in that one, that the states' investigation actually helped on that front.</p><p>And to Jim's point, I just wonder if we're at a point where the definition of antitrust has to change. At your alma mater, Yale, there was this big paper that got a lot of attention, \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" by Lena Khan. And she's saying the way that these tech companies work and that our data is an actual commodity, means that you have to change the definition of antitrust at its heart. Do you agree with that?</p><p>GANSLER: Well, that may be, but that would be a legislative fix, not the state attorneys general bringing cases in --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, true.</p><p>GANSLER: -- North Dakota or Delaware. And -- but just going back to on the cost thing, because I think that's important. What Microsoft and tobacco and other sort of cases where the A.G.s have done after companies, there is a consumer cost involved.</p><p>Here, the allegation is not that these -- big tech is taking people's privacy and putting their social security numbers on -- out there, or taking their private health information. The accusation is that Google, Facebook and others are using people's information to better target advertising.</p><p>So when you're somebody that goes on to Facebook, for example, you know that you're compromising some of your privacy, in the sense that Facebook can use your information to better and more -- better target and give more relevant ads to you, you understand.</p><p>Just like when you turn on the television, that's the price you're going to pay. You're going to have to look at ads. Well, on Facebook and Google, the price is free and you're going to look at some ads. And the idea, here, is, if you live in Wyoming, you're going to want to have pickup trucks ads, where you might not want to have those --</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes.</p><p>GANSLER: -- in downtown Manhattan. So they're going to have to show some consumer harm, and that might be dangerous here.</p><p>SCIUTTO: But I -- so I've got a question, though. Because I -- the ad targeting is so specific. I mean, how many times have you seen, in your social media feed, you know, you might have sent a message about, I don't know, sneakers. And all of a sudden, there's an ad --</p><p>HARLOW: And across them --</p><p>SCIUTTO: -- for sneakers, and across as well --</p><p>HARLOW: -- across them --</p><p>SCIUTTO: -- you know, like an Instagram-to-Facebook --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: -- and you know, folks at home, you know -- have consumers' rights, in effect, been so trimmed down here -- or maybe we're just signing them away when we say we agree to terms and conditions without reading the 47 pages of terms and conditions, you know?</p><p>So -- and for folks at home who have this experience, what do you say to them?</p><p>GANSLER: Well, disclosure is important and the companies have to have adequate and transparent disclosure, which they would argue they do.</p><p>And then the second point is, I do think people now understand that their data is going to be put in some sort of a machine, and they're going to get more relevant ads. And that's actually a different issue, there, which is also part of the tricky and confusing issue going on today with the state attorneys general, coming after big tech using antitrust law.</p><p>The antitrust laws, vis-a-vis privacy, they're completely different things. So I think people recognize, understand that their data is not going to be sold outside of the ecosystem of Google, Facebook or what have you, and recognize that they're going to get ads and it's going to be relevant to them.</p><p>[10:40:00]</p><p>And is it a little spooky or was it spooky when we all started going on Facebook or Google in the first case? Yes. Do people accept it now? Yes, as long their actual data is not being compromised or being hacked.</p><p>HARLOW: Doug, I think we'll have you back a lot on this --</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- because it's not going anywhere.</p><p>SCIUTTO: there's so much balled up into that, yes.</p><p>HARLOW: So much.</p><p>GANSLER: That's true.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you so much, Doug Gansler. We appreciate it.</p><p>GANSLER: My pleasure.</p><p>HARLOW: Quick break, we'll be right back.</p><p>SCIUTTO: CNN has learned, this morning, that Vice President Pence was among the Republican voices opposed to President Trump's now-cancelled plan to host Taliban leaders at Camp David.</p><p>[10:45:06]</p><p>HARLOW: Our chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward has spent time with the Taliban in Afghanistan. I can't think of anyone better to talk about all that is surrounding this, Clarissa, thank you. So just give us a sense of what you experienced in that reporting, and how that plays into what almost happened, which is peace negotiations with the U.S., days before the 9/11 anniversary, at Camp David.</p><p>CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, obviously, Poppy, it's very difficult for me to get into the mindset of the president, and understand how anyone would be wanting to have the Taliban at Camp David just ahead of the 9/11 anniversary, and the optics of that and the sensitivities around that.</p><p>But I can tell you, from having spent time on the ground with the Taliban, that there is a real sense that they would like to see this peace deal go ahead. That they are tired of fighting, they are tired of war, they are worried about losing young people to more extremist organizations, they're worried about splintering within the ranks of their own organization.</p><p>But the difficulty becomes for the U.S. in all of this, in trying to determine what the Taliban sees as the future, going forward. Whether they would really be sincerely interested in a sort of power-sharing agreement with the Afghan government, or whether they're simply trying to opportunistically seize on this moment, where the U.S. clearly wants out of Afghanistan, tell the U.S. what it wants to hear and then, the minute U.S. troops withdraw, to go ahead and usurp power from the Afghan government. That's something that nobody knows yet, right?</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes. I mean, you also look to Afghanistan's recent history, after the Russian withdrawal, huge, deadly years-long civil war. I mean, you spent a lot of time in this country. You've met with Taliban leaders.</p><p>Is it your sense that they saw the outlines of this deal to their advantage, particularly their concerns about the U.S. not consulting the Afghan government -- the elected Afghan government, we should say -- properly? I mean, did the Taliban sense opportunity here, in your view?</p><p>WARD: Let's put it this way. The Taliban see themselves as being victorious at the moment. They see the U.S. as being weak, they see -- it is being (ph) clear that the U.S. is desperate to get out the door and do it as quickly as they can.</p><p>The Taliban is controlling more territory than at any stage since the invasion nearly 18 years ago --</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>WARD: -- 2,400 U.S. servicemen killed, trillions of dollars have been spent. And at the end of the day, the U.S. hasn't been able to win this war.</p><p>And there are critics of this deal who say, \"Listen, there's no guarantee of women's rights. The Afghan government doesn't have a seat at the table. There's no -- there's no way of forcing the Taliban to at least agree to a nationwide ceasefire deal. Clearly, more extractions need to come from the Taliban.\"</p><p>But at the same time, pragmatists will say, \"Listen, we've just got to get this deal done and we've got to get it done quickly.\" And that does not look like it's going to happen now.</p><p>[10:47:55]</p><p>SCIUTTO: Clarissa Ward, great to have you on the story. Thanks so much.</p><p>And we'll be right back.</p><p>HARLOW: All right. So this morning, about a week after Hurricane Dorian pummeled the Bahamas, a humanitarian disaster is unfolding. The official death toll stands at 45 people in the Bahamas, but that of course is expected to rise dramatically. Hundreds of people, still trying to just get off the island with their young children, evacuate. That is proving to be difficult, if not impossible.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Imagine this next moment, if you were on this ferry with your children. In a video posted on Twitter last night, you can hear people being told that they must get off a ferry if they don't have a U.S. visa.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, please, all passengers that don't have U.S. visa, please proceed to disembark.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Now, you don't need a visa to come to the U.S. from the Bahamas if you're traveling by air. Question marks about whether going by ferry.</p><p>This morning, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection is responding to that video, saying it's the ferry operator that was at fault for not properly coordinating the evacuation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL SILVA, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: We asked especially (ph) Balearia to coordinate with the Bahamian government in Nassau, and coordinate there with the American embassy, USAID, and the Bahamian government.</p><p>We're there to facilitate and accommodate that process in an orderly fashion, according to regulation and protocol.</p><p>However, Balearia did not do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO: Our Paula Newton joins us now from Nassau. And you've done incredible work, Paula. You know how bad the situation on the ground there, you've been living it for these last several days. First of all, describe it. But also, I imagine, how difficult it must be for these families to hear they can't leave to come to the U.S. to escape it.</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, those poor souls, Jim. I can't imagine talking to people as the desperation mounts, as they're trying to get on a boat or a plane, to finally get on and have to get off? It is absolutely heartbreaking.</p><p>Listen, here is the situation. Bahamians know that if they get a clear criminal background check, updated, and they have their passports, normally they can get a visa waiver, which means if they pre-clear here in the Bahamas, they're good to go in the United States. And the United States is happy to take them, especially when they have family and friends in the United States who can help them out. When I arrived on Abaco, you have to understand, within the first few moments, I had people handing their passports over to others to say, \"Can you get to the Bahamian police and clear my criminal background check?\" They knew what they needed. And to be told otherwise on that ferry, as I said, is just heartbreaking.</p><p>[10:55:05]</p><p>And another one of the reasons is, has to do with where we are right now. We're in Nassau and we've been talking about all the aid getting here and going out. But a lot of the evacuees have been coming here. A lot of concern about what they can do here.</p><p>Nassau is already a city that's overdeveloped. They're wondering how are their kids going to go to school, where can they get jobs. A lot questions ahead, guys.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: And that's why we're so glad you're there and you'll continue that reporting. We'll continue to shine a light. Paula Newton, thank you so, so much.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Great to have eyes and ears on the ground there.</p><p>We're shedding new light on a secret U.S. intelligence operation to extract a high-level covert source from inside the Russian government. I'll have more on my exclusive reporting, coming just up.</p><p>[11:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019090904CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X15-1041-DXH2-633R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2372\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

What is it?</p><p>'There are really fundamental questions like: is this money? Is it a security? Is Facebook actually taking deposits? Or is it actually a fund?' mused one European central banker.</p><p>All of those questions have regulatory consequences and will affect which licence Libra will need and which regulator has oversight of the new currency.</p><p>'Anything that takes in money, invests that money, issues tokens in exchange for that money and promises the holders of those tokens security of value based on that investment, is currently either an investment firm or a bank,' said Simon Gleeson, a partner at Clifford Chance, the law firm.</p><p>Facebook could persuade regulators to create a new category to avoid the Libra consortium being run as a regulated fund or a bank, he added. 'But the question is: Why should they?'</p><p>Libra could be classed as a security, because it will be underpinned by a basket of currencies and assets, but this would be anathema to Facebook and its partners.</p><p>'It would bring with it a whole heap of regulatory requirements and scrutiny, particularly in the United States and Europe,' said Peter Chapman, another partner at Clifford Chance. These could include the EU's Mifid II rules and oversight by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>The question of whether digital coins are a security, rather than vouchers to be exchanged within a limited community is determined by a Supreme Court evaluation dating back to 1946 called the Howey test, which analyses whether investors are purchasing some kind of promise with an expectation of profit.</p><p>If so, issuers have to comply with rules on registration, transparency and investor marketing that the SEC oversees.</p><p>2. Will new rules be needed or can existing regulations be applied?</p><p>'The cryptocurrency market currently lacks a clear regulatory framework to provide strong protections for investors, consumers, and the economy,' Ms Waters said in a statement on Tuesday, as she called on regulators to 'get serious'.</p><p>Until now, regulators have shied away from creating new rules for crypto assets, arguing that existing consumer protection rules or securities laws can be applied if necessary.</p><p>But the size of Facebook and the scale of its ambition may be the catalyst for new rules on how to deal with Big Tech as it begins to step into financial services and payments.</p><p>Olivier Guersent, the EU official in charge of financial stability said ahead of Libra's unveiling that it was Facebook's potential concentration of both personal and financial data that needed attention from regulators.</p><p>3. What is the balance between risk and opportunity with Libra?</p><p>Policymakers have been careful to calibrate their response to Facebook's claims that Libra will help the 1.7bn 'unbanked', cut transaction costs and shake up traditional financial services.</p><p>Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said the UK central bank was keeping an 'open mind' on the plans but would grant 'no open door'. Some regulators appreciate the potential for Libra to introduce more competition into the banking sector.</p><p>Central bankers and regulators have been phlegmatic until now about crypto assets, which have remained a niche class. But if Facebook's heft results in widespread adoption, that may change.</p><p>'There is always the potential that when a company this big introduces something new that it could quickly become something that central banks should keep a close eye on,' said one eurozone official.</p><p>The impact of stable coins on financial stability will be assessed by the G7, with the first report due in about a month.</p><p>Mr Carney said on Tuesday that if Facebook succeeded in its aims 'it would instantly become systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulation'.</p><p>That raises further questions: Who is responsible if money is lost? Who steps in if Calibra, Facebook's digital wallet, is hacked?</p><p>4. Will it be used for financial crime?</p><p>Libra brings with it a range of financial-crime concerns, from hacking to tax evasion.</p><p>But at the top of the list is money laundering. Before traditional lenders open accounts for customers, they must undertake rigorous background checks to ensure funds are not ill-gotten gains.</p><p>Facebook's plans allow for 'pseudonymous' users able to create multiple accounts not based on their real-life identity.</p><p>'This approach is familiar to many users, developers, and regulators,' its official documents read.</p><p>One UK official remarked: 'This is particularly weasel-worded.

The panel of politicians had conducted a year-long investigation and found these companies 'wielding their power in disruptive, harmful ways' and hence were accused of bridging anti-trust laws in the country.</p><p>What is anti-trust?</p><p>Trust signifies big businesses (like conglomerates) that began to form and encroach on small companies and thus bereft the market of a level playing field. Anti-trust are the regulations enacted by a government to counteract movement in that direction.</p><p>In the hearing, specifically, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos was questioned on how the company's e-commerce site uses competitive data from third-party sellers. Apple's Tim Cook had to answer for the company App Store policies. On the other hand, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had to handle questioning on the company's accused control over the search market and advertising. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was accused of not having a fair business model for new and small companies. In addition, they were also questioned for having anti-conservative biases.</p><p>Here are four major takeaways from the hearing.</p><p>Mixed Statement on Chinese Government Stealing tech from US companies</p><p>There has been a persistent suspicion that the Chinese government steals tech from US companies. Addressing that, both Pichai and Cook said their companies' data was never been stolen, to their first-hand knowledge. Though Pichai informed that in 2009 their company had suffered a cyber-attack.</p><p>Zuckerberg said it's \"well documented\" that China steals tech from the US, while Bezos said he had heard reports of it, but hadn't personally seen it.</p><p>Dominance Over the Internet</p><p>For Google, most of the questions revolved mostly around how the company had taken over the internet. Very specifically, Google's dominance on news and cited data made people suspect that it is not fair to news publishers - how it uses user data, whether it steals data from competing companies and websites, etc.</p><p>Pichai acknowledged that google search facility is automated but there is a manual component involved in blacklisting a website, he said. \"Google deeply cares about the privacy and security of our users,\" he said.</p><p>Third-Party Sellers from its Platform to Kill Small Businesses</p><p>Zuckerberg was facing a line inquiry with respect to several of the company's internal emails that had interesting revelations. Amidst the hearing, an internal email was cited where Zuckerberg himself told Instagram's co-founder Kevin Systrom that Facebook would build a copycat camera app, during the negotiations with Instagram. In fact, reportedly, the social media tycoon didn't have an answer to a question about whether Facebook copied its competitors.</p><p>Similarly, Amazon was accused of having used data from third party sellers from its platform that was destructive to small businesses. In responses, Bezos said: \"The company has a policy against using seller specific data to aid their private label business but he cannot guarantee that the policy has never been violated.\"</p><p>Final Hearing: The Big Four have Monopoly Power</p><p>At the end of hours of grueling, Chairman of the hearing said that they had come to the conclusion that these four companies 'as they exist today have monopoly power'. Adding to that, it was stated that all of them were required to be properly regulated and held accountable. The chair's statement said: \"We need to ensure that the antitrust laws first were written more than a century ago work in the digital age. When these laws were written the monopolists were men named Rockefeller and Carnegie. Their controls of the marketplace allow them to do whatever it took to crush independent businesses and expand their own power. The names have changed, the stories are the same. Today the names are Zuckerberg, Cook, Pichai, and Bezos.\"</p><p>In the end, the chairman strongly stated that these businesses do whatever it takes to crush independent businesses and expand their own power. \"This must end\". Will it? Only time will tell.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNSWLD-0054019219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNSWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-N421-JB5M-W2JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365035</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business World, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The panel of politicians had conducted a year-long investigation a...</p><p>On Wednesday, July 29, the Chief Executives of the world\u2019s top four tech firms Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple faced questions from the United States (US) Congress in a virtual hearing. The panel of politicians had conducted a year-long investigation and found these companies \u2018wielding their power in disruptive, harmful ways\u2019 and hence were accused of bridging anti-trust laws in the country.       What is anti-trust?   Trust signifies big businesses (like conglomerates) that began to form and encroach on small companies and thus bereft the market of a level playing field. Anti-trust are the regulations enacted by a government to counteract movement in that direction.     In the hearing, specifically, Amazon\u2019s CEO Jeff Bezos was questioned on how the company\u2019s e-commerce site uses competitive data from third-party sellers.  Apple\u2019s Tim Cook had to answer for the company App Store policies. On the other hand, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had to handle questioning on the company\u2019s accused control over the search market and advertising. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg was accused of not having a fair business model for new and small companies. In addition, they were also questioned for having anti-conservative biases.   Here are four major takeaways from the hearing.   Mixed Statement on Chinese Government Stealing tech from US companies  There has been a persistent suspicion that the Chinese government steals tech from US companies. Addressing that, both Pichai and Cook said their companies\u2019 data was never been stolen, to their first-hand knowledge. Though Pichai informed that in 2009 their company had suffered a cyber-attack.     Zuckerberg said it\u2019s \u201cwell documented\" that China steals tech from the US, while Bezos said he had heard reports of it, but hadn\u2019t personally seen it.   Dominance Over the Internet  For Google, most of the questions revolved mostly around how the company had taken over the internet. Very specifically, Google\u2019s dominance on news and cited data made people suspect that it is not fair to news publishers \u2013 how it uses user data, whether it steals data from competing companies and websites, etc.     Pichai acknowledged that google search facility is automated but there is a manual component involved in blacklisting a website, he said. \"Google deeply cares about the privacy and security of our users,\" he said.   Third-Party Sellers from its Platform to Kill Small Businesses  Zuckerberg was facing a line inquiry with respect to several of the company\u2019s internal emails that had interesting revelations. Amidst the hearing, an internal email was cited where Zuckerberg himself told Instagram\u2019s co-founder Kevin Systrom that Facebook would build a copycat camera app, during the negotiations with Instagram. In fact, reportedly, the social media tycoon didn\u2019t have an answer to a question about whether Facebook copied its competitors.   Similarly, Amazon was accused of having used data from third party sellers from its platform that was destructive to small businesses. In responses, Bezos said: \"The company has a policy against using seller specific data to aid their private label business but he cannot guarantee that the policy has never been violated.\u201d   Final Hearing: The Big Four have Monopoly Power  At the end of hours of grueling, Chairman of the hearing said that they had come to the conclusion that these four companies 'as they exist today have monopoly power\u2019. Adding to that, it was stated that all of them were required to be properly regulated and held accountable. The chair\u2019s statement said: \u201cWe need to ensure that the antitrust laws first were written more than a century ago work in the digital age. When these laws were written the monopolists were men named Rockefeller and Carnegie. Their controls of the marketplace allow them to do whatever it took to crush independent businesses and expand their own power. The names have changed, the stories are the same. Today the names are Zuckerberg, Cook, Pichai, and Bezos.\u201d   In the end, the chairman strongly stated that these businesses do whatever it takes to crush independent businesses and expand their own power. \u201cThis must end\u201d. Will it? Only time will tell.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42731659446</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GM-XKP1-F07F-80FY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Businessworld India</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Fending off accusations of stifling competition, four Big Tech CEOs \u2014 Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple \u2014 are answering for their companies\u2019 practices before Congress as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry. The powerful CEOs sought to defend their companies amid intense grilling by lawmakers on Wednesday. The executives provided bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers.  But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.  The four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.  President Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued to denounce the big tech companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general. In a tweet, he challenged Congress to crack down on the companies.  If Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Trump tweeted before the start of the hearing.  In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\u201d   Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can\u2019t use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.  Trump\u2019s Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter.  The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.  The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy.  One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.  Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.  In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.  A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.  Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort.  While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.  Simply put, they have too much power, Cicilline said in opening remarks Wednesday, as he laid out data pointing up the power of the four tech companies as essential cogs of commerce and communications.  He also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, these giants stand to profit and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.  The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs.  The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.  Veering from the issue of market competition, a leading conservative Republican on the panel aired longstanding grievances against the big tech companies of censoring conservative viewpoints. Big Tech is out to get conservatives, said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.  Each company has a distinct profile and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.  Bezos, who presides over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal smart tech and beyond, was making his first-ever appearance before Congress.  Bezos introduced himself, in a way, in his hearing testimony, unusual for the occasion. He laid out his challenging life story growing up in New Mexico as the son of a single mother in high school, and later with an adoptive father who emigrated from Cuba at 16.  In a blog post previewing his testimony, Bezos traced his origins as a garage inventor who came up with the concept of an online bookstore in 1994.  He addressed the issue of Amazon\u2019s power in what he describes as a huge and competitive global retail market.  The company accounts for less than 4 per cent of retail in the U.S., Bezos said.

The powerful CEOs sought to defend their companies amid intense grilling by lawmakers on Wednesday.    The executives provided bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.    The four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.    Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.    Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.    Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.    \"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"    Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.    But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.    Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.    As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.    In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.    \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.    Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.    Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.    Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.    In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.      Rep.

Your playlist will load after this ad    The heads of Amazon, Facebook and Google were all grilled by US lawmakers.                              Source: BBC      The powerful CEOs sought to defend their companies amid intense grilling by lawmakers today.     The executives provided bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on US democracy and their role in China.     The four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington.     Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.     Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.     Regulators in the US and Europe have scrutinised Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.     \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from US Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d     Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.     But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.     Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.     As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.     In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.     \u201cIf Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.     Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.     Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.     The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.     Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.     In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.     Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.     Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cthese giants stand to profit\u201d and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.     The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42717031792</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-45N1-F07F-824B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"975\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ONE News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I was going to say there are  fully (muted) but I won't say that.

I'm Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>There could be some surprises in New Hampshire. Pollsters have failed to  predict Senator Cruz's first-place finish in Iowa. </p><p>So, as of today, in the Granite States, there is a new poll that shows  Donald Trump holding the lead and Senator Rubio gaining ground as well. </p><p>My political power panel is here. Conservative commentator, Tammy Bruce,  democratic strategist, John Rowley. Welcome to you both. What happens next?  I'm going to ask you both the same question. What is your prediction, John,  for New Hampshire? Who finishes in what order? </p><p>JOHN ROWLEY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It's the last stand of the republican  establishment. Bush, Kasich, Carly, Christie, all are pretty much are going  to be done at the end. And I think if Rubio can continue this trend, I  don't know that he's going to win, but he will have amazing momentum coming  out of New Hampshire.</p><p>And I think one thing to keep in mind about polls especially around  presidential primaries is, think about the impact they have on the  campaigns and on voters when the last polls come out. Because, you know,  voters react, campaigns reacted to do things.</p><p>So, one of the reasons that you had some surprising results in Iowa is  campaigns did things differently. Sometimes out of desperation after there  is a poll and voters react to that as well. </p><p>BOLTON:  Tammy, if I have to ask you for gold, silver, and bronze, who do  you think? </p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Well, look, this is more difficult  than Iowa. I correctly predicted Iowa for Ted Cruz, but here the  independents play such a big role. I think Donald Trump has an excellent  chance of winning but we see the same trajectory as we did in Iowa. </p><p>His numbers are trending down. Rubio is still trending up. Cruz is a little  bit static. It is the last stand. Jeb Bush has put virtually everything  into New Hampshire. Chris Christie is surprisingly not doing well at all in  the polls. </p><p>I think though, when you're dealing with number one, I predict Donald Trump  is going to win this one. And the fight is going to be per second. Now Ted  Cruz still has a ground game second to none. He's able to target those who  are inclined already to support him. And by the way though, this could all  be changed if Cruz and Trump don't stop fighting. </p><p>If they divide their own vote that is what will give Rubio a chance to move  into second. So, if Cruz and Trump stop fighting, Cruz will take second. If  they don't, Rubio will take second. That's exactly where Rubio wants to be  leading into South Carolina. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK. So, Tammy, I heard you loudly and clearly. You think that  Donald Trump will win New Hampshire. </p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  I have to assume that's because there are so many independents...</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  ... and he seems to be appealing in that way to people.

Explain to me  how I can look at my daughters and have them look up to a President Trump  as a role model. </p><p>TRUMP:  Nobody has more respect for women that I do. I have so many women  executive. I have been great to women and women have been great to me.  They've done a great job. I do bring up things that are things that people  don't want to bring up. When I brought up the Muslim problem, you know,  it's very interesting. I brought that problem up and all of a sudden the  world started going wild and now the world is agreeing with me. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  John, what do you think of Trump's response there? </p><p>ROWLEY:  Well, I'm waiting for him to take credit for inventing the  internet. I mean, he's really delusional that he is the first person that's  talked about so many things in this campaign when a lot of different people  in another Republican Party have talked about them for a long time. </p><p>Whether it's going to impact him or not, I mean, he's appealing to a sliver  of the electorate, really the most conservative Tea Party angry or whiter  or anti-Obama wing of the party sliver of the national electorate. </p><p>And I don't know that it will impact him in New Hampshire. I mean, the  thing about New Hampshire voters though, is they are contrarians and I'm  not sure if that means they deliver a surprise for Trump. They certainly  have delivered surprises before, but, you know, that there may be one of  those equal and opposite reactions to some late polling that we've  certainly seen in both parties in New Hampshire in all of that. </p><p>BRUCE:  Can I chime in one additional element that helps Trump...</p><p>BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p>BRUCE:  is the heroin addiction there in New Hampshire. It's a big issue.  We know that it's related to the border, to the open border, to the ability  of drugs moving up into this country. That is going to be something that  matters from. </p><p>And also I notice that he did change his approach. He noted that he might - - he would like to win but he is not sure. I mean, his demeanor does seem  to have shifted off of that for a span of 12 hours.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  So, his tone is changing?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, a little bit.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>BRUCE:  And I think that will -- that will help him obviously. </p><p>BOLTON:  BOLTON:  Tammy and John, stay with me, please. Other things to ask  you about. In the meantime, on the other side of the aisle, last night's  democratic debate Senator Sanders and Hillary Clinton sparred hard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Secretary Clinton does  represent the establishment. </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Senator Sanders is the  only person who I think would characterize me a woman running to be the  first woman president as exemplifying the establishment and enough is  enough. </p><p>SANDERS:  And one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk but  walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does  not have a super PAC, who's not using huge sums of money from Wall Street.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>CLINTON:  You will not find that I ever changed the view or a vote because  of any donation that I ever received. So, I think it's time to end the very  artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent  weeks. And let's talk -- let's about the issues. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  My political power panel will be back with me shortly to tell you  what they think of those two sides. </p><p>All right. Fox Business is going to be bringing you live coverage of our  nation's first primary. It happens Tuesday, February 9the. Neil Cavuto,  he's going to be bringing you those results from New Hampshire as soon as  they come in starting at 7.55 Eastern Time.</p><p>If you look at the markets today, stocks got crushed. Fewer than forecast  jobs were added to the U.S. economy. In his State of the Union address,  President Obama had this to say to critics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT:  Anyone claiming that  America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Economist thought 190,000 jobs would be added to the U.S. economy.  It was a lower number, 151,000, so 39,000 less. There is a new report that  also shows the number of layoffs hit a six-month high soaring 218 percent  from December to January. </p><p>Gary Smith is with me now. He is the president of Kadina Group. So, Gary,  some economists are calling this jobs report mix. What is your take? </p><p>GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT:  I think that's optimistic. I think  it's terrible would be the better word. Look, there was, what, 151,000 jobs  created. Two-thirds of those jobs, Deirdre, were in retail. One third was  in food services. </p><p>So, you know the job creator was not the CEO of McDonald's. It's people  behind the counter flipping burgers or it's the person working the menswear  section at Wal-Mart. </p><p>Those are the kinds of jobs we're creating. So, we're creating terrible  jobs not even enough of them and then the other important numbers as you  well know is the labor force participation rate. That continues to be  dismal -- it's lower than it was a year ago. Meaning the number of jobs  we're creating is not keeping up even with the population growth. </p><p>BOLTON:  Well, Gary, to your point, it's something like the lowest as we've  talked since the late '70s or early '80s. I'm taking your point on that.  Gary Smith, thanks for that short, sweet perspective on today's jobs  report.</p><p>Well, from national concerns to local ones, two NYPD officers were shot at  a Bronx public housing complex in New York City. The incident follows the  shootings of six other on-duty officers in a little bit more than a year.  Now, four of those officers died. </p><p>New York City real estate executive, Don Peebles is with me now. Don, it's  great to see you. </p><p>DON PEEBLES, NYC REAL ESTATE CHIEF EXECUTVE:  Good to see you.</p><p>BOLTON:  Does this change your view at all about doing business in New  York?</p><p>PEEBLES:  Well, look.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  But it seems to be increasing violence is what I mean.</p><p>PEEBLES:  Well, I think what's happening here is the administration running  the city is tone deaf and not living in reality. We are having a dramatic  increase in random violence and that's frightening visitors from coming to  New York and it's also making business owners more concerned.</p><p>And then you add that to these other discussions about raising tax and  adding more regulations to the private sector and it forces people to look  at alternative cities. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, you've said in the past you are considering or would consider  a run for mayor of New York City. Do incidences such of these propel you  forward in your thinking to the extent of, OK, I could do better than  what's happening now. </p><p>PEEBLES:  Absolutely. That we have right now is we have criminals walking  around with weapons and armed and...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  And they are shooting police officers in uniforms.</p><p>PEEBLES:  ... they are shooting police officers who are sitting docks. We  have slashing of women. We have women being raped who are tourist. Rape in  central park. And the mayor is going to Iowa to knock on doors for Hillary  Clinton when the city is in chaos. And so, yes, a bit concern. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, let me ask you, speaking of being tone deaf, I mean, we do  want to play some clips from Mayor de Blasio. Here is one of them.</p><p>OK. Actually, we don't have that, but in essence he was essentially trying  to speak in favor of the police force. But he has come under so much fire  for not protecting the force. </p><p>PEEBLES:  Well, what has happened is that the mayor set the tone very  early. Bill de Blasio, after the grand jury decided not to indict the  officers for Eric Gardner's death he empathized with people who were in  fear of police violence as opposed to recognizing he is the leader of the  police department.</p><p>But the reality is, he's tried to racially polarize this issue. And  frankly, the minority community, African-American and Latinos  disproportionately carry the burden of crimes and there are no more  conservative New Yorker when it comes to law enforcement than African- Americans. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, let me ask you before we go, there is a Black Lives Matter  candidate, who actually, or I should activists, excuse me, who wants to put  himself forward to be the mayor of Baltimore. Is it a good mix to have an  activist turned mayor? </p><p>PEEBLES:  No. We see it in New York right now. Bill de Blasio was a paid  protester as a public advocate, so he was an activist. Being mayor of major  city or any city for that matter you're performing administrative functions  and municipal functions.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  You have to serve everyone.</p><p>PEEBLES:  And also you have to be a good manager. These are multibillion  dollar organizations, activists belong in running for Congress, running for  the United States Senate. They belong, maybe on the city council but they  do not belong as managers. </p><p>Our city needs to be run by competent managers who have experienced in  managing and leading businesses or large organizations. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Don, well, when you're ready for your announcement you  know where to come. </p><p>PEEBLES:  Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON:  Don Peebles joining me there, in the meantime, real estate exec. </p><p>The refugee crisis is worsening in Germany. Another sexual assault in  Cologne. This one happened live as a reporter was working on air. My next  guest says Germany refugee cartoon etiquette is not working.</p><p>On a separate note, notorious drug CEO, Martin Shkreli plead the fifth  yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIJAH CUMMINGS, MARYLAND STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  You can look away if you  would like, but I wish you could see the faces of people no matter what Ms.  Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the drugs that they need.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  This so-called pharma bro now has posted a new video to YouTube  and you will not believe what he is saying. </p><p>And, Twitter announcing a moments ago, it is suspending more than 100,000  accounts it believes to be propaganda parts from ISIS. Is this better than  Facebook like attack strategy? Captain Chuck Nash is with me up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK COO:  They launched what they called a like  attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Social media company Twitter just announcing it will shut down  more than 100,000 accounts that are deemed to be part of ISIS recruiting  accounts. </p><p>Retired navy captain and Fox News military analyst, Chuck Nash is with me  now. Captain, what is your take on Twitter's decision? </p><p>CHUCK NASH, RETIRED U.S. NAVY:  Well, I think there is to coming to public  pressure because people are outraged that these bad guys are being allowed  to use the same social networks that law-abiding people are and they're  disgusted with it. And I think they're valuing to pressure to shut it down. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, does this just mean though that terrorists will just find  another method by which to communicate? </p><p>NASH:  Oh, absolutely. They are not going to stop communicating. So, there  may be a good news story in this for our intelligence community because  they may be one step ahead of them finding out what their plan B was for  communications, and maybe this is really going to put them communicating on  networks that are a little more accessible to our NSA and other  intelligence operations. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Captain, Facebook does not want to be left out of the  conversation or seen as being negligent. Here is the COO, Sheryl Sandberg. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDBERG:  So, that's the antidote to bad speech is good speech. They  launched what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.  So, the NPD is the neo-Nazi party. That page is filled with intolerance.  And rather than scream and protest they got 100,000 people to like the page  who did not like the page and then put messages of tolerance on the page. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Chuck, what do you make of this kind of vigilante social media  participation? Is that the right way to go? </p><p>NASH:  No, that's just silly. That's just people trying to feel good about  something and doing nothing more than making a couple of keystrokes on a  handheld device. That's silly. That's like, release our girls or whatever  that was in Nigeria.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  In Nigeria, yes.</p><p>NASH:  Yes. When Boko Haram took the 300 girls. That means absolutely  nothing. Its people trying to save their consciences, it's nothing.</p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Going from nothing to something deserving and  significant. A female journalists reporting on the carnival in Cologne,  Germany, says she was sexually assaulted on live TV.</p><p>NASH:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, we're showing a video right now. There is a man making  gestures behind her.</p><p>NASH:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  The reporter also saying someone grabbed her. How is Germany going  to address this issue and what does the U.S. have to learn from Germany's  example? </p><p>NASH:  Well, Deirdre, that's a -- that's a really long answer questions but  I'll keep it short. What you are actually seeing here is what happen in  Sweden in a microcosm. In the 1970's, rape was almost unknown in Sweden. </p><p>The government did a study several years later in the '80s and found out  the migrants from North Africa, the Muslim males that were coming up were  23 times more likely to commit rape. So, now you're seeing all of Europe.</p><p>In Germany, last year they had 100,000 applicants for asylum. Last month,  100,000 asylum seekers showed up just last month, and they're saying  they're going to take 800,000. These societies have got to get over this  political correctness because they are naivet, is jeopardizing public  safety and the safety of their entire culture. </p><p>BOLTON:  And we have heard Angela Merkel, of course, the German Chancellor  saying, listen, this is temporary. Asylum here in Germany is temporary and  they are going to endeavor to send a lot of the refugees back, which I  think unfortunately, for Germany's going to be very complicated. </p><p>What do you think though, of Cologne establishing this kind of safe zone  for women, in other words, almost segregating out its own women for their  won protection which...</p><p>NASH:  Exactly. So, here's the deal. This thing is like Mardi Gras in New  Orleans. So, it is -- yes, there is a lot of booze flying around. People  are drunk, they're happy and everything. But these gangs are moving around.  So, what are these women supposed to do? </p><p>Go into this tent area? That sounds like a lot of fun. So, really what the  German police are saying there are 2500 cops in this deal and there are  about 1.5 million visitors in Cologne in this Mardi Gras-type events. </p><p>So, who do they penalize? Whose freedom do they restrict? The women's.  That's nuts. They're not going to do that. </p><p>BOLTON:  It's nuts. All right. Captain Chuck Nash, we thank you as always.  Glad to have you here. </p><p>NASH:  My pleasure, Deirdre. </p><p>BOLTON:  From overseas to Michigan, the Flint water crisis just getting  worse and worse.

Didn't we?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I find it despicable. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Our legal expert is going to tell us who he thinks is going to  jail over it.</p><p>Also, pharma bro, all he did was smirk yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CUMMINGS:  You can look away if you like but I wish you could see the faces  of people no matter what Ms. Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the drugs  that they need. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Well, he is speaking out.

I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. I invoke my  Fifth Amendment privilege.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENN GROTHMAN, WISCONSIN STATE CONGRESSMAN:  The question there was a  cover up, and the cover up of the worst kind. You've been costing people  money and people ask money as well. You are costing people their health and  maybe their lives. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  That was Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman on the unfolding  water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Now there are new e-mails released by the  Liberal Group Progress Michigan alleging that principle adviser to Michigan  Governor Rick Snyder was made aware of the crisis 10 months prior to the  governor informing the public. </p><p>Tammy Bruce is back with me now. So, Tammy, who was going to be held  accountable for 100,000 children being poisoned? </p><p>BRUCE:  Well, if we leave it up to the establishment, no one. We haven't  seen anyone when it comes to federal scandals that are being taken to task  for what they have done. I'd call a while ago for Governor Snyder's  resignation. </p><p>Look, Flint was under a state appointed emergency manager when this  occurred and the decision to switch to the Flint River was made.  Ultimately, any leader knows that the box stops with them. </p><p>Now with these e-mails showing that his main aide knew about this 10 months  before he said he did and this continues to go on is outrageous. Now, look,  I'm a conservative. I'm not a republican but I think that there's got to be  responsibility for everyone across the board. </p><p>Look, it's a progressive group that found this out. I don't care who  founded out. But the truth is the truth. Facts matter and I think Snyder  should take a step and resign at this point because if -- and look, the EPA  -- the scandal of government -- everybody. Everybody.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes. It's a scandal. I mean, there's no other way to say it. It's  a scandal.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  Speaking of health matters from a different lens, pharma bro,  Martin's Shkreli just releasing a video blasting Congress on YouTube. Here  it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHKRELI:  The reality is it's pathetic that they needed me to get publicity  for themselves. And, you know, I think it's transparent. I think it's  pathetic. They could have had a closed chamber meeting with me. They didn't  want that. They could have given me immunity, they didn't want that. The  last thing in the world they would want me to do is to testify because it  would be very embarrassing to them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Shkreli blasting Congress after getting an earful from lawmakers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CUMMINGS:  You can look away if you would like but I wish you could see the  faces of people, no matter what Ms. Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the  drugs that they need. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Tammy, to your credit you got into it Twitter altercation with  Shkreli. He does still have problems. He can go in front of that House  hearing and take the Fifth, but he also has security fraud charges against  him, right? </p><p>BRUCE:  Well, look, he's facing some serious criminal charges. I'm shocked  that his lawyers are allowing him to post things up on the internet at this  point. You know, what I think what happened in Congress was appropriate. </p><p>A lot of Americans don't realize what this guy did. But more than that it  really isn't all about him despite his feelings that it is, it's his own  narcissism obviously. This is about the nature of the kinds of choices  being made in the pharmaceutical industry, but also the kind of person that  we're dealing with. </p><p>And so, I think Congress did, I think everyone a favor, in highlighting  this guy's behavior and his attitude because when you -- look, I'm all for  profit. I like the pharmaceutical industries saves people's lives, but this  is the kind of things that we've to make sure that we focus on. </p><p>For Shkreli himself I'm surprised that no one in his family has intervened.  He's obviously a young man with some problems facing very serious charges.  And his lawyers stopped him at one point in the congressional hearing from  speaking which would -- which would have ended his Fifth Amendment right to  not speak and they should also try to protect him from himself at this  point. </p><p>BOLTON:  I was going to say he is lucky that his lawyer is on the case  because his lawyer is also trying to explain away with seems to be, from an  objective view, very bad behavior. </p><p>Tammy Bruce, thank you so much. </p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>BOLTON:  See you in a bit.</p><p>In the meantime, moving to the big game on Sunday, Super Bowl brings in big  bucks for the players on the field whether they win or lose. Athletes  earning more than a million dollars are subject to a so-called jock tax. </p><p>Carolina Panthers quarterback, Cam Newton may be feeling it extra hard. </p><p>Cheryl Casone is with me now live from San Francisco. Cheryl, I know you  are ready for the big game but it is significant for all of these athletes  that is being played in California, right? </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, absolutely. Because of  the tax situation that the tax raised that are paid in the State of  California. And there are some of the highest of the world frankly. But,  you know, it was interesting, two years ago, Peyton Manning paid a lot of  taxes in the State of New Jersey because they won. </p><p>We thought those numbers were big. Cam Newton, if he wins on Sunday, he's  going to be paying so much bigger numbers. </p><p>First, we'll take a look at state tax rate for the State of California.  Again, it's called the jock tax. That's what we've named it here, 13.3  percent. That is the amount paid on earnings per athletes who earned a  million dollars or more and of course most of them do earn more than  million dollars or more. </p><p>But let's look at the income that you would get from the Super Bowl. No  matter who you are. The losing team for each player, $102,000, right? For  the winning team, 51,000. That's the income. Remember, California gets a  tax on every single penny that you make in their state.</p><p>Now, Cam Newton and the Panthers. OK. Now if they win, Cam Newton, in  particular, if he pays the State of California, his tax bill for 2016, he's  been, what do you say, guys, $159,560. That if he wins. </p><p>If he loses about the same story. Why -- why bother playing at Panthers if  loss in the Super Bowl. Mr. Newton will pay $159,200 in tax, Deirdre, for  2016. </p><p>He's also saying because it's a duty tax basically. Duty days in a calendar  year is how the State of California equates this. Your annual income, your  calendar income versus the amount of days that you work and the more you  make the worse the tax is. </p><p>But I got to say if would be nice to see Cam Newton win on Sunday. Back to  you in New York.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST:  I was just going to say. It's a  good weather in California, higher taxes. I don't know if the players are  comfortable with that trade. In the meantime, Cheryl Casone, thank you so  much. Live, you can see her there at the Super Bowl.</p><p>All right. Hillary Clinton says she is not an establishment candidate. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Senator sanders is the  only person who, I think would characterize me as a woman running to be the  first woman president as exemplifying the establishment, and enough is  enough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  Our next guest says that Hillary Clinton keeps misplaying the  woman card. We'll talk about that. </p><p>Also, there is fatal frame collapse here in New York City, one person  killed, three injured, a 500-foot crane came falling down during rush hour.  The lone fatality was a man sitting in a parked car, a worker at a nearby  building caught the whole thing on his cell phone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Almost even with us.

Holy!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  One of the things we  should do is not only talk the talk but walk the walk. I am very proud to  be the only candidate up here who does not have a super PAC who's not  raising huge sums of money from Wall Street. </p><p>CLINTON:  You will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of  any donations that I ever received. So, I think it's time to end the very  artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent  weeks. And let's talk -- let's talk about the issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  Tensions were high as Hillary Clinton and Senator Sanders sparred  hard over issues such as campaign finance. Also terms such as,  establishment candidate and progressive candidate. </p><p>My political power panel is back. Tammy Bruce, John Rowley. So, Tammy, what  do you make of Hillary's connections, fundraising from Wall Street? Is this  going to cause her a problem? Or does it pale in comparison to the e-mail  scandal? </p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Look, I think it's all a problem.  It's all linked. It's all about integrity. Obviously the American people  don't trust her for a reason. She has been the first lady, she's been a  senator from New York, the Secretary of State, and she stands there and  says she's not the establishment? </p><p>One good thing -- I'm a feminist, I was the president of the national  organization for women in L.A. and was on their board. We do know women now  have moved into the power rankings, we can be establishment, and I want a  woman to be president, but just not that one. </p><p>And I think she has to realize that she's not the only flame holder that we  know what she's doing. Women have other choices now. And I think that  whether it's the e-mails or even who she is, her own positioning, the money  she takes, all of it speaks to a lack of trust, a lack of credibility, and  a woman who tends to make things up as she goes along. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. So, John, you heard Tammy's points there, I just want  to bring in Hillary Clinton's comments on saying that she is not an  establishment candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize  me, a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the  establishment. And enough is enough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  So, John, that's obviously Hillary's take there. But about the e- mails, how much credibility -- how much is this going to cost her? There  are months to go until November. We don't know what else is going to come  out. </p><p>JOHN ROWLEY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, Senator Sanders has kind of made  the e-mail issue a moot point in the primary. And the establishment  argument is a little bit off base. I mean, I haven't seen many candidates  lose in the -- unlike the republican primary what's going on where there is  a battle over who's too moderate and establishment. </p><p>And frankly, Hillary Clinton has her toe in a lot of different parts of the  Democratic Party overtime. And frankly, I mean, the challenge she's had and  almost the single issue that Bernie Sanders has made is the Wall Street  angle. </p><p>And so, it's -- I think it's less of an establishment issue as kind of the  Wall Street message, which has given her some problems. And -- so anyway, I  think it's more Wall Street than an establishment issue. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Now, Hillary does sound pretty confident, though, as  far as the e-mails go. But I hear what you're saying, Tammy, this is all  wrapped up in the issue of credibility. </p><p>BRUCE:  Well, it is. And look, she's a robot. I mean, she's trained to  sound like she's confident. She makes things up. Look, Bernie -- Bernie  Sanders got more aggressive with her after that meeting with Barack Obama  in the White House. </p><p>And I think that you've realized -- there's one -- one female senator that  has not endorsed Hillary Clinton and that's Elizabeth Warren. Barack Obama  is not moving either. You've got this investigation with the FBI. </p><p>But what we're dealing with Hillary here is whether it's establishment or  Wall Street or you might think the two are the same, I happen to love Wall  Street, is the fact that her daughter who is campaigning for her, lives in  a $10 million condo in New York, a young woman who's married to a hedge  fund manager. </p><p>I mean, the attempts to portray herself as an outsider is in and of itself  insulting. Bernie Sanders made $5 million more last month than Hillary did.  This message is resonating because democrats are also sick and tired of  what's been going on. </p><p>ROWLEY:  Well, that's a pretty good litany of things that republican  primary voters are concerned about. But once we pivot to the general  election, a lot of these problems are just going to seem petty and  political and partisan. </p><p>And in terms of the e-mail, I mean, there's no precedent in the history of  the United States where a credible presidential candidate has been indicted  in a campaign and...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.</p><p>ROWLEY:  ... there needs to something dark and documented and provable...</p><p>BOLTON:  Well, time to go. </p><p>BRUCE:  She won't be the -- she won't be the nominee. So, it won't be an  issue. </p><p>BOLTON:  John and Tammy, thank you both. </p><p>ROWLEY:  Dream on. </p><p>BOLTON:  Glad to have you here.</p><p>ROWLEY:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  We just want to highlight quickly what happened in the markets.  Stocks got crushed. There was a monthly job number missed. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT:  Anyone claiming that  America's economy is in decline is pedaling fiction. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  New reports says investors are ditching stocks putting a lot in  cash. Find out if you should be doing the same. </p><p>Also, a $500 million price tag for a premium 30-second Super Bowl  commercial. Small businesses are usually left in the dark but not this one.  Bill Rancic, \"Apprentice\" winner is going to tell us about how he's giving  away a free Super Bowl ad to one lucky business. We'll tell you which one  it is, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The day of reckoning is upon us. My brother, what is  life if not to die a glorious death. But tonight we are in the heart of.  Rome awaitens and welcome them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  That is a Super Bowl ad, set to air this Sunday, the small  business small business Death Wish Coffee, it's scored big with into a  quick book small business competition.</p><p>Former apprentice winner, small business advocate, Bill Rancic has teamed  up with into it. Bill, glad to have you here. So, this 30-second spot on  Sunday cost an average $5 million. Why did this company, this crazy coffee  company win? </p><p>BILL RANCIC, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" WINNER:  Well, you know, we -- we spent  the last year traveling around the country looking for small businesses to  participate in this competition called small business big game. And we had  tens of thousands of small businesses apply. Got narrowed down, narrowed  down, eventually everyone in America got to vote. And they chose Death Wish  Coffee. </p><p>It was just a great story. The young man started this business literally  moving home with his mom at the age of 30 and put his lifesavings on the  line and started it. He had an idea, he had a dream, and I think people  really connected with that story because that's how 98 percent of the small  businesses that are out there today started. So, it's a really connection. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes. Facebook started in a dorm room. </p><p>RANCIC:  And it's just one way of celebrating small business. </p><p>BOLTON:  Indeed. To your point, Bill, Facebook starting in a dorm room,  Google starting in a very modest split level house. The founder of Death  Wish Coffee, Mike Brown, was just moments ago on after the bell, we're  going to play a clip for anyone who missed that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  I mean, what is it -- what do you think  it's going to be like to sit there during the Super Bowl and know that  millions of people are watching your ad? </p><p>MIKE BROWN, DEATH WISH COFFEE OWNER:  Yes. Millions are people are going to  discover Death Wish Coffee for the first time. And I mean, for a small  business owner, it's a dream come true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  All right. So, there is his comment there. Now you, Bill, are the  original winner of the first \"Apprentice\" show. So, we have to ask. Have  you talked to Trump? </p><p>RANCIC:  You know, I haven't spoken to him in several months. But certainly  following his campaign closely and watching his rise to success in the  campaign. </p><p>BOLTON:  What do you think given your experience with him? </p><p>RANCIC:  Well, I can tell you this. He knows how to hire good people. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right.</p><p>RANCIC:  He hired me 13 years ago. </p><p>BOLTON:  There you go. Proof. </p><p>RANCIC:  But, you know, he's someone who has a proven track record, and he  knows how to get deals done. </p><p>BOLTON:  Bill Rancic, we thank you. Looking forward to seeing the ad live  on Sunday. Bill Rancic joining us there.</p><p>Stocks got crushed today. The NASDAQ down more than 3 percent. Even the  tech darlings from last year sold off in today's session. </p><p>Gary Smith back with me now. So, Gary, investors are pouring more than $200  billion into cash. Is this the right move? </p><p>GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT:  Well, it's the expected move. I  mean, most retail investors base their investing on emotions or the  momentum of the market. And since July, which, you know, we've seen the  great excess out, we've had the big market dip in August of last year. We  had the big market dip of January. Some would say it's still continuing. </p><p>Who could blame them out there? You can't get any returns on bonds so where  are you going to go cash? Now, to the quick answer to your question, is  that the way to go? Maybe back in July it was. Now I would say I think we  have further to go down. </p><p>So, if you have, say, $20,000 to invest, I would put 10,000 in the market  right now and wait for further pull back. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Gary, thank you very much. We love specific advice.  Gary Smith joining us there of Kadina Group.</p><p>Well, a huge stock drop. Speaking of networking site LinkedIn down more  than 40 percent. With me next a Silicon Valley investor on whether or not  another tech crash is coming. </p><p>Fifteen percent work force layoff, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer receiving  criticism over -- well, a lot of the moves that she's making. We'll fill  you in. </p><p>Plus, a fatal crane collapse right here in New York City. One person  killed, three others injured, a 500-foot crane came curling down during  rush hour. The lone fatality was a man sitting in a parked car. A worker at  a nearby building caught the whole thing on his cell phone. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Almost even with us. There he goes. He's moving fast  now. He's dropping it really quick. (muted) That thing looks like it's  going to fall. Holy. It's falling. It's falling. Falling. Oh, it broke.  Holy!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Tech stocks sold off today. Especially ones that had more than 50  percent gains last year. So, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, all down more than  5 percent in today's session. SoftTech Venture Capital founder managing  partner, Jeff Clavier is with me now. Jeff, it's great to see you. </p><p>JEFF CLAVIER, SOFTTECH VENTURE CAPITAL FOUNDER:  It's good to be back. </p><p>BOLTON:  When you see the NASDAQ down more than 3 percent, when you looked  at LinkedIn which was a big tech darling for many years, down something  like 45 percent. What do you think of the tech environment right now? </p><p>CLAVIER:  So, there's been a lot of nervousness in the market. We know that  since the beginning of the year. And there's been sort of expectations that  were priced in terms of continued growth. And they didn't deliver based on  how they said 2016 would shape up for them. And so, you know.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, Jeff, you've invest at the very beginning. </p><p>CLAVIER:  Very. </p><p>BOLTON:  And then you help a little bit as the company grows. Does this  change when you see big drops like this? Does this change the way that  you're investing now? </p><p>CLAVIER:  No. Not at the worst stage. We still do roughly 15 investments  per year and will continue doing so in 2016. I think the way the impact  we'll see is how downstream investors investing behind us will see growth  rounds will just change in terms of valuations and that two market  realities. </p><p>Because there's no way you can have a disconnect between public market  comes which have clearly falling down a lot this year and what was paid for  unicorns in the current market. </p><p>BOLTON:  You have invested in some -- well, numerous hot stocks. Some of  which are still private, some of which are still public, which public one  are the most proud of? That you saw early, you got in early. </p><p>CLAVIER:  I'm still happy what Fitbit has done. Obviously, down 50 percent  this year, but I think that it's actually the company which makes the world  a better place because it helps people to get in shape. </p><p>And I think that hopefully the market we understand that, you know, the  Apple watch won't kill it, that all of its competitors won't kill them  (Inaudible) and the new line up of products that are actually pretty  exciting. The market doesn't like it. But, you know, still has 17 awards. </p><p>BOLTON:  There's a new design, it looks good. </p><p>CLAVIER:  Fashion focused. </p><p>BOLTON:  With a company, though, such as Yahoo clearly on the ropes. Do you  get anxious that there are fewer potential buyers for any other companies  that you might be investing? </p><p>CLAVIER:  So, you know, it's actually pretty unusual to see those  valuations that are coming down which actually are going to get the buyers  back to the table of negotiating with hot company's potential buyouts. </p><p>Because over the last couple of years the expectations were so high that  the remaining (ph) market was pretty tipped. With, you know, all those  valuations sort of coming down. I've heard numerous sort of called, there  are people saying, OK, well, none of the market is back on track, let's  have a discussion. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. That's the good start of all things. Jeff Clavier,  thank you so much. Joining me there, partner at SoftTech VC. </p><p>Super Bowl Sunday is this weekend. You know that. Cheryl Casone is there.  An update from her in just a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  It's Super Bowl weekend. Broncos quarterback, Peyton Manning  trying snag one more championship as retirement looms. The rising Carolina  Panthers star, Cam Newton trying to lead his team to the first Super Bowl  title. </p><p>Cheryl Casone is there in San Francisco. What's the atmosphere like,  Cheryl? </p><p>CASONE:  Well, this is the NFL experience. It's a fan's dream. If you love  football, in fact, we're right in front of radio row, we've been here a lot  of the afternoon. And this is where a lot of the big players.</p><p>I mean, you should have seen Tony Romo, quarterback for the Cowboys. You  couldn't even move in this space. So, it's a lot of fans, a lot of media, a  lot of companies. Everybody trying to kind of get a piece of the football  pie, if you will. </p><p>All the buzz, I got to say, is about Peyton Manning. So many questions  about whether or not he's going to retire after the season and still no  answers from him. He's going to have sell everybody himself.</p><p>Roger Goodell was here, of course, a lot of the executives. Also, about a  million people coming into the San Francisco Bay area. Security has been  insane. Blackhawk helicopters actually flying above the skies at San  Francisco. </p><p>The FBI, Department of Homeland Security surveilling everything. There's  camera everywhere. And I got to tell you, anybody that is going to be at  the Levi Stadium on Sunday, for the big game, Deirdre, smile for the  surveillance camera because they've got so many cameras on that stadium.  They are concerned about security. </p><p>They wanted to make sure that Super Bowl 50 goes off without a hitch. I got  to tell you, the other big piece of buzz right now and you're going to love  this, Coldplay, Beyonc,, Bruno Mars, right? There is a mystery guest cannot  get it out of the half time, people. We've all been trying today, but with  all those reporters and we don't know.</p><p>BOLTON:  Well, enjoy it all. Cheryl Casone joining us there from the Super  Bowl site. Speaking of super stars, Making Money with Charles Payne starts  now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

We elected a  first time United States senator the last time and it didn't work out for  him what work for us. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TED CRUZ, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If momentum are measured by the  media, Marco Rubio would already be the republican nominee. And the media  is telling bronze is the new gold. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARCO RUBIO, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  When people are talking a  tough time in the campaign especially near the end, you see some  desperation set in and start things a bit. I'm not too worried. </p><p>JEB BUSH, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The three leading contenders on  the republican side. Think about their proven record of experience. Donald  Trump. I will leave it at that. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  These people, I would like  to use really foul language. I won't do it. I was going to say there are  fully (muted) but I won't say that. No, it's true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST:  The gloves are off with four days  to go to the New Hampshire primary. </p><p>This is Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>There could be some surprises in New Hampshire. Pollsters have failed to  predict Senator Cruz's first-place finish in Iowa. </p><p>So, as of today, in the Granite States, there is a new poll that shows  Donald Trump holding the lead and Senator Rubio gaining ground as well. </p><p>My political power panel is here. Conservative commentator, Tammy Bruce,  democratic strategist, John Rowley. Welcome to you both. What happens next?  I'm going to ask you both the same question. What is your prediction, John,  for New Hampshire? Who finishes in what order? </p><p>JOHN ROWLEY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It's the last stand of the republican  establishment. Bush, Kasich, Carly, Christie, all are pretty much are going  to be done at the end. And I think if Rubio can continue this trend, I  don't know that he's going to win, but he will have amazing momentum coming  out of New Hampshire.</p><p>And I think one thing to keep in mind about polls especially around  presidential primaries is, think about the impact they have on the  campaigns and on voters when the last polls come out. Because, you know,  voters react, campaigns reacted to do things.</p><p>So, one of the reasons that you had some surprising results in Iowa is  campaigns did things differently. Sometimes out of desperation after there  is a poll and voters react to that as well. </p><p>BOLTON:  Tammy, if I have to ask you for gold, silver, and bronze, who do  you think? </p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Well, look, this is more difficult  than Iowa. I correctly predicted Iowa for Ted Cruz, but here the  independents play such a big role. I think Donald Trump has an excellent  chance of winning but we see the same trajectory as we did in Iowa. </p><p>His numbers are trending down. Rubio is still trending up. Cruz is a little  bit static. It is the last stand. Jeb Bush has put virtually everything  into New Hampshire. Chris Christie is surprisingly not doing well at all in  the polls. </p><p>I think though, when you're dealing with number one, I predict Donald Trump  is going to win this one. And the fight is going to be per second. Now Ted  Cruz still has a ground game second to none. He's able to target those who  are inclined already to support him. And by the way though, this could all  be changed if Cruz and Trump don't stop fighting. </p><p>If they divide their own vote that is what will give Rubio a chance to move  into second. So, if Cruz and Trump stop fighting, Cruz will take second. If  they don't, Rubio will take second. That's exactly where Rubio wants to be  leading into South Carolina. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK. So, Tammy, I heard you loudly and clearly. You think that  Donald Trump will win New Hampshire. </p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  I have to assume that's because there are so many independents...</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  ... and he seems to be appealing in that way to people. Here he is  when confronted at a town hall in New Hampshire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Throughout the course of this campaign you said some  disparaging comments about women, about people from other countries, other  religions, and about everybody who has disagreed with you. Explain to me  how I can look at my daughters and have them look up to a President Trump  as a role model. </p><p>TRUMP:  Nobody has more respect for women that I do. I have so many women  executive. I have been great to women and women have been great to me.  They've done a great job. I do bring up things that are things that people  don't want to bring up. When I brought up the Muslim problem, you know,  it's very interesting. I brought that problem up and all of a sudden the  world started going wild and now the world is agreeing with me. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  John, what do you think of Trump's response there? </p><p>ROWLEY:  Well, I'm waiting for him to take credit for inventing the  internet. I mean, he's really delusional that he is the first person that's  talked about so many things in this campaign when a lot of different people  in another Republican Party have talked about them for a long time. </p><p>Whether it's going to impact him or not, I mean, he's appealing to a sliver  of the electorate, really the most conservative Tea Party angry or whiter  or anti-Obama wing of the party sliver of the national electorate. </p><p>And I don't know that it will impact him in New Hampshire. I mean, the  thing about New Hampshire voters though, is they are contrarians and I'm  not sure if that means they deliver a surprise for Trump. They certainly  have delivered surprises before, but, you know, that there may be one of  those equal and opposite reactions to some late polling that we've  certainly seen in both parties in New Hampshire in all of that. </p><p>BRUCE:  Can I chime in one additional element that helps Trump...</p><p>BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p>BRUCE:  is the heroin addiction there in New Hampshire. It's a big issue.  We know that it's related to the border, to the open border, to the ability  of drugs moving up into this country. That is going to be something that  matters from. </p><p>And also I notice that he did change his approach. He noted that he might - - he would like to win but he is not sure. I mean, his demeanor does seem  to have shifted off of that for a span of 12 hours.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  So, his tone is changing?</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, a little bit.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>BRUCE:  And I think that will -- that will help him obviously. </p><p>BOLTON:  BOLTON:  Tammy and John, stay with me, please. Other things to ask  you about. In the meantime, on the other side of the aisle, last night's  democratic debate Senator Sanders and Hillary Clinton sparred hard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Secretary Clinton does  represent the establishment. </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Senator Sanders is the  only person who I think would characterize me a woman running to be the  first woman president as exemplifying the establishment and enough is  enough. </p><p>SANDERS:  And one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk but  walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does  not have a super PAC, who's not using huge sums of money from Wall Street.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>CLINTON:  You will not find that I ever changed the view or a vote because  of any donation that I ever received. So, I think it's time to end the very  artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent  weeks. And let's talk -- let's about the issues. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  My political power panel will be back with me shortly to tell you  what they think of those two sides. </p><p>All right. Fox Business is going to be bringing you live coverage of our  nation's first primary. It happens Tuesday, February 9the. Neil Cavuto,  he's going to be bringing you those results from New Hampshire as soon as  they come in starting at 7.55 Eastern Time.</p><p>If you look at the markets today, stocks got crushed. Fewer than forecast  jobs were added to the U.S. economy. In his State of the Union address,  President Obama had this to say to critics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT:  Anyone claiming that  America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Economist thought 190,000 jobs would be added to the U.S. economy.  It was a lower number, 151,000, so 39,000 less. There is a new report that  also shows the number of layoffs hit a six-month high soaring 218 percent  from December to January. </p><p>Gary Smith is with me now. He is the president of Kadina Group. So, Gary,  some economists are calling this jobs report mix. What is your take? </p><p>GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT:  I think that's optimistic. I think  it's terrible would be the better word. Look, there was, what, 151,000 jobs  created. Two-thirds of those jobs, Deirdre, were in retail. One third was  in food services. </p><p>So, you know the job creator was not the CEO of McDonald's. It's people  behind the counter flipping burgers or it's the person working the menswear  section at Wal-Mart. </p><p>Those are the kinds of jobs we're creating. So, we're creating terrible  jobs not even enough of them and then the other important numbers as you  well know is the labor force participation rate. That continues to be  dismal -- it's lower than it was a year ago. Meaning the number of jobs  we're creating is not keeping up even with the population growth. </p><p>BOLTON:  Well, Gary, to your point, it's something like the lowest as we've  talked since the late '70s or early '80s. I'm taking your point on that.  Gary Smith, thanks for that short, sweet perspective on today's jobs  report.</p><p>Well, from national concerns to local ones, two NYPD officers were shot at  a Bronx public housing complex in New York City. The incident follows the  shootings of six other on-duty officers in a little bit more than a year.  Now, four of those officers died. </p><p>New York City real estate executive, Don Peebles is with me now. Don, it's  great to see you. </p><p>DON PEEBLES, NYC REAL ESTATE CHIEF EXECUTVE:  Good to see you.</p><p>BOLTON:  Does this change your view at all about doing business in New  York?</p><p>PEEBLES:  Well, look.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  But it seems to be increasing violence is what I mean.</p><p>PEEBLES:  Well, I think what's happening here is the administration running  the city is tone deaf and not living in reality. We are having a dramatic  increase in random violence and that's frightening visitors from coming to  New York and it's also making business owners more concerned.</p><p>And then you add that to these other discussions about raising tax and  adding more regulations to the private sector and it forces people to look  at alternative cities. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, you've said in the past you are considering or would consider  a run for mayor of New York City. Do incidences such of these propel you  forward in your thinking to the extent of, OK, I could do better than  what's happening now. </p><p>PEEBLES:  Absolutely. That we have right now is we have criminals walking  around with weapons and armed and...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  And they are shooting police officers in uniforms.</p><p>PEEBLES:  ... they are shooting police officers who are sitting docks. We  have slashing of women. We have women being raped who are tourist. Rape in  central park. And the mayor is going to Iowa to knock on doors for Hillary  Clinton when the city is in chaos. And so, yes, a bit concern. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, let me ask you, speaking of being tone deaf, I mean, we do  want to play some clips from Mayor de Blasio. Here is one of them.</p><p>OK. Actually, we don't have that, but in essence he was essentially trying  to speak in favor of the police force. But he has come under so much fire  for not protecting the force. </p><p>PEEBLES:  Well, what has happened is that the mayor set the tone very  early. Bill de Blasio, after the grand jury decided not to indict the  officers for Eric Gardner's death he empathized with people who were in  fear of police violence as opposed to recognizing he is the leader of the  police department.</p><p>But the reality is, he's tried to racially polarize this issue. And  frankly, the minority community, African-American and Latinos  disproportionately carry the burden of crimes and there are no more  conservative New Yorker when it comes to law enforcement than African- Americans. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, let me ask you before we go, there is a Black Lives Matter  candidate, who actually, or I should activists, excuse me, who wants to put  himself forward to be the mayor of Baltimore. Is it a good mix to have an  activist turned mayor? </p><p>PEEBLES:  No. We see it in New York right now. Bill de Blasio was a paid  protester as a public advocate, so he was an activist. Being mayor of major  city or any city for that matter you're performing administrative functions  and municipal functions.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  You have to serve everyone.</p><p>PEEBLES:  And also you have to be a good manager. These are multibillion  dollar organizations, activists belong in running for Congress, running for  the United States Senate. They belong, maybe on the city council but they  do not belong as managers. </p><p>Our city needs to be run by competent managers who have experienced in  managing and leading businesses or large organizations. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Don, well, when you're ready for your announcement you  know where to come. </p><p>PEEBLES:  Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON:  Don Peebles joining me there, in the meantime, real estate exec. </p><p>The refugee crisis is worsening in Germany. Another sexual assault in  Cologne. This one happened live as a reporter was working on air. My next  guest says Germany refugee cartoon etiquette is not working.</p><p>On a separate note, notorious drug CEO, Martin Shkreli plead the fifth  yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIJAH CUMMINGS, MARYLAND STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  You can look away if you  would like, but I wish you could see the faces of people no matter what Ms.  Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the drugs that they need.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  This so-called pharma bro now has posted a new video to YouTube  and you will not believe what he is saying. </p><p>And, Twitter announcing a moments ago, it is suspending more than 100,000  accounts it believes to be propaganda parts from ISIS. Is this better than  Facebook like attack strategy? Captain Chuck Nash is with me up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK COO:  They launched what they called a like  attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Social media company Twitter just announcing it will shut down  more than 100,000 accounts that are deemed to be part of ISIS recruiting  accounts. </p><p>Retired navy captain and Fox News military analyst, Chuck Nash is with me  now. Captain, what is your take on Twitter's decision? </p><p>CHUCK NASH, RETIRED U.S. NAVY:  Well, I think there is to coming to public  pressure because people are outraged that these bad guys are being allowed  to use the same social networks that law-abiding people are and they're  disgusted with it. And I think they're valuing to pressure to shut it down. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, does this just mean though that terrorists will just find  another method by which to communicate? </p><p>NASH:  Oh, absolutely. They are not going to stop communicating. So, there  may be a good news story in this for our intelligence community because  they may be one step ahead of them finding out what their plan B was for  communications, and maybe this is really going to put them communicating on  networks that are a little more accessible to our NSA and other  intelligence operations. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Captain, Facebook does not want to be left out of the  conversation or seen as being negligent. Here is the COO, Sheryl Sandberg. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDBERG:  So, that's the antidote to bad speech is good speech. They  launched what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.  So, the NPD is the neo-Nazi party. That page is filled with intolerance.  And rather than scream and protest they got 100,000 people to like the page  who did not like the page and then put messages of tolerance on the page. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Chuck, what do you make of this kind of vigilante social media  participation? Is that the right way to go? </p><p>NASH:  No, that's just silly. That's just people trying to feel good about  something and doing nothing more than making a couple of keystrokes on a  handheld device. That's silly. That's like, release our girls or whatever  that was in Nigeria.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  In Nigeria, yes.</p><p>NASH:  Yes. When Boko Haram took the 300 girls. That means absolutely  nothing. Its people trying to save their consciences, it's nothing.</p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Going from nothing to something deserving and  significant. A female journalists reporting on the carnival in Cologne,  Germany, says she was sexually assaulted on live TV.</p><p>NASH:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, we're showing a video right now. There is a man making  gestures behind her.</p><p>NASH:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  The reporter also saying someone grabbed her. How is Germany going  to address this issue and what does the U.S. have to learn from Germany's  example? </p><p>NASH:  Well, Deirdre, that's a -- that's a really long answer questions but  I'll keep it short. What you are actually seeing here is what happen in  Sweden in a microcosm. In the 1970's, rape was almost unknown in Sweden. </p><p>The government did a study several years later in the '80s and found out  the migrants from North Africa, the Muslim males that were coming up were  23 times more likely to commit rape. So, now you're seeing all of Europe.</p><p>In Germany, last year they had 100,000 applicants for asylum. Last month,  100,000 asylum seekers showed up just last month, and they're saying  they're going to take 800,000. These societies have got to get over this  political correctness because they are naivet, is jeopardizing public  safety and the safety of their entire culture. </p><p>BOLTON:  And we have heard Angela Merkel, of course, the German Chancellor  saying, listen, this is temporary. Asylum here in Germany is temporary and  they are going to endeavor to send a lot of the refugees back, which I  think unfortunately, for Germany's going to be very complicated. </p><p>What do you think though, of Cologne establishing this kind of safe zone  for women, in other words, almost segregating out its own women for their  won protection which...</p><p>NASH:  Exactly. So, here's the deal. This thing is like Mardi Gras in New  Orleans. So, it is -- yes, there is a lot of booze flying around. People  are drunk, they're happy and everything. But these gangs are moving around.  So, what are these women supposed to do? </p><p>Go into this tent area? That sounds like a lot of fun. So, really what the  German police are saying there are 2500 cops in this deal and there are  about 1.5 million visitors in Cologne in this Mardi Gras-type events. </p><p>So, who do they penalize? Whose freedom do they restrict? The women's.  That's nuts. They're not going to do that. </p><p>BOLTON:  It's nuts. All right. Captain Chuck Nash, we thank you as always.  Glad to have you here. </p><p>NASH:  My pleasure, Deirdre. </p><p>BOLTON:  From overseas to Michigan, the Flint water crisis just getting  worse and worse.

I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. I invoke my  Fifth Amendment privilege.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENN GROTHMAN, WISCONSIN STATE CONGRESSMAN:  The question there was a  cover up, and the cover up of the worst kind. You've been costing people  money and people ask money as well. You are costing people their health and  maybe their lives. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  That was Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman on the unfolding  water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Now there are new e-mails released by the  Liberal Group Progress Michigan alleging that principle adviser to Michigan  Governor Rick Snyder was made aware of the crisis 10 months prior to the  governor informing the public. </p><p>Tammy Bruce is back with me now. So, Tammy, who was going to be held  accountable for 100,000 children being poisoned? </p><p>BRUCE:  Well, if we leave it up to the establishment, no one. We haven't  seen anyone when it comes to federal scandals that are being taken to task  for what they have done. I'd call a while ago for Governor Snyder's  resignation. </p><p>Look, Flint was under a state appointed emergency manager when this  occurred and the decision to switch to the Flint River was made.  Ultimately, any leader knows that the box stops with them. </p><p>Now with these e-mails showing that his main aide knew about this 10 months  before he said he did and this continues to go on is outrageous. Now, look,  I'm a conservative. I'm not a republican but I think that there's got to be  responsibility for everyone across the board. </p><p>Look, it's a progressive group that found this out. I don't care who  founded out. But the truth is the truth. Facts matter and I think Snyder  should take a step and resign at this point because if -- and look, the EPA  -- the scandal of government -- everybody. Everybody.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes. It's a scandal. I mean, there's no other way to say it. It's  a scandal.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p>BOLTON:  Speaking of health matters from a different lens, pharma bro,  Martin's Shkreli just releasing a video blasting Congress on YouTube. Here  it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHKRELI:  The reality is it's pathetic that they needed me to get publicity  for themselves. And, you know, I think it's transparent. I think it's  pathetic. They could have had a closed chamber meeting with me. They didn't  want that. They could have given me immunity, they didn't want that. The  last thing in the world they would want me to do is to testify because it  would be very embarrassing to them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Shkreli blasting Congress after getting an earful from lawmakers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CUMMINGS:  You can look away if you would like but I wish you could see the  faces of people, no matter what Ms. Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the  drugs that they need. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Tammy, to your credit you got into it Twitter altercation with  Shkreli. He does still have problems. He can go in front of that House  hearing and take the Fifth, but he also has security fraud charges against  him, right? </p><p>BRUCE:  Well, look, he's facing some serious criminal charges. I'm shocked  that his lawyers are allowing him to post things up on the internet at this  point. You know, what I think what happened in Congress was appropriate. </p><p>A lot of Americans don't realize what this guy did. But more than that it  really isn't all about him despite his feelings that it is, it's his own  narcissism obviously. This is about the nature of the kinds of choices  being made in the pharmaceutical industry, but also the kind of person that  we're dealing with. </p><p>And so, I think Congress did, I think everyone a favor, in highlighting  this guy's behavior and his attitude because when you -- look, I'm all for  profit. I like the pharmaceutical industries saves people's lives, but this  is the kind of things that we've to make sure that we focus on. </p><p>For Shkreli himself I'm surprised that no one in his family has intervened.  He's obviously a young man with some problems facing very serious charges.  And his lawyers stopped him at one point in the congressional hearing from  speaking which would -- which would have ended his Fifth Amendment right to  not speak and they should also try to protect him from himself at this  point. </p><p>BOLTON:  I was going to say he is lucky that his lawyer is on the case  because his lawyer is also trying to explain away with seems to be, from an  objective view, very bad behavior. </p><p>Tammy Bruce, thank you so much. </p><p>BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p>BOLTON:  See you in a bit.</p><p>In the meantime, moving to the big game on Sunday, Super Bowl brings in big  bucks for the players on the field whether they win or lose. Athletes  earning more than a million dollars are subject to a so-called jock tax. </p><p>Carolina Panthers quarterback, Cam Newton may be feeling it extra hard. </p><p>Cheryl Casone is with me now live from San Francisco. Cheryl, I know you  are ready for the big game but it is significant for all of these athletes  that is being played in California, right? </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, absolutely. Because of  the tax situation that the tax raised that are paid in the State of  California. And there are some of the highest of the world frankly. But,  you know, it was interesting, two years ago, Peyton Manning paid a lot of  taxes in the State of New Jersey because they won. </p><p>We thought those numbers were big. Cam Newton, if he wins on Sunday, he's  going to be paying so much bigger numbers. </p><p>First, we'll take a look at state tax rate for the State of California.  Again, it's called the jock tax. That's what we've named it here, 13.3  percent. That is the amount paid on earnings per athletes who earned a  million dollars or more and of course most of them do earn more than  million dollars or more. </p><p>But let's look at the income that you would get from the Super Bowl. No  matter who you are. The losing team for each player, $102,000, right? For  the winning team, 51,000. That's the income. Remember, California gets a  tax on every single penny that you make in their state.</p><p>Now, Cam Newton and the Panthers. OK. Now if they win, Cam Newton, in  particular, if he pays the State of California, his tax bill for 2016, he's  been, what do you say, guys, $159,560. That if he wins. </p><p>If he loses about the same story. Why -- why bother playing at Panthers if  loss in the Super Bowl. Mr. Newton will pay $159,200 in tax, Deirdre, for  2016. </p><p>He's also saying because it's a duty tax basically. Duty days in a calendar  year is how the State of California equates this. Your annual income, your  calendar income versus the amount of days that you work and the more you  make the worse the tax is. </p><p>But I got to say if would be nice to see Cam Newton win on Sunday. Back to  you in New York.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST:  I was just going to say. It's a  good weather in California, higher taxes. I don't know if the players are  comfortable with that trade. In the meantime, Cheryl Casone, thank you so  much. Live, you can see her there at the Super Bowl.</p><p>All right. Hillary Clinton says she is not an establishment candidate. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Senator sanders is the  only person who, I think would characterize me as a woman running to be the  first woman president as exemplifying the establishment, and enough is  enough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  Our next guest says that Hillary Clinton keeps misplaying the  woman card. We'll talk about that. </p><p>Also, there is fatal frame collapse here in New York City, one person  killed, three injured, a 500-foot crane came falling down during rush hour.  The lone fatality was a man sitting in a parked car, a worker at a nearby  building caught the whole thing on his cell phone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Almost even with us.

So, I think it's time to end the very  artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent  weeks. And let's talk -- let's talk about the issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  Tensions were high as Hillary Clinton and Senator Sanders sparred  hard over issues such as campaign finance. Also terms such as,  establishment candidate and progressive candidate. </p><p>My political power panel is back. Tammy Bruce, John Rowley. So, Tammy, what  do you make of Hillary's connections, fundraising from Wall Street? Is this  going to cause her a problem? Or does it pale in comparison to the e-mail  scandal? </p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Look, I think it's all a problem.  It's all linked. It's all about integrity. Obviously the American people  don't trust her for a reason. She has been the first lady, she's been a  senator from New York, the Secretary of State, and she stands there and  says she's not the establishment? </p><p>One good thing -- I'm a feminist, I was the president of the national  organization for women in L.A. and was on their board. We do know women now  have moved into the power rankings, we can be establishment, and I want a  woman to be president, but just not that one. </p><p>And I think she has to realize that she's not the only flame holder that we  know what she's doing. Women have other choices now. And I think that  whether it's the e-mails or even who she is, her own positioning, the money  she takes, all of it speaks to a lack of trust, a lack of credibility, and  a woman who tends to make things up as she goes along. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. So, John, you heard Tammy's points there, I just want  to bring in Hillary Clinton's comments on saying that she is not an  establishment candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize  me, a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the  establishment. And enough is enough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  So, John, that's obviously Hillary's take there. But about the e- mails, how much credibility -- how much is this going to cost her? There  are months to go until November. We don't know what else is going to come  out. </p><p>JOHN ROWLEY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, Senator Sanders has kind of made  the e-mail issue a moot point in the primary. And the establishment  argument is a little bit off base. I mean, I haven't seen many candidates  lose in the -- unlike the republican primary what's going on where there is  a battle over who's too moderate and establishment. </p><p>And frankly, Hillary Clinton has her toe in a lot of different parts of the  Democratic Party overtime. And frankly, I mean, the challenge she's had and  almost the single issue that Bernie Sanders has made is the Wall Street  angle. </p><p>And so, it's -- I think it's less of an establishment issue as kind of the  Wall Street message, which has given her some problems. And -- so anyway, I  think it's more Wall Street than an establishment issue. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Now, Hillary does sound pretty confident, though, as  far as the e-mails go. But I hear what you're saying, Tammy, this is all  wrapped up in the issue of credibility. </p><p>BRUCE:  Well, it is. And look, she's a robot. I mean, she's trained to  sound like she's confident. She makes things up. Look, Bernie -- Bernie  Sanders got more aggressive with her after that meeting with Barack Obama  in the White House. </p><p>And I think that you've realized -- there's one -- one female senator that  has not endorsed Hillary Clinton and that's Elizabeth Warren. Barack Obama  is not moving either. You've got this investigation with the FBI. </p><p>But what we're dealing with Hillary here is whether it's establishment or  Wall Street or you might think the two are the same, I happen to love Wall  Street, is the fact that her daughter who is campaigning for her, lives in  a $10 million condo in New York, a young woman who's married to a hedge  fund manager. </p><p>I mean, the attempts to portray herself as an outsider is in and of itself  insulting. Bernie Sanders made $5 million more last month than Hillary did.  This message is resonating because democrats are also sick and tired of  what's been going on. </p><p>ROWLEY:  Well, that's a pretty good litany of things that republican  primary voters are concerned about. But once we pivot to the general  election, a lot of these problems are just going to seem petty and  political and partisan. </p><p>And in terms of the e-mail, I mean, there's no precedent in the history of  the United States where a credible presidential candidate has been indicted  in a campaign and...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.</p><p>ROWLEY:  ... there needs to something dark and documented and provable...</p><p>BOLTON:  Well, time to go. </p><p>BRUCE:  She won't be the -- she won't be the nominee. So, it won't be an  issue. </p><p>BOLTON:  John and Tammy, thank you both. </p><p>ROWLEY:  Dream on. </p><p>BOLTON:  Glad to have you here.</p><p>ROWLEY:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  We just want to highlight quickly what happened in the markets.  Stocks got crushed. There was a monthly job number missed. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT:  Anyone claiming that  America's economy is in decline is pedaling fiction. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  New reports says investors are ditching stocks putting a lot in  cash. Find out if you should be doing the same. </p><p>Also, a $500 million price tag for a premium 30-second Super Bowl  commercial. Small businesses are usually left in the dark but not this one.  Bill Rancic, \"Apprentice\" winner is going to tell us about how he's giving  away a free Super Bowl ad to one lucky business. We'll tell you which one  it is, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The day of reckoning is upon us. My brother, what is  life if not to die a glorious death. But tonight we are in the heart of.  Rome awaitens and welcome them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  That is a Super Bowl ad, set to air this Sunday, the small  business small business Death Wish Coffee, it's scored big with into a  quick book small business competition.</p><p>Former apprentice winner, small business advocate, Bill Rancic has teamed  up with into it. Bill, glad to have you here. So, this 30-second spot on  Sunday cost an average $5 million. Why did this company, this crazy coffee  company win? </p><p>BILL RANCIC, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" WINNER:  Well, you know, we -- we spent  the last year traveling around the country looking for small businesses to  participate in this competition called small business big game. And we had  tens of thousands of small businesses apply. Got narrowed down, narrowed  down, eventually everyone in America got to vote. And they chose Death Wish  Coffee. </p><p>It was just a great story. The young man started this business literally  moving home with his mom at the age of 30 and put his lifesavings on the  line and started it. He had an idea, he had a dream, and I think people  really connected with that story because that's how 98 percent of the small  businesses that are out there today started. So, it's a really connection. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Yes. Facebook started in a dorm room. </p><p>RANCIC:  And it's just one way of celebrating small business. </p><p>BOLTON:  Indeed. To your point, Bill, Facebook starting in a dorm room,  Google starting in a very modest split level house. The founder of Death  Wish Coffee, Mike Brown, was just moments ago on after the bell, we're  going to play a clip for anyone who missed that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  I mean, what is it -- what do you think  it's going to be like to sit there during the Super Bowl and know that  millions of people are watching your ad? </p><p>MIKE BROWN, DEATH WISH COFFEE OWNER:  Yes. Millions are people are going to  discover Death Wish Coffee for the first time. And I mean, for a small  business owner, it's a dream come true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  All right. So, there is his comment there. Now you, Bill, are the  original winner of the first \"Apprentice\" show. So, we have to ask. Have  you talked to Trump? </p><p>RANCIC:  You know, I haven't spoken to him in several months. But certainly  following his campaign closely and watching his rise to success in the  campaign. </p><p>BOLTON:  What do you think given your experience with him? </p><p>RANCIC:  Well, I can tell you this. He knows how to hire good people. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right.</p><p>RANCIC:  He hired me 13 years ago. </p><p>BOLTON:  There you go. Proof. </p><p>RANCIC:  But, you know, he's someone who has a proven track record, and he  knows how to get deals done. </p><p>BOLTON:  Bill Rancic, we thank you. Looking forward to seeing the ad live  on Sunday. Bill Rancic joining us there.</p><p>Stocks got crushed today. The NASDAQ down more than 3 percent. Even the  tech darlings from last year sold off in today's session. </p><p>Gary Smith back with me now. So, Gary, investors are pouring more than $200  billion into cash. Is this the right move? </p><p>GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT:  Well, it's the expected move. I  mean, most retail investors base their investing on emotions or the  momentum of the market. And since July, which, you know, we've seen the  great excess out, we've had the big market dip in August of last year. We  had the big market dip of January. Some would say it's still continuing. </p><p>Who could blame them out there? You can't get any returns on bonds so where  are you going to go cash? Now, to the quick answer to your question, is  that the way to go? Maybe back in July it was. Now I would say I think we  have further to go down. </p><p>So, if you have, say, $20,000 to invest, I would put 10,000 in the market  right now and wait for further pull back. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Gary, thank you very much. We love specific advice.  Gary Smith joining us there of Kadina Group.</p><p>Well, a huge stock drop. Speaking of networking site LinkedIn down more  than 40 percent. With me next a Silicon Valley investor on whether or not  another tech crash is coming. </p><p>Fifteen percent work force layoff, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer receiving  criticism over -- well, a lot of the moves that she's making. We'll fill  you in. </p><p>Plus, a fatal crane collapse right here in New York City. One person  killed, three others injured, a 500-foot crane came curling down during  rush hour. The lone fatality was a man sitting in a parked car. A worker at  a nearby building caught the whole thing on his cell phone. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Almost even with us. There he goes. He's moving fast  now. He's dropping it really quick. (muted) That thing looks like it's  going to fall. Holy. It's falling. It's falling. Falling. Oh, it broke.  Holy!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Tech stocks sold off today. Especially ones that had more than 50  percent gains last year. So, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, all down more than  5 percent in today's session. SoftTech Venture Capital founder managing  partner, Jeff Clavier is with me now. Jeff, it's great to see you. </p><p>JEFF CLAVIER, SOFTTECH VENTURE CAPITAL FOUNDER:  It's good to be back. </p><p>BOLTON:  When you see the NASDAQ down more than 3 percent, when you looked  at LinkedIn which was a big tech darling for many years, down something  like 45 percent. What do you think of the tech environment right now? </p><p>CLAVIER:  So, there's been a lot of nervousness in the market. We know that  since the beginning of the year. And there's been sort of expectations that  were priced in terms of continued growth. And they didn't deliver based on  how they said 2016 would shape up for them. And so, you know.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, Jeff, you've invest at the very beginning. </p><p>CLAVIER:  Very. </p><p>BOLTON:  And then you help a little bit as the company grows. Does this  change when you see big drops like this? Does this change the way that  you're investing now? </p><p>CLAVIER:  No. Not at the worst stage. We still do roughly 15 investments  per year and will continue doing so in 2016. I think the way the impact  we'll see is how downstream investors investing behind us will see growth  rounds will just change in terms of valuations and that two market  realities. </p><p>Because there's no way you can have a disconnect between public market  comes which have clearly falling down a lot this year and what was paid for  unicorns in the current market. </p><p>BOLTON:  You have invested in some -- well, numerous hot stocks. Some of  which are still private, some of which are still public, which public one  are the most proud of? That you saw early, you got in early. </p><p>CLAVIER:  I'm still happy what Fitbit has done. Obviously, down 50 percent  this year, but I think that it's actually the company which makes the world  a better place because it helps people to get in shape. </p><p>And I think that hopefully the market we understand that, you know, the  Apple watch won't kill it, that all of its competitors won't kill them  (Inaudible) and the new line up of products that are actually pretty  exciting. The market doesn't like it. But, you know, still has 17 awards. </p><p>BOLTON:  There's a new design, it looks good. </p><p>CLAVIER:  Fashion focused. </p><p>BOLTON:  With a company, though, such as Yahoo clearly on the ropes. Do you  get anxious that there are fewer potential buyers for any other companies  that you might be investing? </p><p>CLAVIER:  So, you know, it's actually pretty unusual to see those  valuations that are coming down which actually are going to get the buyers  back to the table of negotiating with hot company's potential buyouts. </p><p>Because over the last couple of years the expectations were so high that  the remaining (ph) market was pretty tipped. With, you know, all those  valuations sort of coming down. I've heard numerous sort of called, there  are people saying, OK, well, none of the market is back on track, let's  have a discussion. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. That's the good start of all things. Jeff Clavier,  thank you so much. Joining me there, partner at SoftTech VC. </p><p>Super Bowl Sunday is this weekend. You know that. Cheryl Casone is there.  An update from her in just a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  It's Super Bowl weekend. Broncos quarterback, Peyton Manning  trying snag one more championship as retirement looms. The rising Carolina  Panthers star, Cam Newton trying to lead his team to the first Super Bowl  title. </p><p>Cheryl Casone is there in San Francisco. What's the atmosphere like,  Cheryl? </p><p>CASONE:  Well, this is the NFL experience. It's a fan's dream. If you love  football, in fact, we're right in front of radio row, we've been here a lot  of the afternoon. And this is where a lot of the big players.</p><p>I mean, you should have seen Tony Romo, quarterback for the Cowboys. You  couldn't even move in this space. So, it's a lot of fans, a lot of media, a  lot of companies. Everybody trying to kind of get a piece of the football  pie, if you will. </p><p>All the buzz, I got to say, is about Peyton Manning. So many questions  about whether or not he's going to retire after the season and still no  answers from him. He's going to have sell everybody himself.</p><p>Roger Goodell was here, of course, a lot of the executives. Also, about a  million people coming into the San Francisco Bay area. Security has been  insane. Blackhawk helicopters actually flying above the skies at San  Francisco. </p><p>The FBI, Department of Homeland Security surveilling everything. There's  camera everywhere. And I got to tell you, anybody that is going to be at  the Levi Stadium on Sunday, for the big game, Deirdre, smile for the  surveillance camera because they've got so many cameras on that stadium.  They are concerned about security. </p><p>They wanted to make sure that Super Bowl 50 goes off without a hitch. I got  to tell you, the other big piece of buzz right now and you're going to love  this, Coldplay, Beyonc,, Bruno Mars, right? There is a mystery guest cannot  get it out of the half time, people. We've all been trying today, but with  all those reporters and we don't know.</p><p>BOLTON:  Well, enjoy it all. Cheryl Casone joining us there from the Super  Bowl site. Speaking of super stars, Making Money with Charles Payne starts  now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I'm not too worried. </p><p> JEB BUSH, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The three leading contenders on  the republican side. Think about their proven record of experience. Donald  Trump. I will leave it at that. </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  These people, I would like  to use really foul language. I won't do it. I was going to say there are  fully (muted) but I won't say that.

I'm Deirdre Bolton.</p><p> There could be some surprises in New Hampshire. Pollsters have failed to  predict Senator Cruz's first-place finish in Iowa. </p><p> So, as of today, in the Granite States, there is a new poll that shows  Donald Trump holding the lead and Senator Rubio gaining ground as well. </p><p> My political power panel is here. Conservative commentator, Tammy Bruce,  democratic strategist, John Rowley. Welcome to you both. What happens next?  I'm going to ask you both the same question. What is your prediction, John,  for New Hampshire? Who finishes in what order? </p><p> JOHN ROWLEY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It's the last stand of the republican  establishment. Bush, Kasich, Carly, Christie, all are pretty much are going  to be done at the end. And I think if Rubio can continue this trend, I  don't know that he's going to win, but he will have amazing momentum coming  out of New Hampshire.</p><p> And I think one thing to keep in mind about polls especially around  presidential primaries is, think about the impact they have on the  campaigns and on voters when the last polls come out. Because, you know,  voters react, campaigns reacted to do things.</p><p> So, one of the reasons that you had some surprising results in Iowa is  campaigns did things differently. Sometimes out of desperation after there  is a poll and voters react to that as well. </p><p> BOLTON:  Tammy, if I have to ask you for gold, silver, and bronze, who do  you think? </p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Well, look, this is more difficult  than Iowa. I correctly predicted Iowa for Ted Cruz, but here the  independents play such a big role. I think Donald Trump has an excellent  chance of winning but we see the same trajectory as we did in Iowa. </p><p> His numbers are trending down. Rubio is still trending up. Cruz is a little  bit static. It is the last stand. Jeb Bush has put virtually everything  into New Hampshire. Chris Christie is surprisingly not doing well at all in  the polls. </p><p> I think though, when you're dealing with number one, I predict Donald Trump  is going to win this one. And the fight is going to be per second. Now Ted  Cruz still has a ground game second to none. He's able to target those who  are inclined already to support him. And by the way though, this could all  be changed if Cruz and Trump don't stop fighting. </p><p> If they divide their own vote that is what will give Rubio a chance to move  into second. So, if Cruz and Trump stop fighting, Cruz will take second. If  they don't, Rubio will take second. That's exactly where Rubio wants to be  leading into South Carolina. </p><p> BOLTON:  OK. So, Tammy, I heard you loudly and clearly. You think that  Donald Trump will win New Hampshire. </p><p> BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  I have to assume that's because there are so many independents...</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  ... and he seems to be appealing in that way to people. Here he is  when confronted at a town hall in New Hampshire.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Throughout the course of this campaign you said some  disparaging comments about women, about people from other countries, other  religions, and about everybody who has disagreed with you. Explain to me  how I can look at my daughters and have them look up to a President Trump  as a role model. </p><p> TRUMP:  Nobody has more respect for women that I do. I have so many women  executive. I have been great to women and women have been great to me.  They've done a great job. I do bring up things that are things that people  don't want to bring up. When I brought up the Muslim problem, you know,  it's very interesting. I brought that problem up and all of a sudden the  world started going wild and now the world is agreeing with me. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  John, what do you think of Trump's response there? </p><p> ROWLEY:  Well, I'm waiting for him to take credit for inventing the  internet. I mean, he's really delusional that he is the first person that's  talked about so many things in this campaign when a lot of different people  in another Republican Party have talked about them for a long time. </p><p> Whether it's going to impact him or not, I mean, he's appealing to a sliver  of the electorate, really the most conservative Tea Party angry or whiter  or anti-Obama wing of the party sliver of the national electorate. </p><p> And I don't know that it will impact him in New Hampshire. I mean, the  thing about New Hampshire voters though, is they are contrarians and I'm  not sure if that means they deliver a surprise for Trump. They certainly  have delivered surprises before, but, you know, that there may be one of  those equal and opposite reactions to some late polling that we've  certainly seen in both parties in New Hampshire in all of that. </p><p> BRUCE:  Can I chime in one additional element that helps Trump...</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> BRUCE:  is the heroin addiction there in New Hampshire. It's a big issue.  We know that it's related to the border, to the open border, to the ability  of drugs moving up into this country. That is going to be something that  matters from. </p><p> And also I notice that he did change his approach. He noted that he might - - he would like to win but he is not sure. I mean, his demeanor does seem  to have shifted off of that for a span of 12 hours.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOLTON:  So, his tone is changing?</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes, a little bit.</p><p> BOLTON:  OK.</p><p> BRUCE:  And I think that will -- that will help him obviously. </p><p> BOLTON:  BOLTON:  Tammy and John, stay with me, please. Other things to ask  you about. In the meantime, on the other side of the aisle, last night's  democratic debate Senator Sanders and Hillary Clinton sparred hard.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BERNIE SANDERS, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Secretary Clinton does  represent the establishment. </p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Senator Sanders is the  only person who I think would characterize me a woman running to be the  first woman president as exemplifying the establishment and enough is  enough. </p><p> SANDERS:  And one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk but  walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does  not have a super PAC, who's not using huge sums of money from Wall Street.</p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> CLINTON:  You will not find that I ever changed the view or a vote because  of any donation that I ever received. So, I think it's time to end the very  artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent  weeks. And let's talk -- let's about the issues. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  My political power panel will be back with me shortly to tell you  what they think of those two sides. </p><p> All right. Fox Business is going to be bringing you live coverage of our  nation's first primary. It happens Tuesday, February 9the. Neil Cavuto,  he's going to be bringing you those results from New Hampshire as soon as  they come in starting at 7.55 Eastern Time.</p><p> If you look at the markets today, stocks got crushed. Fewer than forecast  jobs were added to the U.S. economy. In his State of the Union address,  President Obama had this to say to critics.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT:  Anyone claiming that  America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  Economist thought 190,000 jobs would be added to the U.S. economy.  It was a lower number, 151,000, so 39,000 less. There is a new report that  also shows the number of layoffs hit a six-month high soaring 218 percent  from December to January. </p><p> Gary Smith is with me now. He is the president of Kadina Group. So, Gary,  some economists are calling this jobs report mix. What is your take? </p><p> GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT:  I think that's optimistic. I think  it's terrible would be the better word. Look, there was, what, 151,000 jobs  created. Two-thirds of those jobs, Deirdre, were in retail. One third was  in food services. </p><p> So, you know the job creator was not the CEO of McDonald's. It's people  behind the counter flipping burgers or it's the person working the menswear  section at Wal-Mart. </p><p> Those are the kinds of jobs we're creating. So, we're creating terrible  jobs not even enough of them and then the other important numbers as you  well know is the labor force participation rate. That continues to be  dismal -- it's lower than it was a year ago. Meaning the number of jobs  we're creating is not keeping up even with the population growth. </p><p> BOLTON:  Well, Gary, to your point, it's something like the lowest as we've  talked since the late '70s or early '80s. I'm taking your point on that.  Gary Smith, thanks for that short, sweet perspective on today's jobs  report.</p><p> Well, from national concerns to local ones, two NYPD officers were shot at  a Bronx public housing complex in New York City. The incident follows the  shootings of six other on-duty officers in a little bit more than a year.  Now, four of those officers died. </p><p> New York City real estate executive, Don Peebles is with me now. Don, it's  great to see you. </p><p> DON PEEBLES, NYC REAL ESTATE CHIEF EXECUTVE:  Good to see you.</p><p> BOLTON:  Does this change your view at all about doing business in New  York?</p><p> PEEBLES:  Well, look.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOLTON:  But it seems to be increasing violence is what I mean.</p><p> PEEBLES:  Well, I think what's happening here is the administration running  the city is tone deaf and not living in reality. We are having a dramatic  increase in random violence and that's frightening visitors from coming to  New York and it's also making business owners more concerned.</p><p> And then you add that to these other discussions about raising tax and  adding more regulations to the private sector and it forces people to look  at alternative cities. </p><p> BOLTON:  So, you've said in the past you are considering or would consider  a run for mayor of New York City. Do incidences such of these propel you  forward in your thinking to the extent of, OK, I could do better than  what's happening now. </p><p> PEEBLES:  Absolutely. That we have right now is we have criminals walking  around with weapons and armed and...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOLTON:  And they are shooting police officers in uniforms.</p><p> PEEBLES:  ... they are shooting police officers who are sitting docks. We  have slashing of women. We have women being raped who are tourist. Rape in  central park. And the mayor is going to Iowa to knock on doors for Hillary  Clinton when the city is in chaos. And so, yes, a bit concern. </p><p> BOLTON:  So, let me ask you, speaking of being tone deaf, I mean, we do  want to play some clips from Mayor de Blasio. Here is one of them.</p><p> OK. Actually, we don't have that, but in essence he was essentially trying  to speak in favor of the police force. But he has come under so much fire  for not protecting the force. </p><p> PEEBLES:  Well, what has happened is that the mayor set the tone very  early. Bill de Blasio, after the grand jury decided not to indict the  officers for Eric Gardner's death he empathized with people who were in  fear of police violence as opposed to recognizing he is the leader of the  police department.</p><p> But the reality is, he's tried to racially polarize this issue. And  frankly, the minority community, African-American and Latinos  disproportionately carry the burden of crimes and there are no more  conservative New Yorker when it comes to law enforcement than African- Americans. </p><p> BOLTON:  So, let me ask you before we go, there is a Black Lives Matter  candidate, who actually, or I should activists, excuse me, who wants to put  himself forward to be the mayor of Baltimore. Is it a good mix to have an  activist turned mayor? </p><p> PEEBLES:  No. We see it in New York right now. Bill de Blasio was a paid  protester as a public advocate, so he was an activist. Being mayor of major  city or any city for that matter you're performing administrative functions  and municipal functions.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOLTON:  You have to serve everyone.</p><p> PEEBLES:  And also you have to be a good manager. These are multibillion  dollar organizations, activists belong in running for Congress, running for  the United States Senate. They belong, maybe on the city council but they  do not belong as managers. </p><p> Our city needs to be run by competent managers who have experienced in  managing and leading businesses or large organizations. </p><p> BOLTON:  All right. Don, well, when you're ready for your announcement you  know where to come. </p><p> PEEBLES:  Thank you.</p><p> BOLTON:  Don Peebles joining me there, in the meantime, real estate exec. </p><p> The refugee crisis is worsening in Germany. Another sexual assault in  Cologne. This one happened live as a reporter was working on air. My next  guest says Germany refugee cartoon etiquette is not working.</p><p> On a separate note, notorious drug CEO, Martin Shkreli plead the fifth  yesterday. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ELIJAH CUMMINGS, MARYLAND STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  You can look away if you  would like, but I wish you could see the faces of people no matter what Ms.  Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the drugs that they need.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BOLTON:  This so-called pharma bro now has posted a new video to YouTube  and you will not believe what he is saying. </p><p> And, Twitter announcing a moments ago, it is suspending more than 100,000  accounts it believes to be propaganda parts from ISIS. Is this better than  Facebook like attack strategy? Captain Chuck Nash is with me up next.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK COO:  They launched what they called a like  attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  Social media company Twitter just announcing it will shut down  more than 100,000 accounts that are deemed to be part of ISIS recruiting  accounts. </p><p> Retired navy captain and Fox News military analyst, Chuck Nash is with me  now. Captain, what is your take on Twitter's decision? </p><p> CHUCK NASH, RETIRED U.S. NAVY:  Well, I think there is to coming to public  pressure because people are outraged that these bad guys are being allowed  to use the same social networks that law-abiding people are and they're  disgusted with it. And I think they're valuing to pressure to shut it down. </p><p> BOLTON:  So, does this just mean though that terrorists will just find  another method by which to communicate? </p><p> NASH:  Oh, absolutely. They are not going to stop communicating. So, there  may be a good news story in this for our intelligence community because  they may be one step ahead of them finding out what their plan B was for  communications, and maybe this is really going to put them communicating on  networks that are a little more accessible to our NSA and other  intelligence operations. </p><p> BOLTON:  So, Captain, Facebook does not want to be left out of the  conversation or seen as being negligent. Here is the COO, Sheryl Sandberg. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SANDBERG:  So, that's the antidote to bad speech is good speech. They  launched what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.  So, the NPD is the neo-Nazi party. That page is filled with intolerance.  And rather than scream and protest they got 100,000 people to like the page  who did not like the page and then put messages of tolerance on the page. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  Chuck, what do you make of this kind of vigilante social media  participation? Is that the right way to go? </p><p> NASH:  No, that's just silly. That's just people trying to feel good about  something and doing nothing more than making a couple of keystrokes on a  handheld device. That's silly. That's like, release our girls or whatever  that was in Nigeria.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOLTON:  In Nigeria, yes.</p><p> NASH:  Yes. When Boko Haram took the 300 girls. That means absolutely  nothing. Its people trying to save their consciences, it's nothing.</p><p> BOLTON:  All right. Going from nothing to something deserving and  significant. A female journalists reporting on the carnival in Cologne,  Germany, says she was sexually assaulted on live TV.</p><p> NASH:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, we're showing a video right now. There is a man making  gestures behind her.</p><p> NASH:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  The reporter also saying someone grabbed her. How is Germany going  to address this issue and what does the U.S. have to learn from Germany's  example? </p><p> NASH:  Well, Deirdre, that's a -- that's a really long answer questions but  I'll keep it short. What you are actually seeing here is what happen in  Sweden in a microcosm. In the 1970's, rape was almost unknown in Sweden. </p><p> The government did a study several years later in the '80s and found out  the migrants from North Africa, the Muslim males that were coming up were  23 times more likely to commit rape. So, now you're seeing all of Europe.</p><p> In Germany, last year they had 100,000 applicants for asylum. Last month,  100,000 asylum seekers showed up just last month, and they're saying  they're going to take 800,000. These societies have got to get over this  political correctness because they are naivet, is jeopardizing public  safety and the safety of their entire culture. </p><p> BOLTON:  And we have heard Angela Merkel, of course, the German Chancellor  saying, listen, this is temporary. Asylum here in Germany is temporary and  they are going to endeavor to send a lot of the refugees back, which I  think unfortunately, for Germany's going to be very complicated. </p><p> What do you think though, of Cologne establishing this kind of safe zone  for women, in other words, almost segregating out its own women for their  won protection which...</p><p> NASH:  Exactly. So, here's the deal. This thing is like Mardi Gras in New  Orleans. So, it is -- yes, there is a lot of booze flying around. People  are drunk, they're happy and everything. But these gangs are moving around.  So, what are these women supposed to do? </p><p> Go into this tent area? That sounds like a lot of fun. So, really what the  German police are saying there are 2500 cops in this deal and there are  about 1.5 million visitors in Cologne in this Mardi Gras-type events. </p><p> So, who do they penalize? Whose freedom do they restrict? The women's.  That's nuts. They're not going to do that. </p><p> BOLTON:  It's nuts. All right. Captain Chuck Nash, we thank you as always.  Glad to have you here. </p><p> NASH:  My pleasure, Deirdre. </p><p> BOLTON:  From overseas to Michigan, the Flint water crisis just getting  worse and worse. New e-mail showing officials knew that the water was  poisoned.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm outrage that the EPA continues to allow this type  of dishonesty.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For that much money we poisoned the kids in Flint.  Didn't we?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I find it despicable. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  Our legal expert is going to tell us who he thinks is going to  jail over it.</p><p> Also, pharma bro, all he did was smirk yesterday. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CUMMINGS:  You can look away if you like but I wish you could see the faces  of people no matter what Ms. Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the drugs  that they need. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  Well, he is speaking out. Martin Shkreli has a new YouTube post.  We'll play it for you after this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARTIN SHKRELI, FORMER TURING PHARMACEUTICALS CEO:  Invoke my Fifth  Amendment privilege. I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. I invoke my  Fifth Amendment privilege.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GLENN GROTHMAN, WISCONSIN STATE CONGRESSMAN:  The question there was a  cover up, and the cover up of the worst kind. You've been costing people  money and people ask money as well. You are costing people their health and  maybe their lives. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  That was Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman on the unfolding  water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Now there are new e-mails released by the  Liberal Group Progress Michigan alleging that principle adviser to Michigan  Governor Rick Snyder was made aware of the crisis 10 months prior to the  governor informing the public. </p><p> Tammy Bruce is back with me now. So, Tammy, who was going to be held  accountable for 100,000 children being poisoned? </p><p> BRUCE:  Well, if we leave it up to the establishment, no one. We haven't  seen anyone when it comes to federal scandals that are being taken to task  for what they have done. I'd call a while ago for Governor Snyder's  resignation. </p><p> Look, Flint was under a state appointed emergency manager when this  occurred and the decision to switch to the Flint River was made.  Ultimately, any leader knows that the box stops with them. </p><p> Now with these e-mails showing that his main aide knew about this 10 months  before he said he did and this continues to go on is outrageous. Now, look,  I'm a conservative. I'm not a republican but I think that there's got to be  responsibility for everyone across the board. </p><p> Look, it's a progressive group that found this out. I don't care who  founded out. But the truth is the truth. Facts matter and I think Snyder  should take a step and resign at this point because if -- and look, the EPA  -- the scandal of government -- everybody. Everybody.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes. It's a scandal. I mean, there's no other way to say it. It's  a scandal.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes.</p><p> BOLTON:  Speaking of health matters from a different lens, pharma bro,  Martin's Shkreli just releasing a video blasting Congress on YouTube. Here  it is.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SHKRELI:  The reality is it's pathetic that they needed me to get publicity  for themselves. And, you know, I think it's transparent. I think it's  pathetic. They could have had a closed chamber meeting with me. They didn't  want that. They could have given me immunity, they didn't want that. The  last thing in the world they would want me to do is to testify because it  would be very embarrassing to them. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  Shkreli blasting Congress after getting an earful from lawmakers.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CUMMINGS:  You can look away if you would like but I wish you could see the  faces of people, no matter what Ms. Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the  drugs that they need. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  Tammy, to your credit you got into it Twitter altercation with  Shkreli. He does still have problems. He can go in front of that House  hearing and take the Fifth, but he also has security fraud charges against  him, right? </p><p> BRUCE:  Well, look, he's facing some serious criminal charges. I'm shocked  that his lawyers are allowing him to post things up on the internet at this  point. You know, what I think what happened in Congress was appropriate. </p><p> A lot of Americans don't realize what this guy did. But more than that it  really isn't all about him despite his feelings that it is, it's his own  narcissism obviously. This is about the nature of the kinds of choices  being made in the pharmaceutical industry, but also the kind of person that  we're dealing with. </p><p> And so, I think Congress did, I think everyone a favor, in highlighting  this guy's behavior and his attitude because when you -- look, I'm all for  profit. I like the pharmaceutical industries saves people's lives, but this  is the kind of things that we've to make sure that we focus on. </p><p> For Shkreli himself I'm surprised that no one in his family has intervened.  He's obviously a young man with some problems facing very serious charges.  And his lawyers stopped him at one point in the congressional hearing from  speaking which would -- which would have ended his Fifth Amendment right to  not speak and they should also try to protect him from himself at this  point. </p><p> BOLTON:  I was going to say he is lucky that his lawyer is on the case  because his lawyer is also trying to explain away with seems to be, from an  objective view, very bad behavior. </p><p> Tammy Bruce, thank you so much. </p><p> BRUCE:  Sure.</p><p> BOLTON:  See you in a bit.</p><p> In the meantime, moving to the big game on Sunday, Super Bowl brings in big  bucks for the players on the field whether they win or lose. Athletes  earning more than a million dollars are subject to a so-called jock tax. </p><p> Carolina Panthers quarterback, Cam Newton may be feeling it extra hard. </p><p> Cheryl Casone is with me now live from San Francisco. Cheryl, I know you  are ready for the big game but it is significant for all of these athletes  that is being played in California, right? </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, absolutely. Because of  the tax situation that the tax raised that are paid in the State of  California. And there are some of the highest of the world frankly. But,  you know, it was interesting, two years ago, Peyton Manning paid a lot of  taxes in the State of New Jersey because they won. </p><p> We thought those numbers were big. Cam Newton, if he wins on Sunday, he's  going to be paying so much bigger numbers. </p><p> First, we'll take a look at state tax rate for the State of California.  Again, it's called the jock tax. That's what we've named it here, 13.3  percent. That is the amount paid on earnings per athletes who earned a  million dollars or more and of course most of them do earn more than  million dollars or more. </p><p> But let's look at the income that you would get from the Super Bowl. No  matter who you are. The losing team for each player, $102,000, right? For  the winning team, 51,000. That's the income. Remember, California gets a  tax on every single penny that you make in their state.</p><p> Now, Cam Newton and the Panthers. OK. Now if they win, Cam Newton, in  particular, if he pays the State of California, his tax bill for 2016, he's  been, what do you say, guys, $159,560. That if he wins. </p><p> If he loses about the same story. Why -- why bother playing at Panthers if  loss in the Super Bowl. Mr. Newton will pay $159,200 in tax, Deirdre, for  2016. </p><p> He's also saying because it's a duty tax basically. Duty days in a calendar  year is how the State of California equates this. Your annual income, your  calendar income versus the amount of days that you work and the more you  make the worse the tax is. </p><p> But I got to say if would be nice to see Cam Newton win on Sunday. Back to  you in New York.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST:  I was just going to say. It's a  good weather in California, higher taxes. I don't know if the players are  comfortable with that trade. In the meantime, Cheryl Casone, thank you so  much. Live, you can see her there at the Super Bowl.</p><p> All right. Hillary Clinton says she is not an establishment candidate. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Senator sanders is the  only person who, I think would characterize me as a woman running to be the  first woman president as exemplifying the establishment, and enough is  enough.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BOLTON:  Our next guest says that Hillary Clinton keeps misplaying the  woman card. We'll talk about that. </p><p> Also, there is fatal frame collapse here in New York City, one person  killed, three injured, a 500-foot crane came falling down during rush hour.  The lone fatality was a man sitting in a parked car, a worker at a nearby  building caught the whole thing on his cell phone.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Almost even with us. There he goes. He's moving fast  now. He's dropping it really quick. (muted) That thing looks like it's  going to fall. Holy. It's falling. It's falling. Falling. Oh, it broke.  Holy!</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BERNIE SANDERS, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  One of the things we  should do is not only talk the talk but walk the walk. I am very proud to  be the only candidate up here who does not have a super PAC who's not  raising huge sums of money from Wall Street. </p><p> CLINTON:  You will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of  any donations that I ever received. So, I think it's time to end the very  artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent  weeks. And let's talk -- let's talk about the issues.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BOLTON:  Tensions were high as Hillary Clinton and Senator Sanders sparred  hard over issues such as campaign finance. Also terms such as,  establishment candidate and progressive candidate. </p><p> My political power panel is back. Tammy Bruce, John Rowley. So, Tammy, what  do you make of Hillary's connections, fundraising from Wall Street? Is this  going to cause her a problem? Or does it pale in comparison to the e-mail  scandal? </p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  Look, I think it's all a problem.  It's all linked. It's all about integrity. Obviously the American people  don't trust her for a reason. She has been the first lady, she's been a  senator from New York, the Secretary of State, and she stands there and  says she's not the establishment? </p><p> One good thing -- I'm a feminist, I was the president of the national  organization for women in L.A. and was on their board. We do know women now  have moved into the power rankings, we can be establishment, and I want a  woman to be president, but just not that one. </p><p> And I think she has to realize that she's not the only flame holder that we  know what she's doing. Women have other choices now. And I think that  whether it's the e-mails or even who she is, her own positioning, the money  she takes, all of it speaks to a lack of trust, a lack of credibility, and  a woman who tends to make things up as she goes along. </p><p> BOLTON:  All right. So, John, you heard Tammy's points there, I just want  to bring in Hillary Clinton's comments on saying that she is not an  establishment candidate.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CLINTON:  Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize  me, a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the  establishment. And enough is enough.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BOLTON:  So, John, that's obviously Hillary's take there. But about the e- mails, how much credibility -- how much is this going to cost her? There  are months to go until November. We don't know what else is going to come  out. </p><p> JOHN ROWLEY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, Senator Sanders has kind of made  the e-mail issue a moot point in the primary. And the establishment  argument is a little bit off base. I mean, I haven't seen many candidates  lose in the -- unlike the republican primary what's going on where there is  a battle over who's too moderate and establishment. </p><p> And frankly, Hillary Clinton has her toe in a lot of different parts of the  Democratic Party overtime. And frankly, I mean, the challenge she's had and  almost the single issue that Bernie Sanders has made is the Wall Street  angle. </p><p> And so, it's -- I think it's less of an establishment issue as kind of the  Wall Street message, which has given her some problems. And -- so anyway, I  think it's more Wall Street than an establishment issue. </p><p> BOLTON:  All right. Now, Hillary does sound pretty confident, though, as  far as the e-mails go. But I hear what you're saying, Tammy, this is all  wrapped up in the issue of credibility. </p><p> BRUCE:  Well, it is. And look, she's a robot. I mean, she's trained to  sound like she's confident. She makes things up. Look, Bernie -- Bernie  Sanders got more aggressive with her after that meeting with Barack Obama  in the White House. </p><p> And I think that you've realized -- there's one -- one female senator that  has not endorsed Hillary Clinton and that's Elizabeth Warren. Barack Obama  is not moving either. You've got this investigation with the FBI. </p><p> But what we're dealing with Hillary here is whether it's establishment or  Wall Street or you might think the two are the same, I happen to love Wall  Street, is the fact that her daughter who is campaigning for her, lives in  a $10 million condo in New York, a young woman who's married to a hedge  fund manager. </p><p> I mean, the attempts to portray herself as an outsider is in and of itself  insulting. Bernie Sanders made $5 million more last month than Hillary did.  This message is resonating because democrats are also sick and tired of  what's been going on. </p><p> ROWLEY:  Well, that's a pretty good litany of things that republican  primary voters are concerned about. But once we pivot to the general  election, a lot of these problems are just going to seem petty and  political and partisan. </p><p> And in terms of the e-mail, I mean, there's no precedent in the history of  the United States where a credible presidential candidate has been indicted  in a campaign and...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.</p><p> ROWLEY:  ... there needs to something dark and documented and provable...</p><p> BOLTON:  Well, time to go. </p><p> BRUCE:  She won't be the -- she won't be the nominee. So, it won't be an  issue. </p><p> BOLTON:  John and Tammy, thank you both. </p><p> ROWLEY:  Dream on. </p><p> BOLTON:  Glad to have you here.</p><p> ROWLEY:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  We just want to highlight quickly what happened in the markets.  Stocks got crushed. There was a monthly job number missed. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT:  Anyone claiming that  America's economy is in decline is pedaling fiction. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  New reports says investors are ditching stocks putting a lot in  cash. Find out if you should be doing the same. </p><p> Also, a $500 million price tag for a premium 30-second Super Bowl  commercial. Small businesses are usually left in the dark but not this one.  Bill Rancic, \"Apprentice\" winner is going to tell us about how he's giving  away a free Super Bowl ad to one lucky business. We'll tell you which one  it is, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The day of reckoning is upon us. My brother, what is  life if not to die a glorious death. But tonight we are in the heart of.  Rome awaitens and welcome them.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BOLTON:  That is a Super Bowl ad, set to air this Sunday, the small  business small business Death Wish Coffee, it's scored big with into a  quick book small business competition.</p><p> Former apprentice winner, small business advocate, Bill Rancic has teamed  up with into it. Bill, glad to have you here. So, this 30-second spot on  Sunday cost an average $5 million. Why did this company, this crazy coffee  company win? </p><p> BILL RANCIC, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" WINNER:  Well, you know, we -- we spent  the last year traveling around the country looking for small businesses to  participate in this competition called small business big game. And we had  tens of thousands of small businesses apply. Got narrowed down, narrowed  down, eventually everyone in America got to vote. And they chose Death Wish  Coffee. </p><p> It was just a great story. The young man started this business literally  moving home with his mom at the age of 30 and put his lifesavings on the  line and started it. He had an idea, he had a dream, and I think people  really connected with that story because that's how 98 percent of the small  businesses that are out there today started. So, it's a really connection. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOLTON:  Yes. Facebook started in a dorm room. </p><p> RANCIC:  And it's just one way of celebrating small business. </p><p> BOLTON:  Indeed. To your point, Bill, Facebook starting in a dorm room,  Google starting in a very modest split level house. The founder of Death  Wish Coffee, Mike Brown, was just moments ago on after the bell, we're  going to play a clip for anyone who missed that.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  I mean, what is it -- what do you think  it's going to be like to sit there during the Super Bowl and know that  millions of people are watching your ad? </p><p> MIKE BROWN, DEATH WISH COFFEE OWNER:  Yes. Millions are people are going to  discover Death Wish Coffee for the first time. And I mean, for a small  business owner, it's a dream come true.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  All right. So, there is his comment there. Now you, Bill, are the  original winner of the first \"Apprentice\" show. So, we have to ask. Have  you talked to Trump? </p><p> RANCIC:  You know, I haven't spoken to him in several months. But certainly  following his campaign closely and watching his rise to success in the  campaign. </p><p> BOLTON:  What do you think given your experience with him? </p><p> RANCIC:  Well, I can tell you this. He knows how to hire good people. </p><p> BOLTON:  All right.</p><p> RANCIC:  He hired me 13 years ago. </p><p> BOLTON:  There you go. Proof. </p><p> RANCIC:  But, you know, he's someone who has a proven track record, and he  knows how to get deals done. </p><p> BOLTON:  Bill Rancic, we thank you. Looking forward to seeing the ad live  on Sunday. Bill Rancic joining us there.</p><p> Stocks got crushed today. The NASDAQ down more than 3 percent. Even the  tech darlings from last year sold off in today's session. </p><p> Gary Smith back with me now. So, Gary, investors are pouring more than $200  billion into cash. Is this the right move? </p><p> GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT:  Well, it's the expected move. I  mean, most retail investors base their investing on emotions or the  momentum of the market. And since July, which, you know, we've seen the  great excess out, we've had the big market dip in August of last year. We  had the big market dip of January. Some would say it's still continuing. </p><p> Who could blame them out there? You can't get any returns on bonds so where  are you going to go cash? Now, to the quick answer to your question, is  that the way to go? Maybe back in July it was. Now I would say I think we  have further to go down. </p><p> So, if you have, say, $20,000 to invest, I would put 10,000 in the market  right now and wait for further pull back. </p><p> BOLTON:  All right. Gary, thank you very much. We love specific advice.  Gary Smith joining us there of Kadina Group.</p><p> Well, a huge stock drop. Speaking of networking site LinkedIn down more  than 40 percent. With me next a Silicon Valley investor on whether or not  another tech crash is coming. </p><p> Fifteen percent work force layoff, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer receiving  criticism over -- well, a lot of the moves that she's making. We'll fill  you in. </p><p> Plus, a fatal crane collapse right here in New York City. One person  killed, three others injured, a 500-foot crane came curling down during  rush hour. The lone fatality was a man sitting in a parked car. A worker at  a nearby building caught the whole thing on his cell phone. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Almost even with us. There he goes. He's moving fast  now. He's dropping it really quick. (muted) That thing looks like it's  going to fall. Holy. It's falling. It's falling. Falling. Oh, it broke.  Holy!</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BOLTON:  Tech stocks sold off today. Especially ones that had more than 50  percent gains last year. So, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, all down more than  5 percent in today's session. SoftTech Venture Capital founder managing  partner, Jeff Clavier is with me now. Jeff, it's great to see you. </p><p> JEFF CLAVIER, SOFTTECH VENTURE CAPITAL FOUNDER:  It's good to be back. </p><p> BOLTON:  When you see the NASDAQ down more than 3 percent, when you looked  at LinkedIn which was a big tech darling for many years, down something  like 45 percent. What do you think of the tech environment right now? </p><p> CLAVIER:  So, there's been a lot of nervousness in the market. We know that  since the beginning of the year. And there's been sort of expectations that  were priced in terms of continued growth. And they didn't deliver based on  how they said 2016 would shape up for them. And so, you know.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, Jeff, you've invest at the very beginning. </p><p> CLAVIER:  Very. </p><p> BOLTON:  And then you help a little bit as the company grows. Does this  change when you see big drops like this? Does this change the way that  you're investing now? </p><p> CLAVIER:  No. Not at the worst stage. We still do roughly 15 investments  per year and will continue doing so in 2016. I think the way the impact  we'll see is how downstream investors investing behind us will see growth  rounds will just change in terms of valuations and that two market  realities. </p><p> Because there's no way you can have a disconnect between public market  comes which have clearly falling down a lot this year and what was paid for  unicorns in the current market. </p><p> BOLTON:  You have invested in some -- well, numerous hot stocks. Some of  which are still private, some of which are still public, which public one  are the most proud of? That you saw early, you got in early. </p><p> CLAVIER:  I'm still happy what Fitbit has done. Obviously, down 50 percent  this year, but I think that it's actually the company which makes the world  a better place because it helps people to get in shape. </p><p> And I think that hopefully the market we understand that, you know, the  Apple watch won't kill it, that all of its competitors won't kill them  (Inaudible) and the new line up of products that are actually pretty  exciting. The market doesn't like it. But, you know, still has 17 awards. </p><p> BOLTON:  There's a new design, it looks good. </p><p> CLAVIER:  Fashion focused. </p><p> BOLTON:  With a company, though, such as Yahoo clearly on the ropes. Do you  get anxious that there are fewer potential buyers for any other companies  that you might be investing? </p><p> CLAVIER:  So, you know, it's actually pretty unusual to see those  valuations that are coming down which actually are going to get the buyers  back to the table of negotiating with hot company's potential buyouts. </p><p> Because over the last couple of years the expectations were so high that  the remaining (ph) market was pretty tipped. With, you know, all those  valuations sort of coming down. I've heard numerous sort of called, there  are people saying, OK, well, none of the market is back on track, let's  have a discussion. </p><p> BOLTON:  All right. That's the good start of all things. Jeff Clavier,  thank you so much. Joining me there, partner at SoftTech VC. </p><p> Super Bowl Sunday is this weekend. You know that. Cheryl Casone is there.  An update from her in just a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BOLTON:  It's Super Bowl weekend. Broncos quarterback, Peyton Manning  trying snag one more championship as retirement looms. The rising Carolina  Panthers star, Cam Newton trying to lead his team to the first Super Bowl  title. </p><p> Cheryl Casone is there in San Francisco. What's the atmosphere like,  Cheryl? </p><p> CASONE:  Well, this is the NFL experience. It's a fan's dream. If you love  football, in fact, we're right in front of radio row, we've been here a lot  of the afternoon. And this is where a lot of the big players.</p><p> I mean, you should have seen Tony Romo, quarterback for the Cowboys. You  couldn't even move in this space. So, it's a lot of fans, a lot of media, a  lot of companies. Everybody trying to kind of get a piece of the football  pie, if you will. </p><p> All the buzz, I got to say, is about Peyton Manning. So many questions  about whether or not he's going to retire after the season and still no  answers from him. He's going to have sell everybody himself.</p><p> Roger Goodell was here, of course, a lot of the executives. Also, about a  million people coming into the San Francisco Bay area. Security has been  insane. Blackhawk helicopters actually flying above the skies at San  Francisco. </p><p> The FBI, Department of Homeland Security surveilling everything. There's  camera everywhere. And I got to tell you, anybody that is going to be at  the Levi Stadium on Sunday, for the big game, Deirdre, smile for the  surveillance camera because they've got so many cameras on that stadium.  They are concerned about security. </p><p> They wanted to make sure that Super Bowl 50 goes off without a hitch. I got  to tell you, the other big piece of buzz right now and you're going to love  this, Coldplay, Beyonc,, Bruno Mars, right? There is a mystery guest cannot  get it out of the half time, people. We've all been trying today, but with  all those reporters and we don't know.</p><p> BOLTON:  Well, enjoy it all. Cheryl Casone joining us there from the Super  Bowl site. Speaking of super stars, Making Money with Charles Payne starts  now.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Bush, Kasich, Carly, Christie, all are pretty much are going to be done at the end. And I think if Rubio can continue this trend, I don't know that he's going to win, but he will have amazing momentum coming out of New Hampshire.</p><p>And I think one thing to keep in mind about polls especially around presidential primaries is, think about the impact they have on the campaigns and on voters when the last polls come out. Because, you know, voters react, campaigns reacted to do things.</p><p>So, one of the reasons that you had some surprising results in Iowa is campaigns did things differently. Sometimes out of desperation after there is a poll and voters react to that as well.</p><p>BOLTON: Tammy, if I have to ask you for gold, silver, and bronze, who do you think?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Well, look, this is more difficult than Iowa. I correctly predicted Iowa for <person><nameText>Ted Cruz, </nameText></person>but here the independents play such a big role. I think <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has an excellent chance of winning but we see the same trajectory as we did in Iowa.</p><p>His numbers are trending down. Rubio is still trending up. Cruz is a little bit static. It is the last stand. <person><nameText>Jeb Bush </nameText></person>has put virtually everything into New Hampshire. <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>is surprisingly not doing well at all in the polls.</p><p>I think though, when you're dealing with number one, I predict <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is going to win this one. And the fight is going to be per second. Now <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>still has a ground game second to none. He's able to target those who are inclined already to support him. And by the way though, this could all be changed if Cruz and Trump don't stop fighting.</p><p>If they divide their own vote that is what will give Rubio a chance to move into second. So, if Cruz and Trump stop fighting, Cruz will take second. If they don't, Rubio will take second. That's exactly where Rubio wants to be leading into South Carolina.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, Tammy, I heard you loudly and clearly. You think that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will win New Hampshire.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: I have to assume that's because there are so many independents...</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: ... and he seems to be appealing in that way to people. Here he is when confronted at a town hall in New Hampshire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Throughout the course of this campaign you said some disparaging comments about women, about people from other countries, other religions, and about everybody who has disagreed with you. Explain to me how I can look at my daughters and have them look up to a President Trump as a role model.</p><p>TRUMP: Nobody has more respect for women that I do. I have so many women executive. I have been great to women and women have been great to me. They've done a great job. I do bring up things that are things that people don't want to bring up. When I brought up the Muslim problem, you know, it's very interesting. I brought that problem up and all of a sudden the world started going wild and now the world is agreeing with me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: John, what do you think of Trump's response there?</p><p>ROWLEY: Well, I'm waiting for him to take credit for inventing the internet. I mean, he's really delusional that he is the first person that's talked about so many things in this campaign when a lot of different people in another Republican Party have talked about them for a long time.</p><p>Whether it's going to impact him or not, I mean, he's appealing to a sliver of the electorate, really the most conservative Tea Party angry or whiter or anti-Obama wing of the party sliver of the national electorate.</p><p>And I don't know that it will impact him in New Hampshire. I mean, the thing about New Hampshire voters though, is they are contrarians and I'm not sure if that means they deliver a surprise for Trump. They certainly have delivered surprises before, but, you know, that there may be one of those equal and opposite reactions to some late polling that we've certainly seen in both parties in New Hampshire in all of that.</p><p>BRUCE: Can I chime in one additional element that helps Trump...</p><p>BOLTON: Sure.</p><p>BRUCE: is the heroin addiction there in New Hampshire. It's a big issue. We know that it's related to the border, to the open border, to the ability of drugs moving up into this country. That is going to be something that matters from.</p><p>And also I notice that he did change his approach. He noted that he might - - he would like to win but he is not sure. I mean, his demeanor does seem to have shifted off of that for a span of 12 hours.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: So, his tone is changing?</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, a little bit.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>BRUCE: And I think that will -- that will help him obviously.</p><p>BOLTON: BOLTON: Tammy and John, stay with me, please. Other things to ask you about. In the meantime, on the other side of the aisle, last night's democratic debate Senator Sanders and Hillary Clinton sparred hard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the establishment and enough is enough.</p><p>SANDERS: And one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a super PAC, who's not using huge sums of money from Wall Street.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CLINTON: You will not find that I ever changed the view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received. So, I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks. And let's talk -- let's about the issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: My political power panel will be back with me shortly to tell you what they think of those two sides.</p><p>All right. Fox Business is going to be bringing you live coverage of our nation's first primary. It happens Tuesday, February 9the. Neil Cavuto, he's going to be bringing you those results from New Hampshire as soon as they come in starting at 7.55 Eastern Time.</p><p>If you look at the markets today, stocks got crushed. Fewer than forecast jobs were added to the U.S. economy. In his State of the Union address, President Obama had this to say to critics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Economist thought 190,000 jobs would be added to the U.S. economy. It was a lower number, 151,000, so 39,000 less. There is a new report that also shows the number of layoffs hit a six-month high soaring 218 percent from December to January.</p><p>Gary Smith is with me now. He is the president of Kadina Group. So, Gary, some economists are calling this jobs report mix. What is your take?</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT: I think that's optimistic. I think it's terrible would be the better word. Look, there was, what, 151,000 jobs created. Two-thirds of those jobs, Deirdre, were in retail. One third was in food services.</p><p>So, you know the job creator was not the CEO of McDonald's. It's people behind the counter flipping burgers or it's the person working the menswear section at Wal-Mart.</p><p>Those are the kinds of jobs we're creating. So, we're creating terrible jobs not even enough of them and then the other important numbers as you well know is the labor force participation rate. That continues to be dismal -- it's lower than it was a year ago. Meaning the number of jobs we're creating is not keeping up even with the population growth.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, Gary, to your point, it's something like the lowest as we've talked since the late '70s or early '80s. I'm taking your point on that. Gary Smith, thanks for that short, sweet perspective on today's jobs report.</p><p>Well, from national concerns to local ones, two NYPD officers were shot at a Bronx public housing complex in New York City. The incident follows the shootings of six other on-duty officers in a little bit more than a year. Now, four of those officers died.</p><p>New York City real estate executive, Don Peebles is with me now. Don, it's great to see you.</p><p>DON PEEBLES, NYC REAL ESTATE CHIEF EXECUTVE: Good to see you.</p><p>BOLTON: Does this change your view at all about doing business in New York?</p><p>PEEBLES: Well, look.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: But it seems to be increasing violence is what I mean.</p><p>PEEBLES: Well, I think what's happening here is the administration running the city is tone deaf and not living in reality. We are having a dramatic increase in random violence and that's frightening visitors from coming to New York and it's also making business owners more concerned.</p><p>And then you add that to these other discussions about raising tax and adding more regulations to the private sector and it forces people to look at alternative cities.</p><p>BOLTON: So, you've said in the past you are considering or would consider a run for mayor of New York City. Do incidences such of these propel you forward in your thinking to the extent of, OK, I could do better than what's happening now.</p><p>PEEBLES: Absolutely. That we have right now is we have criminals walking around with weapons and armed and...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: And they are shooting police officers in uniforms.</p><p>PEEBLES: ... they are shooting police officers who are sitting docks. We have slashing of women. We have women being raped who are tourist. Rape in central park. And the mayor is going to Iowa to knock on doors for Hillary Clinton when the city is in chaos. And so, yes, a bit concern.</p><p>BOLTON: So, let me ask you, speaking of being tone deaf, I mean, we do want to play some clips from Mayor de Blasio. Here is one of them.</p><p>OK. Actually, we don't have that, but in essence he was essentially trying to speak in favor of the police force. But he has come under so much fire for not protecting the force.</p><p>PEEBLES: Well, what has happened is that the mayor set the tone very early. Bill de Blasio, after the grand jury decided not to indict the officers for Eric Gardner's death he empathized with people who were in fear of police violence as opposed to recognizing he is the leader of the police department.</p><p>But the reality is, he's tried to racially polarize this issue. And frankly, the minority community, African-American and Latinos disproportionately carry the burden of crimes and there are no more conservative New Yorker when it comes to law enforcement than African- Americans.</p><p>BOLTON: So, let me ask you before we go, there is a Black Lives Matter candidate, who actually, or I should activists, excuse me, who wants to put himself forward to be the mayor of Baltimore. Is it a good mix to have an activist turned mayor?</p><p>PEEBLES: No. We see it in New York right now. Bill de Blasio was a paid protester as a public advocate, so he was an activist. Being mayor of major city or any city for that matter you're performing administrative functions and municipal functions.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: You have to serve everyone.</p><p>PEEBLES: And also you have to be a good manager. These are multibillion dollar organizations, activists belong in running for Congress, running for the United States Senate. They belong, maybe on the city council but they do not belong as managers.</p><p>Our city needs to be run by competent managers who have experienced in managing and leading businesses or large organizations.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Don, well, when you're ready for your announcement you know where to come.</p><p>PEEBLES: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Don Peebles joining me there, in the meantime, real estate exec.</p><p>The refugee crisis is worsening in Germany. Another sexual assault in Cologne. This one happened live as a reporter was working on air. My next guest says Germany refugee cartoon etiquette is not working.</p><p>On a separate note, notorious drug CEO, Martin Shkreli plead the fifth yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIJAH CUMMINGS, MARYLAND STATE REPRESENTATIVE: You can look away if you would like, but I wish you could see the faces of people no matter what Ms. Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the drugs that they need.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: This so-called pharma bro now has posted a new video to YouTube and you will not believe what he is saying.</p><p>And, Twitter announcing a moments ago, it is suspending more than 100,000 accounts it believes to be propaganda parts from ISIS. Is this better than Facebook like attack strategy? Captain Chuck Nash is with me up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK COO: They launched what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Social media company Twitter just announcing it will shut down more than 100,000 accounts that are deemed to be part of ISIS recruiting accounts.</p><p>Retired navy captain and Fox News military analyst, Chuck Nash is with me now. Captain, what is your take on Twitter's decision?</p><p>CHUCK NASH, RETIRED U.S. NAVY: Well, I think there is to coming to public pressure because people are outraged that these bad guys are being allowed to use the same social networks that law-abiding people are and they're disgusted with it. And I think they're valuing to pressure to shut it down.</p><p>BOLTON: So, does this just mean though that terrorists will just find another method by which to communicate?</p><p>NASH: Oh, absolutely. They are not going to stop communicating. So, there may be a good news story in this for our intelligence community because they may be one step ahead of them finding out what their plan B was for communications, and maybe this is really going to put them communicating on networks that are a little more accessible to our NSA and other intelligence operations.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Captain, Facebook does not want to be left out of the conversation or seen as being negligent. Here is the COO, Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDBERG: So, that's the antidote to bad speech is good speech. They launched what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD. So, the NPD is the neo-Nazi party. That page is filled with intolerance. And rather than scream and protest they got 100,000 people to like the page who did not like the page and then put messages of tolerance on the page.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Chuck, what do you make of this kind of vigilante social media participation? Is that the right way to go?</p><p>NASH: No, that's just silly. That's just people trying to feel good about something and doing nothing more than making a couple of keystrokes on a handheld device. That's silly. That's like, release our girls or whatever that was in Nigeria.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: In Nigeria, yes.</p><p>NASH: Yes. When Boko Haram took the 300 girls. That means absolutely nothing. Its people trying to save their consciences, it's nothing.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Going from nothing to something deserving and significant. A female journalists reporting on the carnival in Cologne, Germany, says she was sexually assaulted on live TV.</p><p>NASH: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: So, we're showing a video right now. There is a man making gestures behind her.</p><p>NASH: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: The reporter also saying someone grabbed her. How is Germany going to address this issue and what does the U.S. have to learn from Germany's example?</p><p>NASH: Well, Deirdre, that's a -- that's a really long answer questions but I'll keep it short. What you are actually seeing here is what happen in Sweden in a microcosm. In the 1970's, rape was almost unknown in Sweden.</p><p>The government did a study several years later in the '80s and found out the migrants from North Africa, the Muslim males that were coming up were 23 times more likely to commit rape. So, now you're seeing all of Europe.</p><p>In Germany, last year they had 100,000 applicants for asylum. Last month, 100,000 asylum seekers showed up just last month, and they're saying they're going to take 800,000. These societies have got to get over this political correctness because they are naivet\u201a is jeopardizing public safety and the safety of their entire culture.</p><p>BOLTON: And we have heard Angela Merkel, of course, the German Chancellor saying, listen, this is temporary. Asylum here in Germany is temporary and they are going to endeavor to send a lot of the refugees back, which I think unfortunately, for Germany's going to be very complicated.</p><p>What do you think though, of Cologne establishing this kind of safe zone for women, in other words, almost segregating out its own women for their won protection which...</p><p>NASH: Exactly. So, here's the deal. This thing is like Mardi Gras in New Orleans. So, it is -- yes, there is a lot of booze flying around. People are drunk, they're happy and everything. But these gangs are moving around. So, what are these women supposed to do?</p><p>Go into this tent area? That sounds like a lot of fun. So, really what the German police are saying there are 2500 cops in this deal and there are about 1.5 million visitors in Cologne in this Mardi Gras-type events.</p><p>So, who do they penalize? Whose freedom do they restrict? The women's. That's nuts. They're not going to do that.</p><p>BOLTON: It's nuts. All right. Captain Chuck Nash, we thank you as always. Glad to have you here.</p><p>NASH: My pleasure, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: From overseas to Michigan, the Flint water crisis just getting worse and worse.

I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLENN GROTHMAN, WISCONSIN STATE CONGRESSMAN: The question there was a cover up, and the cover up of the worst kind. You've been costing people money and people ask money as well. You are costing people their health and maybe their lives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: That was Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman on the unfolding water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Now there are new e-mails released by the Liberal Group Progress Michigan alleging that principle adviser to Michigan Governor Rick Snyder was made aware of the crisis 10 months prior to the governor informing the public.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is back with me now. So, Tammy, who was going to be held accountable for 100,000 children being poisoned?</p><p>BRUCE: Well, if we leave it up to the establishment, no one. We haven't seen anyone when it comes to federal scandals that are being taken to task for what they have done. I'd call a while ago for Governor Snyder's resignation.</p><p>Look, Flint was under a state appointed emergency manager when this occurred and the decision to switch to the Flint River was made. Ultimately, any leader knows that the box stops with them.</p><p>Now with these e-mails showing that his main aide knew about this 10 months before he said he did and this continues to go on is outrageous. Now, look, I'm a conservative. I'm not a republican but I think that there's got to be responsibility for everyone across the board.</p><p>Look, it's a progressive group that found this out. I don't care who founded out. But the truth is the truth. Facts matter and I think Snyder should take a step and resign at this point because if -- and look, the EPA -- the scandal of government -- everybody. Everybody.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. It's a scandal. I mean, there's no other way to say it. It's a scandal.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of health matters from a different lens, pharma bro, Martin's Shkreli just releasing a video blasting Congress on YouTube. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHKRELI: The reality is it's pathetic that they needed me to get publicity for themselves. And, you know, I think it's transparent. I think it's pathetic. They could have had a closed chamber meeting with me. They didn't want that. They could have given me immunity, they didn't want that. The last thing in the world they would want me to do is to testify because it would be very embarrassing to them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Shkreli blasting Congress after getting an earful from lawmakers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CUMMINGS: You can look away if you would like but I wish you could see the faces of people, no matter what Ms. Redzclaff (ph) says who cannot get the drugs that they need.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Tammy, to your credit you got into it Twitter altercation with Shkreli. He does still have problems. He can go in front of that House hearing and take the Fifth, but he also has security fraud charges against him, right?</p><p>BRUCE: Well, look, he's facing some serious criminal charges. I'm shocked that his lawyers are allowing him to post things up on the internet at this point. You know, what I think what happened in Congress was appropriate.</p><p>A lot of Americans don't realize what this guy did. But more than that it really isn't all about him despite his feelings that it is, it's his own narcissism obviously. This is about the nature of the kinds of choices being made in the pharmaceutical industry, but also the kind of person that we're dealing with.</p><p>And so, I think Congress did, I think everyone a favor, in highlighting this guy's behavior and his attitude because when you -- look, I'm all for profit. I like the pharmaceutical industries saves people's lives, but this is the kind of things that we've to make sure that we focus on.</p><p>For Shkreli himself I'm surprised that no one in his family has intervened. He's obviously a young man with some problems facing very serious charges. And his lawyers stopped him at one point in the congressional hearing from speaking which would -- which would have ended his Fifth Amendment right to not speak and they should also try to protect him from himself at this point.</p><p>BOLTON: I was going to say he is lucky that his lawyer is on the case because his lawyer is also trying to explain away with seems to be, from an objective view, very bad behavior.</p><p>Tammy Bruce, thank you so much.</p><p>BRUCE: Sure.</p><p>BOLTON: See you in a bit.</p><p>In the meantime, moving to the big game on Sunday, Super Bowl brings in big bucks for the players on the field whether they win or lose. Athletes earning more than a million dollars are subject to a so-called jock tax.</p><p>Carolina Panthers quarterback, Cam Newton may be feeling it extra hard.</p><p>Cheryl Casone is with me now live from San Francisco. Cheryl, I know you are ready for the big game but it is significant for all of these athletes that is being played in California, right?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, absolutely. Because of the tax situation that the tax raised that are paid in the State of California. And there are some of the highest of the world frankly. But, you know, it was interesting, two years ago, Peyton Manning paid a lot of taxes in the State of New Jersey because they won.</p><p>We thought those numbers were big. Cam Newton, if he wins on Sunday, he's going to be paying so much bigger numbers.</p><p>First, we'll take a look at state tax rate for the State of California. Again, it's called the jock tax. That's what we've named it here, 13.3 percent. That is the amount paid on earnings per athletes who earned a million dollars or more and of course most of them do earn more than million dollars or more.</p><p>But let's look at the income that you would get from the Super Bowl. No matter who you are. The losing team for each player, $102,000, right? For the winning team, 51,000. That's the income. Remember, California gets a tax on every single penny that you make in their state.</p><p>Now, Cam Newton and the Panthers. OK. Now if they win, Cam Newton, in particular, if he pays the State of California, his tax bill for 2016, he's been, what do you say, guys, $159,560. That if he wins.</p><p>If he loses about the same story. Why -- why bother playing at Panthers if loss in the Super Bowl. Mr. Newton will pay $159,200 in tax, Deirdre, for 2016.</p><p>He's also saying because it's a duty tax basically. Duty days in a calendar year is how the State of California equates this. Your annual income, your calendar income versus the amount of days that you work and the more you make the worse the tax is.</p><p>But I got to say if would be nice to see Cam Newton win on Sunday. Back to you in New York.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: I was just going to say. It's a good weather in California, higher taxes. I don't know if the players are comfortable with that trade. In the meantime, Cheryl Casone, thank you so much. Live, you can see her there at the Super Bowl.</p><p>All right. Hillary Clinton says she is not an establishment candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Senator sanders is the only person who, I think would characterize me as a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the establishment, and enough is enough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Our next guest says that Hillary Clinton keeps misplaying the woman card. We'll talk about that.</p><p>Also, there is fatal frame collapse here in New York City, one person killed, three injured, a 500-foot crane came falling down during rush hour. The lone fatality was a man sitting in a parked car, a worker at a nearby building caught the whole thing on his cell phone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Almost even with us. There he goes. He's moving fast now. He's dropping it really quick. (muted) That thing looks like it's going to fall. Holy. It's falling. It's falling. Falling. Oh, it broke. Holy!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, (D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of the things we should do is not only talk the talk but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a super PAC who's not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street.</p><p>CLINTON: You will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donations that I ever received. So, I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks. And let's talk -- let's talk about the issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Tensions were high as Hillary Clinton and Senator Sanders sparred hard over issues such as campaign finance. Also terms such as, establishment candidate and progressive candidate.</p><p>My political power panel is back. Tammy Bruce, John Rowley. So, Tammy, what do you make of Hillary's connections, fundraising from Wall Street? Is this going to cause her a problem? Or does it pale in comparison to the e-mail scandal?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Look, I think it's all a problem. It's all linked. It's all about integrity. Obviously the American people don't trust her for a reason. She has been the first lady, she's been a senator from New York, the Secretary of State, and she stands there and says she's not the establishment?</p><p>One good thing -- I'm a feminist, I was the president of the national organization for women in L.A. and was on their board. We do know women now have moved into the power rankings, we can be establishment, and I want a woman to be president, but just not that one.</p><p>And I think she has to realize that she's not the only flame holder that we know what she's doing. Women have other choices now. And I think that whether it's the e-mails or even who she is, her own positioning, the money she takes, all of it speaks to a lack of trust, a lack of credibility, and a woman who tends to make things up as she goes along.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. So, John, you heard Tammy's points there, I just want to bring in Hillary Clinton's comments on saying that she is not an establishment candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the establishment. And enough is enough.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, John, that's obviously Hillary's take there. But about the e- mails, how much credibility -- how much is this going to cost her? There are months to go until November. We don't know what else is going to come out.</p><p>JOHN ROWLEY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, Senator Sanders has kind of made the e-mail issue a moot point in the primary. And the establishment argument is a little bit off base. I mean, I haven't seen many candidates lose in the -- unlike the republican primary what's going on where there is a battle over who's too moderate and establishment.</p><p>And frankly, Hillary Clinton has her toe in a lot of different parts of the Democratic Party overtime. And frankly, I mean, the challenge she's had and almost the single issue that Bernie Sanders has made is the Wall Street angle.</p><p>And so, it's -- I think it's less of an establishment issue as kind of the Wall Street message, which has given her some problems. And -- so anyway, I think it's more Wall Street than an establishment issue.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Now, Hillary does sound pretty confident, though, as far as the e-mails go. But I hear what you're saying, Tammy, this is all wrapped up in the issue of credibility.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, it is. And look, she's a robot. I mean, she's trained to sound like she's confident. She makes things up. Look, Bernie -- Bernie Sanders got more aggressive with her after that meeting with Barack Obama in the White House.</p><p>And I think that you've realized -- there's one -- one female senator that has not endorsed Hillary Clinton and that's Elizabeth Warren. Barack Obama is not moving either. You've got this investigation with the FBI.</p><p>But what we're dealing with Hillary here is whether it's establishment or Wall Street or you might think the two are the same, I happen to love Wall Street, is the fact that her daughter who is campaigning for her, lives in a $10 million condo in New York, a young woman who's married to a hedge fund manager.</p><p>I mean, the attempts to portray herself as an outsider is in and of itself insulting. Bernie Sanders made $5 million more last month than Hillary did. This message is resonating because democrats are also sick and tired of what's been going on.</p><p>ROWLEY: Well, that's a pretty good litany of things that republican primary voters are concerned about. But once we pivot to the general election, a lot of these problems are just going to seem petty and political and partisan.</p><p>And in terms of the e-mail, I mean, there's no precedent in the history of the United States where a credible presidential candidate has been indicted in a campaign and...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>ROWLEY: ... there needs to something dark and documented and provable...</p><p>BOLTON: Well, time to go.</p><p>BRUCE: She won't be the -- she won't be the nominee. So, it won't be an issue.</p><p>BOLTON: John and Tammy, thank you both.</p><p>ROWLEY: Dream on.</p><p>BOLTON: Glad to have you here.</p><p>ROWLEY: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: We just want to highlight quickly what happened in the markets. Stocks got crushed. There was a monthly job number missed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is pedaling fiction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: New reports says investors are ditching stocks putting a lot in cash. Find out if you should be doing the same.</p><p>Also, a $500 million price tag for a premium 30-second Super Bowl commercial. Small businesses are usually left in the dark but not this one. Bill Rancic, \"Apprentice\" winner is going to tell us about how he's giving away a free Super Bowl ad to one lucky business. We'll tell you which one it is, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The day of reckoning is upon us. My brother, what is life if not to die a glorious death. But tonight we are in the heart of. Rome awaitens and welcome them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: That is a Super Bowl ad, set to air this Sunday, the small business small business Death Wish Coffee, it's scored big with into a quick book small business competition.</p><p>Former apprentice winner, small business advocate, Bill Rancic has teamed up with into it. Bill, glad to have you here. So, this 30-second spot on Sunday cost an average $5 million. Why did this company, this crazy coffee company win?</p><p>BILL RANCIC, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" WINNER: Well, you know, we -- we spent the last year traveling around the country looking for small businesses to participate in this competition called small business big game. And we had tens of thousands of small businesses apply. Got narrowed down, narrowed down, eventually everyone in America got to vote. And they chose Death Wish Coffee.</p><p>It was just a great story. The young man started this business literally moving home with his mom at the age of 30 and put his lifesavings on the line and started it. He had an idea, he had a dream, and I think people really connected with that story because that's how 98 percent of the small businesses that are out there today started. So, it's a really connection.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. Facebook started in a dorm room.</p><p>RANCIC: And it's just one way of celebrating small business.</p><p>BOLTON: Indeed. To your point, Bill, Facebook starting in a dorm room, Google starting in a very modest split level house. The founder of Death Wish Coffee, Mike Brown, was just moments ago on after the bell, we're going to play a clip for anyone who missed that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: I mean, what is it -- what do you think it's going to be like to sit there during the Super Bowl and know that millions of people are watching your ad?</p><p>MIKE BROWN, DEATH WISH COFFEE OWNER: Yes. Millions are people are going to discover Death Wish Coffee for the first time. And I mean, for a small business owner, it's a dream come true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: All right. So, there is his comment there. Now you, Bill, are the original winner of the first \"Apprentice\" show. So, we have to ask. Have you talked to Trump?</p><p>RANCIC: You know, I haven't spoken to him in several months. But certainly following his campaign closely and watching his rise to success in the campaign.</p><p>BOLTON: What do you think given your experience with him?</p><p>RANCIC: Well, I can tell you this. He knows how to hire good people.</p><p>BOLTON: All right.</p><p>RANCIC: He hired me 13 years ago.</p><p>BOLTON: There you go. Proof.</p><p>RANCIC: But, you know, he's someone who has a proven track record, and he knows how to get deals done.</p><p>BOLTON: Bill Rancic, we thank you. Looking forward to seeing the ad live on Sunday. Bill Rancic joining us there.</p><p>Stocks got crushed today. The NASDAQ down more than 3 percent. Even the tech darlings from last year sold off in today's session.</p><p>Gary Smith back with me now. So, Gary, investors are pouring more than $200 billion into cash. Is this the right move?</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, KADINA GROUP PRESIDENT: Well, it's the expected move. I mean, most retail investors base their investing on emotions or the momentum of the market. And since July, which, you know, we've seen the great excess out, we've had the big market dip in August of last year. We had the big market dip of January. Some would say it's still continuing.</p><p>Who could blame them out there? You can't get any returns on bonds so where are you going to go cash? Now, to the quick answer to your question, is that the way to go? Maybe back in July it was. Now I would say I think we have further to go down.</p><p>So, if you have, say, $20,000 to invest, I would put 10,000 in the market right now and wait for further pull back.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Gary, thank you very much. We love specific advice. Gary Smith joining us there of Kadina Group.</p><p>Well, a huge stock drop. Speaking of networking site LinkedIn down more than 40 percent. With me next a Silicon Valley investor on whether or not another tech crash is coming.</p><p>Fifteen percent work force layoff, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer receiving criticism over -- well, a lot of the moves that she's making. We'll fill you in.</p><p>Plus, a fatal crane collapse right here in New York City. One person killed, three others injured, a 500-foot crane came curling down during rush hour. The lone fatality was a man sitting in a parked car. A worker at a nearby building caught the whole thing on his cell phone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Almost even with us. There he goes. He's moving fast now. He's dropping it really quick. (muted) That thing looks like it's going to fall. Holy. It's falling. It's falling. Falling. Oh, it broke. Holy!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Tech stocks sold off today. Especially ones that had more than 50 percent gains last year. So, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, all down more than 5 percent in today's session. SoftTech Venture Capital founder managing partner, Jeff Clavier is with me now. Jeff, it's great to see you.</p><p>JEFF CLAVIER, SOFTTECH VENTURE CAPITAL FOUNDER: It's good to be back.</p><p>BOLTON: When you see the NASDAQ down more than 3 percent, when you looked at LinkedIn which was a big tech darling for many years, down something like 45 percent. What do you think of the tech environment right now?</p><p>CLAVIER: So, there's been a lot of nervousness in the market. We know that since the beginning of the year. And there's been sort of expectations that were priced in terms of continued growth. And they didn't deliver based on how they said 2016 would shape up for them. And so, you know.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Jeff, you've invest at the very beginning.</p><p>CLAVIER: Very.</p><p>BOLTON: And then you help a little bit as the company grows. Does this change when you see big drops like this? Does this change the way that you're investing now?</p><p>CLAVIER: No. Not at the worst stage. We still do roughly 15 investments per year and will continue doing so in 2016. I think the way the impact we'll see is how downstream investors investing behind us will see growth rounds will just change in terms of valuations and that two market realities.</p><p>Because there's no way you can have a disconnect between public market comes which have clearly falling down a lot this year and what was paid for unicorns in the current market.</p><p>BOLTON: You have invested in some -- well, numerous hot stocks. Some of which are still private, some of which are still public, which public one are the most proud of? That you saw early, you got in early.</p><p>CLAVIER: I'm still happy what Fitbit has done. Obviously, down 50 percent this year, but I think that it's actually the company which makes the world a better place because it helps people to get in shape.</p><p>And I think that hopefully the market we understand that, you know, the Apple watch won't kill it, that all of its competitors won't kill them (Inaudible) and the new line up of products that are actually pretty exciting. The market doesn't like it. But, you know, still has 17 awards.</p><p>BOLTON: There's a new design, it looks good.</p><p>CLAVIER: Fashion focused.</p><p>BOLTON: With a company, though, such as Yahoo clearly on the ropes. Do you get anxious that there are fewer potential buyers for any other companies that you might be investing?</p><p>CLAVIER: So, you know, it's actually pretty unusual to see those valuations that are coming down which actually are going to get the buyers back to the table of negotiating with hot company's potential buyouts.</p><p>Because over the last couple of years the expectations were so high that the remaining (ph) market was pretty tipped. With, you know, all those valuations sort of coming down. I've heard numerous sort of called, there are people saying, OK, well, none of the market is back on track, let's have a discussion.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. That's the good start of all things. Jeff Clavier, thank you so much. Joining me there, partner at SoftTech VC.</p><p>Super Bowl Sunday is this weekend. You know that. Cheryl Casone is there. An update from her in just a minute.</p><p>BOLTON: It's Super Bowl weekend. Broncos quarterback, Peyton Manning trying snag one more championship as retirement looms. The rising Carolina Panthers star, Cam Newton trying to lead his team to the first Super Bowl title.</p><p>Cheryl Casone is there in San Francisco. What's the atmosphere like, Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: Well, this is the NFL experience. It's a fan's dream. If you love football, in fact, we're right in front of radio row, we've been here a lot of the afternoon. And this is where a lot of the big players.</p><p>I mean, you should have seen Tony Romo, quarterback for the Cowboys. You couldn't even move in this space. So, it's a lot of fans, a lot of media, a lot of companies. Everybody trying to kind of get a piece of the football pie, if you will.</p><p>All the buzz, I got to say, is about Peyton Manning. So many questions about whether or not he's going to retire after the season and still no answers from him. He's going to have sell everybody himself.</p><p>Roger Goodell was here, of course, a lot of the executives. Also, about a million people coming into the San Francisco Bay area. Security has been insane. Blackhawk helicopters actually flying above the skies at San Francisco.</p><p>The FBI, Department of Homeland Security surveilling everything. There's camera everywhere. And I got to tell you, anybody that is going to be at the Levi Stadium on Sunday, for the big game, Deirdre, smile for the surveillance camera because they've got so many cameras on that stadium. They are concerned about security.</p><p>They wanted to make sure that Super Bowl 50 goes off without a hitch. I got to tell you, the other big piece of buzz right now and you're going to love this, Coldplay, Beyonc\u201a, Bruno Mars, right? There is a mystery guest cannot get it out of the half time, people. We've all been trying today, but with all those reporters and we don't know.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, enjoy it all. Cheryl Casone joining us there from the Super Bowl site. Speaking of super stars, Making Money with Charles Payne starts now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2016020501cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J1G-C5R1-DXH2-62N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7271\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

Members of the House judiciary's antitrust subcommittee have investigated the internet giants for more than a year on accusations that they stifled rivals and harmed consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The hearing is the government's most aggressive show against tech power since the pursuit to break up Microsoft two decades ago. It is set to be a bizarre spectacle, with four men who run companies worth a total of around $4.85 trillion -- and who include two of the world's richest individuals -- primed to argue that their businesses are not really that powerful after all.</p><p>  And it will be a first in another way: Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai, Mr. Bezos and Mr. Cook will all be testifying via videoconference, rather than rising side-by-side for a swearing-in at a witness table in Washington. Perhaps appropriately, their reckoning will be broadcast online.</p><p>  ''It has the feeling of tech's Big Tobacco moment,'' said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser at the Federal Communications Commission and a fellow at Georgetown University's law school, referring to the 1994 congressional appearance of top executives of the seven largest American tobacco companies, who said they did not believe that cigarettes were addictive. </p><p>  The hearing, which caps a 13-month investigation by the House subcommittee, will be closely watched for clues that could advance other antitrust cases against the companies. The Federal Trade Commission, for one, is preparing to depose Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives in its 13-month probe of the social network. The Justice Department may soon unveil a case against Google. And an investigation into Apple by state attorneys general also appears to be advancing.</p><p>  As a result, preparations for the hearing have been frenetic -- even with the event postponed by a few days this week to accommodate the commemoration of Representative John Lewis -- as tech lobbyists jockeyed behind the scenes to influence the types of questions that lawmakers might ask.</p><p>  At the hearing, which starts at noon on Wednesday, the 15 members of the antitrust subcommittee will have five minutes for each question. Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the subcommittee, will control the number of rounds of questioning, potentially stretching questioning into the evening.</p><p>  The length of the hearing may also be prolonged since the antitrust issues facing Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon are complex and vastly different.</p><p>Amazon is accused of abusing its role as both a retailer and a platform hosting third-party sellers on its marketplace. Apple has been accused of unfairly using its clout over its App Store to block rivals and to force apps to pay high commissions. Rivals have said Facebook has a monopoly in social networking. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is dealing with multiple antitrust allegations because of Google's dominance in online advertising, search and smartphone software.</p><p>  Democrats may also veer off the topic of antitrust and bring up concerns about misinformation on social media. Some Republicans are expected to sidetrack discussion with their concerns of liberal bias at the Silicon Valley companies and accusations that conservative voices are censored.</p><p>  ''There was an attitude these were great American companies that created jobs and that we should have a hands-off approach and let them flourish,'' Mr. Cicilline said in an interview. ''But there are a lot of serious issues we have uncovered over the course of the investigation that weren't apparent when we first began investigating.''</p><p>Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple declined to comment.</p><p>  For the chief executives, the hearing will be a test of how they perform under fire. Mr. Bezos, 56, has not previously testified to Congress, while Mr. Cook, 59, and Mr. Pichai, 48, have both testified once before. Mr. Zuckerberg, 36, the youngest of the group, has the distinction of being the veteran: He has answered questions at three congressional hearings in the past two years as Facebook has dealt with issues such as election interference and privacy violations.</p><p>  But none are taking any chances for the event to go awry. Mr. Zuckerberg, who had been at his 750-acre estate on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, has been preparing for his testimony with the law firm WilmerHale, according to people with knowledge of the matter. And a small team is working with Mr. Bezos for his testimony in Seattle, said people with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>  For weeks, the tech giants have also waged a lobbying battle to soften any blows. All four chief executives planned to call lawmakers on the House subcommittee in the days before the hearing, said three people with knowledge of the preparations who were not authorized to speak publicly. </p><p>Apple and Amazon also recently released studies to rebut claims of market dominance and anticompetitive practices. Last week, Apple publicized a study by a consulting firm called Analysis Group showing that the 30 percent commission it charges many apps for the right to appear on iPhones is close to what other platforms charge for distribution. The study left out that Apple helped popularize that 30 percent standard across the industry.</p><p>Amazon-funded economic consultants have in recent months argued that the e-commerce company's business model, which is not grounded in selling ads like Google and Facebook, makes it less likely to violate antitrust laws. Last week, Amazon also released a report on small business, saying sales by third-party sellers grew 26 percent in the past year, outpacing Amazon's own sales directly to consumers.</p><p>Google has said that the search and advertising tech markets that it dominates are changing fast. More than half of all searches for products on the internet originate on Amazon, Google's lobbyists have said.</p><p>  And Facebook's Washington staff has pointed to competition from China, particularly from the popular video app TikTok, as evidence that competition in social media abounds. The Chinese-owned app is in the cross hairs of the Trump administration, which has threatened to ban it for national security reasons.</p><p>  Big Tech's rivals have also jockeyed to have their gripes brought up at the hearing, even if for just a few minutes. The House subcommittee has been flooded with proposed questions, documents and letters from the companies' competitors, according to congressional staff and rivals.</p><p>Spotify, for instance, submitted questions about Apple's dominance of the App Store. GreatFire, a China-based group, sent a letter with nine questions for Mr. Cook about Apple's censorship of certain apps in China. Blix, a company whose email app competes with Apple and that is suing Apple in federal court for patent infringement, sent five questions to the subcommittee, including one on why Apple ranked its own apps ahead of rivals' offerings in its App Store.</p><p>  This month, David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, a project-management tool, said he also briefed lawmakers on a recent public spat with Apple. Apple had denied Basecamp's new email app from appearing in the App Store because it charged customers outside of Apple's payment system. After Mr. Heinemeier Hansson complained publicly, Apple permitted the app with some minor changes.</p><p>  The subcommittee's members, who have already held five hearings about the tech giants, were informed and thoughtful during his briefing, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson said.</p><p>  ''Clearly there's already a great resonance,'' he said.</p><p>  Even if the hearing results in more theater than substance, some said the greatest risk to the tech companies was increasing momentum toward regulations.</p><p>  ''The C.E.O.s don't want to be testifying. Even having this collective hearing creates a sense of quasi-guilt just because of who else has gotten called in like this -- Big Pharma, Big Tobacco, Big Banks,'' said Paul Gallant, a tech policy analyst at the investment firm Cowen. ''That's not a crowd they want to be associated with.''</p><p>  Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Jack Nicas from Chicago and David McCabe from Wellfleet, Mass.

By Keith A. Spencer, a cultural critic, essayist, and editor at Salon.com. Cross-posted from Alternet[1]. The word 'innovation' has become synonymous with Silicon Valley to the point of absurdity. Indeed, the tech industry's entrepreneurs and 'thoughtfluencers' throw it around as casually as a dodgeball in a middle-school P.E. class; what it really means is perpetually unclear and purposefully hazy. </p><p>It is vague enough to be suitable in nearly any situation where a new product, service or 'thing' is advertised as superior to the old \u2014 never mind if the so-called 'old' thing has some distinct advantages, or if the new thing's superiority is solely that it makes more money than the old thing, or if there are other old things that are actually superior yet which won't make anyone rich. (Consider Apple removing the headphone jack from its new phones to be Exhibit A.) That summary may sound flippant, but it is a good explication of the path of the tech industry over the past two decades: Some venture capital-backed entrepreneurs jackhammer their way into a new industry, 'tech'-ify it in some way, undermine the competition and declare their new way superior once the old is bankrupted. Thus, rather than confine themselves to operating systems and PC software like they did in the 1980s and 1990s, the tech industry has figured out that the real money lies in being a middleman[2]. By that I mean serving as the in-between point[3] for, say, web traffic to newspapers and magazines (like this one); or being the go-between for taxi services, coordinating drivers and passengers through apps. In both of these examples, the original product isn't that different from the pre-tech world: a taxi ride, in the latter case, a news article in the former. The difference is that a tech behemoth takes a cut of the transaction. And also in many cases, the labor \u2014 the people making and producing and doing the things the tech industry takes a slice from \u2014 is more precarious, less well-remunerated, and less safe than it was in the pre-tech era. Looking at it this way, the tech industry doesn't really seem innovative at all. Or rather, its sole innovation seems to be exploiting workers with more cruelty, and positioning itself in the middle of more transactions. Granted, there are certain services that have become more convenientbecause of apps and smartphones \u2014 but there is no reason that convenience must come at the high cost that it does, besides the tech industry's insatiable lust for profit. Here are but a few examples of how our livelihoods and our societies have been worsened by Silicon Valley as it sinks its talons into new industries. Public transit was never great in the United States, with the exception of a few big cities like New York, and thus private taxi services were around to supplement. Being a taxi driver was once a much-vaunted job, so much so that a taxi medallion was perceived of as a ticket to the middle class[4]. Then came Uber and Lyft, who flooded the market for private transit and undercut the taxi industry by de-skilling the industry and paying their workers far, far less. Driving a taxi is no longer a middle class job; once-valuable taxi medallions have become burdens[5] for some taxi drivers. The outlook for career taxi drivers is so dismal that an alarming number of taxi drivers have been committing suicide[6]. Meanwhile, because of the precarious nature of Lyft and Uber jobs, those drivers are frequently not vetted or under-vetted \u2014 resulting in significant safety concerns[7] for passengers. And unlike a taxi back in the old days, being a rideshare driver isn't a ticket to the middle-class at all: a recent study of such employees revealed that most contractors use these kinds of jobs not as their sole source of income, but as supplementary jobs to make ends meet. Richard D. Wolff[8], an economics professor at the New School in New York City, describes gig economy companies like Uber as 'winning the competition' by taking shortcuts that 'frequently endanger the public.' Regulatory agencies for taxis were created in most countries, Wolff says, because taxi companies were historically unsafe. 'Taxi companies are required now to have insurance, training for drivers, well-inspected cars, and other safeguards to protect the public. The cost of riding in a taxi reflects those safeguards,' Wolff said, adding:there's always the incentive for somebody to come in and operate, once again, inadequately insured, inadequately maintained, inadequately vetted drivers \u2014 to come in with a cheaper cab service [that is] unregulated by the taxi commission. That's all that Uber and Lyft [are] they undercut the old arrangement and offer cheaper and more competitive services by cutting corners.Home Appliances Lightbulbs have existed for around 140 years, and home refrigerators for about 100. In that span, they haven't changed too much, besides getting more energy-efficient, mostly because they haven't really needed to: we need to keep food cold, and we need light. The appliances that do these things don't really need to do much else. Now, tech companies are putting wi-fi and Bluetooth chips in all kinds of things that didn't used to be internet-connected. They call it the 'smart home,' and while the word is open-ended, the common thread with smart home devices is that they can generally be monitored via an app. The smart home is sold to us as next-gen, a new advance on traditional appliances. But these devices tend to waste more of our time, and have both privacy and safety risks that regular appliances lack. You can't just put a wi-fi chip in a mundane household object like a lightbulb or a smoke detector without doing something to fix the security holes that emerge with having another device connected 24/7 to the web. But that is exactly what happened: a tremendous number of smart home devices have been hacked and turned into digital soldiers forming massive botnets[9] that can be called up by hackers to engage in distributed denial of service attacks. An Atlantic reporter did an experiment[10] that found that their fake smart home device attracted hundreds of hacking attempts in a matter of hours after being plugged in. Part of the reason that companies are so eager to market the smart home to us is because these devices can be used to build digital dossiers on customers to market things to them. A refrigerator without an internet connection can't generate any data about a consumer, but a fridge with one can regularly report back all kinds of data on the person using it \u2014 data that can be monetized and sold. Even barring the hacking issue or the privacy issue, smart home devices aren't necessarily an innovation because their whole function seems to be to create more work for us and turn us into (essentially) managers. There is a certain managerial mindset that trickles down from the device's creators (who are, at some level, managers themselves) to consumers \u2014 as if I wanted to spend my days and nights studying graphs and charts of my fridge's power consumption, or do a data analysis on my Roomba's path. That sounds horrible. Additionally, the difficulty of setting up many of these devices in the first place can be mind-numbing for those lacking technical savvy; notably, drastically increasing the number of wi-fi enabled devices in one's house often means that you need to invest in new internet equipment, either routers or faster internet service or both. Not everyone is an engineer, nor wants to be, but smart home devices often compel us to be \u2014 and this increasingly complex domain of appliances is supposed to be superior to the simplicity of flicking a lightswitch on the wall. And speaking of turning us into managers Fitness Steve Jobs'[11] greatest genius[12] was not in engineering, but in marketing. He understood that late capitalism no longer fulfill needs, but create them; inevitably, Apple became the premier exporter of desire, master marketers who compel us lust over their clean-looking products and obsess over them once we own them. To that end, there was never really anything wrong with fitness; it wasn't an industry that needed to be 'disrupted,' to use Silicon Valley's favorite dystopian verb. But if you slap monitoring devices on your shoes, your watch, your armband, and your water bottle, suddenly you have a huge cache of data points about your body and activity that you can analyze later. Apple and a slew of other apps even help you monitor your ovulation cycle, and some analyze and monetize that intimate customer data. This can create some funny situations when those devices stop being updated or get corrupted; Nike was widely mocked when a $350 pair of 'smart' sneakers were ruined by a faulty update[13]. The idea of being able to hack into someone's shoes and ruin them is not exactly where I thought the future was headed. I suppose if you were dreaming of being a statistician collecting data on your body constantly might seem kind of interesting, but if you aren't, it's just a new source of busyness in your life. Again, building devices to quantize as much fitness data as possible wasn't an example of capitalism fulfilling consumer desire \u2014 no one, save a few data scientists, ever said, 'I want to turn my leisure activities and exercise regime into spreadsheets' \u2014 but the tech industry has been very effective at making us desire just that. This obsession with quantifying our existence is known in academic circles as 'computationalism.' Previously I interviewed Professor David Golumbia[14], who has written about this extensively, and who describes computationalism as 'the philosophical idea that the brain is a computer' as well as 'a broader worldview according to which people or society are seen as computers, or that we might be living inside of a simulation.' 'There is a small group of people who become obsessed with quantification,' Golumbia told me. 'Not just about exercise, but like, about intimate details of their life \u2014 how much time spent with one's kids, how many orgasms you have \u2014 most people aren't like that; they do counting for a while [and] then they get tired of counting. The counting part seems oppressive.' Convenience Stores In many of the above cases, Silicon Valley has torn into an industry and taken good jobs and turned them into bad jobs. In the case of the corner store, Silicon Valley's aim seems to be to eliminate the human component altogether. There are a few different business spins on how this might be done. The most infamous is Bodega (now known as Stockwell), which we reported on in 2017[15]:Two former Google employees are hoping to take over street corners, dorm rooms, gyms, or anywhere convenient in urban residential neighborhoods, with their reinvention of the vending machine. Paul McDonald and Ashwath Rajan launched a new startup called 'Bodega,' with the goal of making convenient stores all but a thing of the past. 'Bodega sets up five-foot-wide pantry boxes filled with non-perishable items you might pick up at a convenience store,' Fast Company reported[16]. 'An app will allow you to unlock the box and cameras powered with computer vision will register what you've picked up, automatically charging your credit card.' Employees? They would become things of the past as well, because no one will work the bodegas, and all transactions will be electronic.Unsurprisingly given that the friendly neighborhood corner marketplace is something that has existed for centuries across most cultures, seeing a group of out-of-touch tech bros working hard to destroy that touched a collective nerve. In the wake of internet outrage[17], the two of them apologized and then later rebranded[18]. Stockwell/Bodega is far from the only example of Silicon Valley's crusade against human interaction. There's a company that is trying to make robots that make, serve and sell smoothies, which we reported on[19] ruefully last year. There are multiple companies, including CafeX, making robot baristas. Amazon is creating Amazon Go stores[20] that lack cashiers, and rather rely on cameras to track what people pick up and then bill them accordingly. The thing is, baristas and cashiers aren't things that we are all dying to get rid of; this isn't a comparable situation to the horse-and-buggy days, where cars felt like a serious improvement on using beasts of burden for transit. Silicon Valley is only trying to put baristas and cashiers out of business because human labor costs money; the difference between a $4 coffee from a robot and a $4 coffee from a human is that there are no labor costs in the former purchase, something that makes Silicon Valley go googly-eyed with dollar signs. The tech industry's vision of the future is of a world with less human interaction, less conversation, less humanity; and more surveillance and more monetization of our buying habits. No one wants this, but it's being forced upon us.Excerpted with permission from 'A People's History of Silicon Valley: How the Tech Industry Exploits Workers, Erodes Privacy and Undermines Democracy[21],' by Keith A.

Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Police desperately searching for these four men possibly armed, possibly dangerous.  The shocking details on their brazen jail break. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN, CNN ANCHOR:  And the NSA spying scandal engulfing the White House.  New allegations this morning that the U.S. was spying on dozens of foreign leaders and a shocking admission as to when the president was made aware. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BERMAN:  And another huge setback for the Obamacare Web site.  New, a critical data center crashing this weekend, halting enrollment across the nation.  So, what does this mean now for the health care law? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAMBOLIN:  Good morning to you.  Welcome to EARLY START.  I'm Zoraida Sambolin.</p><p>We're not talking about the Red Sox at all this morning? </p><p>BERMAN:  No, no, I can't about it!  I haven't slept in like three days.  I can barely speak at all. </p><p>Good morning, everyone.  I'm John Berman.  It is Monday, October 28. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p>And happening right now, I got to say, this is a frightening way to start your week. </p><p>A statewide manhunt for four escaped inmates who could be armed and dangerous.  This is happening in Oklahoma.  The men broke out of the Caddo Detention Center, about 70 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. </p><p>The jail break, honestly, like something out of \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"  The inmates were able to break a lock, enter a trapped door above the shower early Sunday morning and made their way to freedom through a tiny crawl space beneath the roof. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENE CAIN, CADDO COUNTY SHERIFF:  We got officers checking all of the abandoned vehicles and checking the residences where we might know they have relatives are living.  We're doing that right now.  Anytime you know anybody that breaks out of prison or anything, you're going to say they're dangerous, we're not for sure they're armed, but you got to think they might be, when you know they wouldn't when they left, but we don't know what they picked up after.  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN:  Four of them, four inmates and four orange prison suits have been discarded a few blocks from the prison.  Neighbors around the area, they're trying not to panic. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OWEN STOCKTON, CADDO COUNTY RESIDENT:  A small town and this stuff is not supposed to happen, right?  It can happen anywhere.  I hope they're not at my house when I get back.  So, wow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN:  Pretty good attitude for something that's honestly terrifying.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  No kidding, right?</p><p>BERMAN:  Authorities now are searching for Dylan Ray Three Irons, Prime Brown, Anthony Mendonca and Triston Cheadle.  They were convicted on drug, burglary, and weapon charges and now, as I said, on the loose this morning.  </p><p>SAMBOLIN:  Crazy.  Shocking that all four of them made it out. </p><p>BERMAN:  And shocking the way they made it out.  A crawl space, like the pipes.  Crazy.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  All right.  Two minutes past the hour here.</p><p>The NSA spying scandal spiraling out of control.  A new report out of Germany claiming President Obama knew the U.S. was conducting surveillance on Chancellor Angela Merkel back in 2010, even though he assured her by phone last week that he did not know anything.  This morning, U.S. officials are claiming the Obama administration ended the NSA operation that spied on Merkel this past summer, as soon as they found out about it. </p><p>We get more from CNN's chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The newest Edward Snowden documents reveal more spying on America's closest allies.  In Spain, reports the NSA listening in on 60 million phone calls in a single month.  And in Germany, the \"Bild am Sonntag\" newspaper reports that President Obama was briefed by NSA Chief Keith Alexander about spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's calls back in 2010, contradicting White House assurances the president was not aware of the extent of the surveillance. </p><p>The NSA quickly denied the report, telling CNN, \"General Alexander did not discuss with President Obama in 2010 an alleged foreign intelligence operation involving German chancellor Merkel, nor has he ever discussed alleged operations involving Merkel.\"</p><p>The NSA's denial a clear step beyond the White House's willingness, up to now, only to deny present and future monitoring. </p><p>JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I can tell you that the president assured chancellor that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor. </p><p>SCIUTTO:  German intelligence experts are expected to come to the U.S. to challenge their counterparts on the spying after a German official accused the U.S. of breaking, quote, \"German law on German soil.\" </p><p>But House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers defended the NSA surveillance on CNN Sunday, saying it was both well-regulated and essential to keeping Americans and Europeans safe from terrorism. </p><p>REP. MIKE ROGERS (R-MI), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMA:  I think the bigger news story here would be, Candy, if the United States intelligence services weren't trying to collect information that would protect U.S. interests of both home and abroad. </p><p>SCIUTTO:  Jim Sciutto, CNN, Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERMAN:  Our thanks to Jim. </p><p>Breaking overnight: Israel air force just a short while ago striking targets in Gaza.  These attacks coming after Palestinian militants fired two rockets into southern Israel. </p><p>Matthew Chance is live from Jerusalem this morning. </p><p>Matthew, give me the latest and the time line here of what happened.</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, John, these Israeli air force strikes on what they say a concealed rocket launching site in Gaza taking place just a few hours ago.  They came in response to the firing of two rockets from the Gaza Strip into the Israeli territory.  Both of those rockets were -- didn't cause any casualties.  One was intercepted, in fact, according to the Israeli military, by the Iron Dome missile defense system.  The other fell into open ground.  No casualties reported. </p><p>But the Israelis did strike back as I say launching those air strikes a few hours ago hitting concealed rocket launching sites inside the Gaza Strip.  Palestinian officials say that -- confirmed the air strikes took place but say there were no injuries either.</p><p>Now, it's been very quiet in the Gaza Strip the last several months particularly because a peace process backed by the U.S. secretary of State and the United States in general under way between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  It's not clear if the rocket attacks were linked to progress in those peace negotiations. </p><p>But, over the course of the past 24 hours, Israeli (INAUDIBLE) will release another 26 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails as a confidence-building measure to try to promote the peace process. </p><p>BERMAN:  Matthew, it has been nearly a year since that cease-fire deal was struck between Hamas in Gaza and Israel.  But over the last few weeks, it seems to have entered this new phase with Israeli destroying a smuggling tunnel into Gaza. </p><p>Are there fears that these air strikes and the missile launches over the last day could escalate into a new really hot conflict between the two sides? </p><p>CHANCE:  Yes, I think, John, there is always that potential.  We have seen it time and again in Gaza with these small incidents being escalated and turning into something much bigger.  It's not clear that this is an example of that at the moment.  Still a lot of political will on both sides, on both the Israeli and Palestinian side for the peace process to advance.</p><p>Of course, in the Gaza Strip, elements like Hamas that govern there are opposed to the peace process with the Israelis but the vast majority of Palestinian groups, vast majority of Palestinians at the moment are in favor of it so there is a sense that this probably isn't enough at this stage to derail the peace process. </p><p>BERMAN:  All right.  Interesting.  All signs this morning pointing to the fact that this could be isolated.  We will keep an eye on it. </p><p>Matthew Chance in Jerusalem, thanks so much for joining us this morning. </p><p>SAMBOLIN:  And new problems this morning for the already trouble- plagued Obamacare Web site.  Not a single American could enroll online yesterday because of what they're calling a data glitch.  An outage at the Verizon data center is being blamed for that.  It's used by the government's health care site to verify people's identities and their citizenship.  The Obama administration and Verizon could not say how long it would take to fix that problem.</p><p>BERMAN:  An independent contractor at the North Carolina state fair has been charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, after a ride he was operating injured five people.  Forty-six-year-old Timothy Tutterrow was arrested following investigations into Thursday night's accident.  Authorities say safety devices on the Vortex, that was the name of the ride, safety devices were tampered with.  More arrests could be coming.  Three people remain hospitalized this morning.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  Miami Dolphin Mike Pouncey ordered to testify before a grand jury in the Aaron Hernandez murder investigation.  So, according to \"Sports Illustrated\", he was served with a subpoena in Foxborough, yesterday, one hour after his team lost to the New England Patriots. Pouncey is a close friend and former college teammate of Hernandez. He has not been charged with a crime and police consider him a witness who could help them with their investigation. </p><p>BERMAN:  A lot of people are wondering all along if there'd be other players involved with this.  So far, no, but he is really the first. Seventy-one-year-old -- a 71-year-old passenger at Montreal's Trudeau Airport arrested Sunday morning for possession of a powder-like substance in his carry-on luggage.  He was board to a flight for Los Angeles using a fake identity.  The officials will only say the substance did not belong at the airport, any airport for that matter, and that it posed no immediate risk. </p><p>SAMBOLIN:  So, now, to the second listeria-related recall in as many weeks.  Taylor Farms is recalling 5,000 pounds of Broccoli salad and slaw, including its broccoli crunch with bacon and dressing.  Did you buy that? </p><p>BERMAN:  No.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  I saw you pay attention here.</p><p>OK.  The kits contain dressing in packets that are the subject of an FDA recall that were sold in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.  Here's the good news, folks -- no one has gotten sick.</p><p>BERMAN:  It is good news. </p><p>SAMBOLIN:  Last week, listeria concerns prompted a major recall of ready-to-eat products by Resers Fine Foods.</p><p>BERMAN:  We make our own slaw.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  Oh, do you?</p><p>BERMAN:  Nine minutes past the hour right now. </p><p>It is Halloween Week, a very important weather week.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  That's true.</p><p>BERMAN:  Let's get a check of how things going so far.  Indra Petersons is here with us this morning. </p><p>Good morning.</p><p>INDRA PETERSONS, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  I'll start with Halloween, because we know it's expected to rain by next week in these areas. So, I just want we know that ahead of time.  A lot of people got to make the Halloween costumes fun to love. </p><p>But here's a little bit hint of good news now that I started with that -- moderate temperatures today.  Yes, oop, there we go.  We're starting to see temperatures rebound a little bit for today, but notice if you look at Buffalo, they are below average.  So, by tomorrow, looking for them to go back down with a cold front is expected to swing through.</p><p>But, hey, here is the change.  We are going to see that pattern shift. Instead of the old care in the east, we're going to start to see that be more in the West, with temperatures moderating in the east for a little bit.  So, we are actually looking at today a big storm in the Pacific Northwest, that's going to bring some pretty heavy snowfall, even up to 18 inches of snowfall possible today in Montana and Wyoming, and exact same system is going to bring rain, even as far south as southern California. </p><p>So, that's really going to be the system that we're going to be watching, eventually make its way across the country and bring rain on Halloween.  And it is a cold system.  I mean, look at these temperatures, Billings about 31, looks like their high today in North Platte only about 44 today.  When you compare that difference to the south where temperatures above normal.  The other big concern is going to be the severe weather threat we are looking at maybe right into through Kansas and Nebraska today.</p><p>We're looking out for that.</p><p>BERMAN:  Keep an eye on that.  All right.  Indra, thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  All right.  And coming up, he took us all for a walk on the wild side.  How rock 'n' roll icon Lou Reed is being remembered this morning. </p><p>BERMAN:  A legend. </p><p>And more legal problems this morning for singer Chris Brown.  New details about his latest run-in with the law.  Another one, folks. </p><p>Plus, it is time for your morning rhyme.  Tweet us with your own original verse.  It can be about anything but it needs to rhyme, folks, #EarlyStart, #MorningRhyme.  We will read the best one on the air in the next half hour. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  Welcome back to EARLY START. </p><p>We have breaking news overnight.  Dr. Conrad Murray is a free man.  He was released from a California prison this morning after serving two years for involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson. Murray had his medical licenses revoked in California, Texas and Nevada after his conviction.  His lawyer says Murray is trying to get them reinstated so he can get back to treating patients. </p><p>BERMAN:  Singer Chris Brown faces charges this morning for an alleged assault outside of Washington, D.C. hotel.  Brown was arrested on a felony assault charge after police say the 24-year-old got into a physical altercation with 20-year-old Isaac Adams Parker outside the W Hotel.  It happened about 4:30 a.m. Sunday morning.  Brown's bodyguard Christopher Hollosy was also arrested. </p><p>SAMBOLIN:  And the music world is mourning the death of a rock legend this morning.  Lou Reed passing Sunday at his home in eastern Long Island after a long battle with liver disease.  Reed influenced generations of musicians and took rock 'n' roll to places it had never gone before. Here is Nischelle Turner. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>NISCHELLE TURNER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With classics like \"Sweet Jane\", Lou Reed influenced generations of rockers, often merging also risque lyrics with drowning guitars.  Born and raised in New York, Reed joined creative forces with Andy Warhol, who sponsored the \"Velvet Underground.\"</p><p>Rolling Stone named the Underground's 1967 debut album the 13th greatest of all time.</p><p>LOU REED, MUSICIAN:  I get personal satisfaction out of making things that don't exist.  I follow passion.  And that is the one rule I've lived by. </p><p>TURNER:  The edgy Reed said he wanted to tell the stories of outsiders.  As a solo artist, Reed's lyrics \"Take a Walk on the Wild Side\" explored sex, drugs, and drag queens. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>ANTHONY DECURTIS, CONTRIBUTIONG EDITOR, ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE:  He saw himself as a literary figure as much as a musician and took that aspect of his work very seriously. </p><p>TURNER:  Reed also delved into acting, playing an annoying record producer in Paul Simon's 1980 movie rip of the music business, \"One Trick Pony.\" </p><p>REED:  What do you think I am?  Just a non-turnout (ph) here?  I made a couple of records myself.  I know what I'm doing. </p><p>TURNER:  Reed loved poetry and legions of indie rockers hung on his every word.  He celebrated independent streak as heard on \"I Love You, Suzanne.\" </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TURNER:  Reed had been frail for months after a liver transplant earlier this year.  He died at his home in South Hampton, New York, at age 71. </p><p>Nischelle Turner, CNN, Los Angeles. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERMAN:  That's a true legend, Lou Reed.</p><p>All right.  So, if I look like a basket case this morning is because I have not slept in several days.  The Boston Red Sox with their backs up against the wall, they came through with a big win in another historic ending to a game, two a row now.  Andy Scholes with more in this morning's \"Bleacher Report.\" </p><p>Good morning, Andy!</p><p>ANDY SCHOLES, BLEACHER REPORT:  Hey.  Good morning, guys.  </p><p>Last night's game huge for the Red Sox.  Not only snatch back the momentum in the series but they also regained that old thing called home field advantage.  Big Papi, he's been on fire this whole series and the only one with a hit in last night's game when he got the team together in the dugout before the sixth inning.  And sure enough, Boston gets two runners on and Jonny Gomes who wasn't supposed to play last night came in for the injured Shane Victorino and rushed that ball to left.  The three home-run gives the Red Sox 4-1 lead.  Check it out.  Mike Napoli giving him a beard tug for a celebration. </p><p>Bottom of the nine, Cardinals had a chance.  Carlos Beltran represents the tying run but Kolten Wong is picked off first base!  It's a walk off pick off.  First time in World Series a game ended on a pickoff. Red Sox win 4-2.  Game five tonight at 8:00 Eastern.</p><p>Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson certainly lived up to the nickname Megatron yesterday against the Cowboys!  Johnson racked up a ridiculous 329 yards receiving.  That was just seven yards shy of the NFL record.  His effort helped the Lions make incredible comeback. Detroit down six with a minute to go, get to one yard line. </p><p>Check out Matt Stafford.  He's like, spike the ball, spike the ball, spike the ball! He tricks everyone and he jumps in for the touchdown! The Lions rejoice because they win 31-30!  A crushing defeat for the Cowboys. </p><p>Check out Dez Bryant on the sideline.  He was not happy about this outcome!  He goes on a tirade and would have to be restrained by Demarcus Ware.  After the game, Dez said his tirade was a action of positive action. </p><p>All right.  Turning on BleacheReport.com today, the Minnesota Vikings off to a quick start again the Green Bay Packers last night.  Rookie Peterson took the kickoff back 109 yards for the touchdown and broke the previous record of 108 yards and most recently done by Jacoby Jones in a Super Bowl in February.  Vikings may have won the battle on that play but the Packers won the war.  They beat Minnesota last night 34-31. </p><p>And believe it or not, the NBA season tips off tomorrow night with a double-header on our sister network TNT.  The Bulls and Heat get things started at 8:00 Eastern.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  Yay, finally! </p><p>SCHOLES:  I know you're excited about this, Zoraida.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  Just basketball, I am so happy!  Yes.</p><p>SHOLES:  If the World Series goes to seven games, which it looked like it might, on Thursday night, it would be on Halloween.  We would have baseball, NFL football, NBA basketball, and hockey, all four sports. </p><p>SAMBOLIN:  Something for everyone.  How perfect is that be? </p><p>BERMAN:  My head will explode completely.</p><p>Andy Scholes, always good to see you.  Thank you. </p><p>SCHOLES:  Have a good one.</p><p>BERMAN:  Coming up for us next, you know what, Christine Romans in the makeup room a little while ago, talking about what a wild week on Wall Street this could be.  Could be looking at a new round of record highs?  We'll tell you when we come back.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  You were in the makeup room?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  Welcome back to EARLY START.  It's \"Money Time\".</p><p>And Berman has been talking about all the fabulous news that you have to share.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  There's a lot of good news.  I mean, stocks have had a really good week again.  We have futures up this morning.  We're looking at a record S&amp;P 500 and futures market that could happen again today.</p><p>A record close at the S&amp;P on Friday.  The other major markets also finish the week higher.  That's how much. </p><p>And now, for a reality check, where you stand for the year, I love bringing you this number.  This is a good indication for me after five years of bad news.  The Dow is up 19 percent, the NASDAQ is up 31 percent, and S&amp;P is up 23 percent. </p><p>I really care about that last number because the stock part of your 401(k) most likely replicates the S&amp;P 500.  And if you're paying big percentage for mutual fund, you know, big percentage for mutual fund management, and you're not up 23 percent, you should look at the S&amp;P 500 tracking mutual funds. </p><p>All right.  The big tech scene should continue this week after a blockbuster showing from high tech heavyweights last week.  Microsoft, Google and Amazon released better earnings and investors cheered the results. </p><p>Apple also had a winning week after the billionaire activist Carl Icahn continued his push for a mega stock buyback.  Look at the stock increases last week.  The CEO Tim Cook of Apple will again be in the spotlight because today is earnings day for Apple.  Look for profit to fall from a year ago, but sales may rise slightly.  We also should get clarity on how the 5s and that less expensive 5c have been selling. So, tomorrow will be a big day for Apple investors.</p><p>Investors also keep an eye on Washington this week but not because of a shutdown, no debt standoff.  We'll be looking at the Federal Reserve.  The Fed committee wraps up a two-day meeting on Wednesday, highly unlikely to dial back the $85 billion monthly stimulus program that helped send stocks soaring this believe.  In fact, people believe that the Fed is flooding the zone until maybe March.  The government shutdown and the debt ceiling battle have forced the Fed's hands, creating a weaker economic outlook, muddying the data the central bank relies to make decisions.  </p><p>In fact, there was a surprising note from Societe Generale last week that said instead of cutting its bond purchases, the Fed could increase them because the economy isn't doing as well the Fed hoped for at this point.  This is a really important story this week -- the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, and it matters to everyone, matters to -- interest rates you're paying on your credit card, your car loan and housing.  So, incredibly important. </p><p>And tomorrow is the one year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy devastating damage in the New York and New Jersey area.  Remember the huge lines to get gas?  This was so insulting to people who were trying to get back to work and you couldn't even get gas.</p><p>Happy to hear for those people that New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo is going to create a strategic gasoline reserve.  After Sandy, many stations were left without power to pump the gas, and the ones that had power quickly ran out of fuel and couldn't get stuff in.  Real interesting, just like the nation has a strategic petroleum reserve. Cuomo wants to do a gas reserve.</p><p>BERMAN:  Interesting as you can't get the gas to the station.  That was the problem during Sandy.  But an effort that may be helpful. </p><p>SAMBOLIN:  We will watch it. </p><p>BERMAN:  Thanks, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS:  You're welcome.</p><p>SAMBOLIN:  All right.  Coming up a statewide manhunt going on in Oklahoma.

New allegations this morning that the U.S. was spying on dozens of foreign leaders and a shocking admission as to when the president was made aware.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BERMAN: And another huge setback for the Obamacare Web site. New, a critical data center crashing this weekend, halting enrollment across the nation. So, what does this mean now for the health care law?</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Good morning to you. Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Zoraida Sambolin.</p><p/><p>We're not talking about the Red Sox at all this morning?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: No, no, I can't about it! I haven't slept in like three days. I can barely speak at all.</p><p/><p>Good morning, everyone. I'm John Berman. It is Monday, October 28. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p/><p>And happening right now, I got to say, this is a frightening way to start your week.</p><p/><p>A statewide manhunt for four escaped inmates who could be armed and dangerous. This is happening in Oklahoma. The men broke out of the Caddo Detention Center, about 70 miles southwest of Oklahoma City.</p><p/><p>The jail break, honestly, like something out of \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" The inmates were able to break a lock, enter a trapped door above the shower early Sunday morning and made their way to freedom through a tiny crawl space beneath the roof.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>GENE CAIN, CADDO COUNTY SHERIFF: We got officers checking all of the abandoned vehicles and checking the residences where we might know they have relatives are living. We're doing that right now. Anytime you know anybody that breaks out of prison or anything, you're going to say they're dangerous, we're not for sure they're armed, but you got to think they might be, when you know they wouldn't when they left, but we don't know what they picked up after. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Four of them, four inmates and four orange prison suits have been discarded a few blocks from the prison.

Shocking that all four of them made it out.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: And shocking the way they made it out. A crawl space, like the pipes. Crazy.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Two minutes past the hour here.</p><p/><p>The NSA spying scandal spiraling out of control. A new report out of Germany claiming President Obama knew the U.S. was conducting surveillance on Chancellor Angela Merkel back in 2010, even though he assured her by phone last week that he did not know anything. This morning, U.S. officials are claiming the Obama administration ended the NSA operation that spied on Merkel this past summer, as soon as they found out about it.</p><p/><p>We get more from CNN's chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The newest Edward Snowden documents reveal more spying on America's closest allies. In Spain, reports the NSA listening in on 60 million phone calls in a single month. And in Germany, the \"Bild am Sonntag\" newspaper reports that President Obama was briefed by NSA Chief Keith Alexander about spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's calls back in 2010, contradicting White House assurances the president was not aware of the extent of the surveillance.</p><p/><p>The NSA quickly denied the report, telling CNN, \"General Alexander did not discuss with President Obama in 2010 an alleged foreign intelligence operation involving German chancellor Merkel, nor has he ever discussed alleged operations involving Merkel.\"</p><p/><p>The NSA's denial a clear step beyond the White House's willingness, up to now, only to deny present and future monitoring.</p><p/><p>JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I can tell you that the president assured chancellor that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor.</p><p/><p>SCIUTTO: German intelligence experts are expected to come to the U.S. to challenge their counterparts on the spying after a German official accused the U.S. of breaking, quote, \"German law on German soil.\"</p><p/><p>But House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers defended the NSA surveillance on CNN Sunday, saying it was both well-regulated and essential to keeping Americans and Europeans safe from terrorism.</p><p/><p>REP. MIKE ROGERS (R-MI), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMA: I think the bigger news story here would be, Candy, if the United States intelligence services weren't trying to collect information that would protect U.S. interests of both home and abroad.</p><p/><p>SCIUTTO: Jim Sciutto, CNN, Washington.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Our thanks to Jim.</p><p/><p>Breaking overnight: Israel air force just a short while ago striking targets in Gaza. These attacks coming after Palestinian militants fired two rockets into southern Israel.</p><p/><p>Matthew Chance is live from Jerusalem this morning.</p><p/><p>Matthew, give me the latest and the time line here of what happened.</p><p/><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, John, these Israeli air force strikes on what they say a concealed rocket launching site in Gaza taking place just a few hours ago. They came in response to the firing of two rockets from the Gaza Strip into the Israeli territory. Both of those rockets were -- didn't cause any casualties. One was intercepted, in fact, according to the Israeli military, by the Iron Dome missile defense system. The other fell into open ground. No casualties reported.</p><p/><p>But the Israelis did strike back as I say launching those air strikes a few hours ago hitting concealed rocket launching sites inside the Gaza Strip. Palestinian officials say that -- confirmed the air strikes took place but say there were no injuries either.</p><p/><p>Now, it's been very quiet in the Gaza Strip the last several months particularly because a peace process backed by the U.S. secretary of State and the United States in general under way between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It's not clear if the rocket attacks were linked to progress in those peace negotiations.</p><p/><p>But, over the course of the past 24 hours, Israeli (INAUDIBLE) will release another 26 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails as a confidence-building measure to try to promote the peace process.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Matthew, it has been nearly a year since that cease-fire deal was struck between Hamas in Gaza and Israel. But over the last few weeks, it seems to have entered this new phase with Israeli destroying a smuggling tunnel into Gaza.</p><p/><p>Are there fears that these air strikes and the missile launches over the last day could escalate into a new really hot conflict between the two sides?</p><p/><p>CHANCE: Yes, I think, John, there is always that potential. We have seen it time and again in Gaza with these small incidents being escalated and turning into something much bigger. It's not clear that this is an example of that at the moment. Still a lot of political will on both sides, on both the Israeli and Palestinian side for the peace process to advance.</p><p/><p>Of course, in the Gaza Strip, elements like Hamas that govern there are opposed to the peace process with the Israelis but the vast majority of Palestinian groups, vast majority of Palestinians at the moment are in favor of it so there is a sense that this probably isn't enough at this stage to derail the peace process.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: All right. Interesting. All signs this morning pointing to the fact that this could be isolated. We will keep an eye on it.</p><p/><p>Matthew Chance in Jerusalem, thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: And new problems this morning for the already trouble- plagued Obamacare Web site. Not a single American could enroll online yesterday because of what they're calling a data glitch. An outage at the Verizon data center is being blamed for that. It's used by the government's health care site to verify people's identities and their citizenship. The Obama administration and Verizon could not say how long it would take to fix that problem.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: An independent contractor at the North Carolina state fair has been charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, after a ride he was operating injured five people. Forty-six-year-old Timothy Tutterrow was arrested following investigations into Thursday night's accident. Authorities say safety devices on the Vortex, that was the name of the ride, safety devices were tampered with. More arrests could be coming. Three people remain hospitalized this morning.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Miami Dolphin Mike Pouncey ordered to testify before a grand jury in the Aaron Hernandez murder investigation. So, according to \"Sports Illustrated\", he was served with a subpoena in Foxborough, yesterday, one hour after his team lost to the New England Patriots. Pouncey is a close friend and former college teammate of Hernandez. He has not been charged with a crime and police consider him a witness who could help them with their investigation.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: A lot of people are wondering all along if there'd be other players involved with this. So far, no, but he is really the first. Seventy-one-year-old -- a 71-year-old passenger at Montreal's Trudeau Airport arrested Sunday morning for possession of a powder-like substance in his carry-on luggage. He was board to a flight for Los Angeles using a fake identity. The officials will only say the substance did not belong at the airport, any airport for that matter, and that it posed no immediate risk.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: So, now, to the second listeria-related recall in as many weeks. Taylor Farms is recalling 5,000 pounds of Broccoli salad and slaw, including its broccoli crunch with bacon and dressing. Did you buy that?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: No.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: I saw you pay attention here.</p><p/><p>OK. The kits contain dressing in packets that are the subject of an FDA recall that were sold in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. Here's the good news, folks -- no one has gotten sick.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: It is good news.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Last week, listeria concerns prompted a major recall of ready-to-eat products by Resers Fine Foods.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: We make our own slaw.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Oh, do you?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Nine minutes past the hour right now.</p><p/><p>It is Halloween Week, a very important weather week.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: That's true.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Let's get a check of how things going so far. Indra Petersons is here with us this morning.</p><p/><p>Good morning.</p><p/><p>INDRA PETERSONS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: I'll start with Halloween, because we know it's expected to rain by next week in these areas. So, I just want we know that ahead of time. A lot of people got to make the Halloween costumes fun to love.</p><p/><p>But here's a little bit hint of good news now that I started with that -- moderate temperatures today. Yes, oop, there we go. We're starting to see temperatures rebound a little bit for today, but notice if you look at Buffalo, they are below average. So, by tomorrow, looking for them to go back down with a cold front is expected to swing through.</p><p/><p>But, hey, here is the change. We are going to see that pattern shift. Instead of the old care in the east, we're going to start to see that be more in the West, with temperatures moderating in the east for a little bit. So, we are actually looking at today a big storm in the Pacific Northwest, that's going to bring some pretty heavy snowfall, even up to 18 inches of snowfall possible today in Montana and Wyoming, and exact same system is going to bring rain, even as far south as southern California.</p><p/><p>So, that's really going to be the system that we're going to be watching, eventually make its way across the country and bring rain on Halloween. And it is a cold system. I mean, look at these temperatures, Billings about 31, looks like their high today in North Platte only about 44 today. When you compare that difference to the south where temperatures above normal. The other big concern is going to be the severe weather threat we are looking at maybe right into through Kansas and Nebraska today.</p><p/><p>We're looking out for that.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Keep an eye on that. All right. Indra, thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. And coming up, he took us all for a walk on the wild side. How rock 'n' roll icon Lou Reed is being remembered this morning.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: A legend.</p><p/><p>And more legal problems this morning for singer Chris Brown. New details about his latest run-in with the law. Another one, folks.</p><p/><p>Plus, it is time for your morning rhyme. Tweet us with your own original verse. It can be about anything but it needs to rhyme, folks, #EarlyStart, #MorningRhyme. We will read the best one on the air in the next half hour.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Welcome back to EARLY START.</p><p/><p>We have breaking news overnight. Dr. Conrad Murray is a free man. He was released from a California prison this morning after serving two years for involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson. Murray had his medical licenses revoked in California, Texas and Nevada after his conviction. His lawyer says Murray is trying to get them reinstated so he can get back to treating patients.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Singer Chris Brown faces charges this morning for an alleged assault outside of Washington, D.C. hotel. Brown was arrested on a felony assault charge after police say the 24-year-old got into a physical altercation with 20-year-old Isaac Adams Parker outside the W Hotel. It happened about 4:30 a.m. Sunday morning. Brown's bodyguard Christopher Hollosy was also arrested.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: And the music world is mourning the death of a rock legend this morning. Lou Reed passing Sunday at his home in eastern Long Island after a long battle with liver disease. Reed influenced generations of musicians and took rock 'n' roll to places it had never gone before. Here is Nischelle Turner.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>NISCHELLE TURNER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With classics like \"Sweet Jane\", Lou Reed influenced generations of rockers, often merging also risque lyrics with drowning guitars. Born and raised in New York, Reed joined creative forces with Andy Warhol, who sponsored the \"Velvet Underground.\"</p><p/><p>Rolling Stone named the Underground's 1967 debut album the 13th greatest of all time.</p><p/><p>LOU REED, MUSICIAN: I get personal satisfaction out of making things that don't exist. I follow passion. And that is the one rule I've lived by.</p><p/><p>TURNER: The edgy Reed said he wanted to tell the stories of outsiders. As a solo artist, Reed's lyrics \"Take a Walk on the Wild Side\" explored sex, drugs, and drag queens.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>ANTHONY DECURTIS, CONTRIBUTIONG EDITOR, ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE: He saw himself as a literary figure as much as a musician and took that aspect of his work very seriously.</p><p/><p>TURNER: Reed also delved into acting, playing an annoying record producer in Paul Simon's 1980 movie rip of the music business, \"One Trick Pony.\"</p><p/><p>REED: What do you think I am? Just a non-turnout (ph) here? I made a couple of records myself. I know what I'm doing.</p><p/><p>TURNER: Reed loved poetry and legions of indie rockers hung on his every word. He celebrated independent streak as heard on \"I Love You, Suzanne.\"</p><p/><p>(MUSIC)</p><p/><p>TURNER: Reed had been frail for months after a liver transplant earlier this year. He died at his home in South Hampton, New York, at age 71.</p><p/><p>Nischelle Turner, CNN, Los Angeles.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>BERMAN: That's a true legend, Lou Reed.</p><p/><p>All right. So, if I look like a basket case this morning is because I have not slept in several days. The Boston Red Sox with their backs up against the wall, they came through with a big win in another historic ending to a game, two a row now. Andy Scholes with more in this morning's \"Bleacher Report.\"</p><p/><p>Good morning, Andy!</p><p/><p>ANDY SCHOLES, BLEACHER REPORT: Hey. Good morning, guys.</p><p/><p>Last night's game huge for the Red Sox. Not only snatch back the momentum in the series but they also regained that old thing called home field advantage. Big Papi, he's been on fire this whole series and the only one with a hit in last night's game when he got the team together in the dugout before the sixth inning. And sure enough, Boston gets two runners on and Jonny Gomes who wasn't supposed to play last night came in for the injured Shane Victorino and rushed that ball to left. The three home-run gives the Red Sox 4-1 lead. Check it out. Mike Napoli giving him a beard tug for a celebration.</p><p/><p>Bottom of the nine, Cardinals had a chance. Carlos Beltran represents the tying run but Kolten Wong is picked off first base! It's a walk off pick off. First time in World Series a game ended on a pickoff. Red Sox win 4-2. Game five tonight at 8:00 Eastern.</p><p/><p>Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson certainly lived up to the nickname Megatron yesterday against the Cowboys! Johnson racked up a ridiculous 329 yards receiving. That was just seven yards shy of the NFL record. His effort helped the Lions make incredible comeback. Detroit down six with a minute to go, get to one yard line.</p><p/><p>Check out Matt Stafford. He's like, spike the ball, spike the ball, spike the ball! He tricks everyone and he jumps in for the touchdown! The Lions rejoice because they win 31-30! A crushing defeat for the Cowboys.</p><p/><p>Check out Dez Bryant on the sideline. He was not happy about this outcome! He goes on a tirade and would have to be restrained by Demarcus Ware. After the game, Dez said his tirade was a action of positive action.</p><p/><p>All right. Turning on BleacheReport.com today, the Minnesota Vikings off to a quick start again the Green Bay Packers last night. Rookie Peterson took the kickoff back 109 yards for the touchdown and broke the previous record of 108 yards and most recently done by Jacoby Jones in a Super Bowl in February. Vikings may have won the battle on that play but the Packers won the war. They beat Minnesota last night 34-31.</p><p/><p>And believe it or not, the NBA season tips off tomorrow night with a double-header on our sister network TNT. The Bulls and Heat get things started at 8:00 Eastern.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Yay, finally!</p><p/><p>SCHOLES: I know you're excited about this, Zoraida.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Just basketball, I am so happy! Yes.</p><p/><p>SHOLES: If the World Series goes to seven games, which it looked like it might, on Thursday night, it would be on Halloween. We would have baseball, NFL football, NBA basketball, and hockey, all four sports.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Something for everyone. How perfect is that be?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: My head will explode completely.</p><p/><p>Andy Scholes, always good to see you. Thank you.</p><p/><p>SCHOLES: Have a good one.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Coming up for us next, you know what, Christine Romans in the makeup room a little while ago, talking about what a wild week on Wall Street this could be. Could be looking at a new round of record highs? We'll tell you when we come back.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: You were in the makeup room?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Welcome back to EARLY START. It's \"Money Time\".</p><p/><p>And Berman has been talking about all the fabulous news that you have to share.</p><p/><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: There's a lot of good news. I mean, stocks have had a really good week again. We have futures up this morning. We're looking at a record S&amp;P 500 and futures market that could happen again today.</p><p/><p>A record close at the S&amp;P on Friday. The other major markets also finish the week higher. That's how much.</p><p/><p>And now, for a reality check, where you stand for the year, I love bringing you this number. This is a good indication for me after five years of bad news. The Dow is up 19 percent, the NASDAQ is up 31 percent, and S&amp;P is up 23 percent.</p><p/><p>I really care about that last number because the stock part of your 401(k) most likely replicates the S&amp;P 500. And if you're paying big percentage for mutual fund, you know, big percentage for mutual fund management, and you're not up 23 percent, you should look at the S&amp;P 500 tracking mutual funds.</p><p/><p>All right. The big tech scene should continue this week after a blockbuster showing from high tech heavyweights last week. Microsoft, Google and Amazon released better earnings and investors cheered the results.</p><p/><p>Apple also had a winning week after the billionaire activist Carl Icahn continued his push for a mega stock buyback. Look at the stock increases last week. The CEO Tim Cook of Apple will again be in the spotlight because today is earnings day for Apple. Look for profit to fall from a year ago, but sales may rise slightly. We also should get clarity on how the 5s and that less expensive 5c have been selling. So, tomorrow will be a big day for Apple investors.</p><p/><p>Investors also keep an eye on Washington this week but not because of a shutdown, no debt standoff. We'll be looking at the Federal Reserve. The Fed committee wraps up a two-day meeting on Wednesday, highly unlikely to dial back the $85 billion monthly stimulus program that helped send stocks soaring this believe. In fact, people believe that the Fed is flooding the zone until maybe March. The government shutdown and the debt ceiling battle have forced the Fed's hands, creating a weaker economic outlook, muddying the data the central bank relies to make decisions.</p><p/><p>In fact, there was a surprising note from Societe Generale last week that said instead of cutting its bond purchases, the Fed could increase them because the economy isn't doing as well the Fed hoped for at this point. This is a really important story this week -- the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, and it matters to everyone, matters to -- interest rates you're paying on your credit card, your car loan and housing. So, incredibly important.</p><p/><p>And tomorrow is the one year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy devastating damage in the New York and New Jersey area. Remember the huge lines to get gas? This was so insulting to people who were trying to get back to work and you couldn't even get gas.</p><p/><p>Happy to hear for those people that New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo is going to create a strategic gasoline reserve. After Sandy, many stations were left without power to pump the gas, and the ones that had power quickly ran out of fuel and couldn't get stuff in. Real interesting, just like the nation has a strategic petroleum reserve. Cuomo wants to do a gas reserve.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Interesting as you can't get the gas to the station. That was the problem during Sandy. But an effort that may be helpful.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: We will watch it.</p><p/><p>BERMAN: Thanks, Christine.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: You're welcome.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Coming up a statewide manhunt going on in Oklahoma. How four convicts managed to break out of a prison that was considered absolutely escape-proof?</p><p/><p>BERMAN: A lot going on this morning.</p><p/><p>The British phone hacking trial finally getting under way in London. Eight people facing charges, including a former huge media executive. Why this case could drag on until Easter.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[Byline: John Berman, Zoraida Sambolin, Jim Sciutto, Matthew Chance, Indra Petersons, Nischelle Turner, Christine Romans] [High: Four men broke out of the Caddo Detention Center, about 70 miles southwest of Oklahoma City.

Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Zoraida Sambolin.</p><p>We're not talking about the Red Sox at all this morning?</p><p>BERMAN: No, no, I can't about it! I haven't slept in like three days. I can barely speak at all.</p><p>Good morning, everyone. I'm John Berman. It is Monday, October 28.

A new report out of Germany claiming President Obama knew the U.S. was conducting surveillance on Chancellor Angela Merkel back in 2010, even though he assured her by phone last week that he did not know anything. This morning, U.S. officials are claiming the Obama administration ended the NSA operation that spied on Merkel this past summer, as soon as they found out about it.</p><p>We get more from CNN's chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The newest Edward Snowden documents reveal more spying on America's closest allies. In Spain, reports the NSA listening in on 60 million phone calls in a single month. And in Germany, the \"Bild am Sonntag\" newspaper reports that President Obama was briefed by NSA Chief Keith Alexander about spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's calls back in 2010, contradicting White House assurances the president was not aware of the extent of the surveillance.</p><p>The NSA quickly denied the report, telling CNN, \"General Alexander did not discuss with President Obama in 2010 an alleged foreign intelligence operation involving German chancellor Merkel, nor has he ever discussed alleged operations involving Merkel.\"</p><p>The NSA's denial a clear step beyond the White House's willingness, up to now, only to deny present and future monitoring.</p><p>JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I can tell you that the president assured chancellor that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor.</p><p>SCIUTTO: German intelligence experts are expected to come to the U.S. to challenge their counterparts on the spying after a German official accused the U.S. of breaking, quote, \"German law on German soil.\"</p><p>But House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers defended the NSA surveillance on CNN Sunday, saying it was both well-regulated and essential to keeping Americans and Europeans safe from terrorism.</p><p>REP.

These attacks coming after Palestinian militants fired two rockets into southern Israel.</p><p>Matthew Chance is live from Jerusalem this morning.</p><p>Matthew, give me the latest and the time line here of what happened.</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, John, these Israeli air force strikes on what they say a concealed rocket launching site in Gaza taking place just a few hours ago. They came in response to the firing of two rockets from the Gaza Strip into the Israeli territory. Both of those rockets were -- didn't cause any casualties. One was intercepted, in fact, according to the Israeli military, by the Iron Dome missile defense system. The other fell into open ground. No casualties reported.</p><p>But the Israelis did strike back as I say launching those air strikes a few hours ago hitting concealed rocket launching sites inside the Gaza Strip. Palestinian officials say that -- confirmed the air strikes took place but say there were no injuries either.</p><p>Now, it's been very quiet in the Gaza Strip the last several months particularly because a peace process backed by the U.S. secretary of State and the United States in general under way between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It's not clear if the rocket attacks were linked to progress in those peace negotiations.</p><p>But, over the course of the past 24 hours, Israeli (INAUDIBLE) will release another 26 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails as a confidence-building measure to try to promote the peace process.</p><p>BERMAN: Matthew, it has been nearly a year since that cease-fire deal was struck between Hamas in Gaza and Israel. But over the last few weeks, it seems to have entered this new phase with Israeli destroying a smuggling tunnel into Gaza.</p><p>Are there fears that these air strikes and the missile launches over the last day could escalate into a new really hot conflict between the two sides?</p><p>CHANCE: Yes, I think, John, there is always that potential. We have seen it time and again in Gaza with these small incidents being escalated and turning into something much bigger. It's not clear that this is an example of that at the moment. Still a lot of political will on both sides, on both the Israeli and Palestinian side for the peace process to advance.</p><p>Of course, in the Gaza Strip, elements like Hamas that govern there are opposed to the peace process with the Israelis but the vast majority of Palestinian groups, vast majority of Palestinians at the moment are in favor of it so there is a sense that this probably isn't enough at this stage to derail the peace process.</p><p>BERMAN: All right. Interesting. All signs this morning pointing to the fact that this could be isolated. We will keep an eye on it.</p><p>Matthew Chance in Jerusalem, thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And new problems this morning for the already trouble- plagued Obamacare Web site. Not a single American could enroll online yesterday because of what they're calling a data glitch. An outage at the Verizon data center is being blamed for that. It's used by the government's health care site to verify people's identities and their citizenship. The Obama administration and Verizon could not say how long it would take to fix that problem.</p><p>BERMAN: An independent contractor at the North Carolina state fair has been charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, after a ride he was operating injured five people. Forty-six-year-old Timothy Tutterrow was arrested following investigations into Thursday night's accident. Authorities say safety devices on the Vortex, that was the name of the ride, safety devices were tampered with. More arrests could be coming. Three people remain hospitalized this morning.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Miami Dolphin Mike Pouncey ordered to testify before a grand jury in the Aaron Hernandez murder investigation. So, according to \"Sports Illustrated\", he was served with a subpoena in Foxborough, yesterday, one hour after his team lost to the New England Patriots. Pouncey is a close friend and former college teammate of Hernandez. He has not been charged with a crime and police consider him a witness who could help them with their investigation.</p><p>BERMAN: A lot of people are wondering all along if there'd be other players involved with this. So far, no, but he is really the first. Seventy-one-year-old -- a 71-year-old passenger at Montreal's Trudeau Airport arrested Sunday morning for possession of a powder-like substance in his carry-on luggage. He was board to a flight for Los Angeles using a fake identity. The officials will only say the substance did not belong at the airport, any airport for that matter, and that it posed no immediate risk.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, now, to the second listeria-related recall in as many weeks. Taylor Farms is recalling 5,000 pounds of Broccoli salad and slaw, including its broccoli crunch with bacon and dressing. Did you buy that?</p><p>BERMAN: No.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I saw you pay attention here.</p><p>OK. The kits contain dressing in packets that are the subject of an FDA recall that were sold in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. Here's the good news, folks -- no one has gotten sick.</p><p>BERMAN: It is good news.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Last week, listeria concerns prompted a major recall of ready-to-eat products by Resers Fine Foods.</p><p>BERMAN: We make our own slaw.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Oh, do you?</p><p>BERMAN: Nine minutes past the hour right now.</p><p>It is Halloween Week, a very important weather week.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: That's true.</p><p>BERMAN: Let's get a check of how things going so far. Indra Petersons is here with us this morning.</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>INDRA PETERSONS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: I'll start with Halloween, because we know it's expected to rain by next week in these areas. So, I just want we know that ahead of time. A lot of people got to make the Halloween costumes fun to love.</p><p>But here's a little bit hint of good news now that I started with that -- moderate temperatures today. Yes, oop, there we go. We're starting to see temperatures rebound a little bit for today, but notice if you look at Buffalo, they are below average. So, by tomorrow, looking for them to go back down with a cold front is expected to swing through.</p><p>But, hey, here is the change. We are going to see that pattern shift. Instead of the old care in the east, we're going to start to see that be more in the West, with temperatures moderating in the east for a little bit. So, we are actually looking at today a big storm in the Pacific Northwest, that's going to bring some pretty heavy snowfall, even up to 18 inches of snowfall possible today in Montana and Wyoming, and exact same system is going to bring rain, even as far south as southern California.</p><p>So, that's really going to be the system that we're going to be watching, eventually make its way across the country and bring rain on Halloween. And it is a cold system. I mean, look at these temperatures, Billings about 31, looks like their high today in North Platte only about 44 today. When you compare that difference to the south where temperatures above normal. The other big concern is going to be the severe weather threat we are looking at maybe right into through Kansas and Nebraska today.</p><p>We're looking out for that.</p><p>BERMAN: Keep an eye on that. All right. Indra, thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. And coming up, he took us all for a walk on the wild side. How rock 'n' roll icon Lou Reed is being remembered this morning.</p><p>BERMAN: A legend.</p><p>And more legal problems this morning for singer Chris Brown. New details about his latest run-in with the law. Another one, folks.</p><p>Plus, it is time for your morning rhyme. Tweet us with your own original verse. It can be about anything but it needs to rhyme, folks, #EarlyStart, #MorningRhyme. We will read the best one on the air in the next half hour.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Welcome back to EARLY START.</p><p>We have breaking news overnight. Dr. Conrad Murray is a free man. He was released from a California prison this morning after serving two years for involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson. Murray had his medical licenses revoked in California, Texas and Nevada after his conviction. His lawyer says Murray is trying to get them reinstated so he can get back to treating patients.</p><p>BERMAN: Singer Chris Brown faces charges this morning for an alleged assault outside of Washington, D.C. hotel. Brown was arrested on a felony assault charge after police say the 24-year-old got into a physical altercation with 20-year-old Isaac Adams Parker outside the W Hotel. It happened about 4:30 a.m. Sunday morning. Brown's bodyguard Christopher Hollosy was also arrested.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And the music world is mourning the death of a rock legend this morning. Lou Reed passing Sunday at his home in eastern Long Island after a long battle with liver disease. Reed influenced generations of musicians and took rock 'n' roll to places it had never gone before. Here is Nischelle Turner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>NISCHELLE TURNER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With classics like \"Sweet Jane\", Lou Reed influenced generations of rockers, often merging also risque lyrics with drowning guitars. Born and raised in New York, Reed joined creative forces with Andy Warhol, who sponsored the \"Velvet Underground.\"</p><p>Rolling Stone named the Underground's 1967 debut album the 13th greatest of all time.</p><p>LOU REED, MUSICIAN: I get personal satisfaction out of making things that don't exist. I follow passion. And that is the one rule I've lived by.</p><p>TURNER: The edgy Reed said he wanted to tell the stories of outsiders. As a solo artist, Reed's lyrics \"Take a Walk on the Wild Side\" explored sex, drugs, and drag queens.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>ANTHONY DECURTIS, CONTRIBUTIONG EDITOR, ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE: He saw himself as a literary figure as much as a musician and took that aspect of his work very seriously.</p><p>TURNER: Reed also delved into acting, playing an annoying record producer in Paul Simon's 1980 movie rip of the music business, \"One Trick Pony.\"</p><p>REED: What do you think I am? Just a non-turnout (ph) here? I made a couple of records myself. I know what I'm doing.</p><p>TURNER: Reed loved poetry and legions of indie rockers hung on his every word. He celebrated independent streak as heard on \"I Love You, Suzanne.\"</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TURNER: Reed had been frail for months after a liver transplant earlier this year. He died at his home in South Hampton, New York, at age 71.</p><p>Nischelle Turner, CNN, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERMAN: That's a true legend, Lou Reed.</p><p>All right. So, if I look like a basket case this morning is because I have not slept in several days. The Boston Red Sox with their backs up against the wall, they came through with a big win in another historic ending to a game, two a row now. Andy Scholes with more in this morning's \"Bleacher Report.\"</p><p>Good morning, Andy!</p><p>ANDY SCHOLES, BLEACHER REPORT: Hey. Good morning, guys.</p><p>Last night's game huge for the Red Sox. Not only snatch back the momentum in the series but they also regained that old thing called home field advantage. Big Papi, he's been on fire this whole series and the only one with a hit in last night's game when he got the team together in the dugout before the sixth inning. And sure enough, Boston gets two runners on and Jonny Gomes who wasn't supposed to play last night came in for the injured Shane Victorino and rushed that ball to left. The three home-run gives the Red Sox 4-1 lead. Check it out. Mike Napoli giving him a beard tug for a celebration.</p><p>Bottom of the nine, Cardinals had a chance. Carlos Beltran represents the tying run but Kolten Wong is picked off first base! It's a walk off pick off. First time in World Series a game ended on a pickoff. Red Sox win 4-2. Game five tonight at 8:00 Eastern.</p><p>Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson certainly lived up to the nickname Megatron yesterday against the Cowboys! Johnson racked up a ridiculous 329 yards receiving. That was just seven yards shy of the NFL record. His effort helped the Lions make incredible comeback. Detroit down six with a minute to go, get to one yard line.</p><p>Check out Matt Stafford. He's like, spike the ball, spike the ball, spike the ball! He tricks everyone and he jumps in for the touchdown! The Lions rejoice because they win 31-30! A crushing defeat for the Cowboys.</p><p>Check out Dez Bryant on the sideline. He was not happy about this outcome! He goes on a tirade and would have to be restrained by Demarcus Ware. After the game, Dez said his tirade was a action of positive action.</p><p>All right. Turning on BleacheReport.com today, the Minnesota Vikings off to a quick start again the Green Bay Packers last night. Rookie Peterson took the kickoff back 109 yards for the touchdown and broke the previous record of 108 yards and most recently done by Jacoby Jones in a Super Bowl in February. Vikings may have won the battle on that play but the Packers won the war. They beat Minnesota last night 34-31.</p><p>And believe it or not, the NBA season tips off tomorrow night with a double-header on our sister network TNT. The Bulls and Heat get things started at 8:00 Eastern.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Yay, finally!</p><p>SCHOLES: I know you're excited about this, Zoraida.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Just basketball, I am so happy! Yes.</p><p>SHOLES: If the World Series goes to seven games, which it looked like it might, on Thursday night, it would be on Halloween. We would have baseball, NFL football, NBA basketball, and hockey, all four sports.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Something for everyone. How perfect is that be?</p><p>BERMAN: My head will explode completely.</p><p>Andy Scholes, always good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>SCHOLES: Have a good one.</p><p>BERMAN: Coming up for us next, you know what, Christine Romans in the makeup room a little while ago, talking about what a wild week on Wall Street this could be. Could be looking at a new round of record highs? We'll tell you when we come back.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: You were in the makeup room?</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Welcome back to EARLY START. It's \"Money Time\".</p><p>And Berman has been talking about all the fabulous news that you have to share.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: There's a lot of good news. I mean, stocks have had a really good week again. We have futures up this morning. We're looking at a record S&amp;P 500 and futures market that could happen again today.</p><p>A record close at the S&amp;P on Friday. The other major markets also finish the week higher. That's how much.</p><p>And now, for a reality check, where you stand for the year, I love bringing you this number. This is a good indication for me after five years of bad news. The Dow is up 19 percent, the NASDAQ is up 31 percent, and S&amp;P is up 23 percent.</p><p>I really care about that last number because the stock part of your 401(k) most likely replicates the S&amp;P 500. And if you're paying big percentage for mutual fund, you know, big percentage for mutual fund management, and you're not up 23 percent, you should look at the S&amp;P 500 tracking mutual funds.</p><p>All right. The big tech scene should continue this week after a blockbuster showing from high tech heavyweights last week. Microsoft, Google and Amazon released better earnings and investors cheered the results.</p><p>Apple also had a winning week after the billionaire activist Carl Icahn continued his push for a mega stock buyback. Look at the stock increases last week. The CEO Tim Cook of Apple will again be in the spotlight because today is earnings day for Apple. Look for profit to fall from a year ago, but sales may rise slightly. We also should get clarity on how the 5s and that less expensive 5c have been selling. So, tomorrow will be a big day for Apple investors.</p><p>Investors also keep an eye on Washington this week but not because of a shutdown, no debt standoff. We'll be looking at the Federal Reserve. The Fed committee wraps up a two-day meeting on Wednesday, highly unlikely to dial back the $85 billion monthly stimulus program that helped send stocks soaring this believe. In fact, people believe that the Fed is flooding the zone until maybe March. The government shutdown and the debt ceiling battle have forced the Fed's hands, creating a weaker economic outlook, muddying the data the central bank relies to make decisions.</p><p>In fact, there was a surprising note from Societe Generale last week that said instead of cutting its bond purchases, the Fed could increase them because the economy isn't doing as well the Fed hoped for at this point. This is a really important story this week -- the Fed, the Fed, the Fed, and it matters to everyone, matters to -- interest rates you're paying on your credit card, your car loan and housing. So, incredibly important.</p><p>And tomorrow is the one year anniversary of Superstorm Sandy devastating damage in the New York and New Jersey area. Remember the huge lines to get gas? This was so insulting to people who were trying to get back to work and you couldn't even get gas.</p><p>Happy to hear for those people that New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo is going to create a strategic gasoline reserve. After Sandy, many stations were left without power to pump the gas, and the ones that had power quickly ran out of fuel and couldn't get stuff in. Real interesting, just like the nation has a strategic petroleum reserve. Cuomo wants to do a gas reserve.</p><p>BERMAN: Interesting as you can't get the gas to the station. That was the problem during Sandy. But an effort that may be helpful.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: We will watch it.</p><p>BERMAN: Thanks, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: You're welcome.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Coming up a statewide manhunt going on in Oklahoma. How four convicts managed to break out of a prison that was considered absolutely escape-proof?</p><p>BERMAN: A lot going on this morning.</p><p>The British phone hacking trial finally getting under way in London. Eight people facing charges, including a former huge media executive. Why this case could drag on until Easter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2013102801CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59PC-FHJ1-JB20-G4PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>October 28, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Oklahoma</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Prisons</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Espionage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Israel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gaza Strip</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Safety</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Obamacare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DD2V</classCode><className>2013 MASS SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim...</p><p>Four Big Tech CEOs spent Wednesday being grilled \u2014 virtually \u2014 by House lawmakers, creating a first-ever spectacle that was by turns revealing and, inevitably, awkward.    Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook each brought their distinct mannerisms to bear, but all shared an abundantly cautious approach that extinguished most of the difficult questions with well-rehearsed lines about how their firms do not tilt the playing field in their own favor.    The House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, concluded the day-long hearing by hinting at what might lie ahead as lawmakers ponder federal regulations to hold the four companies \u2014 worth nearly a combined $5 trillion \u2014 to account.    \u201cThese companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable,\u201d said Cicilline, adding that antitrust laws written a century ago need to be updated for the digital age.    \u201cWhen these laws were written, the monopolists were men named Rockefeller and Carnegie,\u201d he said. \u201cToday the men are named Zuckerberg, Cook, Pichai and Bezos. Once again, their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power. This must end.\u201d    What\u2019s next? Cicilline will issue a report expected in about a month on the subcommittee\u2019s investigation into the companies, providing a framework for what shape new regulations on Silicon Valley could take.    Here are some key takeaways from the hearing:    Bezos \u2018can\u2019t guarantee\u2019 Amazon never used seller data to make its own products    The heart of Wednesday\u2019s hearing was about whether the tech companies exploit their market dominance to squash competition to juice their own products and services.    Critics of Amazon have long pointed to one alleged instance of that: when Amazon notices a third-party product is selling well on its site and uses that information to launch its own private-brand alternative, which critics say Amazon promotes over rivals.    Ever since the Wall Street Journal earlier this year revealed that Amazon was scooping up data from independent sellers and using it to create its own competing products, Amazon executives have categorically denied it.    On Wednesday, that changed.    Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., whose district includes Amazon\u2019s headquarters, asked Bezos point blank: Does the company use the data it collects from other sellers on the platform for its benefit?    \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question yes or no,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cWe have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can\u2019t guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\u201d    It was the first time Amazon acknowledged that the $1 trillion company may be misusing data to edge out independent sellers. Bezos said Amazon is conducting an internal investigation into the matter.    Jayapal noted that Amazon has access to information about consumer habits, sellers\u2019 pricing and inventory data \u2014 a trove of details that could be ripe for abuse if used to make business decisions about Amazon\u2019s own products.    \u201cYou can set the rules of the game for your competitors, but not actually follow those same rules for yourself,\u201d Jayapal said.    Hurting the competition emerges as Democrats\u2019 primary charge against Big Tech    Amazon wasn\u2019t the only target. The hearing promised to examine the \u201cdominance\u201d of all four tech giants, and a lot of the questioning \u2014 mainly from Democrats \u2014 zeroed in on competition.    Drawing on more than a million documents and hundreds of hours of testimony collected in the committee\u2019s year-long investigation, lawmakers also peppered the other three CEOs with questions about how their companies got so big, and whether they are using their might to hurt much smaller competitors.    Google CEO Pichai was pressed on search and advertising, with lawmakers probing whether Google favors its own pages and products and accusing it of stealing content from competing services such as Yelp.    \u201cAs Google became the gateway to the internet, it began to abuse its power,\u201d Cicilline said.    The CEO responded that Google aims to give users the information they\u2019re looking for \u2014 but he ducked some of the specific accusations.    For Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg, the focus was on acquisitions, particularly the company\u2019s $1 billion deal for photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012.    Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., quoted the CEO his own email discussing the need to \u201cneutralize a competitor\u201d as part of the rationale for buying Instagram.    \u201cThis is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\u201d Nadler said.    Zuckerberg was also questioned about how Facebook used another app it bought to monitor what people were doing on their smartphones, in order to identify other apps to poach.    The CEO said there are many reasons he buys companies, arguing that eight years ago, when Facebook bought Instagram, \u201cit was far from obvious\u201d that Instagram would grow so large, saying Facebook\u2019s investment spurred the social media platform\u2019s success.    Apple\u2019s Cook, who received less attention than the other three CEOs, had to defend against charges that his company uses its App Store to punish rivals.    Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia cited Apple\u2019s decision to remove parental control apps, such as OurPact, shortly after Apple introduced Screen Time, a competing service.    \u201cWe were concerned, congresswoman, about the privacy and security of kids,\u201d Cook said, noting that OurPact was vulnerable to third-party takeovers. \u201cSo we were worried about their safety.\u201d    But McBath remained skeptical.    She pointed to an email in which an Apple employee responds to a mother complaining about the removal of parental control apps. The Apple representative suggested that the mother download Apple\u2019s Screen Time.    \u201cEven some of the largest companies in the country fear your power. Our evidence suggests that your company has used its power to harm your rivals and boost your own business,\u201d McBath said. \u201cThis is fundamentally unfair,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, it reduces the competition and the choices made to consumers and that\u2019s a great concern to all of us.\u201d    Republicans sidetrack hearing to air complaints over anti-conservative bias    Wednesday\u2019s hearing was supposed to be about Big Tech\u2019s power and market dominance. But Republicans made it about something else: accusations that online platforms are biased against conservatives.    \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, in his opening statement.    Jordan then rapidly read aloud headlines making claims that conservative-leaning publications and voices have been suppressed or censored on Facebook and Google.    \u201cWe all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies. But what\u2019s not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t end, there has to be consequences.\u201d    Before Jordan\u2019s remarks, Wisconsin Republican Jim Sensenbrenner also mentioned the belief \u2014 strongly contested by large tech companies and unsupported by evidence \u2014 that conservatives do not get a fair shake from the online platforms, calling reports of conservative censorship \u201cseriously troubling.\u201d    \u201cConservatives are consumers, too, and they need the protection of antitrust laws,\u201d Sensenbrenner said.    Missing from view? Zuckerberg\u2019s reaction    Wednesday\u2019s showdown was historic for bringing four of the most powerful men in technology before Congress for the first time.    In the case of Bezos, it was his Capitol Hill debut. But the hearing was also unprecedented in format. Because of the pandemic, the four CEOs, and some members, including judiciary committee chair Nadler, all called in via Cisco\u2019s Webex video conference.    That virtual format made for surreal imagery: the four titans projected on a giant screen in the hearing room, each man contained in his own video chat box as lawmakers looked on to a hearing room of mostly empty seats.    At one point, the chair called a 10-minute recess to fix a technical issue with Bezos\u2019s feed.    Turns out, even tech titans have IT problems.    It also drained the hearing of the kind of kinetic energy of having executives of some of the most influential companies in the world seated side by side. That would have provided a national audience with the chance to see the dynamic among the executives \u2014 who are not known to be particularly fond of one another \u2014 as well as gauge their body language and reactions to each others\u2019 testimony.    On Twitter, observers like Wall Street Journal reporter Deepa Seetharaman lamented not being able to see Zuckerberg\u2019s face when Bezos described social media as a \u201cnuance destruction machine.\u201d    Notably, the most dramatic moment came not in back and forths while lawmakers were questioning the CEOs, but when Jordan, in his usual sleeves-rolled-up bulldog style, got into a full-throated screaming match with Cicilline over his denied request to allow a lawmaker not on the judiciary committee to be able to ask questions.    \u201cWe\u2019re talking about peoples\u2019 liberties here,\u201d Jordan bellowed over Cicilline.    \u201cPut your mask on,\u201d Jordan was told.

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim...</p><p>Four Big Tech CEOs spent Wednesday being grilled \u2014 virtually \u2014 by House lawmakers, creating a first-ever spectacle that was by turns revealing and, inevitably, awkward.    Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook each brought their distinct mannerisms to bear, but all shared an abundantly cautious approach that extinguished most of the difficult questions with well-rehearsed lines about how their firms do not tilt the playing field in their own favor.     The House Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, concluded the day-long hearing by hinting at what might lie ahead as lawmakers ponder federal regulations to hold the four companies \u2014 worth nearly a combined $5 trillion \u2014 to account.    \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable,\" said Cicilline, adding that antitrust laws written a century ago need to be updated for the digital age.    \"When these laws were written, the monopolists were men named Rockefeller and Carnegie,\" he said. \"Today the men are named Zuckerberg, Cook, Pichai and Bezos. Once again, their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power. This must end.\"    What's next? Cicilline will issue a report expected in about a month on the subcommittee's investigation into the companies, providing a framework for what shape new regulations on Silicon Valley could take.    Here are some key takeaways from the hearing:    Bezos 'can't guarantee' Amazon never used seller data to make its own products    The heart of Wednesday's hearing was about whether the tech companies exploit their market dominance to squash competition to juice their own products and services.       Critics of Amazon have long pointed to one alleged instance of that: when Amazon notices a third-party product is selling well on its site and uses that information to launch its own private-brand alternative, which critics say Amazon promotes over rivals.    Ever since the Wall Street Journal earlier this year revealed that Amazon was scooping up data from independent sellers and using it to create its own competing products, Amazon executives have categorically denied it.               On Wednesday, that changed.    Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., whose district includes Amazon's headquarters, asked Bezos point blank: Does the company use the data it collects from other sellers on the platform for its benefit?    \"I can't answer that question yes or no,\" Bezos said. \"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\"    It was the first time Amazon acknowledged that the $1 trillion company may be misusing data to edge out independent sellers. Bezos said Amazon is conducting an internal investigation into the matter.    Jayapal noted that Amazon has access to information about consumer habits, sellers' pricing and inventory data \u2014 a trove of details that could be ripe for abuse if used to make business decisions about Amazon's own products.    \"You can set the rules of the game for your competitors, but not actually follow those same rules for yourself,\" Jayapal said.    Hurting the competition emerges as Democrats' primary charge against Big Tech    Amazon wasn't the only target. The hearing promised to examine the \"dominance\" of all four tech giants, and a lot of the questioning \u2014 mainly from Democrats \u2014 zeroed in on competition.    Drawing on more than a million documents and hundreds of hours of testimony collected in the committee's year-long investigation, lawmakers also peppered the other three CEOs with questions about how their companies got so big, and whether they are using their might to hurt much smaller competitors.    Google CEO Pichai was pressed on search and advertising, with lawmakers probing whether Google favors its own pages and products and accusing it of stealing content from competing services such as Yelp.               \"As Google became the gateway to the internet, it began to abuse its power,\" Cicilline said.    The CEO responded that Google aims to give users the information they're looking for \u2014 but he ducked some of the specific accusations.    For Facebook's Zuckerberg, the focus was on acquisitions, particularly the company's $1 billion deal for photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012.    Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., quoted the CEO his own email discussing the need to \"neutralize a competitor\" as part of the rationale for buying Instagram.    \"This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\" Nadler said.    Zuckerberg was also questioned about how Facebook used another app it bought to monitor what people were doing on their smartphones, in order to identify other apps to poach.    The CEO said there are many reasons he buys companies, arguing that eight years ago, when Facebook bought Instagram, \"it was far from obvious\" that Instagram would grow so large, saying Facebook's investment spurred the social media platform's success.    Apple's Cook, who received less attention than the other three CEOs, had to defend against charges that his company uses its App Store to punish rivals.               Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia cited Apple's decision to remove parental control apps, such as OurPact, shortly after Apple introduced Screen Time, a competing service.    \"We were concerned, congresswoman, about the privacy and security of kids,\" Cook said, noting that OurPact was vulnerable to third-party takeovers. \"So we were worried about their safety.\"    But McBath remained skeptical.    She pointed to an email in which an Apple employee responds to a mother complaining about the removal of parental control apps. The Apple representative suggested that the mother download Apple's Screen Time.    \"Even some of the largest companies in the country fear your power. Our evidence suggests that your company has used its power to harm your rivals and boost your own business,\" McBath said. \"This is fundamentally unfair,\" she said. \"Ultimately, it reduces the competition and the choices made to consumers and that's a great concern to all of us.\"    Republicans sidetrack hearing to air complaints over anti-conservative bias    Wednesday's hearing was supposed to be about Big Tech's power and market dominance. But Republicans made it about something else: accusations that online platforms are biased against conservatives.    \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, in his opening statement.    Jordan then rapidly read aloud headlines making claims that conservative-leaning publications and voices have been suppressed or censored on Facebook and Google.               \"We all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies. But what's not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections,\" Jordan said. \"If it doesn't end, there has to be consequences.\"    Before Jordan's remarks, Wisconsin Republican Jim Sensenbrenner also mentioned the belief \u2014 strongly contested by large tech companies and unsupported by evidence \u2014 that conservatives do not get a fair shake from the online platforms, calling reports of conservative censorship \"seriously troubling.\"    \"Conservatives are consumers, too, and they need the protection of antitrust laws,\" Sensenbrenner said.

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim...</p><p>Four Big Tech CEOs spent Wednesday being grilled \u2014 virtually \u2014 by House lawmakers, creating a first-ever spectacle that was by turns revealing and, inevitably, awkward.   Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook each brought their distinct mannerisms to bear, but all shared an abundantly cautious approach that extinguished most of the difficult questions with well-rehearsed lines about how their firms do not tilt the playing field in their own favor.    The House Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, concluded the day-long hearing by hinting at what might lie ahead as lawmakers ponder federal regulations to hold the four companies \u2014 worth nearly a combined $5 trillion \u2014 to account.    \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable,\" said Cicilline, adding that antitrust laws written a century ago need to be updated for the digital age.    \"When these laws were written, the monopolists were men named Rockefeller and Carnegie,\" he said. \"Today the men are named Zuckerberg, Cook, Pichai and Bezos. Once again, their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power. This must end.\"    What's next? Cicilline will issue a report expected in about a month on the subcommittee's investigation into the companies, providing a framework for what shape new regulations on Silicon Valley could take.    Here are some key takeaways from the hearing:    Bezos 'can't guarantee' Amazon never used seller data to make its own products    The heart of Wednesday's hearing was about whether the tech companies exploit their market dominance to squash competition to juice their own products and services.    Critics of Amazon have long pointed to one alleged instance of that: when Amazon notices a third-party product is selling well on its site and uses that information to launch its own private-brand alternative, which critics say Amazon promotes over rivals.    Ever since the Wall Street Journal earlier this year revealed that Amazon was scooping up data from independent sellers and using it to create its own competing products, Amazon executives have categorically denied it.         On Wednesday, that changed.    Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., whose district includes Amazon's headquarters, asked Bezos point blank: Does the company use the data it collects from other sellers on the platform for its benefit?    \"I can't answer that question yes or no,\" Bezos said. \"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\"    It was the first time Amazon acknowledged that the $1 trillion company may be misusing data to edge out independent sellers. Bezos said Amazon is conducting an internal investigation into the matter.    Jayapal noted that Amazon has access to information about consumer habits, sellers' pricing and inventory data \u2014 a trove of details that could be ripe for abuse if used to make business decisions about Amazon's own products.    \"You can set the rules of the game for your competitors, but not actually follow those same rules for yourself,\" Jayapal said.    Hurting the competition emerges as Democrats' primary charge against Big Tech    Amazon wasn't the only target. The hearing promised to examine the \"dominance\" of all four tech giants, and a lot of the questioning \u2014 mainly from Democrats \u2014 zeroed in on competition.    Drawing on more than a million documents and hundreds of hours of testimony collected in the committee's year-long investigation, lawmakers also peppered the other three CEOs with questions about how their companies got so big, and whether they are using their might to hurt much smaller competitors.    Google CEO Pichai was pressed on search and advertising, with lawmakers probing whether Google favors its own pages and products and accusing it of stealing content from competing services such as Yelp.         \"As Google became the gateway to the internet, it began to abuse its power,\" Cicilline said.    The CEO responded that Google aims to give users the information they're looking for \u2014 but he ducked some of the specific accusations.    For Facebook's Zuckerberg, the focus was on acquisitions, particularly the company's $1 billion deal for photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012.    Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., quoted the CEO his own email discussing the need to \"neutralize a competitor\" as part of the rationale for buying Instagram.    \"This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\" Nadler said.    Zuckerberg was also questioned about how Facebook used another app it bought to monitor what people were doing on their smartphones, in order to identify other apps to poach.    The CEO said there are many reasons he buys companies, arguing that eight years ago, when Facebook bought Instagram, \"it was far from obvious\" that Instagram would grow so large, saying Facebook's investment spurred the social media platform's success.    Apple's Cook, who received less attention than the other three CEOs, had to defend against charges that his company uses its App Store to punish rivals.         Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia cited Apple's decision to remove parental control apps, such as OurPact, shortly after Apple introduced Screen Time, a competing service.    \"We were concerned, congresswoman, about the privacy and security of kids,\" Cook said, noting that OurPact was vulnerable to third-party takeovers. \"So we were worried about their safety.\"    But McBath remained skeptical.    She pointed to an email in which an Apple employee responds to a mother complaining about the removal of parental control apps. The Apple representative suggested that the mother download Apple's Screen Time.    \"Even some of the largest companies in the country fear your power. Our evidence suggests that your company has used its power to harm your rivals and boost your own business,\" McBath said. \"This is fundamentally unfair,\" she said. \"Ultimately, it reduces the competition and the choices made to consumers and that's a great concern to all of us.\"    Republicans sidetrack hearing to air complaints over anti-conservative bias    Wednesday's hearing was supposed to be about Big Tech's power and market dominance. But Republicans made it about something else: accusations that online platforms are biased against conservatives.    \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, in his opening statement.    Jordan then rapidly read aloud headlines making claims that conservative-leaning publications and voices have been suppressed or censored on Facebook and Google.         \"We all think the free market is great. We think competition is great. We love the fact that these are American companies. But what's not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections,\" Jordan said. \"If it doesn't end, there has to be consequences.\"    Before Jordan's remarks, Wisconsin Republican Jim Sensenbrenner also mentioned the belief \u2014 strongly contested by large tech companies and unsupported by evidence \u2014 that conservatives do not get a fair shake from the online platforms, calling reports of conservative censorship \"seriously troubling.\"    \"Conservatives are consumers, too, and they need the protection of antitrust laws,\" Sensenbrenner said.    Missing from view? Zuckerberg's reaction    Wednesday's showdown was historic for bringing four of the most powerful men in technology before Congress for the first time.    In the case of Bezos, it was his Capitol Hill debut. But the hearing was also unprecedented in format. Because of the pandemic, the four CEOs, and some members, including judiciary committee chair Nadler, all called in via Cisco's Webex video conference.    That virtual format made for surreal imagery: the four titans projected on a giant screen in the hearing room, each man contained in his own video chat box as lawmakers looked on to a hearing room of mostly empty seats.    At one point, the chair called a 10-minute recess to fix a technical issue with Bezos's feed.    Turns out, even tech titans have IT problems.    It also drained the hearing of the kind of kinetic energy of having executives of some of the most influential companies in the world seated side by side. That would have provided a national audience with the chance to see the dynamic among the executives \u2014 who are not known to be particularly fond of one another \u2014 as well as gauge their body language and reactions to each others' testimony.    On Twitter, observers like Wall Street Journal reporter Deepa Seetharaman lamented not being able to see Zuckerberg's face when Bezos described social media as a \"nuance destruction machine.\"         Notably, the most dramatic moment came not in back and forths while lawmakers were questioning the CEOs, but when Jordan, in his usual sleeves-rolled-up bulldog style, got into a full-throated screaming match with Cicilline over his denied request to allow a lawmaker not on the judiciary committee to be able to ask questions.    \"We're talking about peoples' liberties here,\" Jordan bellowed over Cicilline.    \"Put your mask on,\" Jordan was told.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42718619639</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-45N1-F07F-8103-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>KUNM</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

landmark decisions this year, as governments across the world look to make tech giants and social networks more accountable.</p><p>The UK will decide whether to regulate the likes of Facebook - and if so, how - while an EU-wide crackdown on copyright material on the web could lead to videos being blocked on sites such as YouTube.</p><p>Social media regulation</p><p>The Government is set to publish a white paper in the winter that will outline new online safety laws.</p><p>A deadline to speed up the removal of harmful content on social media is among the legislative measures being considered by the Government in a bid to protect young people, Minister for Digital Margot James told the Science and Technology Committee in November, concluding evidence in its inquiry into the impact of social media.</p><p>The idea came from Germany's approach, which compels social networking sites to remove illegal content within 24 hours of it being reported, or face fines.</p><p>Tighter age restrictions</p><p>Access to pornography is another area the Government hopes to protect children from in 2019, with new age restrictions on porn websites set to arrive by Easter.</p><p>Tighter controls have been pushed back multiple times since the introduction of the 2017 Digital Economy Act.</p><p>One of the options being considered is issuing young people with a unique online ID, likened to a digital passport.</p><p>Digital copyright</p><p>The way music, memes and news articles are shared online could be affected by a new digital copyright law proposal from the EU.</p><p>YouTube has warned that viewers across the EU could be cut off from videos as a result of the controversial Article 13 copyright directive, which would force big tech firms to take responsibility for the copyright status of material posted by users.</p><p>Members of the European Parliament backed an overhaul to the current law in September, leaving each EU member state to make the final decision in a vote scheduled for January 2019.</p><p>Right to be forgotten</p><p>The so-called ``right to be forgotten'' could be rolled out further in 2019, with the European Court of Justice set to make a decision early in the year.</p><p>The right to be forgotten came about in 2014, after Spaniard Mario Costeja complained that out-of-date information about his financial circumstances should be taken down from Google's search engine.</p><p>The ruling only applied to the company's local sites in the EU, meaning other versions such as its American site Google.com, could still show the links.</p><p>Europe's top court will now decide whether Googleand others like it, such as Bing and Yahoo, should apply the right to be forgotten on all versions of its sites.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

INTERNET</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Harmful content and privacy are some of the issues that will be addressed by landmark decisions this year, as governments across the world look to make tech giants and social networks more accountable.</p><p>The UK will decide whether to regulate the likes of Facebook - and if so, how - while an EU-wide crackdown on copyright material on the web could lead to videos being blocked on sites such as YouTube.</p><p>Social media regulation</p><p>The Government is set to publish a white paper in the winter that will outline new online safety laws.</p><p>A deadline to speed up the removal of harmful content on social media was among legislative measures the Government was considering in a bid to protect young people, Minister for Digital Margot James told the Science and Technology Committee in November, as it concluded gathering evidence in its inquiry into the impact of social media.</p><p>The idea came from Germany's approach, which compels social networking sites to remove illegal content within 24 hours of it being reported, or face fines.</p><p>Tighter age restrictions</p><p>Access to pornography is another area the Government hopes to protect children from in 2019, with new age restrictions on porn websites set to arrive by Easter.</p><p>Tighter controls have been pushed back numerous times since the introduction of the 2017 Digital Economy Act.</p><p>One of the options being considered is issuing young people with a unique online ID, likened to a digital passport.</p><p>Digital copyright</p><p>The way music, memes and news articles are shared online could be affected by a new digital copyright law proposal from the EU.</p><p>YouTube has warned that viewers across the EU could be cut off from videos as a result of the controversial Article 13 copyright directive, which would force big tech firms to take responsibility for the copyright status of material posted by users.</p><p>Members of the European Parliament backed an overhaul to the current law in September, leaving each EU member state to make the final decision in a vote scheduled for January 2019 .</p><p>Right to be forgotten</p><p>The so-called \"right to be forgotten\" could be rolled out further in 2019, with the European Court of Justice set to make a decision early in the year.</p><p>The right to be forgotten came about in 2014, after Spaniard Mario Costeja complained that out-of-date information about his financial circumstances should be taken down from Google's search engine.</p><p>The ruling only applied to the company's local sites in the EU, meaning other versions such as its American site Google.com, could still show the links.</p><p> Europe's top court will now decide whether Google and others like it, such as Bing and Yahoo , should apply the right to be forgotten on all versions of its sites.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, Apple head Tim Cook, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai appeared via video conference before the committee. It was their first joint hearing and the first time Bezos ever appeared before lawmakers.  The companies were accused of stealing content, stifling competition and generally abusing their market dominance, including through acquisitions of rivals. Conservatives also argued their political views were being censored.  Congress can write anti-trust laws and there have been some calls for tougher regulations or even breaking up some of the companies. The Judiciary Committee would play a key role in shaping any legislation.  David Cicilline, the chairman of the subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee dealing with anti-trust, said some of the companies' practices have 'harmful economic effect' by hurting competition and innovation.  The chairman, a Democrat, alleged their market dominance was 'killing small businesses.'   Jim Jordan, an outspoken member of the Republican Party, accused the companies of censorship against political views on the right. 'Big tech is out to get conservatives.' This echoes accusations made by President Donald Trump.  Ahead of the hearing, Trump threatened to take executive action if lawmakers did not pass legislation.  'If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!' Trump said on Twitter.  The four companies are among the most valued in the world, with Apple alone having a market capitalization of about 1.6 trillion dollars.  Amazon was accused of hurting smaller retailers by being both a marketplace and a retailer itself, and using data from its own platform to hurt smaller businesses utilizing its platform.    When pressed, Bezos was unable to promise that the company does not exploit third-party seller data to aid Amazon's own sales, saying only that a policy was in place against the practice.  'But I can't guarantee you that policy has never been violated,' Bezos said.   The tough line of questioning from Pramila Jayapal, a congresswoman from the Seattle area where Amazon is based, was also directed at Facebook, as she probed Zuckerberg about whether he ever threatened smaller competitors with cloning their products.   'Congresswoman, I'm not sure what you would mean by threatened,' Zuckerberg responded.  Zuckerberg also faced questions on issues such as its purchase of Instagram, a rival social media platform, as he stood accused of reducing competition.  Google was grilled over how it presented search results to its own advantage and harvesting data from other sites to present as its own.  Apple faced less anger from lawmakers, but its App Store was also in focus, as it allegedly gives itself an advantage, forcing companies to use its payment system to net profits.   Cook denied Apple was a dominant market force, in line with the statements by all four of the executives.    The company representatives also answered questions about whether they would stamp out the use of forced labour in their supply chains, and all four said that they would terminate relationships with a partner company if it used such practices.

It was their first joint hearing and the first time Bezos ever appeared before lawmakers.The companies were accused of stealing content, stifling competition and generally abusing their market dominance, including through acquisitions of rivals. Conservatives also argued their political views were being censored.</p><p>Congress can write anti-trust laws and there have been some calls for tougher regulations or even breaking up some of the companies. The Judiciary Committee would play a key role in shaping any legislation.David Cicilline, the chairman of the subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee dealing with anti-trust, said some of the companies' practices have \"harmful economic effect\" by hurting competition and innovation.The chairman, a Democrat, alleged their market dominance was \"killing small businesses.\" Jim Jordan, an outspoken member of the Republican Party, accused the companies of censorship against political views on the right. \"Big tech is out to get conservatives.\" This echoes accusations made by President Donald Trump.</p><p>Ahead of the hearing, Trump threatened to take executive action if lawmakers did not pass legislation.\"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\" Trump said on Twitter.The four companies are among the most valued in the world, with Apple alone having a market capitalization of about 1.6 trillion dollars.</p><p>Amazon was accused of hurting smaller retailers by being both a marketplace and a retailer itself, and using data from its own platform to hurt smaller businesses utilizing its platform.</p><p>When pressed, Bezos was unable to promise that the company does not exploit third-party seller data to aid Amazon's own sales, saying only that a policy was in place against the practice.</p><p>\"But I can't guarantee you that policy has never been violated,\" Bezos said.</p><p>The tough line of questioning from Pramila Jayapal, a congresswoman from the Seattle area where Amazon is based, was also directed at Facebook, as she probed Zuckerberg about whether he ever threatened smaller competitors with cloning their products.</p><p>\"Congresswoman, I'm not sure what you would mean by threatened,\" Zuckerberg responded.Zuckerberg also faced questions on issues such as its purchase of Instagram, a rival social media platform, as he stood accused of reducing competition.</p><p>Google was grilled over how it presented search results to its own advantage and harvesting data from other sites to present as its own.</p><p>Apple faced less anger from lawmakers, but its App Store was also in focus, as it allegedly gives itself an advantage, forcing companies to use its payment system to net profits.</p><p>Cook denied Apple was a dominant market force, in line with the statements by all four of the executives.</p><p>The company representatives also answered questions about whether they would stamp out the use of forced labour in their supply chains, and all four said that they would terminate relationships with a partner company if it used such practices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>Editorial contactsEditing by: Annika Burgess, &lt;<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:international@dpa.com\">international@dpa.com</email>;</p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPA-20073099973536</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-PTC1-DXFJ-500B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144245</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><timeReceived>00:44:11+02:00Invalid date found for VDI: (VDI not available) XCEDOCID: 0 LNI: 60G4-PTC1-DXFJ-500B-00000-00.

Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, Apple head Tim Cook, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai appeared via video conference before the committee. It was their first joint hearing and the first time Bezos ever appeared before lawmakers.  The companies were accused of stealing content, stifling competition and generally abusing their market dominance, including through acquisitions of rivals. Conservatives also argued their political views were being censored.   David Cicilline, the chairman of the subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee dealing with anti-trust, said some of the companies' practices have 'harmful economic effect' by hurting competition and innovation.   The chairman, a Democrat, alleged their market dominance was 'killing small businesses.'   Jim Jordan, an outspoken member of the Republican Party, accused the companies of censorship against political views on the right. 'Big tech is out to get conservatives.' This echoes accusations made by President Donald Trump.  Ahead of the hearing, Trump threatened to take executive action if lawmakers did not pass legislation.  'If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!' Trump said on Twitter.  Zuckerberg faced tough questions on issues such as its purchase of Instagram, a rival social media platform, while Google was grilled over how it presented search results to its own advantage and harvesting data from other sites to present as its own.   Apple's App Store was also in focus, as it allegedly gives itself an advantage, forcing companies to use its payment system to net profits.   Meanwhile, Amazon is accused of hurting smaller retailers by being both a marketplace and a retailer itself, and using data from its own platform to hurt smaller businesses utilizing its platform.   The four companies are among the most valued in the world, with Apple alone having a market capitalization of about 1.6 trillion dollars.  Congress can write anti-trust laws and there have been some calls for tougher regulations or even breaking up some of the companies. The Judiciary Committee would play a key role in shaping any legislation.  Google, Apple and Amazon all release earnings reports on Thursday, while Facebook will do so after the closing bell on Wednesday.

Tech scandals and legislation like the European Union's General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have drawn attention from policymakers and the media, and it's easy to get caught up in the feeling that something must be done. Still, it is important to examine the potential implications of privacy rules before crafting a response to a perceived crisis.</p><p><br/>I recently analyzed several federal data privacy proposals from the last year and have also discussed the concerning potential impact of state data privacy proposals. These proposals are typically well-intentioned, and policymakers believe they are responding to constituent consumer needs. However, rather than rush to make policy that could change the permissionless nature of the internet, policymakers should take a step back and ask themselves a few questions.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. What problem are we actually trying to address and does this policy address it?</emphasis><br/>Too often, the data privacy debate gets mixed together with everyone's fears about technology or issues with \"Big Tech.\" Even when it comes to concerns about data privacy, it is not always clear that the proposed solutions actually address the problems or concerns or what the problems or concerns truly are. In the rush to prevent the next scandal, policies may either fail to address the actual concerns or be so broad in their definition of covered entities, data, or personal information that they could impact basically every aspect of the American economy.<br/>For example, many of the concerns involve the security of sensitive information such as credit card numbers or medical information. The concern is not in the initial transaction of that information, but rather in the data breach or lax data security that may expose it. Addressing broader data privacy does not always solve these more specific data security problems. As I mention below, existing laws already address many of these more sensitive areas.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. What tradeoffs would this involve for consumers, current companies, and future innovation?</emphasis><br/>Oftentimes, debates about data privacy get caught up in the broader \"techlash\" conversation. Many seem to see increasing data privacy requirements as a way to regulate big players like Facebook, Twitter, and Google.<br/>But such \"techlash\" is not clearly felt by most Americans and many enjoy exploring a variety of online options. Requiring certain data handling practices could eliminate options that consumers currently enjoy as well as future, better options. Data affects much more of the American economy than just tech giants, and many small businesses have expressed concerns about the potential impact of laws like the CCPA. Creating a restrictive regulatory environment could prevent new competitors from launching and providing new services with different privacy options. America's typically permissionless approach in this area is what has allowed new products that change our lives to start in dorm rooms or garages.<br/>The GDPR provides an example of how ex ante data regulation can affect small companies and new competitors. Several small companies from email management services to online games to certain newspapers chose to make their product unavailable in Europe rather than engage in the costly compliance or change their service offerings. When it comes to targeted advertising, large companies like Google and Facebook have been able to retain or even gain market share while the smaller players shrank.<br/>The potential tradeoffs are not just to innovation or options but potentially include rights such as free speech. For example, a \"right to be forgotten\" would be unlikely to translate into American notions of free speech as inevitably it would require silencing one person or entity's speech in favor of another's right to have such information removed. Policymakers should carefully consider how such rights might come into friction before assuming that a right to privacy should trump other potential concerns.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Do existing policies address the concerns or could they be updated to do so?</emphasis><br/>Contrary to what some might say, the United States is not without any laws governing data privacy. Much of the most sensitive personal information is already covered by specialized law. Financial information, health information, and children's privacy are already covered by federal laws that govern data.<br/>But it is not just federal laws that currently govern data privacy and related issues. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also used its existing authority to combat unfair and deceptive trade practices to handle data privacy and data security concerns. Since its first case against Geocities in the late 1990s, the FTC has brought over 65 cases involving personal consumer data.<br/>When it comes to concerns about data security and data breaches, states have also helped consumers make more informed decisions. Every state has a data breach notification law. While these laws vary in timeline and what information is covered, existing law in every state provides a framework for handling such concerns.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. What public entities are best suited to respond to these concerns? </emphasis><br/>States, Congress, and administrative agencies like the FTC are all grappling with what they should do to address concerns about data privacy. While there's immense pressure to \"do something,\" policymakers should also consider that their part of government ought to play.<br/>Beginning with California, several states have considered passing data privacy laws at a state level. But splintering the internet into different regulatory regimes could harm both current and future businesses on and offline and limit the options consumers have. Such laws would also likely raise constitutional concerns under the Dormant Commerce Clause.<br/>Another concern is how and when privacy rulemaking should be delegated to administrative agencies. A recent GAO report examined the advantages and disadvantages of delegating data privacy to the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), or a new agency entirely. My colleague Andrea O'Sullivan and I discussed this report and concluded that with its experience and consumer welfare focus the FTC is likely the best option.<br/>In any case, if Congress chooses to delegate data privacy issues to an agency, it should be specific in how it does so. Since digital data affects practically every industry from agriculture to the internet, an overly broad grant of authority could turn into a gigantic expansion of the administrative state and merely result in the creation of a heavily regulatory scheme by an agency rather than a legislature.<br/>Clearly, these are not the only questions or concerns that policymakers should consider, but hopefully they will encourage a thoughtful examination of the issues. The decisions made about data privacy will likely shape the future of many industries and should not be rushed into under duress.<br/>Photo credit: Alex Wong/Getty Images<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-60240</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0N-22X1-F03R-W0C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1178\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Mercatus Center At George Mason University</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And that means the biggest losers will be the folks who cash out now.<br/> This isn't just a wild guess on my part.<br/> In particular, there are four reasons why tech stocks - and biotech stocks[2] in particular - will do well in the final six months of the year. So today I'm going to show you why - before the midpoint hits - this is your best chance to position your portfolio... and cash in on that run.<br/> My analysis shows that four specific catalysts will keep tech stocks moving for the rest of this year. <br/> So let's jump right in...<br/>Tech Stocks Catalyst No. 1: The Mobile Wave<br/>The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) trade group just reported that worldwide microchip sales reached $78.47 billion during the first quarter - the industry's highest-ever result for the first three months of a year. Sales for March were up 16.1% in the Americas, and 11.4% globally, on a year-over-year basis.<br/> SEMI, the trade group representing the producers of chip-manufacturing gear, says equipment-makers signed $1.28 billion in orders in March, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06. That represents a year-over-year increase of 16.1%. <br/> Because wireless devices are growing in sophistication and are using more and more chips in each unit, mobile products like smartphones, tablets, and \"phablets\" will be a big driver here. And it's a multiyear driver: Sales of mobile/wireless products will power forward for at least the next three years, says market forecaster IDC.<br/> In fact, in a recent report, IDC estimated that global sales of smartphones hit 1 billion units last year. And it expects sales to hit 1.68 billion by the end of 2017, an increase of nearly 70%. <br/> The continued growth of the mobile wave will help keep semiconductor tech stocks thriving. As for the rest of the tech sector...<br/>Tech Stocks Catalyst No. 2: Merger Mania<br/>For the rest of 2014, I believe mergers and acquisitions (MA) also will help drive tech stocks higher. Silicon Valley firms are sitting on mountains of cash, meaning they can afford to snap up smaller firms possessing promising technology.<br/> So-called \"bolt-on\" deals allow the leaders to add product lines or markets while saving money by cutting redundant workers and offices. <br/> According to a recent Moody's Investors Service report, U.S. companies outside of finance were holding $1.64 trillion in cash at the end of 2013. That's up 12% from 2012, the previous record year.<br/>Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL[3]), Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG[4], GOOGL[5]), and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT[6]) top the list of cash-heavy companies.<br/> And that's why \"Big Tech\" is leading the deal wave. In recent weeks, for instance, Microsoft completed its acquisition of Nokia Corp.'s mobile manufacturing and services unit - a deal it views as key to its future. Apple, which bought nearly two dozen firms last year, just grabbed a startup that can extend smartphone battery life. And Google, which has been \"collecting\" robotics firms, just picked up a leading maker of drones.<br/> I expect this kind of deal making to continue for the rest of this year.<br/>Tech Stocks Catalyst No. 3: Biotech Blockbusters<br/>The urge to play \"Let's Make a Deal\" isn't limited to Big Tech. Big Pharma and biotech outfits will also be playing the MA game in the year's final six months. And that could help the biotech sector sort itself out after a bear market sell-off in the first part of 2014.<br/> For instance, as I wrote this, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE[7]) was still pursuing a $100 billion-plus merger with AstraZeneca PLC (NYSE ADR: AZN[8]). <br/> The recent retreat of biotech stocks from a blistering two-year rally really wasn't about fundamentals.<br/> It was about congressional meddling.<br/> In March, three congressmen told Gilead Sciences Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD[9]) Chief Executive Officer John C. Martin in a letter that the company's new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi was \"extraordinarily\" expensive.<br/> With a sticker price of $84,000 for a full regimen, Sovaldi may seem expensive at first blush. But compare that to the $250,000 cost of a liver transplant, and it's clear the drug is actually pretty cost-effective.<br/> Despite this congressional criticism, Sovaldi racked up a stunning $2.3 billion in first-quarter sales for Gilead. <br/> But the letter from Congress raised the specter of Washington interference and increased regulation. And that was enough to help shove biotech stocks off the cliff.<br/> The sell-off is now overdone, however. A new report from Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE ADR: CS[10]) shows that biotech stocks have been greatly oversold and are poised for a rebound.<br/>Tech Stocks Catalyst No. 4: The Graying of America<br/>The biggest reason for my optimistic view of tech is a surprisingly secular catalyst.<br/> I mean, just think about all those 401(k) accounts being opened and added to each day. <br/> In short, I'm talking about the fact that America keeps getting older.<br/> That means that rivers of cash, most of it retirement money, continues to flow into the stock market, including dozens of top tech stocks.<br/> Just look at the data compiled by Aon Hewitt, a management consultancy that tracks retirement data for 1.3 million people at large corporations. In a recent report, Aon Hewitt found that the portion of new retirement money being invested in stocks has risen to 67%.<br/> Let's put that figure in perspective. In February 2009, just about a month before the bull market began, only 48% of 401(k)s were devoted to stocks. That means long-term stock investing has increased by about 40% in just five years.<br/> And at the end of 2013, the most recent data available, there was at least $5.9 trillion in 401(k) accounts, according to the Investment Company Institute. The trade group says IRA accounts represent an additional $6.5 trillion.<br/> In other words, Americans already have nearly $12.5 trillion socked away in long-term accounts - most of it devoted to stocks.<br/> The steady growth in retirement saving means more and more money is moving into stocks every single day. And that's one reason why - despite sluggish economic growth - the market keeps hitting record highs. <br/> Taken together, these four catalysts should fuel a hefty rebound in U.S.-listed tech stocks in the second half of this year.<br/> How much of your portfolio is devoted to tech stocks?

Today, in an early morning SXSW talk, Crowley tacked hard questions around ethics, privacy, data collection, and regulation, thanks largely to constant prodding from CNN s Laurie Segall. Crowley says that companies like Google and Facebook   alongside the thousands of smaller, more unsavory data collectors and brokers   are going to have reckon with potential regulatory changes and a sharp shift in the public s attitude toward ad targeting and data privacy.</p><p> We think a lot about what future legislation will look like, specifically for location technologies,  Crowley says.  There s a spectrum for this stuff. There s apps that collect a ton of location even about individuals and will sell that to anyone. And they re probably companies you ve never heard of and they don t want you to know their name. </p><p>The tide is starting to turn against big tech companies</p><p>But even for the big giants like Facebook and Google, Crowley says there s going to be hard discussions about whether the ad-based, data-hungry business models that support the most popular tech products on the planet are sustainable.  You could certainly make the argument that companies have gone too far by collecting everything and giving you only a little nugget of value back,  Crowley said.  Who s getting more value out of Facebook? Me using it for free or me paying $5 a month or $10 a month? I do think that as a lot of this stuff starts to become more understood by consumers in general that there s going to be a move toward those [paid] experiences in the future. </p><p>It s been only a a day since Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18256032/elizabeth-warren-antitrust-google-amazon-facebook-break-up\">announced she plans to try and break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook</url>, which itself occurred just a day after       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18253458/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-privacy-encrypted-messaging-whatsapp-messenger-instagram\">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg s stunning announcement</url> that his company will shift to a privacy-focused communications platform that prioritizes encryption and ephemeral messaging. But those two events have had a massive impact on the theme of this year s SXSW. And that theme is already taking shape as a tough debate about how tech companies will react and change now that Washington and the public are beginning to reject the dominant business models of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Crowley often avoided directly criticizing Google or Facebook; he sold his first startup, Dodgeball, to Google (an experience he nonetheless characterizes as  not super fun ) and says he has  great respect  for what both companies have built. But at times he was willing to voice some direct challenges to those companies  ethical stances.  Google has a map of the world and Facebook has a map of the world and Apple has a map of the world,  Crowley says, speaking about Foursquare s role these days as an enterprise location services provider for other companies.  And there are a lot of companies that don t want to work with Google, Facebook, or Apple because those companies are trying to put them out of business. Someone wants a data provider, but not one of the big three. </p><p>Crowley, as the co-founder of Foursquare and once its chief executive for seven years before handing over the role to current CEO Jeff Glueck, is one of the few tech executives that can speak about data collection without fear of being called a hypocrite. As Glueck <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18231985/foursquare-user-data-ceo-jeff-glueck-vergecast#comments\">told The Verge in a recent interview</url>, Foursquare refuses to sell customer data, despite multiple multi-million dollar offers from big companies that want access to users  real-world habits.</p><p>In fact, you could argue that Foursquare, which still employs only around 300 people, failed to expand to the scope of other social networks in part because of its approach to data privacy. Crowley has always made Foursquare s location features transparent and opt-in, and the location platform it now provides to other companies uses only anonymized, aggregated data.</p><p>Naturally, that approach hasn t always translated to success for Foursquare, especially as competing companies like Facebook and Google integrated location features and made individualized ad targeting the backbone of the modern web. Over the years, Foursquare has shifted its model away from consumer apps and toward enterprise products for businesses to make use of large, aggregated location. As a result, the company split the original Foursquare into Swarm and City Guides <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5666062/foursquare-swarm-new-app\">roughly five years ago</url>, and consumers largely abandoned both as the concept of the check-in lost its appeal.</p><p> We can watch Twitter and Facebook and say,  Let s do the opposite of what we re doing.  </p><p>That puts Crowley in the unique position today of being able to criticize fellow tech executives for creating an industry culture that devalues user privacy and prioritizes data collection at all costs.  There s always requests like,  Hey Foursquare, can you give me all of your data and we can ingest it and figure out what to do with it?   Crowley says.  No, that s not what we re about. If there s any moment where we do something crappy or disrespectful or sketchy  users will call you out and employees will call you out. We can watch the lessons that Twitter, Facebook, and others struggle with, and say,  Let s do the opposite of what we re doing.  </p><p>Still, as a provider of location services to everyone from Uber and Snapchat to Twitter and Samsung, Foursquare sits uncomfortably within an industry that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17141266/facebook-cambridge-analytica-user-data-donald-trump-campaign-2016-election\">routinely flouts ethical practices around data privacy and collection</url>. As       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html\">The New York Times pointed out in an investigation last December</url>, the market for advertising based on location data scarped from mobile apps and native services on smartphones has ballooned to an estimated $21 billion. And, as the report makes clear, that market exists as a largely unnoticed sector of the tech and marketing economies as companies fail to disclose what they re doing with the data or how often it is collected.</p><p>Crowley is optimistic that whatever shape the regulations take, companies like Foursquare will be able to make a pitch for more ethical data collection.  We re going to have that opportunity to go to Washington and say this is what s right and this is what s wrong,  he says.  Ten years into Foursquare, we have this opportunity to shape the future. We get invited to these rooms to help people figure out what the law should be going forward that determines what the law should be going forward. That s a big opportunity. </p><p>Tags: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Website:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257541/foursquare-dennis-crowley-data-collection-facebook-google-regulation-sxsw-2019\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257541/foursquare-dennis-crowley-data-collection-facebook-google-regulation-sxsw-2019</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Nick Statt<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecomp1296283</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM6-MMR1-JCTB-F47V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1247\"/><timeReceived>3:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Here's what's coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Four CEO's of tech giants worth $5 trillion face a reckoning via Zoom in Washington today. I ask critics inside and outside the industry, should Congress rein in their massive power?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then, as the world reckons with the murder of George Floyd, Netflix comedy star, Fary, confronts a self-proclaimed color-blind culture in France.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And later --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARL ZIMMER, SCIENCE WRITER, NEW YORK TIMES: It's conceivable, and I say conceivable, that AstraZeneca might be making emergency authorized supplies of the vaccine in October.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Vaccine tracker, Carl Zimmer, updates us on the state of play in the unprecedented global race for a coronavirus cure.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour working from home in London.</p><p>The explosive growth of the tech industry is a great American success story. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google create hundreds of thousands of jobs and rake in trillions of dollars around the world. But today, for the first time, tech titans are zooming together with Congress, which is asking is big tech just too big? David Cicilline, chair of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, laid out his concerns about their overwhelming power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Their ability to dictate terms, call the shots, upend entire sectors and inspire fear represent the powers of a private government. Our founders would not bow before a king, nor should we bow before the emperors of online economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: And are these so-called emperors stifling competition, exploiting workers and abusing our most personal data in their pursuit of global dominance? For their part, the four CEOs, Sundar Pichai of Google, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, argue their platforms enhanced competition, driving innovation while also helping small businesses grow.</p><p>Still, there hasn't been an industry reckoning like this since big tobacco bosses were hold on the carpet back in 1994. And today's blockbuster hearing could mark the end of unregulated growth for the tech sector.</p><p>Shoshana Zuboff, one of the first tenured women professors at Harvard Business School is the author and scholar who predicted decades ago the enormous impact that computers would have on all of our lives.</p><p>Her latest book is \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism.\" And Tim Bray is a leading software developer who recently resigned a senior post at Amazon over what he calls a vein of toxicity running through that company culture.</p><p>Welcome both of you to the program.</p><p>So, Tim, since you, you know, have just resigned from Amazon, let me ask you first -- but I want both of you to reflect on what you've heard so far during the hearings and whether this is the reckoning that is intended. Tim, first to you.</p><p>TIM BRAY, FORMER AMAZON VICE PRESIDENT: Well, I have to say, I'm glad they're happening and the opening statements by the ranking -- the Congress people on the committee were mature, grown-up, serious, I thought, and very pleasing. It seems like they're taking an adult and considerate approach to this.</p><p>A couple things stand out. One is that Microsoft isn't there. That seems weird to me. The second is, one thing that just stuck out to me is that Representative Sensenbrenner spoke of America's consumers and conservatives are consumers too.</p><p>And that attitude troubles me a bit. Would I hope that Americans are more than just consumers, they are citizens, is they are creators, they are more interesting than that. Having said that, I have some optimism the committee hearings will move the needle in a positive direction.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, Shoshana, you've been writing about this for a long time and studying it for decades, as we said. Do you share the optimism that it could move the needle? And I guess, do you share the idea, the question, the fundamental question, that this tech sector is just too big?</p><p>SHOSHANA ZUBOFF, AUTHOR, \"THE AGE OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM\": Well, I'm glad you started off with that introduction from Congressman Cicilline. When I heard it, I was scribbling down those same words, emperors of the online economy.</p><p>[17:05:00]</p><p>So, here's the good news and the bad news, are they emperors? Yes. They are the emperors of surveillance empires that exercise total control over the world's information. Unfortunately, none of that is an overstatement. Where Congressman Cicilline understates is that this is no longer constrained to the online economy. That might have been a true statement 10 years ago.</p><p>Right now, the surveillance economics that has made these once-fledgling start-ups into huge surveillance empires in just 20 years, they are -- they have this surveillance economic logic has gone way beyond the online world, way beyond the tech sector and essentially now is dominating every domain of the conventional economy to such an extent that these empires have indeed become audacious.</p><p>And their long game, as I really believe it to be from all of these years of study, is that they see themselves going head to head with democracy, undermining and trampling individual rights and creating a society based on such an extreme concentration of knowledge and the unaccountable power that goes with that knowledge, that it is simply no longer consistent with the aims of a democratic society. That -- undertaking that challenge, can we create a digital future that is safe for democracy? That's the work that begins today, but it will not end today.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, that is a very dramatic and clearly framed argument against the size and the power of these tech -- the big tech four. Tim Bray, you recently, as I said, resigned, you've written an op-ed about it, you've been interviewed about it. You called it a toxic culture running through Amazon.</p><p>What is the fundamental fear that you have? I mean, colliding with democracy, undermining, you know, the system. Do you think -- do you agree that it's that toxic, and do you think there's a hope in heck that this antitrust issue can be brought? In other words, can they be broken up?</p><p>BRAY: Well, I would certainly hope so. The classic pattern in antitrust is that some companies stumbles into a source of extreme profit. For example, in Google's case it's web search advertising, which is insanely profitable, and then uses that fountain of cash to invade multiple other sectors and impose unfair competition on anybody else trying to be in that sector.</p><p>Another consequence of this is such companies grow very, very large, and as they grow large, their voice grows louder and the amount of power they exercise in the hallways of Washington, where we're watching that hearing, becomes unreasonable. And I think -- you know, my particular issue is with Amazon but I think the notion that there is a completely unreasonable imbalance of wealth and power, not just in the big tech sector but across the economy, is approaching emergency status.</p><p>People feel like, you know, they don't count because people like -- the people who are on display in the committee hearing today are occupying more and more and more of the atmosphere. Big -- too big is just a problem at one point, and when you have concentrated ownership of highly profitable businesses, free markets can't possibly work properly.</p><p>So, yes, something has to be done and I think it's perfectly possible to take a reasonably simple legislative approach to stamp out some of the problems that exist today.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Can I ask you specifically about your issue, you resigned over the way some workers were treated and fired because of complaining about certain conditions. And, again, we see even as these hearings are under way, Amazon is in talks with supermarkets or trying to sort of, you know, get into the supermarket business here in the U.K. by offering free grocery deliveries and things like that. It's still competing in -- as it's undergoing these hearings. Just quickly about what is the specific issue that you have with Amazon and why you resigned.</p><p>BRAY: Well, the specific issue I had was that there was a debate going on as to whether Amazon was taking adequately good care of the warehouse workers during the time of COVID, and a reasonable debate to have, and there were a certain number of activists inside the company who were arguing that, no, Amazon wasn't. And Amazon responded to that by firing them, which struck me as unethical and unacceptable and also not very smart. And for that reason, I left.</p><p>[17:10:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR: Shoshana, let me just turn to you and just summarize some of the main bullet points of the sort of accusations or the problems that Congress says it has with these companies.</p><p>So, Facebook and Google, or Alphabet, the parent company, accusations that they have grown into dominant monopolies, Facebook on social media, Google online search, as you mentioned, by squeezing out or buying up their rivals. Apple and Amazon, as we briefly touched on, Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook, will face a similar line of questioning, whether they're abusing the enormous power they have as gatekeepers of their marketplaces.</p><p>So, they're distinct cases, four distinct companies. Are there remedies or what are the remedies that you see, Shoshana, that can apply to each one of them?</p><p>ZUBOFF: Well, Christiane, let me just squinch in a little message to Tim. Go, Tim. I'm really proud of Tim and the integrity of his decision, and I suspect there are going to be many more people like Tim who find the moral gap between how these operations work and what democracy requires. That gap is just going to become intolerable.</p><p>As far as how do antitrust, the tools that antitrust lawyers and lawmakers have to address the harms in these companies, that to me is a matter of some concern. Right in the opening statements, we heard Congressman Cicilline go after the fact that the companies are surveying, they're taking our data.</p><p>In fact, these companies have become trillion-dollar empires because they steal our private experience. They turn it into data. They analyze it. They produce it. They sell it. That is what accounts for the lion's share of their massive market capitalization. This is a fundamental, illegitimacy at the bedrock of the business model of these companies.</p><p>And if we break them up, let's say we are able to, you know, pull back out Instagram and WhatsApp from Facebook, let's say we're able to shave off some of those subsidiaries of Alphabet, let's say we're able to break up AWS, Amazon's cloud business and its retail business, the fact of the matter is, Christiane, that simply breaking them up is not going to address the toxic surveillance, pervasive surveillance that is produced by these companies and the way in which it undermines democracies, nor is it going to address the really dangerous and unjust employment practices that Tim is responding to. Not only in the warehouses of Amazon but really across these companies.</p><p>We've seen Google employees be fired for their protests. We've seen Facebook employees be separated for their dissent and their protests. And so, these are the deeper issues. Simple way to think about it, when you think about antitrust, you think about the size of a company breaking it up, monopoly.</p><p>That's the container, that's the box, the size. Most of the things we're talking about and many of the things that the congressmen spoke to their introduction are not about the container, they're about the contents of the container, the methods, the mechanisms, the policies, the actual way these companies make money.</p><p>And unless we go in there and break up their ability to corner data flows of human-generated information, their ability to corner, to own the infrastructures, the machines, all of the data centers, the servers, the undersea cables, they own all of this.</p><p>And thirdly, they essentially have a law on the vast majority of professionals who exist on planet earth right now who are specialists in data science and behavioral research, who make the A.I. go. They know how to turn all of those data flows into something meaningful and monetizable.</p><p>These four companies have a lock on all of this infrastructure and personnel and data flows. Breaking them up is not going to disturb that. We've got to get inside the box and understand these are unique 21st century challenges that will not be fixed by 20th century law.</p><p>[17:15:00]</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let's take this big example of Facebook. Let me ask you, Tim, Shoshana says it won't be fixed by the 21st century laws. So, how will it be fixed? But let me just put you this, obviously Facebook, some 3 billion people use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, which are all owned by Facebook, or Messenger, at least once a month.</p><p>That's obviously bigger than any religion. It's the principal source for so many people and, you know, bigger than the combined population of the U.S. and China. It's huge, huge, huge, the power.</p><p>And, you know, Mark Zuckerberg, Zuckerberg has been sort of the boogie boy of a lot of criticism over Facebook, what many people, including Congress and all sorts of other investigations, says something of a maligned influence in many, many, many domains. He obviously pushes back.</p><p>You know, do you -- what is your -- what would be your solution to rein in not just the surveillance capital of a Facebook but the complete and total dominance?</p><p>BRAY: Well, let's ask ourselves why they're engaging in surveillance capitalism and applying an all technologies and so on to using it, artificial intelligence technologies? And the answer sadly is to be more effective at selling ads. And One of the monopolies that most strongly concerns me is the joint duopoly that Google and Facebook have over the advertising technology and advertising marketplace.</p><p>This is immediately, directly and seriously damaging our intellectual landscape because of the many ad-supported publications that are going out of business because Google and Facebook have figured out how to be so effective at accumulating data and using it to sell ads, that, you know, if you have a really interesting site directed at some particular interest, you're probably not going to be able to pay the rent by selling ads. This is terribly damaging and it needs to be fixed.</p><p>And on this particular case, I agree with Shoshana, you know, breaking them up isn't enough. We need some radical reforms of advertising technology. I don't want to get all geeky here, but there are things called cookies and third-parties and so on, and they are being egregiously horribly abused at the moment in a way that's very destructive to our society.</p><p>And yes, once -- I still think we should break the companies up. But once we've done that, we need to get in there and, in particular, do radical reforms of the advertising marketplace.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, just to drill down a little bit more, obviously Facebook is, you know, very concerning because of its power and what other investigations have said, you know, the power to disrupt elections inspires sort of, you know, sometimes deadly hate campaigns and places, whether it's, I don't know, Myanmar, India and the like.</p><p>And by the way, as you know better than I do, Facebook and Google are pouring billions right now today into India, where they think they'll have another, you know, several hundred million consumers. But here's what was written about, you know, how it distorts issues like Black Lives Matter here in \"The New York Times,\" social media once functioned as a tool for the oppressed, in Tahrir Square, in Cairo, Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore, activists used Twitter and Facebook to organize demonstrations and get their messages out. In recent years a right-wing reactionary movement that's turned the tie.</p><p>Now, some of the loudest and most established voices on these platforms belong to conservative commentators and paid provocateurs whose aim is mocking and subverting social justice movements. The result is a distorted view of the world that is at odds with actual public sentiment. And, you know, the majority of -- for instance, the majority of Americans say they support the Black Lives Matter Movement.</p><p>So, Shoshana, you know, like you have already seen some and you mentioned it, one of the representatives on this panel is already complaining that, you know, it's actually -- you know, they're making it political, like their side or the conservative side is being unfairly targeted. How do you even get to, you know, a real-world regulation of this if it's all mixed up in political sort of victimhood?</p><p>ZUBOFF: Well, these are political questions, there's no doubt about that. But the -- there's so much confusion, Christiane, about what is cause and what is effect. And so, this is something Tim was starting to get at.</p><p>When we talk about disinformation or we talk about, you know, the amplification of hate and incendiary messaging, this is an effect, this is not a cause. It's not a thing in itself. What is it an effect of? It's an effect of an economic logic that wants to maximize data flows through the supply chains of these empires.</p><p>[17:20:00]</p><p>So, every single interface that you have with the internet, whether it's your smartphone or you pass a sensor when you walk through the park or the camera that's in the cafe where you're having a cappuccino or the stuff that you've bought because you didn't really know what it was up to that you put all over your house, all of these things now are interfaces for the supply chains that take from your experience, turn it into data, and drive it into the A.I.s of these companies.</p><p>So, what they absolutely have to do is they have to maximize those flows. A.I. needs a lot of data. And so, every algorithm that works inside of these operations is there to maximize what they euphemistically call engagement to make it sticky so that you go back and you do more and you spend more time and you press more keys, or you use it to go to other sites or you use it even to change what you do in your offline behavior to join a group, to go to a meeting.</p><p>Now, all of that is -- every single thing that you do in relation to these interfaces is driving data, and what happens is that if you run into something that's really, you know, provocative, it's like you're driving down the highway, you pass a beautiful elm tree, you keep driving, you keep driving down the highway and you pass a car wreck, you slow down and the whole field slows down. That's what disinformation is. That's what hate speech is. People slow down. They engage more. They are drawn to it. That's the way it works.</p><p>And when we say about Facebook or Google or any of these companies, it's just business, it's just a business decision, it's true, it is a business decision. In the case of Facebook, choosing not to regulate political ads when they're full of blatant lies, blatant mistruths, that's a business decision that also conveniently dovetails with a political decision. Because they're trying -- they have been trying for these last years to be friends with the Trump administration for one simple reason, the only way that these little companies turned into empires in a brief 20 years, two decades, is that there has been no body of law to impede them.</p><p>Partially, because lawmakers didn't understand what really goes on inside these companies, but also because lawmakers, starting with 9/11, had a vested interest in having access to the data that these companies were producing. We have lasted for 20 years kind of democracy being asleep at the switch, watching these companies become hugely dangerous, threatening empires as Congressman Cicilline implies.</p><p>And what's great about today, whatever this committee accomplishes, what's great about today is that this is the beginning, not the end, of what promises to be a long and bitter decade-long struggle over whether or not democracy can reassert control over the digital future. That's where we are right now.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Shoshana Zuboff, Tim Bray, thank you very, very much indeed and we will keep monitoring this needle and the direction it's moving in.</p><p>Now, the murder of George Floyd sparked a wave of demonstrations and reflection on race across the whole world, including in France where protests challenged the culture's idea of itself as color-blind, where everyone is French and no one is black, brown, Asian or white. Which is where the comedian, Fary, comes in. He's become a global phenomenon, star of Netflix's first French comedy special. He sparked a standup renaissance at home in Paris. Take a look at this clip from his latest Netflix special \"Hexagone.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FARY, FRENCH COMEDIAN (through translator): I think that I really become French last summer in New York. Because -- can I finish? OK. I don't know if you've been to New York, but when I was over there, it really brought out the Frenchman in me, especially my Parisian side.</p><p>[17:25:00]</p><p>It was weird being over there as a French guy, because people you don't know in the street, like talk to you. For no reason. I'm sorry, but we, the French, especially us Parisians, admittedly, we need a real reason to talk to someone we don't know.</p><p>Really. To us, it's very simple, you don't know me? Don't talk to me. Don't. Sometimes, even if you do know me. Sometimes, you're with a friend in the street, like, I work with that guys. Look down so he won't see me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Fary, welcome to the program now from Paris.</p><p>So, before we get into --</p><p>FARY, FRENCH COMEDIAN: Hello.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- your shows and talk more about them, I just want to ask you what you are -- how you are understanding in participating perhaps in some of the demonstrations, some of the protests and whether do you see any kind of link between racism in the U.S. and in France?</p><p>FARY: I think -- first of all, I think racism is racism all over the world. That's the thing about not countries but about white privilege. So, we're basically the same. And we did protest here because we also have violence, police violence against racial people.</p><p>And so, they often said here in television that U.S. and French it's very different but it's the same thing, because, you know, there's also some violence by police officers because you're black. And we had Adama Traore who died exactly the same way George Floyd died, but it was like four years ago and nobody goes to jail until today. So, I think that's a global issue and it's about rethink the way we are, about the way we look.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let me ask you because you've got a lot of these specials which are creating hits and causing -- you know, really popular around the world. In \"Fary Is the New Black,\" as one of them is called, you say there are words that French people are scared of. You give an example of white people being scared to say the word noir, which is black in French, obviously. They say black in English instead.</p><p>FARY: Yes, yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And as we know, in 2018, your national assembly removed the word race from the first article of its constitution. Can you explain to an audience why the system is so wary, so reluctant to talk about black, brown, white, you know, Asian? Everybody's meant to be just French in France.</p><p>FARY: That's a French culture. It's (INAUDIBLE) because they think we should act and be the same way, and also, I think they're afraid about saying those words because behind those words, there's issues and subjects about it. If we say black like the French word, that's a big word to them because it was, back then, an insult. When you say someone is black, it was something insulting.</p><p>And so, they have to rethink and -- they have to tell the story again because we -- the story they told us, that's not the story we should listen to when we are a child. And I think that's a big issue for them. Because black, it's -- when they say they exist, they're a community, that's a threat for us, for everyone in France because we want to see French as just one people.</p><p>And there's two ways of thinking, that they think it's opposite, but it's not. We can have community and we can have people who act like just one people. So, they think if we have a community, it's something dangerous, which I think it's wrong.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You know, that's really interesting actually because everybody wants to claim identity. And, you know, some people say that if you just talk about being color-blind, you don't value and you don't see different identities. And I think that's what you're saying right now about your own communities.</p><p>[17:30:00]</p><p>Last year, you caused quite a stir when you greeted the audience at the Moliere theater awards, which is like the Tonys in America.</p><p>You said: \"Hello, white people.\"</p><p>And on national radio, you have said France is not anti-racist. You said, you know, \"Tell the truth, I was born here,\" but you're still terrified. And you have gone viral with those clips online.</p><p>What is your particular experience? What is the effect -- despite the universalism that France adheres to, what is the effect on your real life and your colleagues and friends' real life?</p><p>FARY: I think, here in France, I'm still a young comedian, and I think that's also because of my skin color.</p><p>And I think that's what I was saying at the Moliere. I think white people is also a community. And they don't talk about it. It's like there is the normal way and there's the others. And that's what I wanted to say when I came and said, \"Hello, white people.\"</p><p>It's like, we see you doing your stuff just between you. So I think if -- that's something I don't say often, but I still think, if I wasn't black, I would be treated in another way.</p><p>That's -- we were talking about this. When you asked for an interview, you said, you wanted to talk about the amazing career. That's the words we read, the amazing career I had. And I was very surprised, because that's someone from another country who is just seeing that I have a career.</p><p>And here in France, I'm still seen like a young comedian. And I did a lot of things. So, that's my way of experimenting. But I think people in their lives, in real lives, I think I have not a real life, because I'm an artist, but, yes, they have struggled to just go forward in their lives, because they are seeing, like, just a black one, before being a people.</p><p>So, whenever you want a flag, whenever you want a job, it's way harder than everyone else. And that's the true thing. And people don't want to see that. People don't want to see that we need people that looks like us, so we can see and say and think that we can do other things than rappers or soccer players or selling drugs.</p><p>That's something we need. And I don't see young black people who want to be lawyer or doctors. And that's a shame.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You know, it's really poignant, what you said there. We should be looked at as people who are not just X, Y or Z.</p><p>But you know that, obviously, in 2005, there were riots after two young boys were killed when they ran away from police and they were executed. And then a few years later, and, twice, we have had, you know, majority black, your national football team winning in '98, and I guess whenever it was, 2018 or whatever.</p><p>FARY: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And Zidane, who was so famous, and then Kylian Mbappe in the latest World Cup.</p><p>FARY: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And the whole world comes together to celebrate that.</p><p>Is there a -- do you feel there's sort of a -- I don't know. Is it real? Is it slightly hypocritical? How do you feel about that?</p><p>FARY: No, because soccer is like -- it's the same thing than rap. It's -- we can do that. That's not a problem for them. That's not a danger.</p><p>So, they can accept the national team is -- there is black people in it, because we win. So, obviously, that's something acceptable. But it's like I just said. Yes, people, they don't want to see us -- we don't see us as something -- I'm not saying soccer player is not a good thing, but something higher than that.</p><p>And that's -- when we go and protest about police officer, the president said that there's no discussion, because they use the word (SPEAKING FRENCH). That's like we're a kind of power, like a secret power.</p><p>[17:35:12]</p><p>And that's not even a discussion with the police officers, because they -- after the protesting, they started to protest, the police officers, like if they were the victim. And people are the victim all day long.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>FARY: They can protest for something. That is true that everybody sees.</p><p>And that's a way of thinking in police here in France, because they see black people and Arab people like a threat.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>FARY: And that's the way they talk. There's not -- when we win the world championship, that's just an event. That's just a party.</p><p>There's just like the new eve. OK, that's not real life. That's like a movie.</p><p>AMANPOUR: New Year's Eve, yes.</p><p>FARY: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I hear you.</p><p>Let me play another one of your clips from your -- from the program in June. It's about called \"Facies.\" And it's about names and faces.</p><p>I just want to -- and it's sort of about what you're talking about now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FARY (through translator): So, let's say I'm changing my first name. Would it make you look past the fact that I'm not as fair-skinned as other names</p><p>Like, if I get a whiter French name, what's the idea? That I'll whiten over time? Oh, sure, you don't even see color. You have a friend of a friend who is even blacker than an Arab. Sorry.</p><p>If I was Asian and I changed my name, would that be easier for you to pronounce than rice paddy? What if I move somewhere else? Do I have to change again? Is there like a clever bland name that can bypass your anger?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Fary, you said rice paddy. It refers to a French politician who calls his aide rice paddy.</p><p>I want you to know. Your comedy is very sharp. It's very pointed. Do you have hope that this moment might change certain things, even in universalist France?</p><p>FARY: I don't think I will see it. I think maybe our child's child, maybe they will see it.</p><p>But I don't have good hope about it, because people don't even -- the president -- don't even see it as a subject, not a topic for them, because it's like we always are playing as victim. We are not. And we are victims.</p><p>I am not, but I'm representing victims. And they don't think that's a real subject, because they don't talk about, let's remove the bad police officer, let's change the way police see Arab and black people. Let's change the way they communicate with people.</p><p>They should change all the things. And they're afraid of it because it's political. That's just politics, because they don't have...</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right.</p><p>FARY: They -- that's not good for them to change everything because of votes. That's always the same thing.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, Fary, thank you so much for bringing your comedy and for your pointed communication, particularly at this time.</p><p>FARY: Thank you. That was not that funny, but...</p><p>AMANPOUR: And everybody can see your specials on Netflix.</p><p>FARY: Thank you so much.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, it will be, if people get to see the whole -- all of them on Netflix and in real life. Thank you.</p><p>Now, with coronavirus spiking around the world amid easing lockdowns, all the more need for that coronavirus vaccine. In the global scientific rush, Russia is the latest, saying its vaccine will soon be approved, although no testing data has been released amid concerns about cutting corners.</p><p>Right now, there are more than 165 vaccines in development, and 27 are in human trials.</p><p>Carl Zimmer is an award-winning science writer with a weekly column in \"The New York Times.\"</p><p>Here he is breaking down the biology with our Walter Isaacson.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALTER ISAACSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Christiane.</p><p>And, Carl Zimmer, welcome to the show.</p><p>CARL ZIMMER, COLUMNIST, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Thanks for having me.</p><p>ISAACSON: It's been an amazing past seven days or so for vaccine, which is what we hope will all save us soon.</p><p>And with your vaccine tracker in \"The New York Times,\" you have done a wonderful job tracking them. Why don't we start with the one that I think may be furthest along, which is the Oxford vaccine?</p><p>[17:40:09]</p><p>Explain to us where that is in phase three trials, and how that actually works. It's a traditional vaccine.</p><p>ZIMMER: So, Oxford University has a vaccine which they are testing out with AstraZeneca, the drugmaker.</p><p>And, basically, what it is, is, it's a virus that delivers a gene into your cells. So, this particular kind of virus only affects chimpanzees. And so the thinking is that people have not been exposed to this before, so it will be effective for getting into cells.</p><p>It can't replicate, though. These kinds of viral vectors are actually engineered so all they do is just deliver a gene into your cells.</p><p>ISAACSON: So, when it delivers a gene into the cell, what does the gene do?</p><p>ZIMMER: Well, your cell looks at that gene like any other gene and makes a protein. And this protein happens to be one of the proteins made by the coronavirus.</p><p>And so when your immune system sees it, the hope is it makes lots of antibodies that can then go after the real coronavirus, if you should get sick.</p><p>ISAACSON: Most of the proteins being made by any of these vaccines try to mimic the spike protein, right, on the surface of the coronavirus. Why is that?</p><p>ZIMMER: So, the coronavirus has this sort of halo of proteins, and these are called spike, as you say.</p><p>And they use this protein to latch on to cells that in our nose or airway and then invade the cell. So, this seems to be the best target for our immune system.</p><p>So, people who get sick with the coronavirus and then get better, the reason for that is their immune system figures out basically how to go after that spike protein, so the virus just can't get into cells in the first place.</p><p>ISAACSON: So this Oxford vaccine is in phase three trials. Tell me where it stands, and when we might get results.</p><p>ZIMMER: So, this has been going in phase three trials for a couple weeks now, a few weeks now, in several countries such as Brazil.</p><p>And it -- we will have to wait and see. In a couple of months maybe, we might start hearing about results. It really depends on how many people are being exposed to the virus in these different countries. They really don't have that much control over how long it takes before they start to see good results.</p><p>ISAACSON: So, maybe September, maybe October, we will start getting the first set of results?</p><p>ZIMMER: It's conceivable, and I say conceivable, that AstraZeneca might be making emergency authorized supplies of the vaccine in October. That's conceivable.</p><p>ISAACSON: Wow.</p><p>ZIMMER: Could be longer.</p><p>ISAACSON: Now, the other two vaccines that in the past week went into phase three trials are one by Moderna, and the other, I think Pfizer is taking the lead on it, maybe with BioNTech.</p><p>And they do something different. They take a piece of messenger RNA and inject it into your cells. Explain to me why that's different and why it might be better.</p><p>ZIMMER: So, the idea there is that -- just to remind everybody of their high school biology, in order to turn a gene into a protein, first, you -- your cell copies your gene into a piece of what's called messenger RNA.</p><p>And that then is used by your cells to make protein. So these researchers at Moderna, at Pfizer have been trying out just making a piece of messenger RNA, and then getting that into your cells, and then your cells just, boom, make protein out of it.</p><p>And so there could be potentially some advantages. For one thing, it's a lot easier to make a piece of messenger RNA or also a piece of DNA than it is to take some chimpanzee virus or some other more traditional kind of vaccine, because you're just like dealing with a code.</p><p>As soon as the genome of the coronavirus was put online, you could just say like, OK, there's the gene for the spike protein, let's just copy out the gene or messenger RNA version of it, and let's get to work.</p><p>So, that's why Moderna was the first vaccine to go to human testing. It's fast.</p><p>ISAACSON: And when do you think they will be getting results?</p><p>ZIMMER: Well, Moderna and Pfizer, as you mentioned, just started their phase three trials. So, that could be maybe a couple of months.</p><p>[17:45:02]</p><p>Again, there's a lot of logistics that go into determining when this happens. You have to get 30,000 or people or so into a trial. They will be doing these in many states in the United States. They will be doing them in other countries as well.</p><p>And you have to wait and see just how intense the pandemic is. If you have got people vaccinated in a place where there isn't a lot of the virus circulating, it's going to take a long time to see if you have got an effect.</p><p>So, you actually want to go to the places that are most intense, and there you're going to see a difference quickly between people who are vaccinated with the real vaccine and who got the placebo.</p><p>ISAACSON: I'm in Louisiana, and we're pretty intense right now. And I signed up for this trial. Was I foolish to do so?</p><p>ZIMMER: Oh, no, no. It's crucial that lots of people volunteer for these trials. Otherwise, we won't know what works and we can't move forward.</p><p>So -- and we can only predict so far like where the vaccine is going to flare up and where it's going to cool down. That's one of the really amazing things about this pandemic, is, it just -- it explodes, it dies out, it explodes again.</p><p>So, I'm talking to you from Connecticut. We had a horrific problem here in April and May. Now we're one of the quietest places in the country, for now. We will see what happens in the fall.</p><p>ISAACSON: So we talked about the viral vector, the more traditional vaccine. Talked about messenger RNA. And you can also do it with DNA. It's about the same.</p><p>Which of them can be manufactured faster and easier and more cheaply if they come out ahead in this race?</p><p>ZIMMER: Well, there's actually a third group of vaccines that really have the big advantage of just a long track record in terms of experience.</p><p>That is vaccines that are made out of either a weakened version of the virus you want to vaccinate against or just a killed one. And, really, that's actually...</p><p>ISAACSON: Sort of like the old polio Salk and Sabin vaccines?</p><p>ZIMMER: Tried and true, yes.</p><p>And even today, that's what most vaccines are. There is no licensed messenger RNA vaccine out there for people, none. These -- we mentioned the adenovirus vaccines, like the one that AstraZeneca and University of Oxford have. That is just starting to get approved.</p><p>There was one that was approved for Ebola, for example, just like a couple weeks ago. They have been in research for years and years and years, but the vaccine world moves slowly.</p><p>So, if you want to think about, well, what would be the kind of vaccine that you could just make in huge amounts, well, actually inactivated vaccines, virus vaccines, or weakened ones, those might be the way to go.</p><p>ISAACSON: Now, who's doing those?</p><p>ZIMMER: Well, places like China. So, China actually has two inactivated viruses in phase three trials right now.</p><p>And so this is really an international story. This is not just the United States doing all the work for everyone. There's stuff going on in China. There's research going on in Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, just -- India.</p><p>And a lot are them are looking at these more traditional ones. The downside there is that it takes longer to scale up. You want -- it takes longer to make a big batch of these inactivated virus vaccines, because you have to be very careful about it. You can't rush through it, because you want to make sure they're really inactivated.</p><p>ISAACSON: The United States, I keep reading, has thrown a billion dollars here, $1.2 billion there, to help vaccine development, like with Moderna, or many of the others have gotten federal grants.</p><p>What do those federal grants do? Do they get paid back? And does that mean we will get the virus more cheaply?</p><p>ZIMMER: So, this has been actually kind of a broad trend recently, because vaccines have suffered a lot from what vaccine makers call the valley of death.</p><p>Some scientists do some work on animals. They see that a vaccine has some promise, and they're like, OK, now we need some heavy hitters to come in and help us do the clinical trials and do all of the paperwork for licensing and so on. It's incredibly expensive, and the manufacturing.</p><p>And a lot of pharmaceutical companies look at it and they're like, well, I don't know. Do we think it's going to work? Or are we just going to lose a billion dollars on this? That slows things down.</p><p>And so governments and philanthropic organizations for years now have been saying, we need to find ways to speed up this process, for the good of everyone.</p><p>[17:50:02]</p><p>So one idea is for governments to say in advance, OK, look, we don't know yet if this vaccine is going to work, but, if it does, we're going to buy a bunch of them from you. And we will give you some money so that you're not taking as big a risk on this, and so you're not going to get destroyed trying to make a vaccine that will help us all.</p><p>ISAACSON: And if it doesn't work, do we get money back?</p><p>ZIMMER: No.</p><p>ISAACSON: OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ISAACSON: Now, tell...</p><p>ZIMMER: You know, the whole thing doesn't work. If they say, OK, like, you're going to spend all -- you're going to put -- invest all this and take all this risk, and if it doesn't work out, you give us all of this money back, that's not going to work for a lot of businesses.</p><p>ISAACSON: A lot of the pharmaceutical executives were testifying in front of Congress. Some of them said that they would provide the vaccine at cost.</p><p>But others, like Moderna, said, no, we're not going to provide it at cost. And Moderna in particular has been pretty secretive about its approach and has gotten some pushback from scientists. Is there anything that worries you in their approach?</p><p>ZIMMER: Well, I think, in general, we need to be a lot clearer on how everybody is going to get this vaccine.</p><p>If each of us has to pay $100 to get a vaccine, we're not going to get the kind of coverage that we need. And if Moderna says, no, we're not going to do this at cost, and won't even tell us what they're going to charge for it, we have a problem. And we do especially have a problem, given that the United States government has been supporting their work.</p><p>ISAACSON: Are you worried that there is no process and plan for distributing them, for pricing it, for deciding who gets it?</p><p>ZIMMER: I certainly have talked to a lot of vaccine experts who have been in this business for years who are concerned that we're not reckoning with the full scale of this challenge.</p><p>I mean, there's a lot of great, stuff again, I should emphasize, in terms of research. The trials are moving forward without sacrificing safety. That's really important. Like, we're going to know about the safety profiles of these vaccines, and in lots of populations.</p><p>But you still have that question of, how are we going to do something we have never done before? And we need a plan now. And, honestly, if you look at, say, where we are with testing, where we're running out of pipette tips, the most basic equipment for testing, that should make us all very concerned about whether we have our act together enough in the United States to do something far more ambitious than widespread testing.</p><p>Getting vaccines to people as quickly as possible is going to be a much bigger challenge. If we can't even get the testing right, which we're not, then how are we going to get these vaccines right?</p><p>ISAACSON: What happens if some people say, I don't want the vaccine?</p><p>ZIMMER: Well, there's no plans to make it compulsory.</p><p>Some people have been wondering, if companies will say, in order to work here, you have to get vaccinated. But, you know, that is an important issue, because, in order for vaccines -- these vaccines to really be effective on a society-wide scale, we need a lot of people to get them, because, you know, it's likely that these vaccines are not going to be 100 percent effective.</p><p>So, just because you get the vaccine doesn't necessarily mean you won't get sick. But if 80 percent, 90 percent of people get the vaccine, then it's going to -- the virus itself is just going to become a lot rarer, because it's going to have a much harder time getting around. And that's good for everyone.</p><p>ISAACSON: At-home tests are being developed by various places, Mammoth Biosciences, Sherlock Biosciences. They like they would be transformative.</p><p>They would bring biology into our kitchens and they would let us know instant write where we are. Where do we stand with that, and when can we expect at-home tests?</p><p>ZIMMER: That's a great question. I wish it would be, like, today. I wish I can hold an at-home test right here on this camera.</p><p>It's very frustrating that we don't have things yet, because the tests that we're relying on now use a technology, PCR, which is a great, reliable, powerful technology, but it's old. It's from the '80s.

The House antitrust subcommittee will hear testimony livestreamed from Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Facebook Inc.\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc.\u2019s Tim Cook as part of its yearlong inquiry into technology industry competition. The panel is armed with more than a million pages of internal company documents gathered as part of its probe.   Representative David Cicilline, the panel\u2019s Democratic chairman, wanted to hear from the CEOs together as he concludes his investigation into whether the companies are squashing smaller rivals and foreclosing competition. In a coup for Cicilline, the session will mark the first time these tech leaders will appear before lawmakers together. It\u2019s also Bezos\u2019s debut on the witness stand.   The participation of all four CEOs -- who command enterprises with a combined value of nearly $5 trillion -- signals the degree of pressure they\u2019re facing from an American public increasingly outraged by the industry\u2019s inability to police itself. They\u2019ll likely face questions about whether they\u2019ve done enough to contain privacy breaches, election misinformation and the spread of racist and violent content.   \u201cThey will not be able to simply run out the clock or duck by giving general or evasive answers,\u201d said William Kovacic, a former member of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission who is now a professor at George Washington University.   Republicans will likely air concerns shared by President Donald Trump that the companies hold an anti-conservative bias. Bezos has become a Trump target over his ownership of the Washington Post, which has closely covered the administration\u2019s foibles.   The hearing comes as the coronavirus pandemic leaves millions of homebound workers, parents and teachers more reliant than ever on the companies\u2019 online platforms to earn a living, buy groceries, stay connected and educate their children. And the remote video hearing may diminish some of the spectacle, depriving lawmakers of the opportunity to berate the executives in person while also potentially creating hiccups as participants fumble with their mute buttons.   The companies face a variety of complaints about their business practices, from charges that Amazon abuses its power over the third-party merchants that sell on its site to allegations that Facebook acquires companies to eliminate potential rivals. Critics have claimed that Google\u2019s dominance of search and online advertising allows it to preference its own products and squeeze publishers. And some app makers contend that Apple uses its grip on high-end devices to force apps into its payment system, extracing high fees in the process and deciding which ones survive.   The companies, all of which are expected to announce earnings the day after the hearing, have also gone on acquisitions sprees this year, waving off watchdog scrutiny. They all declined to, or didn\u2019t return requests for, comment.   Here\u2019s a look at how the hearing may break down by witness:   Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos: Market player or umpire, or both?   The world\u2019s richest man is making his debut before Congress, giving lawmakers a fresh target. Bezos should expect a tough grilling from Cicilline, who holds up the e-commerce behemoth as the prime example of how Big Tech firms use their size to prioritize their own commercial interests over customers\u2019 needs.   Cicilline has also questioned whether an Amazon lawyer told the truth in previous testimony. During a hearing last year, Cicilline slammed Amazon for undermining third-party sellers. He pressed a company lawyer, Nate Sutton, about the relationship, prompting Sutton to deny that Amazon uses individual seller data to launch competing goods.   Subsequent media reports contended that company employees did just that, causing Cicilline to suggest that Sutton may have been untruthful. He said Bezos needed to appear to clear up the matter.   Amazon faces antitrust probes by the FTC, California and the European Union, which are all looking at the company\u2019s role as a marketplace, Bloomberg has reported.   Cicilline\u2019s staffers include Lina Khan, who helped provide the intellectual underpinning of a movement for revamped competition enforcement with her legal scholarship on Amazon.   Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg: Protecting free speech or digital ad business?   The CEO who\u2019s arguably provoked the greatest amount of outrage among both parties\u2019 lawmakers, Zuckerberg has been a frequent visitor to Capitol Hill in recent years.   He gave two days of testimony on the company\u2019s privacy practices in 2018 as part of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a U.K. political consultancy with ties to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign harvested data on millions of the site\u2019s users without their knowledge. Last year, he faced skeptical lawmakers about the company\u2019s digital currency, Libra.   Now Zuckerberg is grappling with an ongoing advertiser boycott led by civil rights groups because of what they say are his failures to tackle racism, discrimination, voter suppression and election misinformation on his platform. Cicilline has called Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing politicians to post advertisements that are demonstrably false \u201ca business decision,\u201d rather than a move to protect free speech. Facebook last week started adding voting information labels to posts about the 2020 U.S. election, including those shared by Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden.   Democrats may ask about Zuckerberg\u2019s meetings with Trump and whether his hands-off approach to misleading content is designed to appease the White House, which has vowed to punish social-media companies for their supposed anti-conservative bias.   Facebook is the subject of federal antitrust probes by the Justice Department and FTC, which share jurisdiction for enforcement of competition laws but rarely double-up on targets. It\u2019s also under investigation by 45 state attorneys general. Critics have focused on how the company extracts user data to power its advertising operation, as well as its acquisition strategy.   Congress also has been asking questions about Zuckerberg\u2019s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as whether Facebook\u2019s treatment of apps it didn\u2019t buy, including Vine, Snapchat, FourSquare and TikTok, were efforts to squelch competition.   In response, Zuckerberg is preparing to argue that hindering American technological innovation only helps China, that Facebook faces threats from companies including TikTok and that the success of properties it acquired was the result of its investment.Although Zuckerberg has previously faced lawmakers, his testimony on Wednesday will be his first focused on antitrust.   Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai: Staring down a DOJ antitrust lawsuit   While Bezos and Zuckerberg may draw the most rhetorical fireworks, Pichai may be facing the most immediate danger with Attorney General William Barr weeks away from filing a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google for its dominance in the digital advertising market.   The company is also being investigated by a 48-state coalition led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is also focusing on digital ads. Other states are looking into the company\u2019s dominance of online search and its mobile operating system. Some of them could also join the Justice Department case.   Google has argued that regulators should establish a broad definition of the ads market, including television. The company also has pointed to the insurgent challenge from Amazon for digital ad spending.   Google is also facing criticism for the way it collects data and how it handles disinformation on services like YouTube. Google\u2019s $2.1 billion deal for device-maker Fitbit Inc. is undergoing an extended antitrust review, a takeover seen as a test for regulators.   Although Pichai previously testified before the Judiciary Committee in 2018 over anti-conservative bias, he may be best remembered in Congress for the empty chair behind the \u201cGoogle\u201d nameplate when he angered lawmakers earlier that year by skipping a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on foreign election meddling.   Apple\u2019s Tim Cook: Master of deflection amid App Store probe   Of all the CEOs, Tim Cook has been the most successful in deflecting scrutiny from Washington. He\u2019s forged strong relationships with the White House, appeared on business councils with Trump and pushed the company\u2019s trade interests. Apple has largely avoided conservatives\u2019 accusations over liberal bias. Cook has also dodged the kind of criticism that Democrats have launched against Zuckerberg for courting Republicans.   While it has stayed out of the political crossfire, Apple is the subject of a Justice Department antitrust probe for rules that require many app makers to use the company\u2019s payment system, Bloomberg has reported. App makers such as Spotify Technology SA are raising red flags, particularly in Europe, with complaints about the fees Apple charges on its App Store, especially when the company has competing offerings.   Apple defended the fees it charges developers who sell software and services through its App Store, saying recently that the 30% cut is standard industry practice and \u201cis similar in magnitude to the commission rates charged by many other app stores and digital content marketplaces.\u201d   Cook previously testified in 2013 about Apple\u2019s payment of taxes, although he hasn\u2019t appeared

In a coup for Cicilline, the session will mark the first time these tech leaders will appear before lawmakers together. It's also Bezos's debut on the witness stand.</p><p>The participation of all four CEOs - who command enterprises with a combined value of nearly $5 trillion - signals the degree of pressure they're facing from an American public increasingly outraged by the industry's inability to police itself. They'll likely face questions about whether they've done enough to contain privacy breaches, election misinformation and the spread of racist and violent content.</p><p>\"They will not be able to simply run out the clock or duck by giving general or evasive answers,\" said William Kovacic, a former member of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission who is now a professor at George Washington University.</p><p>Republicans will likely air concerns shared by President Donald Trump that the companies hold an anti-conservative bias. Bezos has become a Trump target over his ownership of the Washington Post, which has closely covered the administration's foibles.</p><p>The hearing comes as the coronavirus pandemic leaves millions of homebound workers, parents and teachers more reliant than ever on the companies'online platforms to earn a living, buy groceries, stay connected and educate their children. And the remote video hearing may diminish some of the spectacle, depriving lawmakers of the opportunity to berate the executives in person while also potentially creating hiccups as participants fumble with their mute buttons.</p><p>Here's a look at how the hearing may break down: Amazon's Jeff Bezos: Market player or umpire, or both? The world's richest man is making his debut before Congress, giving lawmakers a fresh target. Bezos should expect a tough grilling from Cicilline, who holds up the e-commerce behemoth as the prime example of how Big Tech firms use their size to prioritize their own interests over customers' needs.</p><p>Cicilline has also questioned whether an Amazon lawyer told the truth in previous testimony. During a hearing last year, Cicilline slammed Amazon for undermining third-party sellers. He pressed a company lawyer, Nate Sutton, about the relationship, prompting Sutton to deny that Amazon uses individual seller data to launch competing goods.</p><p>Amazon faces antitrust probes by the FTC, California and the European Union, which are all looking at the company's role as a marketplace, Bloomberg has reported. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg: Protecting free speech or digital ad business? The CEO who's arguably provoked the greatest amount of outrage among both parties'lawmakers, Zuckerberg has been a frequent visitor to Capitol Hill in recent years.</p><p>He gave two days of testimony on the company's privacy practices in 2018 as part of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a British political consultancy with ties to Trump's presidential campaign harvested data on millions of the site's users without their knowledge. Last year, he faced skeptical lawmakers about the company's digital currency, Libra.</p><p>Now Zuckerberg is grappling with an ongoing advertiser boycott led by civil rights groups because of what they say are his failures to tackle racism, discrimination, voter suppression and election misinformation on his platform. Cicilline has called Facebook's policy of allowing politicians to post advertisements that are demonstrably false \"a business decision,\" rather than a move to protect free speech. Facebook last week started adding voting information labels to posts about the 2020 U.S. election, including those shared by Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden.</p><p>Democrats may ask about Zuckerberg's meetings with Trump and whether his hands-off approach to misleading content is designed to appease the White House, which has vowed to punish social-media companies for their supposed anti-conservative bias.</p><p>Facebook is the subject of federal antitrust probes by the Justice Department and FTC, which share jurisdiction for enforcement of competition laws but rarely double-up on targets. It's also under investigation by 45 state attorneys general. Critics have focused on how the company extracts user data to power its advertising operation, as well as its acquisition strategy. Google's Sundar Pichai: Staring down a DOJ antitrust lawsuit While Bezos and Zuckerberg may draw the most rhetorical fireworks, Pichai may be facing the most immediate danger with Attorney General William Barr weeks away from filing a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google for its dominance in the digital advertising market.</p><p>The company is also being investigated by a 48-state coalition led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is also focusing on digital ads. Other states are looking into the company's dominance of online search and its mobile operating system.</p><p>Google has argued that regulators should establish a broad definition of the ads market, including television.</p><p>Google is also facing criticism for the way it collects data and how it handles disinformation on services like YouTube. Google's $2.1 billion deal for device-maker Fitbit Inc. is undergoing an extended antitrust review, a takeover seen as a test for regulators. Apple's Tim Cook: Master of deflection amid probe Of all the CEOs, Tim Cook has been the most successful in deflecting scrutiny from Washington. He's forged strong relationships with the White House, appeared on business councils with Trump and pushed the company's trade interests. Apple has largely avoided conservatives'accusations over liberal bias. Cook has also dodged the kind of criticism that Democrats have launched against Zuckerberg for courting Republicans.</p><p>While it has stayed out of the political crossfire, Apple is the subject of a Justice Department antitrust probe for rules that require many app makers to use the company's payment system, Bloomberg has reported. App makers such as Spotify Technology SA are raising red flags, particularly in Europe, with complaints about the fees Apple charges on its App Store, especially when the company has competing offerings. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

I regard EQIX, like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">F5</emphasis>(FRIV:NYSE), as an integral manager to all of the data on the Web and where it gets stored. Its robust earnings tell me that<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EMC</emphasis>(EMC:NYSE),<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Intel</emphasis>(INTC:NYSE) and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VMWare</emphasis>(VMW:NYSE) are going to keep seeing more demand from these themes. Same with Citrix, which is the ultimate software-as-a-service cloud play. When it rallies, it tends to take<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Salesforce.com</emphasis>(CRM:NYSE) with it.You need Xilinx chips if your telco network is going to keep up with your cellphone features that sop of data and video. </p><p>It was worrisome for a time when Xilinx didn't see that demand, part of a larger theme of carrier spending slowdown. That seems to have ended, although of course we know from<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juniper</emphasis>(JNPR:NYSE) that telco spending's been muted for some areas.Finally Cirrus Logic, an up-and-down story, is definitely up this quarter. Cirrus makes the best sound chips and some energy regulation chips, both of which are in huge up cycles, the former benefiting from Apple's largesse.All four of these companies provide a positive backdrop for areas of technology that always seem to be called into question -- demand for big data equipment, cloud software and better features for cellphones -- but have become tried and true sources of growth for the companies that play in their fields.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-11509339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55H3-GWX1-JCMB-G0MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"305\"/><timeReceived>10:24 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 TheStreet.com, Inc.

I'm Michael Holmes. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Studio seven at CNN world headquarters in Atlanta. And ahead this hour, nearly half of China now on lockdown as authorities go to new links to stop the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The United Nations calls it the biggest humanitarian horror story of this century. Almost one million people forced from their homes in Syria's latest violence. And Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pledging $10 billion to fight climate change, but even some of these own employees say the world's richest man still has done enough.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin this hour in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Chinese health officials are saying that a hospital director in that city has died from the virus. The global death toll is now jumped to more than 1,800. Right now, half of China's population, 718 million people are under travel restrictions because of the outbreak. And officials are monitoring people who bought fever medicine since January. China also says more than 12,000 patients, and this is important, have recovered and being discharged from hospitals.</p><p>Meanwhile, CNN has just learned that 160 Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan in the first week of February and quarantine in California will be released on Tuesday. And 14 of the cruise ship passengers evacuated from Japan have been sent to medical facilities after testing positive for the virus. They were flying back to the U.S. Monday morning.</p><p>Now CNN's Matt Rivers joins me now from Tokyo to talk about these developments. First of all, what do we know about the disembarkation, if you like, process as it stands?</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, we expect, Michael, this process to begin sometime during the day on the 19th. What Japanese health officials are saying is that they will be testing every single person on board the Diamond Princess before they are going to be allowed off and out of that quarantine and just kind of allowed to go free in Japan in both Yokohama and potentially Tokyo as well. What officials are saying though, is that it takes a couple of days to get those test results back. They believed to have testing procedures basically done by today, but then it could take several days after that for the results to come back. So what officials are saying is that the people who qualify, that basically the people who are not tested positive, the people who qualify to get off the ship will be allowed to do so between the 19th and the 21st.</p><p>The one caveat to that is even if your test comes back negative, but the person who you are sharing a cabin with comes back positive, well, then they're going to keep that person on board the ship for a longer quarantine period. Not clear at least as of now from health officials how long that person is going to be kept onboard the ship.</p><p>So this process of disembarkation that passengers had been waiting for some time now, Michael, does look like it's going to move forward sometime during the day on the 19th. And it will last for the next several days. But not everyone is going to qualify. I mean, we still see the number of cases being reported go up. I mean, it was just last night here in Japan that we reported an increase of 99 additional cases.</p><p>That was the largest day to day increase in terms of the number of positive diagnoses on the ship since the quarantine began. So that could certainly continue to go up, Michael, and that will affect not only the people who tested positive, but also the people staying in the same cabins as those people who get that diagnosis.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes, yes. A lot of questions about whether it was wise to keep everyone together from the beginning. Who then remains on board the ship?</p><p>RIVERS: Well, so there are about -- there are several dozen Americans that remain after those evacuation flights took the majority of Americans off the plane Sunday into Monday morning. But there's a whole bunch of other nationalities of people on board. There's Japanese people that remain on board. There's Australians, there's Italians, there's Canadians, there's a number of different nationalities that remain on board.</p><p>We know the Canadians, Italians, and the Australians are planning on evacuating their citizens. We don't know the schedule at this point. We don't know whether that's going to happen before passengers are a led off the ship or after in some capacity. We're told that embassies are getting in touch directly with their nationals on board the ship.</p><p>But there's a whole bunch of people that remain on board, Michael, and they're, you know, desperately, you know, waiting to hear from officials, did they test positive or not? And how soon can they get off the ship after what's been just a miserable process for those people on board.</p><p>[01:05:16]</p><p>HOLMES: Goodness. Absolutely. Matt, thank you very much, reporting all throughout this. Matt Rivers there. All right, now Syria's president says his forces' recent rapid gains against the rebels are a prelude to the end of the country's nine-year war. The Syrian army says now that it has taken control of dozens of towns in Aleppo's northwestern region and forces are pushing into Idlib province.</p><p>Russian airstrikes hit near the Turkish border forcing two hospitals to close according to staff. President Bashar al-Assad says the conflict isn't over yet.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BASHAR AL-ASSAD, PRESIDENT OF SYRIA (through translator): We are fully aware that this liberation does not mean the end of war, nor the collapse of schemes, nor the demise of terrorism, nor does it mean that the enemies have surrendered, but it certainly means rubbing their noses in the dirt as a prelude for complete defeat sooner or later.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: The U.N. says nearly 900,000 civilians have been displaced since December, most of them women and children. One U.N. official said the humanitarian crisis has reached a horrifying new level.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK LOWCOCK, UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL, UNITED NATION: If this goes on, what we're going to see is Idlib, that part of Northwest in Syria turned into the world's biggest pile of rubble-strewn with the corpses of a million children.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: A dire situation there. Now, Barbara Walter joins us from San Diego. She's a political science professor at the University of California San Diego, also an expert on international security with an emphasis civil wars, so the perfect person to speak with.</p><p>Professor, I mean, it's hard to get your head around nearly a million people displaced in a couple of months. It almost defies belief. Our own Arwa Damon said there are no good options for the population as the enclave disintegrates. What's your assessment of what's unfolding?</p><p>BARBARA WALTER, POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO: With a complete humanitarian disaster, Assad has consciously been targeting and killing civilians in the area with the objective of depopulating the area. It's true that there is almost a million civilians, almost half of them are children, and there's no place for them to go. So essentially, they're sitting up.</p><p>Normally they would go across the border into Turkey. That's where four million Syrian refugees have already gone. The Turkish government has closed that border.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes, in the -- in the short term, a lot of these people are telling CNN they would prefer some sort of Turkish protectorate in that part of the region. And then as you point out, Turkey, has upped its military presence, hundreds of armored vehicles and tanks, they have taken casualties as well. How does that complicate the battlefield?</p><p>WALTER: Well, Turkey has a very good incentive to try to create a safe haven, a protectorate for the civilians. Its greatest concern is that it gets overloaded with refugees, and this actually destabilizes Turkey. So Erdogan is going to do everything possible to try to keep them out of his country. And that means creating some sort of protectorate. That's not going to be easy, because it's basically Turkey against Assad, against the Russians with help from Iran.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes, just even saying that line is a little bit scary in a geopolitical sense. I mean, how realistically the possibility of full- blown conflict between Turkey, a NATO member, and the Assad regime with the Russians perhaps being dragged in to support their proxies. That's a frightening thing. How possible is it?</p><p>WALTER: I don't think it's that likely. I think if NATO it had more teeth at the moment, Turkey might be a little more emboldened. But NATO right now is essentially leaderless with Trump, President Trump not showing much interest in taking leading role there and none of the Europeans have been up. So even though Turkey is a member of NATO, NATO as an organization right now is quite weak.</p><p>HOLMES: Turkish officials made this point. They've been moaning for months. They cannot handle a new influx of refugees. But you know, this regime offensive, it could potentially push three million people across the border into a nation that as you say, hosts four million Syrian refugees or met already. I mean, what is that process look like?</p><p>[01:10:03]</p><p>WALTER: Well, I think the most immediate negative effect is probably not that bad from a U.S. perspective. I think the person who has the most to fear from this is President Erdogan because having that many refugees is not particularly popular in Turkey and amongst his constituents. So he's probably going to take the blame most immediately from having refugees like that before anything worse happened.</p><p>HOLMES: I wonder what your thoughts are on, you know, what responsibility, if any, the U.S. has to bear for what's happening in that northern area of the country where not so long ago the U.S. patrolled and the area was largely peaceful. I mean, did that sort of drop any dominoes, that withdrawal?</p><p>WALTER: This has everything to do with us withdrawal starting back in October. The U.S. withdrew almost all of its soldiers by the beginning of November. And that basically cleared the way for Assad to make rapid military advances. That's exactly what he did.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes. And Turkey to displace Kurds as well. It's a busy part of the world. Barbara Walter, Professor, thank you so much. I appreciate your expertise.</p><p>WALTER: It's my pleasure.</p><p>HOLMES: OK, the number of former U.S. Justice Department officials demanding the Attorney General's resignation nearly doubled on Monday. Bill Barr, accused of politicizing the Justice Department. The latest instance his intervention in a high profile case involving one of President Donald Trump's close friends. Kaitlan Collins with an update.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Attorney General Bill Barr is now facing more scrutiny after a week that strained his relationship with the Justice Department rank and file and an interview that threatened to upend his standing with the President.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: I know people who are trying to bully Bill Barr out of his job.</p><p>COLLINS: More than 2,000 former federal prosecutors and Justice Department officials are calling on him to resign after he intervened to reduce Roger Stone's sentencing recommendation. Officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have signed an open letter calling Barr's actions unheard of and outrageous, including the deputy attorney general from George H.W. Bush's White House.</p><p>Stone is a close confidant of Trump's and is set to be sentenced to this week after he was convicted on seven counts including lying to Congress and witness tampering. Barr denied talking about the case with the President.</p><p>BARR: I have not discussed the Roger Stone case at the White House.</p><p>COLLINS: But comments like this from Trump have done little to combat allegations of political influence.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Roger Stone was treated horribly. I want to thank the Justice Department.</p><p>COLLINS: Trump is spending President's Day behind closed doors after a weekend in Florida where he headlined the priciest fundraiser of his presidency at the home of billionaire Nelson Peltz and activist grand marshal at the Daytona 500.</p><p>TRUMP: Gentlemen, start your engines.</p><p>COLLINS: His campaign manager was forced to delete his tweet after he posted a photo of Air Force One flying over the racetrack from when President George W. Bush visited in 2004. Brad Parscale later tweeted a photo of Trump's Air Force One arrival in Daytona. Trump ended the weekend in Washington attending the wedding of his senior advisors, Stephen Miller and Vice President Pence's press secretary Katie Waldman at his hotel in Washington. Now in that open letter that those now over 2,000 attorneys have signed. They say they welcome to what Bill Barr said when he criticized the president for getting involved in Justice Department matters. But they said that that wasn't enough and that in their opinion, actions speak louder than words that we should note so far the Justice Department has not commented on that letter. Kaitlan Collins, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLMES: We'll take a short break. When we come back, floodwaters are keeping emergency services busy in the U.K. Is the situation about to get even worse? We'll check the forecast and see if more rain could be on the way. And the world's richest man putting his money where his mouth is in the fight against climate change. We'll explain how Amazon chief Jeff Bezos' $10 billion donation might deliver some results even some of his own workers though not convinced. We'll have that when we come back.</p><p>[01:15:00]</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN INTERNATIONAL METEOROLOGIST: Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri with you for CNN weather watch. And the eastern third of the U.S. where the active weather is confined to when it comes to some wintry weather to the north and rain showers across portions of the South and Central States.</p><p>And in Chicago in particular, look at this. We get a taste of wintry temperatures. We haven't had much of those in recent months, highs minus five where two is the average for this time of year. Just like that, on Friday revert back to what is normal for this time of year, by Saturday and Sunday climb above that. And as is the case continuing what has been a historic start here to the winter season in the past several months across portions of the United States.</p><p>And notice to the south, some to wet weather as well across parts of the Southern United States from Atlanta back westward just north of Montgomery, Alabama. There's some heavy rainfall expected where some flooding once again remains a concern. Highs in Denver one, in Dallas 13 degrees. A very warm afternoon slated across portions of Southern California 24 degrees and partly cloudy conditions.</p><p>Winnipeg that's where the coolest temperatures are slated for about 17 below for an afternoon high. Into Havana, Cuba, how about a taste of almost summer-like warmth coming in 33 degrees across the region. NASA a little more manageable down to 27 there with partly cloudy conditions and shift the attention into South America there where (INAUDIBLE) expecting highs to be into the 30s, Paranam also around 30 degrees.</p><p>HOLMES: American racecar driver has been hospitalized after getting into a dramatic crash at the Daytona 500. It happened in the final lap of the event in Florida. Ryan Newman was actually in first place when he gets clipped crashes into the wall. His car flipping several times and flying into the air. when you see it in slow motion, you can see just how dramatic it was. Then another car crashes into him.</p><p>T.V. commentators say he was taken to hospital after being taken out of the vehicle. A statement from Newman's racing team says he's currently in a serious condition but does not have life-threatening injuries which is both incredible and good news.</p><p>Turning now to the U.K., which is still grappling with the fallout of a severe winter storm. Storm Dennis had prompted a record-breaking number of flood warnings across Britain as workers rescue residents by boat in waist-deep water. Dennis struck Britain nearly a week after another storm Ciara wreaked havoc leaving thousands without electricity. Meteorologist Pedram Javaheri joins us with more. Any good news on the meteorological horizon?</p><p>JAVAHERI: You know, in the immediate forecast, yes. So we're talking about Tuesday. It looks like the low and quieter day. And unfortunately, Wednesday into Thursday, additional wet weather is expected here. And of course, you noted Ciara was a storm we dealt with about eight-nine days ago and you bring this particular storm in Dennis here and of course very similar in the amount of rain they produce, the wind gusts also tremendous.</p><p>We know across the South Wales Valleys across this region, water levels and those rivers as the highest we've seen in four decades. It really speaks to the intensity, the rarity of such a storm, and of course, nearly 500 properties, taking on some water. You know, the U.K. in the past few years has allocated billions of dollars in weather emergencies. But moving forward, they've actually increased that to over $6.5 billion.</p><p>[01:20:24]</p><p>In the past five years, that number was closer to $3 billion. So kind of see the response here by the government dealing with the severe weather we've experienced in recent years and of course moving forward. But images look as such across this region, flood alerts upwards of nearly 500 of them in place across the U.K. when you consider the warnings and alerts, and nine of which considered severe at this hour.</p><p>So looking forward to the into Wednesday, notice we have quite a bit of coverage here as far as at least some of the lower risk in place. There are some medium-risk going into Tuesday across the Wales region, also the Midlands area. And the biggest concern here is the amount of water that has already come down that has increased the groundwater supply right above the water table.</p><p>So any additional rainfall becomes surface flooding, and that is really what's most concerning at this hour because so many rivers, so many tributaries dealing with flooding at this hour, Michael. So the last thing they want to see is additional wet weather. But of course, the calendar says it's the middle of February so plenty of storms still over the next several months across this region. HOLMES: Yes. The world is changing. Pedram Javaheri, thank you so much.</p><p>JAVAHERI: Thanks.</p><p>HOLMES: All right, the world's richest man putting a portion of his vast wealth behind the fight against climate change. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pledging $10 billion to create a fund to support climate change scientists, activists, and organizations. The Bezos Earth Fund will be giving out grants this northern summer. Bezos wants to work with others to explore new ways of fighting climate change saying this. \"We can save Earth. It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation-states, global organizations and individuals.\"</p><p>And Bill McKibben joins us now. He's an environmentalist and the founder of climate campaign group 350.org. He's also the author of the book Earth. You see there on your screen now. Always good to see you, sir. Now, given the urgency of the climate situation, how would $10 billion best be used if you were spending it?</p><p>BILL MCKIBBEN, FOUNDER, 350.ORG: Well, I mean, look, first of all, let's say, it's probably not the best thing in the world that we've set up a planet where a few people end up with all the money. That being the case, I'm glad that Mr. Bezos is spending some of it on earth instead of just on outer space. And I think that the places that it's most important to spend it are in standing up to the fossil fuel industry. They're the ones who are driving this crisis now.</p><p>We don't know if you will, because Amazon continues to partner with the big oil companies in the hunt for more oil and gas. Their web services are a crucial part of their kind of cloud computing, of what the big oil companies are doing. But if he's serious about reining in climate change, the place it's going to come is if we stand up to these guys.</p><p>HOLMES: And to that point, he is, of course, facing a climate rebellion from within. You know, the group of employees Amazon for Life on Twitter, they -- you call them one of the truly effective groups of workers on the planet. And you quote them underneath. You know, they're saying, basically, great, Jeff Bezos, thanks for the money. But they also asking hard questions and we'll put it up for people to read.</p><p>They saying things like, when is Amazon going to stop helping oil and gas companies ravage the earth? Stop funding climate-denying think tanks. They call him complicit in the acceleration of the climate crisis, and he has promised changes. But you know, they're saying, well, thanks for the 10 billion, but there's a lot of questions at home.</p><p>MCKIBBEN: Let's hope that their work among others is in the process of converting him on this issue. Look, I'm willing to accept the fact that people looking at the mess that we're now in, watching the pictures that you've been showing from Australia for the past month, I'm willing to accept the fact that people who haven't been very involved in this in the past are beginning to get scared. And so it's, you know, good work from people like Amazon employees for climate action that are beginning to push this debate.</p><p>We'll see. It's quite true that we need every hand on board, but we need to make sure that those guys are really willing to take on -- well, take on the other rich people who are keeping us on the path world.</p><p>HOLMES: And yes. I mean, to that point, I mean, do you think even with Bezos giving some of his own money, do you think there's a message out there now, a feeling that people can't rely on government. There are so many governments around the world. You mentioned Australia. That's one, the U.S. as well, that continued to promote fossil fuels and in fact, demean climate activism. Is there a feeling -- growing feeling that if governments want to do it, we'll have to do it ourselves, be it private citizens, or Jeff Bezos or whoever?</p><p>[01:25:20]</p><p>MCKIBBEN: Well, I think that there is -- I mean, look, I mean, Jeff Bezos has managed to make sure that Amazon didn't pay any federal tax last year. So that's a reminder of one of the reasons that the federal government isn't doing very much about the tax that we're in. But yes, look, we're going to have to build movements because governments aren't doing the things that they're supposed to be doing. And those movements are going to have to make it inconvenient for the most powerful industries on our planet.</p><p>We really are reaching one of those moments where you line up on one side or the other. That's why people are pushing the big banks so hard to stop lending the fossil fuel industry. It's why so many institutions are divesting their holdings from the fossil fuel industry. We're at the moment of truth now. And so I guess in that moment, it's good that as many people as possible are beginning to throw down.</p><p>HOLMES: You know, it's interesting you mentioned the Australian bush fires, you got glaciers melting, I mean, this bomb cyclone in the U.K., the second biggest ever in the North Atlantic. You've been warning of the perils of climate change for years now, and must have been, of course, frustrated by the inaction. Are you more confident now or less that catastrophic consequences can be averted, or at least mitigate it in a meaningful sense.</p><p>MCKIBBEN: Well, clearly catastrophic consequences can't be averted. I mean, look, ask the people who ended up standing on the beach in New South Wales and Victoria because the ocean was the only way they could get out of the forest fire. The question now is not whether we can stop climate change, it's whether we can stop it short of the point where it just destroys civilizations.</p><p>And I'm afraid that's an open question. I mean, if we're going to do it, we're going to have to move faster than we've ever moved before. We've only left ourselves. The scientists tell us a decade or so, to make huge strides. We better get on it and on it fast.</p><p>HOLMES: Bill McKibben, always a pleasure to have you on. Sir, thank you so much.</p><p>MCKIBBEN: Back to you. Thanks.</p><p>HOLMES: We're going to take a short break. When we come back, Americans exposed to the coronavirus on a cruise ship in Japan. They're back in the U.S. but their journey back home felt like they were trading one old deal for another. We'll have the details after the break.</p><p>[01:31:13]</p><p>MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM</p><p>I'm Michael Holmes with the headlines.</p><p>The U.N. says the humanitarian crisis in Syria is reaching a horrifying new level. 900,000 Syrians have fled their home since December as Syrian forces make rapid advances in Aleppo. President Bashar al-Assad said the war is not over but the games, he said, are a prelude to the rebels' eventual defeat.</p><p>The world's richest man putting a portion of his vast wealth behind the fight against climate change. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pledging $10 billion to create a fund to support scientists, activists and organizations. The Bezos Earth Fund, as it will be called, will begin giving out grants in the next few months.</p><p>The coronavirus has now killed more than 1,800 people worldwide, including a hospital director in Wuhan, China -- the epicenter of the outbreak. At least 73,000 cases have been recorded globally now. Most of them in China. And nearly half the country's population or about 780 million people are still facing travel restrictions.</p><p>Now, the 14 Americans who tested positive for the virus on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship are now being treated in the United States. More than 300 Americans were flown back to California and Texas on Monday where they will wait 14 more days in quarantine.</p><p>CNN's Will Ripley has more now on their long journey home.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT; Daybreak in Yokohama, Japan. The final day on the Diamond Princess for more than 300 Americans evacuated by the U.S. government.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a converted cargo 747. So there is less insulation than a regular passenger jet. So bring some American layers to stay warm.</p><p>RIPLEY: American health officials try to prepare passengers for a long, uncomfortable journey -- a journey Karey Maniscalco (ph) from Utah is reluctant to take. She and her husband already endured nearly two weeks of quarantine on the cruise ship. KAREY MANISCALCO, EVACUATED CRUISE SHIP PASSENGER: I didn't like that answer.</p><p>RIPLEY: Now, they are about to do it all over again at a California military base.</p><p>MANISCALCO: They have sent over a dozen emails assuring us that there would not be an additional quarantine. And they just told us that we would be re-quarantined for 14 more days. I've just lost a whole month of my life.</p><p>RIPLEY: She is angry at the U.S. government, angry they waited so long to evacuate the American passengers.</p><p>Others, like Gay Courter (ph) from Florida are grateful.</p><p>GAY COURTER, EVACUATED CRUISE SHIP PASSENGER: : I want to go somewhere where I can feel safe. I just want to thank President Trump and the U.S. government. There has been a lot of silence on this. And now we know the silence has been putting together a brilliant plan.</p><p>RIPLEY: Executing that plan will take nearly ten hours even though the airport is just a 20-minute drive from the ship.</p><p>Once they get on, there is no getting off, not even to go to the bathroom.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The best I can do is go found out where a bathroom is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So find out.</p><p>RIPLEY: As the hours drag on, this health worker tries to break the tension.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you call a witch on the beach?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A sandwich.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There you are.</p><p>RIPLEY: Passengers are beginning to feel like the joke is on them.</p><p>MANISCALCO: We are just waiting. I don't really know what we are waiting for, but we are waiting indefinitely.</p><p>[01:34:45]</p><p>RIPLEY: Finally, they are allowed off the bus -- and on to the tarmac, boarding two converted 747 cargo planes. The cabin, best described as barebones. No windows, makeshift toilets, temporary seats.</p><p>MANISCALCO: This is first class, baby. First class.</p><p>RIPLEY: Lack of luxury aside, Maniscalco feels anxious.</p><p>MANISCALCO: It is not good conditions. No one on here has had their temperature taken by the federal government or any government for that matter.</p><p>So we are all in really close, tight quarters. Everybody is sitting next to each other. I have a girl sitting here in just a minute. It seems dangerous and not safe.</p><p>RIPLEY: The U.S. government says they are safe, even though 14 passengers who tested positive for coronavirus are allowed on the flight, all showing no symptoms. They are put in a specialized containment area, isolated from the other passengers.</p><p>Just after daybreak, both planes finally take off -- a long sleepless night followed by a ten-hour flight.</p><p>Now, they have arrived in California and Texas. One ordeal ends, another begins.</p><p>Will Ripley, CNN -- Yokohama, Japan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) ] HOLMES: Now the virus has also affected the world supply of iPhones. A shortage of workers has limited the number of devices that Apple can make and sell. It says the top priority is quote, \"the health and well-being of Apple employees\". The tech giant makes most iPhones in China where its factories have been shut down as the coronavirus spread.</p><p>But Apple retail stores across the country are slowly starting to reopen. The company says the supply disruption should be temporary, but it still expects to miss its quarterly revenue goals.</p><p>We're going to take a short break again now. But we'll have more news in just a moment.</p><p>HOLMES: Just days before European Union officials plan to unveil new rules regarding big tech firms and data, Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg is publicly asking for more governance. He says more regulations will benefit everyone in the long run.</p><p>CNN's Nina Dos Santos with more from Brussels.</p><p>[01:39:51]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg spent part of the day on Monday in Brussels meeting with three powerful E.U. commissioners who'll have a big say on the legislative horizon that his company is going to be facing in this vital market in the years to come. Well, during that meeting, he was informed that the E.U. is looking into privacy issues, as well as trying to understand how Facebook could take more responsibility for the type of content that its platforms deliver, to try and curtail things like hate speech, also disinformation and public health, and also the realm of politics.</p><p>Vera Jourova, the E.U.'s transparency and values commissioner was one of those who met with Mark Zuckerberg. She spoke to CNN just before heading in to that crucial meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, E.U. TRANSPARENCY AND VALUES COMMISSIONER: I am sure that the business model Facebook uses for selling books cannot be used for selling the political ideas or political actors. That is why I also want to speak about the protection of the elections.</p><p>I want to protect European voters against the mechanisms of algorithms which is what chased (ph) them him into the bubble and do not give them the free possibility to make a free choice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOS SANTOS: These meetings are very different types of meetings, the receptions that Mark Zuckerberg has had in years gone by. There were not television cameras present. And all we've had afterwards was something of a terse statement saying that they had had discussions.</p><p>Very different pictures to 2018, when Zuckerberg was publicly grilled by hundreds of European parliamentarians angry at the lack of transparency over what was done with citizens data online.</p><p>While privacy concerns are still part of the discussion that the E.U. is having with Facebook, they're also trying to combat all sorts of other issues and will do so with a series of new laws that are going to be presented in draft proposal form this week, before probably being implemented later on in the year.</p><p>The message to Facebook is that it has to follow them, otherwise, it could face potentially financial sanctions.</p><p>Either way though, both sides know they have to get this balance right for the large number of people who log on to Facebook in this part of the world every single day.</p><p>To put this into context, the E.U. has 445 million citizens or thereabout. Facebook has around about 307 million daily active users in this part of the world as per its latest annual report.</p><p>Nina Dos Santos, CNN -- Brussels.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLMES: There you have it.</p><p>Thanks for watching CNN NEWSROOM, everyone.

In Mexico City, for example, the ride-sharing service blocks ride requests from areas where carjacking is a risk at certain times of day. \"Ratings are real,\" said Khosrowshahi, and a user has more information on their driver than if they hailed a taxi. But ultimately, \"a 4.9 is a rating of how they drive, not the state of their mind.\"</p><p>The deeper issue at stake is whether the big tech companies are doing enough to build trust in their values and intentions. Under its previous chief executive, Uber suffered from a \"growth at any cost\" culture, exposed by whistleblower Susan Fowler. But, in the world of new, connected products and services - the Fourth Industrial Revolution - \"trust has to be the highest value in our company,\" argued <person><nameText>Marc R. Benioff, </nameText></person>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Salesforce, USA, adding: \"If anything trumps trust, we're in trouble.\"</p><p>CEOs need to be more transparent about the values they embrace. For Benioff, equality is key, especially in terms of employee pay and promotion. For <person><nameText>Ruth Porat, </nameText></person>Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of Alphabet, USA, Google's core value is respect - for the user, for the opportunity and for one another. Highbrow values are fine, but do companies' intentions measure up? Amazon's Alexa now has a built-in camera that can rate what a person is wearing, recommend upgrades to their wardrobe and order with a single click. Is it right that technology not only does things for us, but also decides things for us? Online retailers such as Amazon now gather so much data that they know more about users than the users themselves, raising serious questions about the privacy of that data and who has the authority to use and monetize it. Botsman asked: Is technology encouraging us to give away our trust too easily?</p><p>The signs are pointing towards more regulation, according to Benioff. \"When CEOs don't take responsibility, then governments have no choice but to step in,\" he said. Benioff likened the accelerating power of today's technology to the complex financial products of a decade ago. Regulators weren't paying sufficient attention then, and the headlong rush into mortgage-backed derivatives and the like created the worst financial crash for generations. Regulators need to adapt much faster to the new reality.</p><p>There is a political angle to this argument too, said Sir Martin Sorrell, Chief Executive Officer of WPP, United Kingdom, one of the world's largest advertising companies. The spread of artificial intelligence, driverless cars and stores with no workers or check-outs is making ordinary people nervous. These voters are less worried about trust than about whether their job is secure - and this populism is sure to have an impact at the ballot box. Automation might bring prices down, but chief executives and governments alike need to take on the task of skills training with far greater urgency. With the tech space increasingly dominated by a handful of huge players, such as Apple, Google and Facebook, regulation of data sharing, privacy and responsibility for platform content is an increasingly urgent issue, argued Sorrell.</p><p>Ultimately, however, we cannot rely on regulators alone to solve these problems. In the case of newsfeeds, argued Botsman, do we want Facebook or regulators to be the arbiters of truth - or is that role best left to users themselves?</p><p>The World Economic Forum's 48th Annual Meeting is taking place on 23-26 January 2018 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland. More than 3,000 leaders from around the world are gathering in a collaborative effort to shape the global, regional and industry agendas, with a commitment to improve the state of the world.</p><p>Contact: Fon Mathuros, head of media, +41 (0)79 201 0211, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fma@weforum.org\">fma@weforum.org</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6139099 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6139099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGH-TNT1-DYG2-R0HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><timeReceived>7:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 23, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The session will be the sixth hearing in the Judiciary Committee's ongoing investigation into the nature of digital competition and the anti-competitive behaviors by tech giants. All eyes are on the four key topics that lawmakers will be debating , for their results will shape personal technologies in the coming years.    1)   Tech Companies Are Huge. Are They A Bad Monopoly?    Big Tech keeps getting bigger, even during the coronavirus pandemic. Their stocks, which were hit in the first weeks of the pandemic, are now on an upward march to the top of the market cap heap. Just four firms are worth a combined $4 trillion. Just four firms make up over 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500. How could they have been allowed to grow so huge without hearing a whimper from regulators in the past?    Our current interpretation of antitrust law has made it practically toothless to curb any software-driven companies. Since 1979, the Supreme Court has focused on a \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d theory of antitrust law. An act is deemed anticompetitive \u201conly when it\u2026 raises the prices of goods above competitive levels or diminishes their quality.\u201d Its intention is to protect consumers, and it works wonders for the traditional economy, by regulating the oil and gas, telecommunications, auto, real estate, and consumer packaged goods industries.     But in the digital economy led by software development, any additional users served will incur few additional costs. Once a piece of software is written, it costs nothing to duplicate. Tech companies also know how to get money elsewhere. It\u2019s the advertisers, like P&amp;G and Nike, who pay Google so that we have Google Maps and Gmail. It\u2019s Netflix who pays AWS some $10 million a month for cloud computing so that Amazon can cross subsidize home delivery at a loss . All of a sudden, it becomes less clear if you and I are worse off or better off because of Silicon Valley.    What we need to watch out for is whether Washington will push for a new interpretation of antitrust law. Instead of relying on an outdated doctrine designed for the last century, regulators will instead pay attention to behaviors that harm competitors. Are tech companies systematically eliminating major competitors or depriving other companies of a fair opportunity to compete? Rather than looking at product price, regulators will look at industrial concentration.    2)   Are Tech Companies Playing A Fair Game?        Being big gives you big advantages. \u201cFacebook\u2019s killing Snap. Are they doing that in reasonable ways? They\u2019re copying them. Are they better than them, or are they actually doing this in unfair ways?\u201d asked Tim Wu , a professor at Columbia Law School. Once a radical thought belonging only to the liberal Left, this congressional hearing will also likely ask whether smaller companies are being unfairly impaired. That was the logic when the Justice Department was claiming jurisdiction over Apple earlier this year, after the Dutch investigation into the company for favoring its own apps, like Apple Music, over third-party apps like Spotify.    We should look at how lawmakers investigate Microsoft. Slack\u2019s European Commission filing claims that Microsoft\u2019s bundling of its Teams product with the Office software suite is illegal . The fear is that Microsoft is deploying an \u201cembrace, extend, and exterminate\u201d strategy, an approach that exterminated Netscape two decades ago. As Teams is rolling out new features in catching up with Zoom, the result of the hearing might determine whether Zoom might become the next Netscape. Will we still be using Zoom for our next virtual party?         3)   Are They Safe, Are They Good?    Although the hearing isn\u2019t technically about ethics, Mark Zuckerberg is unlikely to escape the same questions he\u2019s been bombarded with over the last two years. What will be interesting to watch is whether there is any shift in his tone. Earlier this month, the Facebook CEO told employees in a town hall meeting that he was reluctant to bow down to the threats of a growing ad boycott, saying, \u201cMy guess is that all these advertisers will be back on the platform soon enough.\u201d    That is a stunning statement, given that the boycott now includes some of the largest brands out there, including Unilever, Starbucks, Levi, and Coca-Cola. Big brands are boycotting because their consumers are sick of seeing product promotions on a platform that encourages hate speech, misinformation, and false conspiracies, along with all the outrage surrounding them.    Instead, Zuckerberg saw Facebook as having a \u201creputational and a partner issue.\u201d Since the boycott makes up a small portion of the overall revenue, the defiant CEO says, \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna change our policies or approach on anything because of a threat to a small percent of our revenue, or to any percent of our revenue.\u201d    But then, maybe Zuckerberg has finally had enough and will describe a list of new features for labeling fake news and disinformation. On our Facebook app, we may finally see warning labels on bad content before reading it, just like a food label tells you how much sodium is in that pack of Cheetos before you wolf it down. Maybe a tone-deaf CEO is finally regaining some of his hearing?    4)   What Else Are You Not Telling Me?    Big Tech may or may not be broken up by regulators out of the current hearing. But what is clear is that AI algorithms by tech giants shouldn\u2019t be opaque and unquestioned. Financial audit, for instance, has been a means of providing the public with assurances of a company\u2019s integrity in its financial reports, without disclosing proprietary information and sensitive processes. Lawmakers might consider creating a new class of specialists\u2014data science auditors\u2014whose job would be to conduct algorithm audits to ensure any automatic decisions are unbiased and ethical.    Businesspeople have long despised politics, while lawmakers have scant regard for product marketing. 2020 is proving to change all that. The historical divide between the two worlds is now coming together. Our future technologies depend on it.

Josh Hawley said that, if approved, the text \"gives users the right to a lawsuit if platforms enforce their usage rules unfairly or unequally.\"<br/>The proposal comes weeks after President Donald Trump accused the networks of eliminating conservative political voices and signed a decree that could remove the legal shield that protects online services from content posted on their platforms by third parties, despite doubts about whether it can be effectively enforced.<br/>Hawley's project, presented in conjunction with fellow Republicans Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton and Mike Braun, changes the legal protection mechanism for online services, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, in case they fail to act \"in good faith\" in moderating the content published on their platforms.<br/>Legislation and decree stem from allegations by Trump and his allies about social platform bias, even though the president has a large following on Twitter and other platforms.<br/>\"Big tech companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook have used their power to silence conservatives' political discourse without any resources for users,\" Hawley said in a statement.<br/>\"Congress should act to ensure that bad actors don't get a free pass to censor and silence their opponents,\" he added.<br/>Activists and legal specialists argue that Section 230 is the cornerstone of an open internet, because it allows companies to host third-party content without fear of legal action being taken against them.<br/>Some analysts believe that efforts to regulate social media could mean the imposition of unconstitutional limits on free speech, according to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.<br/>In addition, the text could open the door to \"an infinite number of lawsuits\" against internet companies by the vague definition of good faith actions.<br/>rl/jm/piz/gm<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-12803330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6059-MBN1-JBJN-M23T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 17, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The House antitrust subcommittee will hear testimony livestreamed from Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Facebook Inc\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple Inc\u2019s Tim Cook as part of its yearlong inquiry into technology industry competition. The panel is armed with more than a million pages of internal company documents gathered as part of its probe.    Representative David Cicilline, the panel\u2019s Democratic chairman, wanted to hear from the CEOs together as he concludes his investigation into whether the companies are squashing smaller rivals and foreclosing competition. In a coup for Cicilline, the session will mark the first time these tech leaders will appear before lawmakers together. It\u2019s also Bezos\u2019s debut on the witness stand.    The participation of all four CEOs \u2013 who command enterprises with a combined value of nearly US$5tril (RM21.26tril) \u2013 signals the degree of pressure they\u2019re facing from an American public increasingly outraged by the industry\u2019s inability to police itself. They\u2019ll likely face questions about whether they\u2019ve done enough to contain privacy breaches, election misinformation and the spread of racist and violent content.    \u201cThey will not be able to simply run out the clock or duck by giving general or evasive answers,\u201d said William Kovacic, a former member of the US Federal Trade Commission who is now a professor at George Washington University.    Republicans will likely air concerns shared by US president Donald Trump that the companies hold an anti-conservative bias. Bezos has become a Trump target over his ownership of the Washington Post , which has closely covered the administration\u2019s foibles.    The hearing comes as the coronavirus pandemic leaves millions of homebound workers, parents and teachers more reliant than ever on the companies\u2019 online platforms to earn a living, buy groceries, stay connected and educate their children. And the remote video hearing may diminish some of the spectacle, depriving lawmakers of the opportunity to berate the executives in person while also potentially creating hiccups as participants fumble with their mute buttons.    The companies face a variety of complaints about their business practices, from charges that Amazon abuses its power over the third-party merchants that sell on its site to allegations that Facebook acquires companies to eliminate potential rivals. Critics have claimed that Google\u2019s dominance of search and online advertising allows it to preference its own products and squeeze publishers. And some app makers contend that Apple uses its grip on high-end devices to force apps into its payment system, extracing high fees in the process and deciding which ones survive.    The companies, all of which are expected to announce earnings the day after the hearing, have also gone on acquisitions sprees this year, waving off watchdog scrutiny. They all declined to, or didn\u2019t return requests for, comment.    Here\u2019s a look at how the hearing may break down by witness:    Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos: Market player or umpire, or both?    The world\u2019s richest man is making his debut before Congress, giving lawmakers a fresh target. Bezos should expect a tough grilling from Cicilline, who holds up the e-commerce behemoth as the prime example of how Big Tech firms use their size to prioritise their own commercial interests over customers\u2019 needs.    Cicilline has also questioned whether an Amazon lawyer told the truth in previous testimony. During a hearing last year, Cicilline slammed Amazon for undermining third-party sellers. He pressed a company lawyer, Nate Sutton, about the relationship, prompting Sutton to deny that Amazon uses individual seller data to launch competing goods.    Subsequent media reports contended that company employees did just that, causing Cicilline to suggest that Sutton may have been untruthful. He said Bezos needed to appear to clear up the matter.    Amazon faces antitrust probes by the FTC, California and the European Union, which are all looking at the company\u2019s role as a marketplace, Bloomberg has reported.    Cicilline\u2019s staffers include Lina Khan, who helped provide the intellectual underpinning of a movement for revamped competition enforcement with her legal scholarship on Amazon.    Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg: Protecting free speech or digital ad business?    The CEO who\u2019s arguably provoked the greatest amount of outrage among both parties\u2019 lawmakers, Zuckerberg has been a frequent visitor to Capitol Hill in recent years.    He gave two days of testimony on the company\u2019s privacy practices in 2018 as part of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a UK political consultancy with ties to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign harvested data on millions of the site\u2019s users without their knowledge. Last year, he faced sceptical lawmakers about the company\u2019s digital currency, Libra.    Now Zuckerberg is grappling with an ongoing advertiser boycott led by civil rights groups because of what they say are his failures to tackle racism, discrimination, voter suppression and election misinformation on his platform. Cicilline has called Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing politicians to post advertisements that are demonstrably false \u201ca business decision\u201d, rather than a move to protect free speech. Facebook last week started adding voting information labels to posts about the 2020 US election, including those shared by Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden.    Democrats may ask about Zuckerberg\u2019s meetings with Trump and whether his hands-off approach to misleading content is designed to appease the White House, which has vowed to punish social-media companies for their supposed anti-conservative bias.    Facebook is the subject of US federal antitrust probes by the Justice Department and FTC, which share jurisdiction for enforcement of competition laws but rarely double-up on targets. It\u2019s also under investigation by 45 state attorneys general. Critics have focused on how the company extracts user data to power its advertising operation, as well as its acquisition strategy.    Congress also has been asking questions about Zuckerberg\u2019s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as whether Facebook\u2019s treatment of apps it didn\u2019t buy, including Vine, Snapchat, FourSquare and TikTok, were efforts to squelch competition.    In response, Zuckerberg is preparing to argue that hindering American technological innovation only helps China, that Facebook faces threats from companies including TikTok and that the success of properties it acquired was the result of its investment.    Although Zuckerberg has previously faced lawmakers, his testimony on Wednesday will be his first focused on antitrust.    Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai: Staring down a DOJ antitrust lawsuit    While Bezos and Zuckerberg may draw the most rhetorical fireworks, Pichai may be facing the most immediate danger with US Attorney General William Barr weeks away from filing a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google for its dominance in the digital advertising market.    The company is also being investigated by a 48-state coalition led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is also focusing on digital ads. Other states are looking into the company\u2019s dominance of online search and its mobile operating system. Some of them could also join the Justice Department case.    Google has argued that regulators should establish a broad definition of the ads market, including television. The company also has pointed to the insurgent challenge from Amazon for digital ad spending.    Google is also facing criticism for the way it collects data and how it handles disinformation on services like YouTube. Google\u2019s US$2.1bil (RM8.93bil) deal for device-maker Fitbit Inc is undergoing an extended antitrust review, a takeover seen as a test for regulators.    Although Pichai previously testified before the Judiciary Committee in 2018 over anti-conservative bias, he may be best remembered in Congress for the empty chair behind the \u201cGoogle\u201d nameplate when he angered lawmakers earlier that year by skipping a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on foreign election meddling.    Apple\u2019s Tim Cook: Master of deflection amid App Store probe    Of all the CEOs, Tim Cook has been the most successful in deflecting scrutiny from Washington. He\u2019s forged strong relationships with the White House, appeared on business councils with Trump and pushed the company\u2019s trade interests. Apple has largely avoided conservatives\u2019 accusations over liberal bias. Cook has also dodged the kind of criticism that Democrats have launched against Zuckerberg for courting Republicans.    While it has stayed out of the political crossfire, Apple is the subject of a Justice Department antitrust probe for rules that require many app makers to use the company\u2019s payment system, Bloomberg has reported. App makers such as Spotify Technology SA are raising red flags, particularly in Europe, with complaints about the fees Apple charges on its App Store, especially when the company has competing offerings.    Apple defended the fees it charges developers who sell software and services through its App Store, saying recently that the 30% cut is standard industry practice and \u201cis similar in magnitude to the commission rates charged by many other app stores and digital content marketplaces\u201d.    Cook previously testified in 2013 about Apple\u2019s payment of taxes, although he hasn\u2019t appeared before Congress during the backlash to tech power that has grown during Trump\u2019s presidency.

A group of state attorneys general and Congress are just the latest to want to examine whether these companies have become too big and powerful, and a new analysis in The New York Times suggests four ways that policy makers could promote more competition at the highest levels of tech.</p><p>The most obvious approach might be to simply split up the companies to limit the ways that they stifle competition. This could mean that Google gets to keep its search engine, but has to surrender the proprietary shopping services that appear in it. Amazon might retain control of its marketplace, but perhaps it could no longer sell its own branded items. Splitting up the companies would be difficult, but the federal government has done it before, like when it targeted AT&amp;T in the 1980s in a similar way, resulting in the company shedding multiple assets. Another approach identified by the Times would be for the government to focus on potential breakups rather than implementing more broad guidelines that would affect the sector at large.</p><p> Another possibility would be the establishment of a dedicated government watchdog. This already exists in a broad range of industries like banking, aviation, and drugs. Could tech be next? Not necessarily, because there is one more idea on how to disrupt tech monopolies: unlocking the data. These companies thrive not only because of the services they provide, but also the information they collect on the people who use them. A new rule that requires companies to sell that user data to other countries could help smaller companies compete.</p><p> In today's political environment, it is hard enough to get Congress and President Donald Trump to get much done on hot-button issues, but the current appetite for regulating the technology sector is a notable departure from past years, when the companies were seen as economic engines that were best left undisturbed.</p><p> For the rest of today's tech news, head over to First Read Tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Big tech.

Because no mat...</p><p>, edition of Fox News\u2019  Your World with Neil Cavuto     NEIL CAVUTO (HOST): I want to go right now to Charlie Gasparino, because an issue that did not get as much coverage today, when Joe Biden was making his remarks, are his plan to raise taxes. Because no matter where you are right now, taxes are going to go up. And whether you love Joe Biden, or you love Donald Trump, or you hate Joe Biden \u2014 you get the drill \u2014 invariably, taxes will go up. And that is something that is indisputable \u2014 Joe Biden himself indicating that with fundraisers last night, who he acknowledged would not welcome that, but that he's got to do that. So, Charlie, what kind of taxes are we talking about?    CHARLIE GASPARINO (FOX BUSINESS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT): I think he underplayed how many taxes he will raise, and how much regulations going to go on. If Joe Biden becomes president, it will be \u2014 he will probably be on an agenda that's much more progressive than even Obama \u2014 President Obama, who he served with, he was the vice president \u2014 that President Obama enacted.    I mean, we're talking about massive regulations, we're talking about dismantling the entire Trump tax agenda \u2014which was lower taxes for higher-income people, and much lower corporate income tax. We're talking about massive amounts of regulation. Elizabeth Warren, Neil, will have a say in this new administration on various regulatory policies, maybe even tax policy. She might even be the treasury secretary, we don't even know, she's going to get something if he becomes \u2014 this is all presupposing he becomes president, it's a long time for that.    And these issues are something that could be very fertile ground for Donald Trump to attack, if he does when \u2014 during the debates. Because let me tell you something, Neil, to raise taxes massively, coming out of this recession, to ramp up regulation massively, coming out of what we're going through with a pandemic \u2014 which wasn't Donald Trump's fault. I mean, it was handed to him. You could debate whether he did a good job handling it. But, you know, the lockdowns were not Donald Trump's fault. They had to happen.    But to sort of stymie the economy, through massive government programs of regulation and taxes, it's probably not a smart thing to do. It will have an impact on the market. It's not having an impact now, it's because we're not close to it yet. But I can tell you, I know for a fact because I've been reporting this out for the last week, Wall Street brokerage firms are starting to get worried about how they're going to address the Biden economic agenda, how they're going to break it to their investors, \u201cHey, guys, and gals, this is how you have to arrange your portfolio, because certain companies are going to get crushed on this because they're going to get much higher taxes.\u201d    By the way, Joe Biden gets in there, the breakup of Big Tech, which \u2014 I know the Trump administration's making noises in that direction, going after Google, there's an active investigation of Google. There will probably be some sort of case against Google, we don't know how far-reaching it is. But if Joe Biden gets in there, and Elizabeth Warren has his ear, well guess what? They're going to attempt to break up Big Tech. And this all presupposes if Donald Trump \u2014 if Joe Biden wins, that the Senate goes to the Democrats which it will likely. And that gives him a pretty clean slate to do what he wants.    This is something investors really need to worry about. They should be talking to their financial advisers right now, because it is an issue that's going to come \u2014 that if the polls stay this way, and we're in the Fall, it's something that's going to \u2014 you're going to have to decide on what to do. Back to you, Neil.    CAVUTO: All right, Charlie Gasparino, thank you very much. And to Charlie's point, it's how people are feeling about this, and the prospects of polls in the Fall, that's when it comes closer to sticking. Markets are not really envisioning one thing or the other here. As I always like to say, markets aren't red or blue, they're green. They like making money. They made a lot of it under Bill Clinton, the Democrat. They've been making a lot of it, even with the gyrations this crazy year, under Donald Trump.

Elizabeth Warren's Friday proposal to break up big tech companies bears out my warning on this site from last September that tech companies' actions are setting the stage for a return to Teddy Roosevelt type trust-busting.</p><p>In her post explaining her plans to break up the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon, Warren referred to the trust busting efforts of the early 20thcentury. She argues that now, like a hundred years ago, monopolies are bad and competition is good. The growing tech giants that gobble up competitors wipe out the competition that is needed to make companies better and stymies innovation.</p><p>Wonder if she applies that same philosophy to government monopolies that attempt to thwart competition in the field of education? But I digress.</p><p>Months ago, the U.S. Justice Department gave notice that it too was looking into the growing concern that big tech was hurting competition and stifling the free exchange of ideas.</p><p>The concern I raised last September that social media platforms could be declared public utilities is a plan Warren embraced as something called \"platform utilities.\" Warren wrote: \"These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.\"</p><p>How will the Valley respond? Days before Warren's announcement, Face-book's Mark Zuckerberg declared a new \"privacy manifesto\" to reassure users about Facebook's concern over privacy issues. Big tech is feeling heat. However, the offered solutions won't turn down the flame. Both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal panned Zuckerberg's proposal.</p><p>Be careful of all the regulators Warren plans to send out across the Internet to force the break-ups and the post break-up adherences to whatever rules are created. There is also a danger to innovation and entrepreneurship from a swarming locust of regulators.</p><p>At the end of my trust busting column last September I asked: \"Is it too hard to imagine that either political party, sensing public frustration with the dominance of the Internet mega companies, could pull out Teddy Roosevelt's big stick and attempt to re-create some form of trust busting for the modern era?\"</p><p>Now, Warren has introduced the idea into the presidential contest, which begs the question, what will be the political re-percussions?</p><p>Silicon Valley has had a cozy relationship with Democrats, sending large portions of political donations to Democrats. Will Republicans stand up for these businesses with the possible payoff of Silicon Valley donors switching sides? Or will vote counters find that the trust busting appeals to the public and Republicans will come up with their own version of tech break-ups, presumably with fewer regulators?</p><p>And, how will Kamala Harris respond?</p><p>The California senator has good relationships in the Silicon Valley and counted on her friends there to support her presidential bid. Keeping a distance from the Warren proposals could strengthen her ties with Valley leaders at the risk of offending progressive voters who want to take big business down.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PUBREC-2206968682</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PUBREC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VXM-K5W1-JBHT-D069-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Desert Publication, Inc. and Sharon Apfelbaum Mar 19, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Public Record, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0744205X</issn><volume>Vol. 44</volume><issueNumber>No. 23</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Commentary</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Will Republicans stand up for these businesses with the possible payoff of Silicon Valley donors switching sides? Or will vote counters find that the trust busting appeals to the public and Republicans will come up with their own version of tech break-ups, presumably with fewer regulators?</p><p>And, how will Kamala Harris respond?</p><p>The California senator has good relationships in the Silicon Valley and counted on her friends there to support her presidential bid. Keeping a distance from the Warren proposals could strengthen her ties with Valley leaders at the risk of offending progressive voters who want to take big business down.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PUBREC-2206968682</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PUBREC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWM-6151-DY0W-43XY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Desert Publication, Inc. and Sharon Apfelbaum Mar 19, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Public Record, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0744205X</issn><volume>Vol. 44</volume><issueNumber>No. 23</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Commentary</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Days before Warren's announcement, Face-book's Mark Zuckerberg declared a new \"privacy manifesto\" to reassure users about Facebook's concern over privacy issues. Big tech is feeling heat. However, the offered solutions won't turn down the flame. Both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal panned Zuckerberg's proposal.</p><p>Be careful of all the regulators Warren plans to send out across the Internet to force the break-ups and the post break-up adherences to whatever rules are created. There is also a danger to innovation and entrepreneurship from a swarming locust of regulators.</p><p>At the end of my trust busting column last September I asked: \"Is it too hard to imagine that either political party, sensing public frustration with the dominance of the Internet mega companies, could pull out Teddy Roosevelt's big stick and attempt to re-create some form of trust busting for the modern era?\"</p><p>Now, Warren has introduced the idea into the presidential contest, which begs the question, what will be the political re-percussions?</p><p>Silicon Valley has had a cozy relationship with Democrats, sending large portions of political donations to Democrats. Will Republicans stand up for these businesses with the possible payoff of Silicon Valley donors switching sides? Or will vote counters find that the trust busting appeals to the public and Republicans will come up with their own version of tech break-ups, presumably with fewer regulators?</p><p>And, how will Kamala Harris respond?</p><p>The California senator has good relationships in the Silicon Valley and counted on her friends there to support her presidential bid. Keeping a distance from the Warren proposals could strengthen her ties with Valley leaders at the risk of offending progressive voters who want to take big business down.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PUBREC-2206968682</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PUBREC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X94-CD51-JBHT-D1X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Desert Publication, Inc. and Sharon Apfelbaum Mar 19, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Public Record, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0744205X</issn><volume>Vol. 44</volume><issueNumber>No. 23</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Commentary</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

At least, locally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now IV is taking that discussion to the startup community by partnering with one of Seattle's biggest startup incubators, the Start Up Really Fast (SURF) Incubator, to mentor the startups that are incubating there. The company will do its first presentation and discussion during <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.surfincubator.com/ai1ec_event/intellectual-ventures-happy-hour/?instance_id=6060\">a happy hour event at 5 p.m. Nov. 7</url> and plans to do a lot more education programs and startup mentoring sessions in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Programs like this are part of what SURF does best: Attract big local players to come work with small startups and help develop the sense of community support and mentorship opportunities that are vital to a startup's early success.</p><p>But IV has a history of taking legal action against companies that it says are using its patents without a license, and the first step in doing that is finding out what technology companies are working on, and checking to see if that technology infringes on its patents.</p><p>Checking to see if a startup's technology infringes on other patents is just one of several ways IV executives told me they plan to help the SURF startups.</p><p>While IV's patent activities - acquiring tens of thousands of patents and \"enforcing\" them by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intellectualventures.com/index.php/news\">pushing companies to pay to license them</url> - have garnered a significant amount of negative attention, the argument the company consistently makes is that it has created a marketplace for innovation that didn't exist before.</p><p>In an interview recently, IV co-founder and CEO Nathan Myhrvold <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2013/10/intellectual-ventures-ceo-myhrvold.html?page=all\">told me people are threatened by what IV is doing because it's new</url>.</p><p>\"People misunderstand our business and how we do it,\" he said.</p><p>He admitted, though, that the patent acquisition and assertion business has made IV a target for critics.</p><p>\"Look, it is innovative. Not everyone loves it, but not everyone loves innovation, either,\" he told me.</p><p>Part of IV's plan to shift the dialog from the hypercritical coverage of its patent business to the startup community is by literally working closely with the startup community.</p><p>\"Over the last year, our company has centered around promoting innovation and invention,\" said Bill Thomas, vice president of channel licensing and business development at IV.</p><p>In the past, the company has focused on outreach to the big tech companies, he said, but now they're working more closely with the startup community to better understand how IV can partner with them to support innovation.</p><p>\"We've built an entire business model around the notion that ideas have value,\" Thomas said.</p><p>And IV can certainly teach startups a thing or two about navigating the nation's complicated patent system.</p><p>IV asked the SURF startups what their biggest areas of concern around intellectual property were, and for the most part they indicated they were looking for help determining what is patentable and what is not, and the pros and cons of patenting new technology.</p><p>But inviting IV - a company whose primary business model is finding out who's using its patents and getting them to pay licensing fees - into a room full of people developing new technology has its risks.</p><p>\"We always tell entrepreneurs, don't share things that would require an NDA (nondisclosure agreement) unless you get an NDA,\" said SURF Director Neil Bergquist, who worked closely with an IV employee to get the partnership off the ground.</p><p>Inviting IV to educate and mentor startups at SURF is part of the incubator's mission to offer training and education opportunities to the startup community, he said, and is no different than inviting other big tech companies like Microsoft and Verizon - two recent presenters - in to work with the startups.</p><p>\"It gives (IV) a nexus point to have frank discussions and conversations with inventors and get beyond what's in the headlines,\" Bergquist said.</p><p>IV is in the headlines for a reason, though. Even President Barack Obama is <url normalizedValue=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2021127795_patentsivxml.html\">said to be targeting patent assertion companies like IV</url> with new rules and regulations about how patents can be applied.</p><p>Bergquist said he is confident IV is partnering with SURF for the right reasons, something IV also insists is the case.</p><p>\"We live here, this is our home, this is who we are,\" said Geoff Deane, who heads up IV's Bellevue lab, which was where companies including Kymeta, TerraPower and Evolv did work before spinning out on their own. Kymeta, which makes a high tech, mobile satellite antenna, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2013/07/kymeta-closes-on-50m-financing-round.html\">recently raised $50 million in investments</url>.</p><p>\"You find across IV this mission of encouraging adventurous thinking. It's cultural. It's important to us,\" Deane said.</p><p>Encouraging that within the Seattle startup community is important to the inventors at IV, he said.</p><p>\"How do we help people think differently, and have an environment in which this kind of innovation culture grows?\" Deane asked. \"That's what we're really about. When we create more innovative businesses in Seattle, it helps us all.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Politicians on both sides of the aisle in the US have been calling for massive, sometimes crippling, regulations[1], fines or even antitrust breakups[2] of the companies. Regulators around the globe have been fining[3] the companies billions of dollars[4]. Apparently all of that is news to Fox News contributor Juan Williams, who has taken to the august pages of The Hill to publish an op-ed calling for a backlash to big tech[5]. Dude, it's already happening. Still, perhaps Williams has a new argument that is worth considering?</p><p> I mean, there are legitimate points to be made about competition, privacy and the like. But... nope. Williams is mad that Wikileaks -- which, last I checked, is not considered a member of \"big tech\" -- leaked his cell phone number in a cache of John Podesta emails:Tell the truth \u2014 you love Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and all the rest. I did, too. Then it got personal for me. In 2016, Russian hackers, using WikiLeaks, 'doxed' me. They published my private cell phone number in a dump of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's stolen emails. I gave him my number in a private email to set up an interview. Once the number was out, my phone blew up. Pranksters harassed me. Thuggish partisans threatened me. I had to get a new phone as I was covering the final weeks of the campaign.So, uh, what does that have to do with \"Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and all the rest\"? I have absolutely no clue. And neither does Williams. But apparently, it's a reason to attack them. Oh, also because some asshole troll wrote negative reviews on his upcoming book on Amazon.Then, in 2018, a smiling man came up after I hosted a television show in Dallas to tell me how much he enjoyed 'trolling' me online with racist language. I couldn't believe he was saying this to my face. His smile made it weird. He then bragged about how he and his pals wrote phony reviews of a book I wrote on President Trump's history of racism. He wanted to bring down the book's rating on Amazon, even though it had not yet been released and he had not read it. And get this - this guy then asked for a selfie.That's certainly a good example of an asshole troll doing asshole trollish things. But according to Williams, it's proof of why we need to attack social media companies?This is just one horrible way the world has been transformed for the worse by social media.Huh? Then he just blames them all for recent mass shootings.The recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton reminded the nation of the damage done by Big Tech's refusal to take responsibility for hate speech, racism and calls to violence.Wait. What did any of those sites have to do with the mass shootings in either place? This is just a random slur for no reason at all. There is no connection at all. Indeed, there's a much stronger connection[6] between those shootings and... wait for it, Williams' own employer:There is a striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing media personalities and the language used by the Texas man who confessed to killing 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso this month. [....] An extensive New York Times review of popular right-wing media platforms found hundreds of examples of language, ideas and ideologies that overlapped with the mass killer's written statement \u2014 a shared vocabulary of intolerance that stokes fears centered on immigrants of color. The programs, on television and radio, reach an audience of millions.So, uh, Juan Williams, perhaps there should be a \"backlash\" against your own house, before you start throwing stones at others. But, nope. It's important for Fox News to keep the narrative focused on the tech companies, lest anyone take a look at its own efforts. And one way to fuel the narrative is to lie about it and then poll the public you fooled. Williams plays along:Polls now show a sharp increase in Americans who are furious with big technology companies that rake in millions while refusing to take any responsibility for the spread of hateful language, bizarre conspiracy theories, financial scams and trolls \u2014 as well as the derailing of honest political discourse.Funny, but it's Williams buddies at Fox News who keep arguing that these platforms take too much responsibility on the site and are supposedly \"banning conservatives,\" and that's why Senators like Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz keep threatening laws to stop these sites from taking down any speech. Meanwhile, you have to be horrifically and totally out of touch to argue that these sites have not been trying to deal with \"hateful language, bizarre conspiracy theories, financial scams and trolls.\" They've been trying. They've been failing, but part of that is the impossibility of the task. And part of it is the intellectually dishonest claims by folks like Williams.Start with the big tech companies' refusal to stop Russia from interfering in the 2016 election with a deluge of phony online posts designed to tear the country apart by race, religion, sexual preference, and fear of immigrants.\"Refusal to stop\" is an interesting way to rewrite history. First off, according to Fox News, all that Russia stuff is a hoax[7] and we should be holding people responsible for \"years of lies\"[8] about it. But now, Williams is claiming that tech companies should be held liable for not stopping what his colleagues insist is a total hoax? Second, it is absolutely true that social media companies were caught unaware of the extent of Russian operations on social media during the 2016 election. But it's also true that detailed data analysis showed that it was Fox News and not Russian trolls[9] who were more successful in spreading the kind of bogus propaganda the Russians were pushing. Again, Mr. Williams, perhaps check your own house first.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a leading candidate for the White House in 2020, is following Hughes' lead by campaigning on a plan to break up the big tech companies. And Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has introduced legislation to hold tech companies accountable for the fact that consumers \u2014 especially young children \u2014 are becoming addicted to tech products and harming their health in the process.Williams is so clueless he doesn't even realize that Hawley's other recently introduced bill would literally ban what Williams is requesting in terms of having companies \"take responsibility\" for hate speech online.Back in December, I wrote in this column: 'An honest 2020 election is not possible without Congress getting its hands dirty by confronting Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, the tech corporations often referred to by the acronym 'FAANG.'' The problem has only gotten worse. Congress \u2014 for the future of our democracy, please bring on the tech backlash!Again, all of the evidence says that Fox News had significantly more impact than any of the big internet companies, and Williams' sole point of complaint is that Wikileaks -- not a big tech company -- released an email with his phone number, and some random asshole online trolled him. Maybe, next time, Mr. Williams can take a look at his own employer first.Permalink[10] | Comments[11] | Email This Story[12] [ 1]: <url

TIM WALZ (D), MINNESOTA</emphasis>:  Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fires still smolder in our streets.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Demonstrators taking to the streets across the country over the death of George Floyd and past incidents in their cities.   </p><p>      And now, the police officer at the heart of the Floyd case faces charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALZ</emphasis>:  Generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world and the world is watching.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  This hour, we'll get the latest on the case from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. We'll discuss how to heal the divide between the black community and law enforcement with Andy Skoogman, head of the Minnesota chiefs of police.   </p><p>      And why in the year 2020 is race still such a flash point? We're joined by Professor Cornel West and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.   </p><p>      Then, Twitter tags the president's tweet on how to stop the Minneapolis riots for glorifying violence. We'll ask our Sunday panel about the new battle between the president and big tech.   </p><p>      And our power player of the week, this author's new work of fiction hits close to home.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LAWRENCE WRIGHT, AUTHOR, 'THE END OF OCTOBER'</emphasis>:  The question was, what would happen if we had a pandemic?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  All, right now, on \"FOX News Sunday\".  </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.   </p><p>      A nation already on edge now pushed to the brink. The coronavirus claiming more than 100,000 lives and some 40 million jobs, and now, the video recorded death of an unarmed black man in police custody acting like a match tossed on a tinderbox.   </p><p>      Tens of thousands taking to the streets overnight in more than 75 cities across the country. As some protests turn violent, the National Guard was deployed, and curfews were imposed in more than two dozen cities, the most at one time since the civil unrest of the 1960s. That is our focus this hour.   </p><p>      In a moment, we'll talk with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison about the George Floyd case and what it says about race in America in 2020.  </p><p>      But, first, let's bring in Matt Finn in Minneapolis with the latest on another night of protests across the country -- Matt.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT</emphasis>:  Chris, there's been a seemingly endless cloud of acrid smoke here in Minneapolis, a combination of fires and teargas. The city has been under siege, but it appears that law enforcement might have finally gained some ground overnight.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINN</emphasis>:  A fifth straight night of protests in Minneapolis met by a much stronger police presence. Rioters violated the curfew and clashed with officers once again, even shooting at them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACOB FREY (D), MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR</emphasis>:  You're not getting back at the police officer that tragically killed George Floyd by looting a town.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINN</emphasis>:  In Indianapolis, police investigating multiple shootings amid the protests, including one that left a person dead. In New York, protests in all five boroughs, some turn to violence. NYPD squad cars set on fire. Molotov cocktails thrown at police.   </p><p>      A state of emergency declared in Los Angeles where the unrest invoked memories of Rodney King. The mayor asking for National Guard assistance after initially resisting using troops. In the nation's capital, protests once again in front of the White House, defying the president's claim on Twitter that protesters could face vicious dogs if they cross the fence.   </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINN</emphasis>:  And in an extraordinary move, the Pentagon has said it's ready to provide military support should Minnesota's governor request their assistance. So far he has not -- Chris.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Matt Finn reporting for Minneapolis -- Matt, thank you.   </p><p>      And joining us now Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison.   </p><p>      Mr. Attorney General over the last five days we've seen rioters in Minneapolis burn down a police station, force the National Guard to retreat, and loot neighborhoods.   </p><p>      On Saturday, here's what Attorney General Barr had to say.  </p><p>      (BEGIN CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL</emphasis>:  Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda.  </p><p>      (END CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Do you have evidence that people from outside Minnesota, whether it's far left extremists or white supremacists, that outsiders are hijacking these riots in Minneapolis?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEITH ELLISON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MINNESOTA</emphasis>:  We have evidence that outsiders have been present and in some cases have played a very negative role. But I've been talking with protestors and trying to get a sense of who some of these folks are and I've heard mixed things.  </p><p>      Some of the negative stuff has come from people in Minnesota and some of it has come from people on the outside. What I'd say is we've got enough to handle on our own and that what we really need to do is refocus on justice for Mr. Floyd. And the negative behavior, looting, arson, does not help us achieve that goal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  On Friday you urged the people of Minneapolis not to react to the National Guard in the streets the way they would to local police. I want to put up something you said, please remember that this is not the group that you associate with unfair authority.  </p><p>      Question, do Blacks in Minneapolis have reason to distrust or even to fear their local police?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELLISON</emphasis>:  Sadly yes. There is a history of that. It has been repeated time and time again. I want to say that many officers are great people. I know so many of them and I think the chief is an extraordinary person and the mayor and the council deserve a lot of credit for appointing Mr. Arradondo. But it is an endemic problem in (ph) Minneapolis Police Department.  </p><p>      One problem is our Police Federation president operates as sort of an alternative chief who, I think, undermines good order in the department. So we have -- our challenge is in front of us. And I think that we can reform, we will reform, and there's a lot of great officers who want to reform. And it's good to have a chief that wants to reform.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  While you have been consistent in condemning the violence, on Friday you quoted Martin Luther King saying, riot is the way the unheard get heard. Are you suggesting that something good may come from the violence in the streets in Minneapolis this week?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELLISON</emphasis>:  No, the violence really is a negative thing. But I think what Martin Luther King was trying to say is rather -- he -- rather than simply dismiss the outrage and the rage that people express after decades -- really, really, really actually centuries, of states sponsored oppression for African Americans, let's look at the roots of that rage and try to address it rather than just pound it down with massive force.  </p><p>      I mean people are upset for a reason. And to dismiss those reasons means we're going to be relegated to dealing with them again and again and again. I mean it was -- actually it was John F. Kennedy who said, where peaceful change is made impossible, violent change is inevitable. And these are not statements about what they believe should happen, they're statements about what does happen. And so I think that's really what the spirit of the comment was.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I want to drill down on this specific case, the fired police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third degree murder, not second degree murder, which has a much stiffer penalty -- second degree does. And the big difference has to do with what he intended to do, whether he intended to kill George Floyd, I have to say we're putting up the video now and it's hard to see anything other than -- and (ph) even questionable about his intent when he kept his neck -- his knee on his neck for nine minutes including three minutes when he was no longer responsive. But, I guess, two questions.  </p><p>      First of all, are you comfortable with the charge of third degree murder, which means he didn't intend to kill him? And secondly, how do you respond to the Floyd family, members of which are saying that they would like to see you take over the prosecution of this case as a special prosecutor?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELLISON</emphasis>:  Well, let me say that we are very early in this process -- very early. It is not uncommon to amend charges. It is not uncommon to add defendants. The fact is that the investigation is still going on and it actually -- it's actually in the middle of the investigation -- or maybe even the beginning of the middle. And so I don't want anyone to conclude that these are all the charges that are going be there.  </p><p>      You know, to ask people to be patient who have suffered so long and been denied justice so long is really asking a lot of them. But if you want to make sure that this case results in a successful prosecution, you got to understand the defense attorneys who are going to be on the other side are very skillful and they will try to break every single link in the prosecutorial chain. So I ask people no (ph), don't rush this thing. Let's get this thing right.  </p><p>      Remember the Walter Scott jury hung (ph), the Rodney King jury came back acquitting the defendants. These cases which looked so obvious to us watching video tape, you get them into trial with some really good lawyers and things can go (inaudible), very different direction. So let's get this thing right.  </p><p>      As it relates to my role, I am standing behind the process at this point. And the process is that the county attorney has primary jurisdiction. I will say that I'm always there to assist the cause of justice, in anyway that I can, but I am backing up Minnesota state law, which means the primary --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELLISON</emphasis>:  -- authority at this point is the state -- is the county.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Finally, and I got a little over a minute left here so I need a quick answer from you. As Attorney General you're part of the power structure in Minnesota and you have talked in the last few days about a deep dive reform, we're going to fix a broken society. But the fact is those were exactly the same things that were being said four years ago after a police officer shot and killed Philando Castile at a traffic stop. And, in fact, Castile -- the officer who shot him, was acquitted.  </p><p>      So why, I guess, frankly, should we believe -- why should people in the community believe you anymore than the people who were making those same assurances four years ago?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELLISON</emphasis>:  Fair question. I will tell you that we did have a year long task force on preventing deadly force encounters with police. We issued a report in February. We had law enforcement community civil rights. We had people all over the state of Minnesota. This is a real serious deeply rooted problem, Chris, and I'm committed in the long term.  </p><p>      I believe the Commissioner of Public Safety John Harrington is -- and the governor is -- look, I'll tell you, you know who used to -- who called for real (ph) change? Martin Luther King called for it. He was talking about police brutality back in the '60s. This problem is not a simple problem nor is it a localized problem. We all have to embrace change and move forward. And maybe this can help us do it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Attorney General Ellison, thank you. Thanks for your time, sir. And it's good to speak with you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELLISON</emphasis>:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Up next, we'll talk with the head of Minnesota's chiefs of police association about the use of force by law enforcement and how to prevent more unnecessary deaths.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Police departments across the country are reviewing procedures after video showing the death of George Floyd while in custody.   </p><p>      Joining us now, Andy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association which represents 300 law enforcement officials in that state.   </p><p>      Mr. Skoogman, after this terrible incident this week you put out a statement that your association was, quote, \"appalled\" by Derek Chauvin, the police officer's actions and you applauded the fact that the police chief in Minneapolis fired all four of the officers involved in the incident. Why?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ANDY SKOOGMAN, MINNESOTA CHIEFS OF POLICE ASSOCIATION</emphasis>:  Well, Chris, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity.   </p><p>      You know, I think there's -- when we spoke last week, you and I spoke, I think there's a national narrative, or there had been last week, that police officers in Minnesota are being trained in the technique that Derek Chauvin used and that is simply not the case. It is the furthest from the truth that exist.   </p><p>      We did condemn the actions of the officer, not only the technique used by Derek Chauvin, but the lack of empathy shown by the other officers on the scene. We did commend Chief Medaria Arradondo from Minneapolis for his quick actions in terminating those officers and, you know, maybe lay -- lay folks don't understand but the ability to terminate an officer that quickly is unprecedented, it doesn't happen very much.   </p><p>      So, as Attorney General Keith Ellison said in your previous segment, Medaria Arradondo is a phenomenal police chief and he did all the right things here.   </p><p>      What those officers did in that video certainly not aligned with all the values that the chief of Minneapolis has worked to instill over his tenure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I want to -- I want to pick up, though, because the police report that was filed after the incident said that George Floyd, the man who was killed, resisted arrest and it also said that he died at the hospital when in fact it appears clear that he was dead at the scene. Those were both lies, which raises the question, if there had not been a video in this case, isn't it possible, even likely, that these four officers would still be on the street?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SKOOGMAN</emphasis>:  Well, Chris, you know, I really am not privy to the details in the background of this investigation, so it is hard for me to say that.  </p><p>      But you know, the videos -- I've said this for many years, I've been in this position for six and a half years, I believe that cell phone videos, I believe body worn camera videos are game changers for law enforcement. They weed out the bad apples and they can be used to show great things and -- that police officers are doing.   </p><p>      So, video is definitely the key in this case as it is in so many other cases in this day and age.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  You know, everybody now is talking about reform and fixing things, fixing things with the police, fixing things with society. I want to put up something that you said, Mr. Skoogman.   </p><p>      I think law enforcement in general is looking for ways to do a better job of connecting with communities of color.  </p><p>      You said that back in 2017 on the first anniversary of the shooting of Philando Castile at that traffic stop that we showed in the last segment. Yet here we are and it's 2020 and we have another case, apparently, of police brutality in the death of George Floyd.   </p><p>      So, I'm not -- I'm not trying to put all the blame on you, but how much should people trust these claims \"we're going to make things better\", when we keep hearing it?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SKOOGMAN</emphasis>:  Yes, no, I think a fair question.   </p><p>      You know, the Attorney General Keith Ellison in your previous segment talked just briefly at the end about a working group here in Minnesota that he and Commissioner John Harrington, the commissioner of public safety here in Minnesota, they co-shared a working group. It was -- they got together last year, it's a diverse group, including law enforcement, stakeholders, community members, family members of individuals who had been shot and killed by law enforcement here in Minnesota over a number of years.   </p><p>      That working group was actually run by Ron Davis, who ran the COPS Office under -- in the President Obama administration.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Look, I just want -- I need to interrupt because we are short on time here. I can hear people watching this on TV right now and saying, good, we're glad you did the task force, all of that. George Floyd is still dead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SKOOGMAN</emphasis>:  Absolutely, Chris. It's entirely tragic. What we are trying to do is I think we just need to continue to work together. With got to get rid of this us versus them mentality. We got to continue the training that we put together here in Minnesota and across the country around implicit bias, training isn't everything but it's certainly a start.   </p><p>      We need to do a better job with law enforcement and in communities of color about recruiting new officers. I'm extremely concerned about the future of law enforcement across the country. We are seeing fewer and fewer people who want to be police officers, whether -- no matter what race they are, and that's a huge problem.   </p><p>      And I do think that -- the final thing that I can say about this is I believe that the arbitration process in our country needs to be changed. We have officers that violate public policy, they have a pattern of doing that, police chiefs and sheriffs try to fire them and our courts reinstate those jobs. So, there is a whole thing to look at from a variety of angles, Chris.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mr. Skoogman, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us.   </p><p>      Up next, we'll hear from two leading African-American voices on the racial tensions playing out on America's streets. Professor Cornel West on what can be done to heal the divide, and Republican Senator Tim Scott on whether this racial flash point will turn out any differently.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  This latest racial flashpoint may have started in the streets of Minneapolis but the angry reaction quickly spread to cities across the country. We want to discuss the state of race in America with two leading African-Americans.  </p><p>      First, Professor Cornel West of Harvard Divinity School.   </p><p>      Professor, I want to play three videos for you and then get your reaction.  </p><p>      First the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in February while jogging in a suburban neighborhood in Georgia.  </p><p>      Then, that incident in New York Central Park on Monday where a White woman called the police after a Black man asked her to put her dog on a leash.   </p><p>      Here's a clip.  </p><p>      (BEGIN CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  An African-American man threatening my life. I'm sorry. I can't hear (INAUDIBLE). I'm being threatened by a man at The Ramble. Please send the cops immediately.  </p><p>      (END CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And then the alleged murder of George Floyd on a Minneapolis street. Professor West, what's going on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORNEL WEST, HARVARD DIVINITY SCHOOL PROFESSOR</emphasis>:  Well, I think what we're seeing here is the ways in which the vicious legacy of white supremacy manifests in organized hatred, greed, and corruption. If we're dealing with moral meltdown and spiritual breakdown and the sad thing about this moment, my dear brother Chris, is that we are witnessing the collapse of the legitimacy of leadership; the political class, the economic class, the professional class. That's the deeper crisis.  </p><p>      And so, the beautiful thing is we're seeing citizens who are caring and concerned. They're hitting the streets. So you kill a black brother, each life, not matter what color, precious. We're seeing black, white, red, yellow, especially young people, coming together. That's a beautiful thing.  </p><p>      Many decades ago that wasn't the case. But the problem is we have a system --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Well, let me --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEST</emphasis>:  -- that's not responding and seems to be unable to respond. That's the problem my brother.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Professor, you said that this week we're witnessing America as your words a fair -- a failed social experiment. Now, clearly, there is continued racial inequality and as we can see continued racial injustice. But calling America a failed social experiment and some of the things you just said, isn't that going way too far?   </p><p>      I mean, you look back over the 50 years since 1968, which this has reminded a lot of people of, there has been substantial progress in terms of black education and black income. We elected an African American president and we re-elected an African American president.   </p><p>      Clearly, we can see it's not enough, but it's not nothing either.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEST</emphasis>:  Oh, no, no. I'm not saying there hasn't been progress. But as Brother Malcolm used to say, and, of course, your beloved father had that dialogue with Malcolm in '59, you don't stab folks in the back nine inches, pull it out three inches, and say you're making progress.   </p><p>      Yes, you made progress, especially for the black middle class. I'm talking about the Black poor and working class -- all poor and working class.  </p><p>      You see, brother Chris, I am a Revolutionary Christian looks at the world through the lens of the cross, not Pontius Pilate. I don't measure black progress in terms of black elites, how many black faces you have in high places. That's wonderful. That's beautiful. I'm concerned about the least of these.  </p><p>      I'm concerned about that Jesus that went into the temple and ran out the money changers. He was concerned about the least of these.   </p><p>      That's the traditional Martin King. That's the traditional of John Coltrane and Ella Baker. That's what we need now but the problem is we've got a system, my brother, that rationalizes legalized loot. Wall Street greed, Wall Street crimes, legalized murder too often.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEST</emphasis>:  And keep in mind, when -- when police kill fellow citizens, they kill white brothers and sisters too. Their lives are precious too. That's wrong too. But too many black and brown have been killed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I want to -- I -- I -- OK.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEST</emphasis>:  You see -- you see my point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  So you -- we saw pictures of the riots and you said it's a beautiful thing that people are taking to the street.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEST</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And you called -- this week you called the -- the death of George Floyd a -- let me get the words right -- a lynching at the highest level. You also said, thank God that we have people in the streets.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEST</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Here, on the other hand, is what Atlanta's African-American mayor said about what's going on in her streets this week.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, (D), ATLANTA, GEORGIA</emphasis>:  This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos. A protest has purpose.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I got about two minutes here, Professor. Do you think that what we're seeing in the streets, riots, violence, looting in African-American neighborhoods, do you think that's doing any good for African-Americans?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEST</emphasis>:  No, most of my fellow citizens, God bless them, that are in the streets are there peaceful, who are there marching. And when it does spill over into violence, looting is wrong. But legalized looting is wrong too. Murder is wrong. Legalized murder is wrong too. I look at the wickedness at high places first and then keep track of the least of these.  </p><p>      We all have individual responsibility, but we're living in a system that seems to be unable to reform itself. And when you have such a moment, you get violent spillover. That's the concern.  </p><p>      If we're more concerned about the property and spillover than the poverty, decrepit school system, dilapidated housing, massive unemployment and under-employment, we're going to be doing this every five, every 10, every 20 years. And you and I are old enough to know, though, brother, going all the way back to the Harvard years. I remember when you were arrested right there in front of the Cambridge Prison itself of '69. We go over and over again. We got to make sure we don't pass it on to our younger generation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Yes, but I -- let me just say, because I got to -- I -- I got to move -- I got to move on. I was there as a reporter. I wasn't there as a protestor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEST</emphasis>:  No, no, I know. Oh, yes. Oh, no, I understand. I understand that, brother. I understand.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  But, Professor, thank you. Thank -- thanks for joining us today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEST</emphasis>:  Thank you so much, though, brother.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Now let's turn Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.  </p><p>      Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC)</emphasis>:  Thanks, Chris.  </p><p>      I want to ask you the same question that I asked at the start of Professor West, which is, you know, we've got the Arbery shooting, we've got that awful incident in Central Park, and then we've got this devastating video of what that white police officer to do George Floyd.  </p><p>      Same question, what is going on?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Well, there's no doubt that what we're having the opportunity to see is the absolute devastation of too many African-American males, over too many decades, frankly.   </p><p>      George Floyd, thankfully, was in a position where people were able to film it and video it and that's why we are having this conversation. Had it not been for someone videotaping this, it would not have happened. If it had not been for Mr. Arbery being videotaped, it would not have happened. Even though it happened, none of us would have known about it.  </p><p>      The Walter Scott case in 2015, had it not been for a video, it would not have happened. And when you read the police reports, you come to the conclusion that it didn't happen the way it happened until you have a video that substantiates what it is.   </p><p>      And perhaps, Chris, what we should focus on, as you said earlier, was the New York City woman who said to the Harvard black man that, I'm going to call the police and say my life is being threatened. What that says is that there is a lower value on an African-American male life than it is on a white woman's life. And that is part of what played out there and that is part of the significant thing that we need to focus on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Well, I would -- let me -- Senator, let me -- Senator, let me pick up on that --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Certainly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Because this does seem -- this does seem, sir, to be a systemic problem.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And I want to put up some numbers that -- that indicate that. Young men of color are two and a half times more likely to die at the hands of police than white men. And police use of force -- this is astonishing to me -- is the sixth leading cause of death for young men of color.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  How do you explain that, sir?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Well, I -- I can only explain that by saying that there's too much abuse within law enforcement towards African-American men. I have been a victim, seven times stopped in one year as an elected official just driving while black. So I'm not going to pretend that there isn't a major racial component.  </p><p>      But what I will suggest to you is what I believe is actually happening. Thank God for video. Thank God for film. Think God for this conversation that we're having today and thank God we're having it in America because if you weren't not in America, you probably couldn't have this conversation.  </p><p>      It is not a binary choice, progress or regression. You can actually have both at the same time. We're seeing a lot of goodwill. We're seeing a diversity in the protests that we did not see in the '60s.  </p><p>      John Lewis would be proud of the non-violent protesters that we're seeing today, black, white, red and brown. What he was saying and what I am saying -- what he -- actually, what he did say is that any violence in the midst of this -- these protests --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Simply takes away from the actual issue, which is that George Floyd lost his life. It looks like murder to me. Let's get the investigation started and finished so that we will have more confidence in a legal system that we can all say, this is a system where the woman has a blindfold on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Senator -- Senator, I want to follow upon on something that Professor West said, which is that, you know, we have to talk not only about what is going on in the riots in the streets, we have to talk about what is going on among people at the highest levels of our society. And I want to put up some tweets that were sent out by President Trump this week.  </p><p>      The first one, this was about the riots in Minneapolis. These thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd. Any difficulty and we will assume control. But when the looting starts, the shooting starts.  </p><p>      And that I want to put up another series of tweets, Senator Scott, and these were after there were protests that turned violent at the White House on Friday night. The president praised the Secret Service. He said, nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs and the most ominous weapons I have ever seen. Many Secret Service agents just waiting for action. We put the young ones on the front line, sir, they love it, and good practice.  </p><p>      Now, obviously, Secret Service has to protect the president, but, you know, you -- you've -- you're not as old as I am or Cornel West, but you have seen racial tensions in this country. When we hear about the looting starts, the shooting starts, when you hear about vicious police dogs, is that kind of talk from the president of the United States constructive at this moment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Well, those are not constructive tweets, without any question. I'll say this, I spoke with the president yesterday morning and he and I had a good conversation about what are the next steps. I told him what I'm going to tell you, which is, Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified, in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd. Those tweets are very helpful. It is helpful when you say what you said yesterday, which is that it's important for us to recognize the benefit of non-violent protests. It is helpful when you respond to my request to have the Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Barr, have a commission and a conversation around race and justice in this nation. Mr. President, it is helpful when you lead with compassion. And the tweets that I saw yesterday were far better.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  OK, but -- but -- but, Senator Scott, I've got a minute left, did you -- did you -- did you, sir, did you speak truth to power and did you say to him, when you talk about thugs, when you talk about looting and shooting and you talk about vicious police dogs, what did you say about that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  I used similar words that you just used, which as we talked about the fact that there's a constructive way to -- to have a dialogue with a nation and, in a similar fashion, that we had a conversation after Charlottesville. The president will listen if you engage him with the facts of the issue and then you ask him to focus on -- his attention on making progress as one nation under God.   </p><p>      I think is tweets yesterday were far more responsive after the conversation. I'm thankful that we can have that conversation. We don't always agree. I didn't agree with some of his tweets beforehand, but we have the ability to sit down and dialogue on how we move this nation forward and not let the detractors get in the way of what has been a pretty phenomenal couple of years economically.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Senator --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Yes, Chris.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Senator Scott, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. Always good to talk with you, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss rising tensions over racial inequality and the president's war with Twitter.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MIKE FREEMAN, HENNEPIN COUNTY ATTORNEY</emphasis>:  I'm here to announce the former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin is in custody.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN)</emphasis>:  The absolute chaos. This is not grieving and this is not -- this is not making a statement that we fully acknowledge needs to be fixed.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Reaction from Minnesota officials to the alleged murder of George Floyd by a white policeman this week.   </p><p>      And it's time now for our Sunday group.   </p><p>      Former Trump National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, anchor of \"THE DAILY BRIEFING,\" Dana Perino, and Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service.   </p><p>      The country is going through a tough time right now and minorities are going through the toughest time. I want to put up some statistics.   </p><p>      More than 100,000 people died from the coronavirus. More than 40 million jobs lost. And if you want to get a sense of how that has especially hitting minorities, in Minnesota, more than one-third of Covid cases are African-Americans, although they're just 6 percent of the population of that state.  </p><p>      And then, of course, now the George Floyd case.   </p><p>      Mo, is that why we're seeing these violent demonstrations across the country at this moment? Is this a kind of perfect storm?   </p><p>      MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC </p><p> SERVICE, FORMER DNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, AND FOX NEWS </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONTRIBUTOR</emphasis>:  Look, this is probably one of the saddest moments in this country in my lifetime, right? It's all -- it's everything you just said coming together, colliding in -- in -- in a terrible way. And it is disproportionately hurting people of color and minority communities.   </p><p>      I think it's important to recognize, though, that there is a difference between the protesters who are out there making a legitimate point fighting for justice, and the rioters and looters who are exploiting the death of George Floyd and exploiting this moment for whatever reason that they are. We're seeing the best and worst of America right now. We are seeing police officers marching with protesters. We're seeing police officers take a knee in prayer at these protests with the protesters.   </p><p>      But we're also seeing these violent clashes between criminals and the police, and rioters and the police.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELLEITHEE</emphasis>:  And the police overreaching into many cases. So it is -- you know, we could sure use some leadership to try to bring us all together, bring us all together the way past presidents have, but it -- we also all have to take the responsibility ourselves. And -- and that starts in the streets, it starts in the communities.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  OK, let me -- let me bring in -- we've got limited time here, Mo, so let me bring in Dana.   </p><p>      How do you explain this explosion of violence across the country far from where this terrible incident happened in Minneapolis?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DANA PERINO, ANCHOR, 'THE DAILY BRIEFING'</emphasis>:  Well, you know, I am humble enough to say that I -- I don't know. And I think a lot of people this morning wake up and just feel, again, this incredible sense of sadness and a little bit of fear and some humility is in order from leadership, but also some leadership is needed.   </p><p>      I believe the nation needs a circuit breaker. There -- we have to figure out a way to deal with what we can going forward. A lot of this frustration was borne out because of something that happened on Monday where Derek Chauvin kneeled on the officers neck -- on -- on George Floyd's neck. He died. Many other people -- if this had been anyone else, that person would have been put in jail under probable cause until charged. That didn't happen. And we can't go back and fix that.   </p><p>      I do think that right now local leadership needs to figure out a way to get everybody in a room and start talking about how they can do things, because a government can't heal a heart, but it can do a couple of things well, which is, one, restore law and order --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERINO</emphasis>:  But also figure out a way to mete out justice, consistently, every day, equally, for everyone.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And then there is the escalating battle between President Trump and the social media giants, and that escalated this week with the -- Twitter tagging two of the president's tweets, one on the alleged corruption of mail-in voting, and then the other one about when the looting starts, the shooting starts.   </p><p>      Here's the president responding to that.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</emphasis>:  The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress and it blacklists, shadow ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Michael, what do you think of the president's decision to try to regulate, to try to limit Twitter? Is it good policy? And, realistically, in the midst of a presidential election, and also the Senate and of the House election, what are the chances that he's actually going to be able to do this?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN</emphasis>:  I agree with what Attorney General Barr said late last week, I think Friday. He said that this is not just Twitter but all the social media companies essentially pulled a bait and switch on the country, that they rose to prominence, they grew their markets by saying that we're -- they were neutral platforms, that anybody could say anything, and they were indifferent to and had nothing to do with content.   </p><p>      And now that they have great market power, you know, huge audiences, gigantic user bases and so on, they've decided to influence the message that takes place on their platform. There're not -- they're no longer neutral platforms, and so they've changed their behavior and -- and there are, you know, government regulations that would have -- have applied to them had they been sort of honest about this all along and they're going to apply to them now. So I think what the attorney general said was right and this is -- this is long overdue. We're -- we're addressing -- we're addressing a fact that has been in place for a long time, but we've been pretending it wasn't true for at least five or ten years.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Dana, I want to look at this from -- from both sides. Is this a -- a fight that it's smart for the president to take on in the midst of his campaign for re-election? And what about Twitter? Was it smart for them to start tagging or putting alerts in front of presidential tweets? Don't you go down a very slippery slope there if you're going to call of the president, don't you have to call out Joe Biden? If you're going to call out Republicans, don't you have to call out Democrats?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERINO</emphasis>:  Well, I absolutely think it's a win for President Trump and a loser for Twitter, for Twitter's decision that they made this week. There are many people on the -- on the right who believe that the game is rigged. And the president said, all right, I think that the refs are working for the other side. So by taking this action, he decided to work the refs a little bit.   </p><p>Twitter then decided to take a tweet about mail-in voting -- of all the tweets that you could have chosen, they decide to take on this one on mail-in voting. They had to then fact-check themselves twice to clarify what they meant.   </p><p>      And I do think that when you are fact-checking the president of the United States but not the leader of Iran, then you have absolutely opened up Pandora's Box. And, you know, FaceBook separates itself by saying, like, we are not going to fact-check the president.   </p><p>      I think one of the things -- like speaking to what Michael Anton just said, I don't think that these social media companies should look at President Trump as anything different than a citizen. I understand his words carry a lot of weight --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERINO</emphasis>:  But you have to apply these things equally. And if not, they're going to face some regulation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I've got about a minute left for you, Mo. Your thoughts about what's going on here both on the side of Twitter tagging the president and the president talking about trying to establish some limits on what Twitter and the other social media giants can do.   </p><p>      Mo, are you with us?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELLEITHEE</emphasis>:  Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I think we lost him.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELLEITHEE</emphasis>:  You cut out there for a second, Chris.  </p><p>      No, no, I apologize, I -- you got me know.   </p><p>      Look, I -- you know, to Dana's point, you know, if they were going to treat him like any other citizen, he would have been kicked off the platform by now, right? The president of the United States has been violating the terms of service and we've seen Twitter apply those terms of service to other people. This isn't censorship, this is them calling him out for violating those terms of service.  </p><p>      But the content's still there. People can still see it for themselves whether it's when he's being faxed checked or when he's glorifying violence. But I do think they're going to have to do a better job of applying it across the board.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Thank you, panel, see you next Sunday. A very busy, very difficult week.   </p><p>      Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" the author whose brand-new novel foresees much of the pandemic we're going through right now.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  You can't deny the eerie timing of a new novel about a fictitious global pandemic. The book parallels, with uncanny accuracy, much of what we're seeing right now.   </p><p>      Here's our \"Power Player of the Week.\"   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LAWRENCE WRIGHT, AUTHOR, 'THE END OF OCTOBER'</emphasis>:  The experts in the field all were quite apprised of what would happen when something like this comes into our society.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE (voice over)</emphasis>:  Lawrence Wright finished his latest novel, \"The End of October,\" in 2019, but it reads like a front page in 2020, a deadly virus spreading globally, scientists fighting with politicians, a stock market plunged, even a vice president put in charge of the response.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  It wasn't prophecy, Chris, as has been said. It was, you know, just -- the question was, what would happen if -- if we had a pandemic? You know, a really virulent, highly contagious one?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE (on camera)</emphasis>:  How unsettling is it right now to be watching the news and see so much of it follow your plot?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  Well, it's dismaying. And I hope it stops. My book is pretty bleak.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE (voice over)</emphasis>:  The virus in the book begins in Indonesia, then spreads to Mecca, as millions of pilgrims arrive for the annual hajj, and doctors race to save lives.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  I was fascinated by the ingenuity and, as I saw it, the heroism of people like my hero who go out into these hot zones and face these novel diseases with so little preparation and no understanding of what might happen. To me, that's just terrifying.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Celebrities like Taylor Swift and Brad Pitt succumbed to the virus, but not everyone.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE (on camera)</emphasis>:  So, I'm reading your book and suddenly I pop up grilling the Russians foreign minister.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  How did that happen?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  I employed certain personalities in the book, some of them real, you being one. You're lucky I didn't kill you off like I did with Anderson Cooper. So I don't want you to complain too much, Chris.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE (voice over)</emphasis>:  Wright is no stranger to writing about disasters. He won a non-fiction Pulitzer Prize for \"The Looming Tower,\" on the rise of Islamic terrorism and the run-up to 9/11. He says a famous movie director inspired his latest book.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  Ridley Scott wanted me to write a script about how civilization would collapse. And, you know, I thought about nuclear war and so on, but I just thought, pandemic.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  But Wright says he misjudged the end of civilization part, and thank goodness.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  I didn't give enough credit to individuals for voluntarily sequestering themselves in their homes for months at a time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE (on camera)</emphasis>:  In terms of lives and livelihoods, how do you think this all ends?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WRIGHT</emphasis>:  Like a war or a depression, a pandemic is like an x-ray into our society. We can see all the broken places. We know where our shortcomings are. And we have the opportunity to remedy them.   </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And now the countdown to the countdown.   </p><p>      As you may know, I've also written a new book. It's called \"Countdown 1945:  The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days that Changed the World.\" It's a behind-the-scenes look at how America's top politicians, scientists, and military leaders pulled together to make an astonishing breakthrough that ended the Second World War.   </p><p>      Here's a look at what was happening as summer began 75 years ago.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE</emphasis>:  Victory in Europe had been won.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE (voice over)</emphasis>:  By early June, the allies are preparing to invade Japan. An operation projected to take more than a year and kill hundreds of thousands on both sides.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE</emphasis>:  When Dr. J.R. Oppenheimer arrives --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  The team behind the Manhattan Project says, if the U.S. decides to drop an atom bomb on the enemy, it should strike as soon as possible and without warning, hitting a key military target in a major city.   </p><p>      But before Truman could decide how to proceed, he waits for the first test of an atom bomb in the New Mexico desert.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE</emphasis>:  The most momentous man-made explosion of all time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  The test of a plutonium bomb is a success. The weapon works. Truman must now make the toughest decision any president has ever faced.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  The book comes out on June 9th, a week from Tuesday, and we'll have a special hour documentary on the \"Countdown\" next Sunday, June 7th.   </p><p>      Please visit foxnewssunday.com for more on both.   </p><p>      And for the latest on the protests and unrest across the country, keep it right here on your local Fox station and Fox News Channel.   </p><p>      But that's it for today.

The coronavirus claiming more than 100,000 lives and some 40 million jobs, and now, the video recorded death of an unarmed black man in police custody acting like a match tossed on a tinderbox.</p><p>Tens of thousands taking to the streets overnight in more than 75 cities across the country. As some protests turn violent, the National Guard was deployed, and curfews were imposed in more than two dozen cities, the most at one time since the civil unrest of the 1960s. That is our focus this hour.</p><p>In a moment, we'll talk with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison about the George Floyd case and what it says about race in America in 2020.</p><p>But, first, let's bring in Matt Finn in Minneapolis with the latest on another night of protests across the country -- Matt.</p><p>MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, there's been a seemingly endless cloud of acrid smoke here in Minneapolis, a combination of fires and teargas. The city has been under siege, but it appears that law enforcement might have finally gained some ground overnight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FINN:  A fifth straight night of protests in Minneapolis met by a much stronger police presence. Rioters violated the curfew and clashed with officers once again, even shooting at them.</p><p>JACOB FREY (D), MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR:  You're not getting back at the police officer that tragically killed George Floyd by looting a town.</p><p>FINN:  In Indianapolis, police investigating multiple shootings amid the protests, including one that left a person dead. In New York, protests in all five boroughs, some turn to violence. NYPD squad cars set on fire. Molotov cocktails thrown at police.</p><p>A state of emergency declared in Los Angeles where the unrest invoked memories of Rodney King. The mayor asking for National Guard assistance after initially resisting using troops. In the nation's capital, protests once again in front of the White House, defying the president's claim on Twitter that protesters could face vicious dogs if they cross the fence.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FINN:  And in an extraordinary move, the Pentagon has said it's ready to provide military support should Minnesota's governor request their assistance. So far he has not -- Chris.</p><p>WALLACE:  Matt Finn reporting for Minneapolis -- Matt, thank you.</p><p>And joining us now Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison.</p><p>Mr. Attorney General over the last five days we've seen rioters in Minneapolis burn down a police station, force the National Guard to retreat, and loot neighborhoods.</p><p>On Saturday, here's what Attorney General Barr had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda.</p><p>(END CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Do you have evidence that people from outside Minnesota, whether it's far left extremists or white supremacists, that outsiders are hijacking these riots in Minneapolis?</p><p>KEITH ELLISON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MINNESOTA:  We have evidence that outsiders have been present and in some cases have played a very negative role. But I've been talking with protestors and trying to get a sense of who some of these folks are and I've heard mixed things.</p><p>Some of the negative stuff has come from people in Minnesota and some of it has come from people on the outside. What I'd say is we've got enough to handle on our own and that what we really need to do is refocus on justice for Mr. Floyd. And the negative behavior, looting, arson, does not help us achieve that goal.</p><p>WALLACE:  On Friday you urged the people of Minneapolis not to react to the National Guard in the streets the way they would to local police. I want to put up something you said, please remember that this is not the group that you associate with unfair authority.</p><p>Question, do Blacks in Minneapolis have reason to distrust or even to fear their local police?</p><p>ELLISON:  Sadly yes. There is a history of that. It has been repeated time and time again. I want to say that many officers are great people. I know so many of them and I think the chief is an extraordinary person and the mayor and the council deserve a lot of credit for appointing Mr. Arradondo. But it is an endemic problem in (ph) Minneapolis Police Department.</p><p>One problem is our Police Federation president operates as sort of an alternative chief who, I think, undermines good order in the department. So we have -- our challenge is in front of us. And I think that we can reform, we will reform, and there's a lot of great officers who want to reform. And it's good to have a chief that wants to reform.</p><p>WALLACE:  While you have been consistent in condemning the violence, on Friday you quoted Martin Luther King saying, riot is the way the unheard get heard. Are you suggesting that something good may come from the violence in the streets in Minneapolis this week?</p><p>ELLISON:  No, the violence really is a negative thing. But I think what Martin Luther King was trying to say is rather -- he -- rather than simply dismiss the outrage and the rage that people express after decades -- really, really, really actually centuries, of states sponsored oppression for African Americans, let's look at the roots of that rage and try to address it rather than just pound it down with massive force.</p><p>I mean people are upset for a reason. And to dismiss those reasons means we're going to be relegated to dealing with them again and again and again. I mean it was -- actually it was John F. Kennedy who said, where peaceful change is made impossible, violent change is inevitable. And these are not statements about what they believe should happen, they're statements about what does happen. And so I think that's really what the spirit of the comment was.</p><p>WALLACE:  I want to drill down on this specific case, the fired police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third degree murder, not second degree murder, which has a much stiffer penalty -- second degree does. And the big difference has to do with what he intended to do, whether he intended to kill George Floyd, I have to say we're putting up the video now and it's hard to see anything other than -- and (ph) even questionable about his intent when he kept his neck -- his knee on his neck for nine minutes including three minutes when he was no longer responsive. But, I guess, two questions.</p><p>First of all, are you comfortable with the charge of third degree murder, which means he didn't intend to kill him? And secondly, how do you respond to the Floyd family, members of which are saying that they would like to see you take over the prosecution of this case as a special prosecutor?</p><p>ELLISON:  Well, let me say that we are very early in this process -- very early. It is not uncommon to amend charges. It is not uncommon to add defendants. The fact is that the investigation is still going on and it actually -- it's actually in the middle of the investigation -- or maybe even the beginning of the middle. And so I don't want anyone to conclude that these are all the charges that are going be there.</p><p>You know, to ask people to be patient who have suffered so long and been denied justice so long is really asking a lot of them. But if you want to make sure that this case results in a successful prosecution, you got to understand the defense attorneys who are going to be on the other side are very skillful and they will try to break every single link in the prosecutorial chain. So I ask people no (ph), don't rush this thing. Let's get this thing right.</p><p>Remember the Walter Scott jury hung (ph), the Rodney King jury came back acquitting the defendants. These cases which looked so obvious to us watching video tape, you get them into trial with some really good lawyers and things can go (inaudible), very different direction. So let's get this thing right.</p><p>As it relates to my role, I am standing behind the process at this point. And the process is that the county attorney has primary jurisdiction. I will say that I'm always there to assist the cause of justice, in anyway that I can, but I am backing up Minnesota state law, which means the primary --</p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>ELLISON:  -- authority at this point is the state -- is the county.</p><p>WALLACE:  Finally, and I got a little over a minute left here so I need a quick answer from you. As Attorney General you're part of the power structure in Minnesota and you have talked in the last few days about a deep dive reform, we're going to fix a broken society. But the fact is those were exactly the same things that were being said four years ago after a police officer shot and killed Philando Castile at a traffic stop. And, in fact, Castile -- the officer who shot him, was acquitted.</p><p>So why, I guess, frankly, should we believe -- why should people in the community believe you anymore than the people who were making those same assurances four years ago?</p><p>ELLISON:  Fair question. I will tell you that we did have a year long task force on preventing deadly force encounters with police. We issued a report in February. We had law enforcement community civil rights. We had people all over the state of Minnesota. This is a real serious deeply rooted problem, Chris, and I'm committed in the long term.</p><p>I believe the Commissioner of Public Safety John Harrington is -- and the governor is -- look, I'll tell you, you know who used to -- who called for real (ph) change? Martin Luther King called for it. He was talking about police brutality back in the '60s. This problem is not a simple problem nor is it a localized problem. We all have to embrace change and move forward. And maybe this can help us do it.</p><p>WALLACE:  Attorney General Ellison, thank you. Thanks for your time, sir. And it's good to speak with you.</p><p>ELLISON:  Thank you, sir.</p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll talk with the head of Minnesota's chiefs of police association about the use of force by law enforcement and how to prevent more unnecessary deaths.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Police departments across the country are reviewing procedures after video showing the death of George Floyd while in custody.</p><p>Joining us now, Andy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association which represents 300 law enforcement officials in that state.</p><p>Mr. Skoogman, after this terrible incident this week you put out a statement that your association was, quote, \"appalled\" by Derek Chauvin, the police officer's actions and you applauded the fact that the police chief in Minneapolis fired all four of the officers involved in the incident. Why?</p><p>ANDY SKOOGMAN, MINNESOTA CHIEFS OF POLICE ASSOCIATION:  Well, Chris, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity.</p><p>You know, I think there's -- when we spoke last week, you and I spoke, I think there's a national narrative, or there had been last week, that police officers in Minnesota are being trained in the technique that Derek Chauvin used and that is simply not the case. It is the furthest from the truth that exist.</p><p>We did condemn the actions of the officer, not only the technique used by Derek Chauvin, but the lack of empathy shown by the other officers on the scene. We did commend Chief Medaria Arradondo from Minneapolis for his quick actions in terminating those officers and, you know, maybe lay -- lay folks don't understand but the ability to terminate an officer that quickly is unprecedented, it doesn't happen very much.</p><p>So, as Attorney General Keith Ellison said in your previous segment, Medaria Arradondo is a phenomenal police chief and he did all the right things here.</p><p>What those officers did in that video certainly not aligned with all the values that the chief of Minneapolis has worked to instill over his tenure.</p><p>WALLACE:  I want to -- I want to pick up, though, because the police report that was filed after the incident said that George Floyd, the man who was killed, resisted arrest and it also said that he died at the hospital when in fact it appears clear that he was dead at the scene. Those were both lies, which raises the question, if there had not been a video in this case, isn't it possible, even likely, that these four officers would still be on the street?</p><p>SKOOGMAN:  Well, Chris, you know, I really am not privy to the details in the background of this investigation, so it is hard for me to say that.</p><p>But you know, the videos -- I've said this for many years, I've been in this position for six and a half years, I believe that cell phone videos, I believe body worn camera videos are game changers for law enforcement. They weed out the bad apples and they can be used to show great things and -- that police officers are doing.</p><p>So, video is definitely the key in this case as it is in so many other cases in this day and age.</p><p>WALLACE:  You know, everybody now is talking about reform and fixing things, fixing things with the police, fixing things with society. I want to put up something that you said, Mr. Skoogman.</p><p>I think law enforcement in general is looking for ways to do a better job of connecting with communities of color.</p><p>You said that back in 2017 on the first anniversary of the shooting of Philando Castile at that traffic stop that we showed in the last segment. Yet here we are and it's 2020 and we have another case, apparently, of police brutality in the death of George Floyd.</p><p>So, I'm not -- I'm not trying to put all the blame on you, but how much should people trust these claims \"we're going to make things better\", when we keep hearing it?</p><p>SKOOGMAN:  Yes, no, I think a fair question.</p><p>You know, the Attorney General Keith Ellison in your previous segment talked just briefly at the end about a working group here in Minnesota that he and Commissioner John Harrington, the commissioner of public safety here in Minnesota, they co-shared a working group. It was -- they got together last year, it's a diverse group, including law enforcement, stakeholders, community members, family members of individuals who had been shot and killed by law enforcement here in Minnesota over a number of years.</p><p>That working group was actually run by Ron Davis, who ran the COPS Office under -- in the President Obama administration.</p><p>WALLACE:  Look, I just want -- I need to interrupt because we are short on time here. I can hear people watching this on TV right now and saying, good, we're glad you did the task force, all of that. George Floyd is still dead.</p><p>SKOOGMAN:  Absolutely, Chris. It's entirely tragic. What we are trying to do is I think we just need to continue to work together. With got to get rid of this us versus them mentality. We got to continue the training that we put together here in Minnesota and across the country around implicit bias, training isn't everything but it's certainly a start.</p><p>We need to do a better job with law enforcement and in communities of color about recruiting new officers. I'm extremely concerned about the future of law enforcement across the country. We are seeing fewer and fewer people who want to be police officers, whether -- no matter what race they are, and that's a huge problem.</p><p>And I do think that -- the final thing that I can say about this is I believe that the arbitration process in our country needs to be changed. We have officers that violate public policy, they have a pattern of doing that, police chiefs and sheriffs try to fire them and our courts reinstate those jobs. So, there is a whole thing to look at from a variety of angles, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mr. Skoogman, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us.</p><p>Up next, we'll hear from two leading African-American voices on the racial tensions playing out on America's streets. Professor Cornel West on what can be done to heal the divide, and Republican Senator Tim Scott on whether this racial flash point will turn out any differently.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  This latest racial flashpoint may have started in the streets of Minneapolis but the angry reaction quickly spread to cities across the country. We want to discuss the state of race in America with two leading African-Americans.</p><p>First, Professor Cornel West of Harvard Divinity School.</p><p>Professor, I want to play three videos for you and then get your reaction.</p><p>First the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in February while jogging in a suburban neighborhood in Georgia.</p><p>Then, that incident in New York Central Park on Monday where a White woman called the police after a Black man asked her to put her dog on a leash.</p><p>Here's a clip.</p><p>(BEGIN CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  An African-American man threatening my life. I'm sorry. I can't hear (INAUDIBLE). I'm being threatened by a man at The Ramble. Please send the cops immediately.</p><p>(END CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  And then the alleged murder of George Floyd on a Minneapolis street. Professor West, what's going on?</p><p>CORNEL WEST, HARVARD DIVINITY SCHOOL PROFESSOR:  Well, I think what we're seeing here is the ways in which the vicious legacy of white supremacy manifests in organized hatred, greed, and corruption. If we're dealing with moral meltdown and spiritual breakdown and the sad thing about this moment, my dear brother Chris, is that we are witnessing the collapse of the legitimacy of leadership; the political class, the economic class, the professional class. That's the deeper crisis.</p><p>And so, the beautiful thing is we're seeing citizens who are caring and concerned. They're hitting the streets. So you kill a black brother, each life, not matter what color, precious. We're seeing black, white, red, yellow, especially young people, coming together. That's a beautiful thing.</p><p>Many decades ago that wasn't the case. But the problem is we have a system --</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, let me --</p><p>WEST:  -- that's not responding and seems to be unable to respond. That's the problem my brother.</p><p>WALLACE:  Professor, you said that this week we're witnessing America as your words a fair -- a failed social experiment. Now, clearly, there is continued racial inequality and as we can see continued racial injustice. But calling America a failed social experiment and some of the things you just said, isn't that going way too far?</p><p>I mean, you look back over the 50 years since 1968, which this has reminded a lot of people of, there has been substantial progress in terms of black education and black income. We elected an African American president and we re-elected an African American president.</p><p>Clearly, we can see it's not enough, but it's not nothing either.</p><p>WEST:  Oh, no, no. I'm not saying there hasn't been progress. But as Brother Malcolm used to say, and, of course, your beloved father had that dialogue with Malcolm in '59, you don't stab folks in the back nine inches, pull it out three inches, and say you're making progress.</p><p>Yes, you made progress, especially for the black middle class. I'm talking about the Black poor and working class -- all poor and working class.</p><p>You see, brother Chris, I am a Revolutionary Christian looks at the world through the lens of the cross, not Pontius Pilate. I don't measure black progress in terms of black elites, how many black faces you have in high places. That's wonderful. That's beautiful. I'm concerned about the least of these.</p><p>I'm concerned about that Jesus that went into the temple and ran out the money changers. He was concerned about the least of these.</p><p>That's the traditional Martin King. That's the traditional of John Coltrane and Ella Baker. That's what we need now but the problem is we've got a system, my brother, that rationalizes legalized loot. Wall Street greed, Wall Street crimes, legalized murder too often.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK.</p><p>WEST:  And keep in mind, when -- when police kill fellow citizens, they kill white brothers and sisters too. Their lives are precious too. That's wrong too. But too many black and brown have been killed.</p><p>WALLACE:  I want to -- I -- I -- OK.</p><p>WEST:  You see -- you see my point?</p><p>WALLACE:  So you -- we saw pictures of the riots and you said it's a beautiful thing that people are taking to the street.</p><p>WEST:  Absolutely.</p><p>WALLACE:  And you called -- this week you called the -- the death of George Floyd a -- let me get the words right -- a lynching at the highest level. You also said, thank God that we have people in the streets.</p><p>WEST:  Absolutely.</p><p>WALLACE:  Here, on the other hand, is what Atlanta's African-American mayor said about what's going on in her streets this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, (D), ATLANTA, GEORGIA:  This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos. A protest has purpose.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  I got about two minutes here, Professor. Do you think that what we're seeing in the streets, riots, violence, looting in African-American neighborhoods, do you think that's doing any good for African-Americans?</p><p>WEST:  No, most of my fellow citizens, God bless them, that are in the streets are there peaceful, who are there marching. And when it does spill over into violence, looting is wrong. But legalized looting is wrong too. Murder is wrong. Legalized murder is wrong too. I look at the wickedness at high places first and then keep track of the least of these.</p><p>We all have individual responsibility, but we're living in a system that seems to be unable to reform itself. And when you have such a moment, you get violent spillover. That's the concern.</p><p>If we're more concerned about the property and spillover than the poverty, decrepit school system, dilapidated housing, massive unemployment and under-employment, we're going to be doing this every five, every 10, every 20 years. And you and I are old enough to know, though, brother, going all the way back to the Harvard years. I remember when you were arrested right there in front of the Cambridge Prison itself of '69. We go over and over again. We got to make sure we don't pass it on to our younger generation.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, but I -- let me just say, because I got to -- I -- I got to move -- I got to move on. I was there as a reporter. I wasn't there as a protestor.</p><p>WEST:  No, no, I know. Oh, yes. Oh, no, I understand. I understand that, brother. I understand.</p><p>WALLACE:  But, Professor, thank you. Thank -- thanks for joining us today.</p><p>WEST:  Thank you so much, though, brother.</p><p>WALLACE:  Now let's turn Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.</p><p>Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC):  Thanks, Chris.</p><p>I want to ask you the same question that I asked at the start of Professor West, which is, you know, we've got the Arbery shooting, we've got that awful incident in Central Park, and then we've got this devastating video of what that white police officer to do George Floyd.</p><p>Same question, what is going on?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, there's no doubt that what we're having the opportunity to see is the absolute devastation of too many African-American males, over too many decades, frankly.</p><p>George Floyd, thankfully, was in a position where people were able to film it and video it and that's why we are having this conversation. Had it not been for someone videotaping this, it would not have happened. If it had not been for Mr. Arbery being videotaped, it would not have happened. Even though it happened, none of us would have known about it.</p><p>The Walter Scott case in 2015, had it not been for a video, it would not have happened. And when you read the police reports, you come to the conclusion that it didn't happen the way it happened until you have a video that substantiates what it is.</p><p>And perhaps, Chris, what we should focus on, as you said earlier, was the New York City woman who said to the Harvard black man that, I'm going to call the police and say my life is being threatened. What that says is that there is a lower value on an African-American male life than it is on a white woman's life. And that is part of what played out there and that is part of the significant thing that we need to focus on.</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I would -- let me -- Senator, let me -- Senator, let me pick up on that --</p><p>SCOTT:  Certainly.</p><p>WALLACE:  Because this does seem -- this does seem, sir, to be a systemic problem.</p><p>SCOTT:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  And I want to put up some numbers that -- that indicate that. Young men of color are two and a half times more likely to die at the hands of police than white men. And police use of force -- this is astonishing to me -- is the sixth leading cause of death for young men of color.</p><p>SCOTT:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  How do you explain that, sir?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, I -- I can only explain that by saying that there's too much abuse within law enforcement towards African-American men. I have been a victim, seven times stopped in one year as an elected official just driving while black. So I'm not going to pretend that there isn't a major racial component.</p><p>But what I will suggest to you is what I believe is actually happening. Thank God for video. Thank God for film. Think God for this conversation that we're having today and thank God we're having it in America because if you weren't not in America, you probably couldn't have this conversation.</p><p>It is not a binary choice, progress or regression. You can actually have both at the same time. We're seeing a lot of goodwill. We're seeing a diversity in the protests that we did not see in the '60s.</p><p>John Lewis would be proud of the non-violent protesters that we're seeing today, black, white, red and brown. What he was saying and what I am saying -- what he -- actually, what he did say is that any violence in the midst of this -- these protests --</p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>SCOTT:  Simply takes away from the actual issue, which is that George Floyd lost his life. It looks like murder to me. Let's get the investigation started and finished so that we will have more confidence in a legal system that we can all say, this is a system where the woman has a blindfold on.</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator -- Senator, I want to follow upon on something that Professor West said, which is that, you know, we have to talk not only about what is going on in the riots in the streets, we have to talk about what is going on among people at the highest levels of our society. And I want to put up some tweets that were sent out by President Trump this week.</p><p>The first one, this was about the riots in Minneapolis. These thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd. Any difficulty and we will assume control. But when the looting starts, the shooting starts.</p><p>And that I want to put up another series of tweets, Senator Scott, and these were after there were protests that turned violent at the White House on Friday night. The president praised the Secret Service. He said, nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs and the most ominous weapons I have ever seen. Many Secret Service agents just waiting for action. We put the young ones on the front line, sir, they love it, and good practice.</p><p>Now, obviously, Secret Service has to protect the president, but, you know, you -- you've -- you're not as old as I am or Cornel West, but you have seen racial tensions in this country. When we hear about the looting starts, the shooting starts, when you hear about vicious police dogs, is that kind of talk from the president of the United States constructive at this moment?</p><p>SCOTT:  Well, those are not constructive tweets, without any question. I'll say this, I spoke with the president yesterday morning and he and I had a good conversation about what are the next steps. I told him what I'm going to tell you, which is, Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified, in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd. Those tweets are very helpful. It is helpful when you say what you said yesterday, which is that it's important for us to recognize the benefit of non-violent protests. It is helpful when you respond to my request to have the Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Barr, have a commission and a conversation around race and justice in this nation. Mr. President, it is helpful when you lead with compassion. And the tweets that I saw yesterday were far better.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK, but -- but -- but, Senator Scott, I've got a minute left, did you -- did you -- did you, sir, did you speak truth to power and did you say to him, when you talk about thugs, when you talk about looting and shooting and you talk about vicious police dogs, what did you say about that?</p><p>SCOTT:  I used similar words that you just used, which as we talked about the fact that there's a constructive way to -- to have a dialogue with a nation and, in a similar fashion, that we had a conversation after Charlottesville. The president will listen if you engage him with the facts of the issue and then you ask him to focus on -- his attention on making progress as one nation under God.</p><p>I think is tweets yesterday were far more responsive after the conversation. I'm thankful that we can have that conversation. We don't always agree. I didn't agree with some of his tweets beforehand, but we have the ability to sit down and dialogue on how we move this nation forward and not let the detractors get in the way of what has been a pretty phenomenal couple of years economically.</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator --</p><p>SCOTT:  Yes, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Scott, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. Always good to talk with you, sir.</p><p>SCOTT:  Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss rising tensions over racial inequality and the president's war with Twitter.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE FREEMAN, HENNEPIN COUNTY ATTORNEY:  I'm here to announce the former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin is in custody.</p><p>GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN):  The absolute chaos. This is not grieving and this is not -- this is not making a statement that we fully acknowledge needs to be fixed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Reaction from Minnesota officials to the alleged murder of George Floyd by a white policeman this week.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.</p><p>Former Trump National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, anchor of \"THE DAILY BRIEFING,\" Dana Perino, and Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service.</p><p>The country is going through a tough time right now and minorities are going through the toughest time. I want to put up some statistics.</p><p>More than 100,000 people died from the coronavirus. More than 40 million jobs lost. And if you want to get a sense of how that has especially hitting minorities, in Minnesota, more than one-third of Covid cases are African-Americans, although they're just 6 percent of the population of that state.</p><p>And then, of course, now the George Floyd case.</p><p>Mo, is that why we're seeing these violent demonstrations across the country at this moment? Is this a kind of perfect storm?</p><p>MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE, FORMER DNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Look, this is probably one of the saddest moments in this country in my lifetime, right? It's all -- it's everything you just said coming together, colliding in -- in -- in a terrible way. And it is disproportionately hurting people of color and minority communities.</p><p>I think it's important to recognize, though, that there is a difference between the protesters who are out there making a legitimate point fighting for justice, and the rioters and looters who are exploiting the death of George Floyd and exploiting this moment for whatever reason that they are. We're seeing the best and worst of America right now. We are seeing police officers marching with protesters. We're seeing police officers take a knee in prayer at these protests with the protesters.</p><p>But we're also seeing these violent clashes between criminals and the police, and rioters and the police.</p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  And the police overreaching into many cases. So it is -- you know, we could sure use some leadership to try to bring us all together, bring us all together the way past presidents have, but it -- we also all have to take the responsibility ourselves. And -- and that starts in the streets, it starts in the communities.</p><p>WALLACE:  OK, let me -- let me bring in -- we've got limited time here, Mo, so let me bring in Dana.</p><p>How do you explain this explosion of violence across the country far from where this terrible incident happened in Minneapolis?</p><p>DANA PERINO, ANCHOR, \"THE DAILY BRIEFING\":  Well, you know, I am humble enough to say that I -- I don't know. And I think a lot of people this morning wake up and just feel, again, this incredible sense of sadness and a little bit of fear and some humility is in order from leadership, but also some leadership is needed.</p><p>I believe the nation needs a circuit breaker. There -- we have to figure out a way to deal with what we can going forward. A lot of this frustration was borne out because of something that happened on Monday where Derek Chauvin kneeled on the officers neck -- on -- on George Floyd's neck. He died. Many other people -- if this had been anyone else, that person would have been put in jail under probable cause until charged. That didn't happen. And we can't go back and fix that.</p><p>I do think that right now local leadership needs to figure out a way to get everybody in a room and start talking about how they can do things, because a government can't heal a heart, but it can do a couple of things well, which is, one, restore law and order --</p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>PERINO:  But also figure out a way to mete out justice, consistently, every day, equally, for everyone.</p><p>WALLACE:  And then there is the escalating battle between President Trump and the social media giants, and that escalated this week with the -- Twitter tagging two of the president's tweets, one on the alleged corruption of mail-in voting, and then the other one about when the looting starts, the shooting starts.</p><p>Here's the president responding to that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress and it blacklists, shadow ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Michael, what do you think of the president's decision to try to regulate, to try to limit Twitter? Is it good policy? And, realistically, in the midst of a presidential election, and also the Senate and of the House election, what are the chances that he's actually going to be able to do this?</p><p>MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN:  I agree with what Attorney General Barr said late last week, I think Friday. He said that this is not just Twitter but all the social media companies essentially pulled a bait and switch on the country, that they rose to prominence, they grew their markets by saying that we're -- they were neutral platforms, that anybody could say anything, and they were indifferent to and had nothing to do with content.</p><p>And now that they have great market power, you know, huge audiences, gigantic user bases and so on, they've decided to influence the message that takes place on their platform. There're not -- they're no longer neutral platforms, and so they've changed their behavior and -- and there are, you know, government regulations that would have -- have applied to them had they been sort of honest about this all along and they're going to apply to them now. So I think what the attorney general said was right and this is -- this is long overdue. We're -- we're addressing -- we're addressing a fact that has been in place for a long time, but we've been pretending it wasn't true for at least five or ten years.</p><p>WALLACE:  Dana, I want to look at this from -- from both sides. Is this a -- a fight that it's smart for the president to take on in the midst of his campaign for re-election? And what about Twitter? Was it smart for them to start tagging or putting alerts in front of presidential tweets? Don't you go down a very slippery slope there if you're going to call of the president, don't you have to call out Joe Biden? If you're going to call out Republicans, don't you have to call out Democrats?</p><p>PERINO:  Well, I absolutely think it's a win for President Trump and a loser for Twitter, for Twitter's decision that they made this week. There are many people on the -- on the right who believe that the game is rigged. And the president said, all right, I think that the refs are working for the other side. So by taking this action, he decided to work the refs a little bit.</p><p>Twitter then decided to take a tweet about mail-in voting -- of all the tweets that you could have chosen, they decide to take on this one on mail-in voting. They had to then fact-check themselves twice to clarify what they meant.</p><p>And I do think that when you are fact-checking the president of the United States but not the leader of Iran, then you have absolutely opened up Pandora's Box. And, you know, FaceBook separates itself by saying, like, we are not going to fact-check the president.</p><p>I think one of the things -- like speaking to what Michael Anton just said, I don't think that these social media companies should look at President Trump as anything different than a citizen. I understand his words carry a lot of weight --</p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>PERINO:  But you have to apply these things equally. And if not, they're going to face some regulation.</p><p>WALLACE:  I've got about a minute left for you, Mo. Your thoughts about what's going on here both on the side of Twitter tagging the president and the president talking about trying to establish some limits on what Twitter and the other social media giants can do.</p><p>Mo, are you with us?</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.</p><p>WALLACE:  I think we lost him.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  You cut out there for a second, Chris.</p><p>No, no, I apologize, I -- you got me know.</p><p>Look, I -- you know, to Dana's point, you know, if they were going to treat him like any other citizen, he would have been kicked off the platform by now, right? The president of the United States has been violating the terms of service and we've seen Twitter apply those terms of service to other people. This isn't censorship, this is them calling him out for violating those terms of service.</p><p>But the content's still there. People can still see it for themselves whether it's when he's being faxed checked or when he's glorifying violence. But I do think they're going to have to do a better job of applying it across the board.</p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you, panel, see you next Sunday. A very busy, very difficult week.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" the author whose brand-new novel foresees much of the pandemic we're going through right now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  You can't deny the eerie timing of a new novel about a fictitious global pandemic. The book parallels, with uncanny accuracy, much of what we're seeing right now.</p><p>Here's our \"Power Player of the Week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAWRENCE WRIGHT, AUTHOR, \"THE END OF OCTOBER\":  The experts in the field all were quite apprised of what would happen when something like this comes into our society.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over):  Lawrence Wright finished his latest novel, \"The End of October,\" in 2019, but it reads like a front page in 2020, a deadly virus spreading globally, scientists fighting with politicians, a stock market plunged, even a vice president put in charge of the response.</p><p>WRIGHT:  It wasn't prophecy, Chris, as has been said. It was, you know, just -- the question was, what would happen if -- if we had a pandemic? You know, a really virulent, highly contagious one?</p><p>WALLACE (on camera):  How unsettling is it right now to be watching the news and see so much of it follow your plot?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Well, it's dismaying. And I hope it stops. My book is pretty bleak.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over):  The virus in the book begins in Indonesia, then spreads to Mecca, as millions of pilgrims arrive for the annual hajj, and doctors race to save lives.</p><p>WRIGHT:  I was fascinated by the ingenuity and, as I saw it, the heroism of people like my hero who go out into these hot zones and face these novel diseases with so little preparation and no understanding of what might happen. To me, that's just terrifying.</p><p>WALLACE:  Celebrities like Taylor Swift and Brad Pitt succumbed to the virus, but not everyone.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera):  So, I'm reading your book and suddenly I pop up grilling the Russians foreign minister.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  How did that happen?</p><p>WRIGHT:  I employed certain personalities in the book, some of them real, you being one. You're lucky I didn't kill you off like I did with Anderson Cooper. So I don't want you to complain too much, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over):  Wright is no stranger to writing about disasters. He won a non-fiction Pulitzer Prize for \"The Looming Tower,\" on the rise of Islamic terrorism and the run-up to 9/11. He says a famous movie director inspired his latest book.</p><p>WRIGHT:  Ridley Scott wanted me to write a script about how civilization would collapse. And, you know, I thought about nuclear war and so on, but I just thought, pandemic.</p><p>WALLACE:  But Wright says he misjudged the end of civilization part, and thank goodness.</p><p>WRIGHT:  I didn't give enough credit to individuals for voluntarily sequestering themselves in their homes for months at a time.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera):  In terms of lives and livelihoods, how do you think this all ends?</p><p>WRIGHT:  Like a war or a depression, a pandemic is like an x-ray into our society. We can see all the broken places. We know where our shortcomings are. And we have the opportunity to remedy them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE:  And now the countdown to the countdown.</p><p>As you may know, I've also written a new book. It's called \"Countdown 1945:  The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days that Changed the World.\" It's a behind-the-scenes look at how America's top politicians, scientists, and military leaders pulled together to make an astonishing breakthrough that ended the Second World War.</p><p>Here's a look at what was happening as summer began 75 years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Victory in Europe had been won.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over):  By early June, the allies are preparing to invade Japan. An operation projected to take more than a year and kill hundreds of thousands on both sides.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When Dr. J.R. Oppenheimer arrives --</p><p>WALLACE:  The team behind the Manhattan Project says, if the U.S. decides to drop an atom bomb on the enemy, it should strike as soon as possible and without warning, hitting a key military target in a major city.</p><p>But before Truman could decide how to proceed, he waits for the first test of an atom bomb in the New Mexico desert.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The most momentous man-made explosion of all time.</p><p>WALLACE:  The test of a plutonium bomb is a success. The weapon works. Truman must now make the toughest decision any president has ever faced.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  The book comes out on June 9th, a week from Tuesday, and we'll have a special hour documentary on the \"Countdown\" next Sunday, June 7th.</p><p>Please visit foxnewssunday.com for more on both.</p><p>And for the latest on the protests and unrest across the country, keep it right here on your local Fox station and Fox News Channel.</p><p>But that's it for today.

The State Department is monitoring reports of a poison gas attack in a rebel-held town near Syria's capital of Damascus.  Video from Syrian activists claims to show victims, including children, getting hosed down.  A human's rights group says dozens have been killed in the attack.  And we'll stay on top of this story.  </p><p>Now to the face-off for trade between the U.S. and China, which has sent tension soaring and market stumbling.  In the latest move, President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese exports, something that nation has vowed to fight.  A trade war without serious consequences for consumers and businesses and investors.  </p><p>Joining me now, President Trump's new top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow.  </p><p>Larry, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER:  Thank you, Chris.  Thanks a lot.</p><p>WALLACE:  You keep saying that there is no trade war, that this is part of negotiations between the U.S. and China.  But the Chinese history says there are any talks and says, quote, China is fully prepared to hit back forcefully and without hesitation.  </p><p>And here was Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We will continue to have discussions.  But there is the potential of a trade war.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Now, you're a market guy.  The markets dropped 572 points on Friday.  Clearly, there are a lot of serious investors who think there's a real chance of a trade war.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I suppose so.  I mean, I know there are some jitters out there.  I don't think there's any trade or insight.  Just technically, we have taken no actions, you understand that.  And even the Thursday announcement for President Trump, he asked Ambassador Lighthizer to consider additional actions.  </p><p>It's a long process.  Several months here.  We put our papers, we take public comments.  We then review the public comments and then decisions will be made.  </p><p>So far, no tariffs and no action has been enacted.  Point number two.  I believe China's response to the U.S. actions, which is a complaint against stealing intellectual property against forced technology transfers, I think that's a legitimate complaint, so does the rest of the world.</p><p>But China's response was highly unsatisfactory and I think that's unfortunate.  We do have constant communication with them, to be sure.  I hope their side picks up on this.  But so far, stonewalling us is not the answer.  </p><p>Listen -- </p><p>WALLACE:  And that's what they're doing is stonewalling?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Basically.  I mean, lots of rhetoric out there, like, you know, old communist party type stuff.  The whole world, please, the whole world knows China has been violating trade laws for many years and President Trump is the guy calling them on it and he's right to do so.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Is the president -- you say he's calling them on it.  Is he bluffing or will he impose tariffs if China doesn't change its trade practice?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I -- he's not bluffing.  I mean, there are a number of tools at his disposal.  </p><p>Just one thing there -- people are saying Trump, Trump, Trump.  This is a problem caused by China, not a problem caused by President Trump, and I would go so far as to say, Trump is there to fix the problem.  </p><p>If you talk to the president as I have, he regards himself as a free trader, all right?  As do I.  But his argument, and it's a good one, you can't have free trade, which is pro-growth around the world unless China brings down its barriers, opens up its markets --  </p><p>WALLACE:  But, Larry --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and stop this technology steal that they're doing.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Nobody is saying that China isn't to blame here.  The question is, the president's response.  As you point out, you are a tree trader.  </p><p>Here is what you said just last month when President Trump announced his first round of tariffs.  And this wasn't an announcement.  This was real imposition of tariffs on aluminum and steel.  Here you are.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Tariff hikes are prosperity killers.  They always have been and they always will be.  Tariffs are taxes and the ones who suffer most are the users.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  So who should we believe, that Larry Kudlow or this one?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I thought you might run that.  I'm opposed to blanket tariffs and that's where it first started.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But that's what the president is talking about?</p><p>KUDLOW:  No, he has changed his view, even on the national security action.  We've got a lot of exceptions and a lot of carve-outs.</p><p>WALLACE:  But you're not talking about carve-outs or exceptions for China.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, hang on.  So, I oppose the blanket tariffs, I always do.  </p><p>Now, with respect to China, I've always been a hard-liner on China, and while I don't like tariffs, sometimes there is no substitution for putting tariffs into the discussion, into the process.  That is part of the quiver of arrows that the president has.  </p><p>Look, he's a great negotiator.  He has a whole history of that.  But in this process, tariffs have to be part of it.  There's no two ways about it.  Then, hopefully, there will be discussions and hopefully, in just the next two months, the Chinese will come seriously back to the table.  </p><p>President Trump has told me, we were together a long time on Thursday and Friday.  He likes President Xi.  They get along.  He respects President Xi as a negotiator, but they have not played by the rules, Chris.  This has been going on.  </p><p>Technology is everything to this country, everything -- our entrepreneurship, our innovation, our future growth, our productivity.  We cut corporate tax rates precisely to unlock the animal spirits around technology.  </p><p>We cannot let China willy-nilly steal our technology.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK.  You said on Friday that you were going to announce a trade coalition of the willing today, other countries that were going to join us in taking on China.  Who are they?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't (ph) -- I didn't make this announcement.  I'm just observing.  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, no, you set on Friday, between 24 and 48 hours I'm going to announce the trade coalition of the willing.  Do you have them?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  They are coming to us.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Who are they?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Japan, Europe, Australia, Canada.  They have come to us.  The president actually -- </p><p>WALLACE:  They are not talking about tariffs.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Sure they are.  </p><p>WALLACE:  No, they're not.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Sure they are.</p><p>WALLACE:  Japan said that they were going to join us in taking this issue to the world trade organization and to object to Chinese trade practices just as free traders have done for years.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  But if China maintains its third world status, as they have in the WTO, then other countries are free to take whatever actions they want.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But -- if I just depress this, has any other country joined us in threatening tariffs if China doesn't clean up its act?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I can't answer that.  I don't even want to answer that.  </p><p>All I'm saying is my trade coalition of the willing will put the whole world behind the United States' actions against China, and this is going to have a big effect on China.  China does not want to lose face, but China does not want to be regarded as the enemy in trade for the entire world.  </p><p>The WTO, by the way, is one of the processes.  Ambassador Lighthizer has that in his releases.  So, we'll work there.  We'll work directly with the Chinese.  </p><p>But I want to make this clear: President Trump is a great negotiator.  The tariffs, which none of us particularly want, may -- I say may -- have to be part of this discussion and argument.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK, I want to pick up on that because ever since I first met we go back a ways.  And ever since I first met you in the Reagan White House, you have been an apostle of growth.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  You say that growth cures income inequality.  Growth cures budget deficits.  But if China and if -- let me just finish, if China and the U.S. slapped tariffs on each other, even President Trump said that could hurt the economy.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So, we may take a hit, and, you know what, ultimately, we're going to be much stronger for it.  But it's something we had to do.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  And here's a line from an article: Trump should also examine the historical record on tariffs because they have almost never worked as intended and almost always delivered an unhappy ending.  </p><p>Larry, I assume you agree with that because you wrote it.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I do.  I wrote it.  I agree with it.  It's still my position.  The president knows that.  We had lots of conversations.  </p><p>But around this action, I'm going to stay with us -- the path to free-trade has to include China acting in concert with first world nations, with (INAUDIBLE) nations.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Even if we end up in trade were?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  We're not going to end up in a trade war.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, they aren't backing off.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, we haven't even enacted anything yet.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  So, let's go easy on the trade war.  We got several months here.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But you say the president isn't bluffing.  You say tariffs have to be part of the discussion.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  I do.</p><p>WALLACE:  So, if they don't back off -- </p><p>KUDLOW:  We will see.  We will see.  </p><p>Remember this: the U.S. economy is doing very well now.  By the way, at the time, you learned your lesson as well when we first spoke back in 1980.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I listened.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You've been very good on that, I'm proud of you.  </p><p>Now, having said all that, we are growing at over 3 percent annual rate for the last three quarters.  This is investment spending, equipment spending is booming.  Jobs are rising.  Consumer confidence is high.  Small business confidence is high.  </p><p>All I'm saying is forget trade wars.  Why don't you just look at the progress of the American economy?  </p><p>WALLACE:  I --  </p><p>KUDLOW:  We can take --  </p><p>WALLACE:  That's the concern though that people have is this is going to put a brake on that --   </p><p>KUDLOW:  It cant -- it can't possibly.  It can't possibly.  The sums here are too small.  But the principals are very strong.  Do you see what I'm saying?  </p><p>WALLACE:  I understand that but as you well know trade war sometime escalate.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I haven't seen a trade war since Smoot Hawley, of 1930s.  And even I was -- </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  I have to ask you to other questions and we've got three other minutes to get them in.  </p><p>One of the drags on the market right now is the concern that Washington is going to regulate big tech.  Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Facebook, is going to testify before Congress this week.  </p><p>Does the president want to see Washington regulate how Facebook uses its users' data, what it does with its users' data and also how it screens ads?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I think the president right now will be intently watching the congressional hearings.  I think that's going to be step number one.  I think he has his doubts whether Facebook has violated protocols, I don't know.  We will see.  </p><p>I wish Mr. Zuckerberg -- I hope he comes to Congress wearing a nice business suit and shirt and tie, so he will be taking more seriously.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Not a t-shirt?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Right, I'm tired of that t-shirt, hoody stuff.  He does run one of the largest corporations of the world, for heaven's sakes.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  But we (INAUDIBLE) agree to regulate -- </p><p>KUDLOW:  We are waiting on Congress.  Let's see what comes out of that before the administration takes any particular action.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  Amazon -- the president keeps hitting the company for failing to pay taxes, for its deal with the Post Office.  </p><p>Here he was on Air Force One.  </p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, Amazon is just not on an even playing field.  You know, they have a tremendous lobbying effort in addition to having \"The Washington Post,\" which is, as far as I'm concerned, another lobbyist.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  In fact, the Post Office makes money off Amazon.  It doesn't lose money.  And Amazon collects taxes in all 45 states.  </p><p>So, is this just talk or is the president seriously considering taking action against Amazon?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  The president is asking that Amazon and all the Internet retailers have a level playing field with respect to tax.  And while it's true -- </p><p>WALLACE:  But Amazon is one of the companies that does have a level playing field.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  In recent years, they've done much better in collecting state taxes, sales taxes.  However, they don't always connect local sales taxes, and we've had too much protection in this area.  They are not a fledgling industry anymore.  </p><p>So, what the president is saying is raising this issue for discussion.  I don't think it's aimed at anybody.  We just need a level playing field and you're going to have a court decision very soon, Chris, that's going to make this more explicit.  </p><p>WALLACE:  OK, I've got a minute left.  There is talk this morning that the president may ask Congress to undo part of the $1.3 trillion spending bill to cut back some of the expenditures that were made.  Is that true and how far along are you on that?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  It's playing in the White House.  My friend, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, he and I are on -- I'm an ex-OMB guy.  I feel his pain.  </p><p>We are looking at an enhanced rescission package.  I'm not going to use numbers.  This is all around town.  </p><p>I think the Republican Party on the Hill has finally figured out.  It's really not a bad idea to trim some spending because, after all, spending can lead to deficits and spending interferes with the economy.  And President Trump is a deregulator and a tax cutter.  So, we want and much more modest government role.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Larry, thank you.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Thanks for your time.  Always good to talk with you, and I keep listening and learning.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  You've been great.  You've been absolutely one of the best people down through the years.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  That's where I blew all of my credibility.  Thank you, Larry.  Always a pleasure.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  That was a joke and a compliment.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Thank you.</p><p>Up next, reaction from one of the top Democrats in the House, Congressman Joe Crowley on his party's message for the 2018 midterms and talk he might replace Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker of the House.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  A look at the cherry blossoms along the tidal basin here in D.C., which have peak bloom this week and were just beautiful.  </p><p>Washington always has its eye on the next election and as we get closer to the 2018 midterms, many are predicting a blue wave with Democrats taking back the House and possibly the Senate.  </p><p>Joining us now, New York Congressman Joe Crowley, chair of the House Democratic Caucus and the subject of growing chatter among Democrats as a possible replacement for Nancy Pelosi after the election.  He's not going to like me saying that.  </p><p>Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. </p><p>REP. JOE CROWLEY (D-NY), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN:  Thanks, Chris.  Good to be with you.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You just heard Larry Kudlow.  What do you think of his arguments for potentially, potentially using tariffs against China?  And if not that, how do you propose we stop their unfair trading practice?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, Chris, I'm also a member of the Ways and Means Committee and so I do recognize there's a role for tariffs in the economy.  But I think what really it has created is a great deal more chaos.  People really don't know what the president's plans are or what Mr. Kudlow's plan is as it relates to China, and the trade war that has now begun, or at least the initial start of that has begun.  </p><p>I think that's left a lot of Americans with uncertainty about what this -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  What should they do?  If you are not going to use tariffs, how do you stop behind the unfair trade practices, the theft of intellectual property?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, first of all, let me just say for the record that when it came to the issue of China, I did not vote for normal trade with China.  I believe they were not economically nor politically mature enough to be dealing with us on the same par.  And having said, I think that's panned out to be true.  </p><p>But I do think we have to do this in a much more calculated way, and I -- with more of a plan.  Let's have an understanding of what the ultimate goal is here.  Is the goal to raise the price of products here in the United States or to lower the price of agricultural products in the United States?  That is the overall goal, because that's what some of the effect may very well be if China retaliates in this war.  Where is ultimately going?  That's what we don't understand about this.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Donald Trump won the presidency because he convinced a lot of voters, including a lot of Democratic voters in the industrial heartland that he had a better idea for how to build the economy, how to get them jobs than Hillary Clinton did.  Now, Democrats are going into the 2018 midterms with what they call a better deal.  </p><p>Here is Nancy Pelosi on that.  </p><p>(BEGN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Democrats are offering a better deal, better jobs, better wages, a better future.  A better deal is founded on strong values that we share.  Strong values fueled by fresh ideas.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Forgive me, Congressman, but that sounds like standard Democratic boilerplate.  So, give me one fresh idea that Democrats are offering voters for November.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Fresh idea?  First of all, Chris, Donald Trump did not win by a lot of Democratic votes in the Midwest.  It was fractions of a vote that actually are responsible for him being president of the United States today.  </p><p>But what I think one great fresh idea is a real infrastructure package for the American people.  What the president has offered a 20-80 plan, 20 percent from the federal, 80 percent from local governments is not going to wash.  It's not going to work.  What Democrats are proposing is really an 80-20 or 75-25 plan where the federal government comes up with the resources for 80 percent and works with local governments to put America back to work and invest in American infrastructure and invest in America.  </p><p>That's jobs.  That's a bridge to the new economy.  That's giving people the opportunity to put their kids through college, to afford health care with a real job.  That's the kind of message the Democrats are talking about.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But let's look at the Trump record on the economy, which obviously you agree is going to be the key issue in November.  </p><p>Employers are adding an average of 202,000 jobs a month this year.  The unemployment rate has been 4.1 percent for six straight months.  That's the lowest level in 17 years.  And wages are up 2.7 percent, the highest rate of almost nine years.  </p><p>Congressman, a solid majority of Americans, according to the polls, feel good about the Trump economy.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Show me how any of those statistics the difference of any month that President Obama was president of United States -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I just said that the 4.1 percent is the lowest level in 17 years.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  It's moving on a downward trend.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But it wasn't 4.1 percent.   Wage growth wasn't up.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Where was it when President Bush left office?  </p><p>WALLACE:  President Bush or President Obama?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  President Bush, when he left office, and President Obama came from --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I understand, the world is in recession.</p><p>CROWLEY:  Right.  And so, we -- Democrats really moved us towards this job growth through the sustained economy.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Are you saying the president deserves no -- </p><p>CROWLEY:  I didn't say that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm asking.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  What I'm suggesting is that I believe what this is based on is a false premise.  The notion of the tax cut is going to lead to somehow help the American people along (ph) I think is a scam.  I think what they've done is the desperate need to pass anything by the end of the year.  They rammed through a bill without fully really understanding what was in the bill.  </p><p>It was done in a very, very highly partisan way, and I think in the end, it's the average worker, the middle class, in this going to suffer because the result of the tax cut bill.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to another subject, immigration.  The president has ordered the deployment of up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the southern border and the fact is more people are attempting to cross the border illegally.  Just take a look at these statistics.  </p><p>In March of 2017, 16,000 people were caught at the border.  That number tripled last month, March of 2018, to more than 50,000.  </p><p>Don't we need to stop the surge?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform.  We've been talking about this for decades and we just haven't seen it happen, not since 1986.  What I think is interesting to go back to 1986 where you saw a comprehensive immigration reform and comprehensive tax reform done in a bipartisan way.  It was long-lasting because it was done both -- Democrats and Republicans came together.  </p><p>Here we have a very partisan approach to this.  The president talks about building a wall, but Mexico is going to pay for it.  Now, he's putting troops down at the border, a very provocative move.  But at the same time, it's not really solving the problem.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait a minute.  You say it's a very provocative move.   Barack Obama put 1,800 at the border.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  It was to some degree provocative, not in the same breath that this president has done.  What the verbiage, the language that our president has used towards immigrants in this nation is really -- it's abhorrent to me, quite frankly.  It's not representative of who we are as a nation.  </p><p>So, this president, making this move is different from any other president doing it quite frankly.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to the midterms.  President Trump says that your party is vulnerable in November.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats haven't learned -- they still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and security are deplorable.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  How confident are you the Democrats will win in November and take back control of the House?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  We're a long way from November.  Let's be clear about that.  </p><p>But I'm confident that the American people want to bring balance back to the United States government.  What they see right now is Republicans in charge of the presidency, the Senate, the House and some would argue the Supreme Court.  </p><p>Every branch of government seems to be controlled in some way or facet (ph) by Republicans.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Forgive me.  That was what voters decided.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, look, they have an opportunity here to change course and correction, that's the beauty of our democracy.  The House of Representatives, every member of the House of Representatives is up for election this year and a third of the Senate.  So, people have the opportunity to bring that balance back.  </p><p>We know that the first midterm election of an incumbent president on average sees 40 seats swing in the opposite direction.  It's not going to happen on its own.  Democrats are not going to win that back just simply be up against President Trump.  We need to be for, as I mentioned before, our economic policies, our better deal and is a deal are become very clear to the American people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  In more than a third of House races, Republicans running for those seats have run ads that go after Nancy Pelosi.  Here's an example from the recent special election in Pennsylvania '18.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AD ANNOUNCER:  Conor Lamb is a Pelosi liberal.  His values aren't our values.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Now, that Democrat, Conor Lamb, won, but one of the ways in which he won was that he promised not to support Nancy Pelosi if Democrats take the House and she's up for speaker again.  </p><p>Is Nancy Pelosi a liability for Democrats in this campaign?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  I think it was more reflective of the fact that Republicans are bankrupt on the ideas.  They don't have anything else to offer except to go after Nancy Pelosi to win elections.  That's -- if they think, that's a winning strategy, they're completely mistaken and wrong.  It's not a winning strategy.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLACE:  I mean, forgive me, but Conor Lamb apparently thought it was an issue because he dumped Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Conor Lamb won because he ran a local election.  He talked about that the cuts that the Republicans were attempting to make and to privatize Social Security.  He talked about what affect local -- what affect the federal government has on local politics, on people's lives.  And that's why he won that election, not because of Nancy Pelosi.  </p><p>WALLACE:  If Democrats win the House in November, will you run either to replace Nancy Pelosi if she steps down or against her if she doesn't?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, on the first portion of that, I would wait and see just what happened in terms of Nancy Pelosi deciding not to run.  But if Nancy Pelosi stays, I don't -- I don't see a scenario by which I would challenge her for that position.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you want to be speaker?  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Look, I'm focused right now on winning back the House of Representatives, to be in the majority, to be the chair of the Democratic Caucus in the majority.  I'm doing that job right now.  I want to be the best chair of the Democratic Caucus I possibly can be, help my colleagues get reelected and help when back seats for the House Democratic Caucus.  </p><p>That's my focus and goal.  That's the focus and goal of the entire Democratic leadership.  We are one mind, Chris, and that is we want to win back the house.  That's goal one and the only goal right now.  </p><p>WALLACE:  One last question in this.  On top Democrat was quoted as saying that at age 56, which you are now, that you are a spring chicken by congressional standards.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  Well, I've had others say that I'm not such a spring chicken after all.  Look, at the end of the day, we have a very vibrant Democratic Caucus.  We have some incredibly talented young people.  </p><p>I think people running today like Mikie Sherrill.  She was a Navy grad.  She is running for office in New Jersey.  </p><p>I think of Joe Neguse who's running in Colorado.  I think of Brendan Kelly.  Some great people are running all around this country and we are becoming more vibrant as a Democratic Caucus. </p><p>So, I think we have nothing to look forward to but good days ahead of us.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Congressman Crowley, thank you.  Thanks for coming in today.  Please come back, sir.  </p><p>CROWLEY:  I'm happy to come back.  Thank you.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the escalating tariff threats between the U.S. and China.  </p><p>Plus, we'll discuss the president's Pruitt problem and growing ethical concerns about the EPA chief.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Coming up, President Trump sends the National Guard to the border.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have very bad laws for our border.  We're going to be doing things militarily until we can have a wall and proper security.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel what the deployment means, next on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship long-term with China, but we have to get this straightened out. We have to have some balance. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: President Trump taking a hard line on China, saying it's time to stop Beijing from taking advantage of the U.S. on trade.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. </p><p>GOP strategist Karl Rove. Columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams. Former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards. And the head of Heritage Action for America, Michael Needham. </p><p>Well, Karl, there's no question that we have a problem with Chinese trade practices, but is it the best solution to threaten them with tariffs? </p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. We have two problems with them. The biggest problem is, they're stealing our intellectual property. And in all this kerfuffle over tariffs, we've missed the fact that on March 23rd the administration filed what it should have done, which is an action with the WTO challenging from top to bottom the Chinese on their intellectual property rights. That's where we can win and win big for the American companies, the American consumer and for the concept of free trade. </p><p>But tariffs, really problematic. The president said we're going to levy $60 billion in tariffs on the Chinese. Peter Navarro, his trade expert, came out and said, and the Chinese are not going to retaliate. The Chinese said, we're going to respond with $50 billion of tariffs. The president says, this is unfair, I'm going to come with $100 billion worth of tariffs. $160 billion worth of tariffs would be paid by American taxpayers. This year the value of the tax cut, as estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, is $135 billion to American taxpayers. Next year, $280 billion. Economic growth is happening because of pro-growth -- in part because of the pro-growth policies of the tax code. What happens if you take that away by tariffs? </p><p>He's attacking a problem we don't need to really be worried about. We by $500 billion from them. They buy $130 billion from us. Let's focus on selling more to them and we're not going to get there by putting tariffs on Chinese products. </p><p>WALLACE: Michael, are you as negative about the idea of tariffs and what impact could it conceivably have on economic growth, which at this point may be the best argument Republicans have going for them going into the midterms? </p><p>MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Yes, look, large, broad tariffs aren't the right way to go. Nobody wants a trade war. I agree with what Larry Kudlow said, I don't think we're going to have a trade war. </p><p>At the same time, I think the strongest fact the president has going for him is he's always been looking about for American interests, he's always been looking out for American security. And for 20 years liberal elites have promised us that if we just integrate China into the global trade network, they will start acting like a responsible stakeholder in the international community. They haven't. And it's been a lie. </p><p>And the president is right to take seriously the threat of China, their irresponsibility on intellectual property, their requirements that American companies when they come into China give up their intellectual property and the vast irresponsibility of the Chinese government around the world, integrating them into a trade framework had not worked. We need to be tough. We just need to be smart about how we're being tough. We need to be targeted. And I think some of what the president has laid out has not been targeted and smart. </p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, look, I understand the concern about tariffs. On the other hand, as Michael points out, China has continued with unfair trade practices, stealing or threatening, pressuring to get our intellectual property. I have to say, I asked Congressman Crowley that and didn't get much of an answer. Do you have a specific idea of how we get them to clean up their act? </p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, first of all, I don't think tariffs are a trade policy. And one of the things that's missing here I think in the Pacific region is a trade policy. We had an opportunity, I think, under the Obama administration of a TPP that was fairly negotiated. I mean I didn't support that because I thought that it was missing in terms of protections for American workers, which would have had a direct impact on our relationship -- our trade relationship with China. And I think that what is happening now is this sort of ad hoc imposition of tariffs that's really throwing the markets around. </p><p>Now, do I care about that for wealthy people? No, but I do care about that for American workers and for retirements and for -- for farmers. And so --</p><p>WALLACE: So what should we do? </p><p>EDWARDS: You know, and so I think that, you know, what we should do is we should actually have a trade policy for the region that allows us, with our neighbors and our allies, to stack up against China. And right now we don't have that. </p><p>WALLACE: If you go to the WTO and, as Michael has pointed out, it hasn't worked. There was a ruling I just read this weekend that the WTO made about certain Chinese trade practices. They have spent six years, and they still are mulling how to comply. </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I'm not really sure the WTO is necessarily the framework. It may be -- it's one avenue. But the real framework is our European allies, which are facing exactly the same problem with China, but we've done nothing to coordinate a strategy with -- with Europe and with the Pacific region in terms of dealing with China, particularly on intellectual property. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, I want to switch to another big story this week, and that is immigration and President Trump's decision to send up to 4,000 members of the National Guard to the southern border to guard that border. He talked at one point about a caravan of about 1,000 people coming up through Mexico to the United States. Here he is. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yesterday it came out where this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody's ever seen before. They don't want to mention that. So we have to change our laws. And the Democrats, what they're doing is just -- it's insanity. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Juan, now under questioning, the white House ended up having to cite reports of incidents of rate with another caravan back in 2014. But what about the larger issue and what about the president's decision to send border -- rather, National Guard to the border? </p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, this is political theater for a man who promised to build a wall that would be paid for by Mexico. That hasn't happened and you've had some people in his base say, hey, what happened to your pledge to build a wall? </p><p>The reality is, the border crossings are -- I think it's a 45 plus year low. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, no, no, no, we --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, we saw the tick up that you illustrated earlier in the show in the month of March. That's not representative of the long term here. And the long term is in fact that in terms of border crossings from Mexico, they too are at net zero migration. This is the reality. But what you have is most illegals in this country have overstayed visas. They haven't run through any wall or snuck under a wall or jumped over a wall. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, there's no wall.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There's a -- well, that are -- there are walls in places that we think. I mean it's not as if we haven't done anything about border security. But the caravan, the caravan's been coming up as an Easter ritual for the last five plus years, Chris. And I think what you have here is an attempt to trigger fear and hysteria over, oh, there's a horde coming at the southern border and they're coming and they're going to invade America. </p><p>But I think it's all about this president trying to say to his base, hey, I am putting a wall up, or if I'm not putting a wall up, I'm going to put soldiers there. Soldiers who, by the way, have no authority to detain anyone, arrest anyone, no bullets in their guns. I mean it's -- it's a joke. </p><p>WALLACE: I -- I -- I can see both Michael and Karl with -- ready to come out of their seats. </p><p>Karl, I'll --</p><p>ROVE: I want to briefly agree with one -- the only thing that Juan said that was correct, which is the caravan has been going on for a long while and the Mexicans were fully capable of taking care of them. But the rest of what Juan said, bologna. </p><p>Look, we -- we have a problem on the border. If you look at -- if you look at the crossings compared to a year ago, they have doubled. And we are facing a surge. And the president was right to say to the states -- it was on an impulse, but that doesn't make it a bad impulse, that the states need help. </p><p>You noticed -- did you see with the first National Guard unit was from Texas to be sent to the border immediately after the president's order, an aviation unit because, what was the first unit to go from Arizona? A construction unit. There are things along the border that the National Guard can do in a moment like this when additional resources are needed that is justified and ample. And I trust the secretary of Homeland Security to arrive at it and so do the governors of most of the border states. </p><p>We have Jerry Brown wringing his hands in Sacramento as to what he ought to do, but otherwise this is a useful thing. President Obama did it. President Bush did it in a similar moment. It's not because of the caravan, but it's because of a more secular trend that's troubling. The number of illegal border crossings has doubled this year verses last year.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. I know we're not going to settle this. You can argue during the commercial. </p><p>WILLIAMS: It's a deal.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we have to take a break here. </p><p>When we come back, the Trump administration imposes new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and businesses to punish the Kremlin for alleged meddling in the 2016 election. </p><p>Plus, the fate of Scott Pruitt. What would you like to ask the panel about whether the president should stand by or fire his EPA chief? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter, at Fox News Sunday, and we may use your question on the air. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Is draining the swamp renting an apartment from the wife of a Washington lobbyist? </p><p>SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: I don't think that that's even remotely fair to ask that question. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt pushing back on ethics allegations against him, including renting a room in a Capitol Hill condo for $50 a night. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Michael, you're one of 10 leading conservatives who sent a letter to President Trump yesterday urging him to keep Pruitt at EPA. And Saturday night the president tweeted this, rent for this condo was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job. </p><p>Are you not troubled by the growing list of ethical concerns about Scott Pruitt? </p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, Scott Pruitt is taking on one of the sacred cows of the extreme progressive left, which is that in the debate between job growth and job creation and environmentalism there is no room for any belief in terms of anything other than always siding with environmentalists. And anyone who takes that side should be attacked in a mean-spirited manner. And that's what's going on towards EPA administrator Pruitt right now. </p><p>In that environment, all of us who take on the left for some these things should be squeaking clean because you give them fuel to create issues. And I think Scott Pruitt should not have done many of the things that he's done, which has allowed the left to sidetrack the discussion from policy and take it towards the personnel -- the personal and the ad hominem. </p><p>If you compare what Scott Pruitt is going through, to what Obama -- President Obama's EPA administrators went through, Gina McCarthy deleted 5,000 tweets because she wanted to get around FOIA requirements. Gina McCarthy spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on foreign travel. Lisa Jackson, the administrator before Gina McCarthy, had a fake e-mail account to get around FOIA requests. She spent $155,000 on a single trip to China. And so there's a gigantic double standard. The reason the double standard exists is because of the policies that Scott Pruitt is pursuing, and he should be lauded for the -- for his noble efforts on those policies. </p><p>WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of Scott Pruitt's behavior we got this tweet from 6152Tom. Is there any truth to it that he is a target, as he is getting the most done? Has made some bad expense decisions but his value-added seems to be the best of any cabinet person. </p><p>Juan, how do you answer Tom? </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think there's a real situation here in terms of have -- President Trump having promised to drain the swamp and then you have Scott Pruitt -- and let's just put aside the policy arguments because I think for Michael --</p><p>NEEDHAM: Shouldn't that be what matters, policy --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, not at the moment. </p><p>NEEDHAM: You don't think policy matters?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Let's just -- let's separated it for a second, Michael, because I think conservative activists and conservative donors and people in businesses that are affected by environmental regulations just say, well, he's doing what we want, so let's leave it alone. But can you imagine if this was any other president and you had a cabinet secretary who was engaged in this kind of behavior, can't even answer a question from Ed Henry of Fox News. I don't think he's a -- Fox News is not some liberal organization out here trying to undercut a conservative. No. </p><p>But what you have is someone who has taken advantage of not only what is a sweetheart deal, pennies for dollars in terms of that condo, but the condo being rented from a lobbyist whose clients have business in front of the EPA. That, on the face of it, Michael, is disqualifying. So we can talk about policy and we can have arguments about --</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>NEEDHAM: I am -- I am going to look forward to going back and finding Juan Williams speaking out about Gina McCarthy deleting 5,000 text messages to get around FOIA. I am sure Juan was outraged at the $150,000 -- </p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I don't think that's good behavior. But I'm just telling you, I'm just -- it's shocking to me that you will make excuses for what is inexcusable. </p><p>NEEDHAM: But you said they were disqualifying. Was Lisa Jackson's $155,000 trip to China disqualifying?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's -- look, she spent, by the way, on security, much less. Scott Pruitt spent three times as much. He has alarms and red flashing things and added -- asking for more people just to get through D.C. traffic. </p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's ridiculous. </p><p>WALLACE: I --</p><p>WILLIAMS: For a drain the swamp administration? </p><p>WALLACE: OK. </p><p>I want to -- we were going to talk about Russia. We may still get to it. </p><p>But I want to focus now on the breaking story today, and that is this -- what appears to be a poison gas attack on a rebel-held suburb outside of Damascus. There are reports that dozens of people may have been killed and even more were hit by this. </p><p>The president has begun to tweet on this subject today and I hope we'll put up one tweet. Many dead including women and children in mindless chemical attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad. Big price.</p><p>It's interesting, Karl. There has not been outside confirmation that this was a poison attack, but it's interesting, one, the president is saying it, and, two, not only condemning it, but also in maybe the strongest terms I've never heard him, condemning President Putin's support for Assad. </p><p>ROVE: Yes. The president -- the president is not obligated to act. So confirm if this was a poison gas attack, which it looks like it was. The estimates now are at least 70 dead, maybe as many as 150, a number of them children, all of them civilians. But now the United States will have to act as the president acted in the aftermath of the sarin gas attack in early 2017. Otherwise, our credibility in the region is going to be greatly diminished. </p><p>WALLACE: Yes, let me just pick up on that with you because in one of his earlier tweets he said the reason that this has fallen apart is because President Obama did not enforce the redline when he was president on -- when it came to gas attacks by Assad. He -- and when the president did launch that attack, those -- I think it was 59 missiles -- back in the spring of 2017, he said, if it happens again, I'll strike again. How much is he on the line now (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>ROVE: Well, he's on the line. And, look, I think there's some -- I think there is some -- you know, there's some reason why he said -- some evidence that he was correct when he said President Obama should have acted. It's unseemly for the president, however, to be reflecting on that, in my opinion. </p><p>He ought to -- he ought to act. It was one of the most important moments in the definition of his foreign policy last year that when this attack did occur he reacted in 25 percent of the air capacity of the Syrian air force disappeared in a matter of moments. He has to exact another price in order to send a second signal that just because a year has passed, doesn't mean you can engage in this behavior again.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to what appears -- and we need to say it's not confirmed yet -- what appears to be an attack, and, if so, what action President Trump is going to need to take? </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, the president is the president today. And I think that the American people and the Congress actually have to engage in a discussion about Syria that is a moral discussion when it comes to the use, if this is true, of poison gas. I mean this is a human rights crisis and the president has an obligation to act. </p><p>That said, over this last year and a half, our policy has actually allowed Assad, with Russia's help, to consolidate his power. And that leaves open the door to do these kinds -- to engage in these kind of atrocities because we think we've rolled back the Islamic States. In fact, what we've done is we've actually created an environment where it goes underground, it's not consolidating land, but continues to engage in terrorist behavior and activity. </p><p>WALLACE: Would you agree that President Obama is much more responsible for the disaster and the humanitarian slaughter in Syria than President Trump is? </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, let me just say, I -- at the time when I was in Congress, I called on the president and supported the idea -- </p><p>WALLACE: President Obama. </p><p>EDWARDS: President Obama, and support of the idea that we should actually be on the side of the Syrian people who were facing exactly the same kinds of atrocities. And it's come to this point. </p><p>But the fact is that today in April 2018, President Trump is the president and it's his obligation to act and not just reflect on what a bad job he thinks that President Obama did. </p><p>WALLACE: We have less than a minute left. </p><p>Michael.</p><p>NEEDHAM: Yes, look, I think that -- that President Trump should act, as Karl said. I think that President Trump needs to see things through in Syria. And I think that we should give President Trump credit for having a very muscular and strong American policy towards Syria. And, more importantly, towards Russia, which is backing Syria in terms of getting anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, the action he took earlier this year in Syria, pushing forward to put small, tactical nuclear weapons into our arsenal. And so I think President Trump has had a very strong foreign policy and he needs to make sure that he continues that, following through with Syria. </p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, John Bolton comes on board tomorrow and we'll see what happens. But I think Trump has been trying to pull troops out of Syria without Pentagon approval. </p><p>WALLACE: Thanks, panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p>Up next our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the president of a major university here in Washington works the campus like a big city mayor. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Hang around Washington long enough and you see plenty of turnover. Cabinet secretaries come and go and administrations, and -- and, as we've seen recently, when presidents change their mind. So what happens to those former big shots? Here is our \"Power Player of the week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SYLVIA BURWELL, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY: I think the role is a little more like a mayor than a CEO.</p><p>Hi. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Sylvia Matthews Burwell is president of American University here in Washington. And she works the campus like a mayor. </p><p>BURWELL: Very nice to meet you both. Thank you both. </p><p>Right now we're passing the library. </p><p>WALLACE: Here was a video in her new job when the school year started last summer. </p><p>BURWELL: Great to see some students on campus. </p><p>Oh, wait a minute, there's Claude (ph), the AU legend, out for a morning run. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So I understand you insist everyone calls you Sylvia. </p><p>BURWELL: That's right. </p><p>WALLACE: Why? </p><p>BURWELL: Because I think it's part of being a part of the university and having people feel like they can engage. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): If Burwell looks familiar, she was a member of President Obama's cabinet. First his budget director, then secretary of Health and Human Services, trying to fix Obamacare after the disastrous rollout, and then dealing with the Ebola crisis. </p><p>BURWELL: So having very large critical issues made it a pretty challenging time. </p><p>WALLACE: But running a university with 13,000 students and a tradition of public service is also challenging. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How much does it cost, tuition, room and board, to go to AU for a year? </p><p>BURWELL: About $60,000. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Burwell says she's trying to cut cost and find new ways to help students who can't afford it. </p><p>Then, there were several racist incidents last fall, including confederate flag posters on bulletin boards. Burwell held a town hall. </p><p>BURWELL: We want to make sure that you know we're taking our steps. We need your help and support too. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't feel safe here. I don't feel happy here. I don't feel nicer. I feel worse.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Was that a tough meeting for you? </p><p>BURWELL: You know, it -- it was a tough meeting most of all because of the pain that the incidents cause. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): One reform, every student must now take a course that includes diversity training. </p><p>BURWELL: It is about learning to listen from others differing points of view and differing experiences. </p><p>WALLACE: Burwell grew up in Hinton, West Virginia. Her grandparents, Greek immigrants. </p><p>BURWELL: There were two themes in the Matthews household. One was education and the other was public service. </p><p>WALLACE: She followed both paths, going to Harvard and becoming a Rhodes Scholar. Then interspersing government work with 11 years helping run the Gates and Walmart Foundations. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): How does it feel to see so much of the Obama legacy, including Obamacare, being rolled back by President Trump? </p><p>BURWELL: There will be people who don't receive treatment and actually die because they can't afford the care, the preventative care, or the care along the way. And so this has real-world consequences for individuals in their lives. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): But Burwell embraces her new role as college president, including one game as guest coach of the women's basketball team. </p><p>BURWELL: I'm undefeated.
