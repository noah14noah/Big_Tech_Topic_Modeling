WHITE PAPER ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p><p>The White Paper is the centerpiece of a package of measures to address the challenges of AI. It sets out different policy options with the \"twin objective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks associated with certain uses of this new technology.\" The White Paper, which is a document used by the EC to launch a debate with the public, stakeholders, the European Parliament and the Council in order to reach a political consensus, is structured into two parts: (1) The first part sets out more political and technical aspects to promote a partnership between the private and the public sector in order to form an \"ecosystem of excellence\" and (2) the second part proposes key elements of a future regulatory framework for AI to create an \"ecosystem of trust\".</p><p>While the first part of the White Paper mostly contains general policy proposals intended to boost AI development, research and investment in the EU, the second part outlines the main features of a possible regulatory framework for AI. In the EC's view, lack of public trust is one of the biggest obstacles to a broader proliferation of AI throughout the EU. Thus, as we have discussed previously,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote7\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p>H. Mark Lyon, Gearing Up For The EU's Next Regulatory Push: AI, LA &amp; SF Daily Journal (Oct. 11, 2019), available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gibsondunn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lyon-Gearing-up-for-the-EUs-next-regulatory-push-AI-Daily-Journal-10-11-2019.pdf\">https://www.gibsondunn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lyon-Gearing-up-for-the-EUs-next-regulatory-push-AI-Daily-Journal-10-11-2019.pdf</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote> similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), the EC intends for the EU to maintain its \"first out of the gate\" status and increase public trust by attempting to regulate the inherent risks of AI. The main risks identified by the EC concern fundamental rights (including data privacy and non-discrimination) as well as safety and liability issues. Apart from possible adjustments to existing legislation, the EC concludes that a new regulation specifically on AI is necessary to address these risks.</p><p>According to the White Paper, the key issue for any future legislation would be to determine the scope of its application. The assumption is that any legislation would apply to products and services relying on AI. Furthermore, the EC identifies \"data\" and \"algorithms\" as the main elements that compose AI, but also stresses that the definition of AI needs to be sufficiently flexible to provide legal certainty while also allowing for the legislation to keep up with technical progress.</p><p>In terms of substantive regulation, the EC favors a context-specific risk-based approach instead of a GDPR \"one size fits all\" approach. An AI product or service will be considered \"high-risk\" when two cumulative criteria are fulfilled:</p><p>(1) Critical Sector: The AI product or service is employed in a sector where significant risks can be expected to occur. Those sectors should be specifically and exhaustively listed in the legislation; for instance, healthcare, transport, energy and parts of the public sector, such as the police and the legal system.</p><p>(2) Critical Use: The AI product or service is used in such a manner that significant risks are likely to arise. The assessment of the level of risk of a given use can be based on the impact on the affected parties; for instance, where the use of AI produces legal effects, leads to a risk of injury, death or significant material or immaterial damage.</p><p>If an AI product or service fulfils both criteria, it will be subject to the mandatory requirements of the new AI legislation. However, additionally, the use of AI based applications for certain purposes should always be considered high-risk when they fundamentally impact individual rights. This could include the use of AI for recruitment processes or for remote biometric identification (such as facial recognition). Moreover, even if an AI product or service is not considered \"high-risk\", it will remain subject to existing EU-rules such as the GDPR.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote8\"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p>The exact implications and requirements of the GDPR on AI based products and services are still not entirely clear, see further, Ahmed Baladi, Can GDPR hinder AI made in Europe?, Cybersecurity Law Report (July 10, 2019), available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gibsondunn.com/can-gdpr-hinder-ai-made-in-europe/\">https://www.gibsondunn.com/can-gdpr-hinder-ai-made-in-europe/</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote> Notably, the EC expressly takes the view that the GDPR already regulates all issues related to personal data.</p><p>Taking into account the \"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence\" of the High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote9\"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>For further detail, see our 2019 Artificial Intelligence and Automated Systems Annual Legal Review.</p></bodyText></footnote> the EC sets out six key requirements, which could be included in the upcoming AI legislation:</p><p>1. Training Data</p><p>The EC proposes several requirements related to training data, such as a requirement to train AI systems on data sets that are sufficiently broad and representative, as well as a requirement to ensure that privacy and personal data are adequately protected during the use of AI-enabled products and services. Further, the adequate protection of personal data during the use of AI products and services should be ensured.</p><p>2. Data and Record-keeping</p><p>In light of the complexity and opacity of many AI systems, the EC recommends that the regulatory framework prescribe the keeping of accurate records regarding the data set used to train and test the AI systems (including a description of the main characteristics and how the data set was selected), the retention of the data sets themselves and the documentation on the programming and training methodologies, processes and techniques used to build, test and validate the AI systems. The records, data sets and documentation would have to be retained during a limited, reasonable time period to enable effective enforcement and regress of potential victims. Where necessary, arrangements should be made to ensure that confidential information, such as trade secrets, is protected.</p><p>3. Information Provision</p><p>In the EC's view, transparency requirements, such as ensuring clear information regarding the AI system's capabilities and limitations and informing individuals when they are interacting with an AI system and not a human being, could also be considered. However, no such information would need to be provided in situations where it is immediately obvious to the user that they are interacting with AI systems.</p><p>4. Robustness and Accuracy</p><p>To minimize the risk of harm, the EC suggests that the regulatory framework should require that AI systems are robust and accurate, that their outcomes are reproducible, that they can adequately deal with errors or inconsistencies throughout all life cycle phases, and that they are resilient against both overt and more hidden attacks.</p><p>5. Human Oversight</p><p>The EC recognizes that the appropriate degree of human oversight to ensure that AI systems do not undermined human autonomy or cause other adverse effects may vary from case to case. For example, the rejection of an application for social security benefits may be decided upon by an AI system, but should become effective only subject to human review and validation; conversely, the rejection of an application for a credit card may be taken by an AI system with the possibility of subsequent human review. Additionally, operational blocks could be built into the AI system in the design phase, for instance an automatic stop for a driverless car when the conditions do not permit the safe operation of the car.</p><p>6. Specific Requirements for Remote Biometric Identification</p><p>As we have discussed recently,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote10\"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p>See our 2019 Artificial Intelligence and Automated Systems Annual Legal Review.</p></bodyText></footnote> the EC considered a five-year ban on the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces. Instead, without providing any clear time frame, the EC now intends to launch a broad public debate on the specific circumstances which might justify the use of remote biometric identification and on possible safeguards to be employed.</p><p>The White Paper also addresses personal and geographic scope of the future AI legislation. Since many actors may be involved in the lifecycle of an AI system (developers, producers, distributers, end-users, etc.), it is proposed that obligations under the future legislation should be distributed among the different actors based on who would be best placed to address the respective risks. Regarding geographic scope, the EC emphasizes that the objectives of the legislative may only be achieved if the requirements set out in the future legislation apply to all companies providing AI based products or services in the EU, regardless of their actual location.</p><p>In terms of compliance and enforcement, the EC favors a mandatory prior conformity assessment for all providers of high-risk AI applications to verify compliance with the above mentioned criteria. This could include checks of the algorithms and of data sets used during the development phase. The ex post enforcement of the new requirements as well as the ex ante conformity assessment could be entrusted to existing governance bodies in the individual EU Member States and an overarching European governance structure.</p><p>Finally, the White Paper proposes the introduction of a voluntary labelling scheme for non \"high-risk\" AI applications, where interested parties would be awarded with a quality label for their AI products and services.</p><p>II. DATA STRATEGY</p><p>The Data Strategy presents policy measures aiming to foster a European \"data economy\" within the next five years. As already evident by the EC's focus on Big Tech firms in the area of antitrust, the EC continues this trend by trying to break the dominance of US and Chinese tech firms with new proposals including the option to introduce a compulsory \"data access\" right for competitors.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote11\"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p>While the exact prerequisites are not yet clear, the EC notes that a data access right should only be made compulsory where specific circumstances require it (i.e. where a market failure in a specific sector is identified or can be foreseen and cannot be resolved by competition law) and where it is appropriate under fair, transparent, reasonable, proportionate and/or non-discriminatory conditions.</p></bodyText></footnote> In a statement during the presentation of the Data Strategy, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, said that the EU had missed the battle for personal data, but the \"battle for industrial data starts now.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote12\"/><label>12</label><bodyText><p>Samuel Stolton and Vlagyiszlav Makszimov, Von der Leyen opens the doors for an EU data revolution, Euractiv (Feb. 20, 2020), available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/von-der-leyen-opens-the-doors-for-an-eu-data-revolution/\">https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/von-der-leyen-opens-the-doors-for-an-eu-data-revolution/</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>To achieve this aim, the Data Strategy recommends to create a single European data space<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote13\"/><label>13</label><bodyText><p>This is defined in the Data Strategy as \"a genuine single market for data, open to data from across the world\".</p></bodyText></footnote> and identifies several issues, such as the fragmentation of legal frameworks between EU Member States, the availability of quality data, and imbalances in market power and data infrastructures that are currently impeding the EU's ability to take a leading role in the global data economy. To overcome these challenges, the EC lists a number of proposals which focus on creating a legal framework, building the necessary infrastructure and honing in on the vast potential of non-personal \"industrial data.\" This also includes the possibility for non-European companies to access and use EU data, provided they comply with the applicable laws and standards.</p><p>Specifically, the EC's Data Strategy is based on four pillars, which include concrete proposals for regulatory action:</p><p>1. Introduction of a cross-sectoral legislative framework for data access and use</p><p>According to the EC, a legislative framework for the governance of common European data spaces will be put into place in Q4 2020. This framework could include standardization mechanisms and harmonized description of datasets to improve both data accessibility and interoperability between sectors in line with so-called \"FAIR principles\", namely Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability. Further, the EC intends to move forward with the adoption of an implementing act on high-value data sets under the Open Data Directive<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote14\"/><label>14</label><bodyText><p>Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 20, 2019, OJ L 172, p. 56-83.</p></bodyText></footnote> in Q1 2021 in order to make available key public sector reference data in machine-readable format. Finally the EC is contemplating a new \"Data Act\" to be introduced in 2021 which would provide incentives for horizontal data sharing across sectors and could include a \"data access\" right for competitors, as described above. Further regulatory action includes an update of the Horizontal Co-operation Guidelines<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote15\"/><label>15</label><bodyText><p>European Commission, Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to horizontal co-operation agreements, 2011/C 11/01, OJ C 11, p. 1-72.</p></bodyText></footnote> to provide more guidance to companies on the compliance of data sharing and pooling arrangements with EU competition law, a review of jurisdictional issues related to data and - possibly - the explicit regulation of the online platforms economy which is currently being analyzed by the EC's \"Observatory on the Online Platform Economy.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote16\"/><label>16</label><bodyText><p>See <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-observatory-online-platform-economy\">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-observatory-online-platform-economy</url>.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>2. Investments in data and infrastructures for hosting, processing and using data and interoperability</p><p>In order to create an environment in which data-driven innovation is fostered, the EC plans to invest in a project on European data spaces and federated cloud infrastructures. Drawing upon public and private sources, the EC hopes to gather funding in the amount of 4 to 6 billion, of which the EC wants to contribute 2 billion. In March 2020 the EC will present a wider set of strategic investments in new technologies, such edge computing, quantum computing, cyber-security and 6G networks, as part of its industrial strategy. Additionally, the EC promises to bring together a coherent framework around the different applicable rules for cloud services, in the form of a cloud rulebook by Q2 2022 and to introduce a cloud services marketplace for EU users by Q4 2022.</p><p>3. Strengthening the digital rights of individuals</p><p>Through this initiative the EC is considering the development of \"personal data spaces\" for individuals. According to the EC, individuals should be in control of their data at \"a granular level\", to be achieved by enhancing the data portability right under the GDPR, introducing stricter requirements on interfaces for real-time data access and creating a universally usable digital identity. These issues will be explored in the context of the Data Act that could be introduced in 2021.</p><p>4. Development of common European data spaces in strategic sectors</p><p>Finally, the EC envisions the development of nine common European data spaces across strategic sectors, including the industrial/manufacturing, transport/logistics, healthcare, financial services, energy and agricultural sectors. The idea is to create large pools of industrial data, combined with the necessary infrastructure, to use and exchange data as well as appropriate governance mechanisms. Although these data spaces mainly concern industrial data, the EC emphasizes that they will be developed in full compliance with data protection rules and the highest available cyber-security standards.</p><p>III. REPORT ON SAFETY AND LIABILITY</p><p>The EC's Report on Safety and Liability, which also accompanies the White Paper, analyses the EU's current product safety and liability legislation.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote17\"/><label>17</label><bodyText><p>The current framework consists of, inter alia: the General Product Safety Directive (Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of Dec. 3, 2001, OJ L 11, 15.1.2002, p. 4-17); specific horizontal and sectorial rules, such as the Market Surveillance Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 9, 2008, OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30-47, and the Machinery Directive (Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 17, 2006, OJ L 157, p. 24-86); and the Product Liability Directive (Directive 85/374/EEC of July 25, 1985).</p></bodyText></footnote> It determines that the existing EU horizontal and sector-specific legislative framework is robust and reliable, since the current definition of product safety already includes an extended concept of safety, and that liability issues are generally covered by the liability concept already in place. However, the EC also identifies certain gaps with respect to the legal management of specific risks posed by AI systems and other digital technologies that should be covered in future product safety and product liability legislation.</p><p>In light of the recommendations contained in the Report on Safety and Liability, future product safety legislation may cover, inter alia, the following aspects:</p><p> Connectivity and cyber vulnerabilities: Product connectivity, interconnectivity and interaction of products with other devices may compromise the safety of the product directly and indirectly (e.g., when a product is hacked). Thus, the EC recommends the adoption of explicit provisions such as an explicit assessment of the risks which stem from interconnectivity in order to provide better protection of users and more legal certainty.Autonomy: Unintended outcomes based on the use of AI could cause harm to users and exposed persons. In order to improve the safety of users, the EC takes inspiration from sector-specific laws to recommend the adoption of horizontal legislation that obliges the appropriate economic operator (i.e. the manufacturer, the distributor or the software producer) to carry out new risk assessment procedures during the products' lifetime. Furthermore, the EC suggests the adoption of specific requirements to ensure human oversight of AI products and systems, starting from their design throughout their lifecycle.Mental health risks: The EC anticipates that the behavior of AI applications may generate mental health risks and harm, which should be explicitly covered by the definition of product safety in future legal frameworks. In particular, legislation in this field should cover vulnerable users, such as elderly persons in care environments.Data dependency: Risks to safety may result from a product's faulty collection or processing of data, including a lack of accuracy or relevance. Against this backdrop, the EC recommends that EU product safety legislation should address the risks of faulty data at the product design stage as well as throughout the entire lifecycle.Opacity: With regard to the \"black-box effect\" in the decision-making processes of AI systems, the EC has identified a possible new challenge for product safety ex-post enforcement mechanisms that is not covered by existing legislation. The EC therefore suggests considering transparency requirements for algorithms, as well as requirements for robustness, accountability and human oversight of decision-making. This could include imposing obligations on developers of algorithms to disclose design parameters and metadata of datasets in case accidents occur.Software: While EU product safety legislation may cover risks stemming from software integrated into a product or device, the EC proposes to adapt and clarify existing rules in the case of stand-alone software placed on the market as it is or downloaded into a product after its placement on the market (e.g. an app that is downloaded on a mobile device). In particular, this would concern stand-alone software that has an impact on the safety of an AI product or system.Complex value chains: EU product safety legislation imposes obligations on several economic operators following the principle of \"shared responsibility\". However, the EC suggests that provisions specifically requesting cooperation between economic operators in the supply chain and users should be adopted. For example, each actor in the value chain who has an impact on the product's safety, from software producers to repairers modifying the product, should assume responsibility and provide the next actor in the chain with the necessary information and measures.</p><p>In light of the recommendations contained in the Report on Safety and Liability, future product liability legislation may cover, inter alia, the following aspects:</p><p> Complexity of products, services, and the value chain: The EC considers the definition of \"product\" in the current Product Liability Directive to be sufficiently broad to cover AI products and systems. However, in the view of the EC, the scope of the Product Liability Directive should be clarified to reflect the complexity of such products and systems and to ensure that compensation is always available for damage caused by products that are defective because of software or other digital features.Burden of proof in complex environments: The current liability regime in the EU relies on the parallel application of the Product Liability Directive, which features a system of strict liability, and fault-based and/or strict liability rules of the individual EU Member States. In order to mitigate the consequences of complexity, the EC is seeking industry feedback whether and to what extent it may be necessary to alleviate or reverse the burden of proof required by the individual EU Member State's liability rules for damage caused by the operation of AI applications. For instance, a reversal as regards fault and causation could apply where the relevant economic operator failed to meet specific mandatory cyber-security or other safety rules.Connectivity and openness: Connectivity and openness characteristics of AI products may influence the safety expectations with regard to damage that results from cyber-security breaches. Furthermore, connected products may also be used for purposes beyond those reasonably expected by the manufacturer. Therefore, the EC considers legislation in order to clarify and facilitate compensation for damages caused to users, particularly in situations concerning foreseeable reasonable use and contributory negligence (e.g., the failure of the injured party to download a safety update).Autonomy and opacity: In addition to issues such as complexity, the fact that AI applications can improve their performance by learning from experience creates a challenge to the effective enforcement of liability claims. The EC notes that a guiding principle for EU product safety and product liability remains the obligation of producers to ensure that all products put on the market are safe throughout their entire lifecycle and for the use that can reasonably be expected. In order to address the remaining uncertainties regarding the liability of manufacturers the EC proposes revisiting the notion of 'putting into circulation' that is currently used by the Product Liability Directive to cover products that have been changed or altered, and to clarify who is liable for any changes that are made to the product.High-risk applications: The EC is seeking views on whether and to what extent strict liability, as it exists in some national laws of individual EU Member States, may be necessary in order for possible victims of high-risk AI devices and services (i.e. where there is a possibility of significant harm to important legal interests, like life, health and property) to achieve effective compensation. Further, the EC is also seeking views on whether strict liability should be coupled with an obligation of the relevant economic operator to have in place available insurance. For the operation of non high-risk AI devices and services, the EC suggests that changes to the burden of proof might be required as well, since the victim may not be able to obtain the relevant data required to assess liability from the potentially liable party.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>While there is no specific draft legislation yet, we expect that the EC will deliver concrete proposals later this year after the public consultation phase has ended. Companies active in the field of AI should closely follow the latest developments in the EU given the proposed geographic reach of the future AI legislation, which is likely to affect all companies doing business in the EU. With the presentation of the White Paper, the Data Strategy and the Report on Safety and Liability, EC President Ursula von der Leyen and her new commission have made it clear that they have ambitious plans for Europe's digital transformation. Certainly we will see a lot of legislative activity in Europe aimed at challenging the US and Chinese dominance in the digital realm, not only with regard to AI. After all, the EC is striving \"to export its values across the world\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote18\"/><label>18</label><bodyText><p>Supra note 1, EC, White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust, p. 9.</p></bodyText></footnote> and \"actively promote its standards.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote19\"/><label>19</label><bodyText><p>Supra note 3, EC, A European strategy for data, p. 24.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>As the EC has launched a public consultation period and requested comments on the proposals set out in the White Paper and the Data Strategy, this is an important opportunity for companies and other stakeholders to provide feedback and shape the future EU regulatory landscape for AI.

The announcement also represents the Commission's first major regulatory proposal in this area since Margrethe Vestager commenced her dual-role as Executive Vice-President of the Commission responsible for \"a Europe fit for a digital age\" and Commissioner for Competition. From a competition law perspective, the Data Strategy and Digital Future Communications contain proposals relating to: ex ante regulation of \"Big Tech\" platforms; potentially updating competition law as it applies to digital markets; how the collection and use of data can be factored into in merger control analyses; and voluntary and (where appropriate) compulsory data sharing. The scope of the papers seems to be ambitious, and it remains to be seen how many of the proposals and ideas will ultimately be taken forward in the short to medium term.</p><p>AI White Paper</p><p>The AI White Paper sets out the Commission's proposed approach to AI regulation. The focus is on a risk-based approach, imposing mandatory regulatory requirements for \"high-risk\" applications, i.e. where the AI is deployed in a sector where significant risks can be expected (e.g. healthcare) and where risks are likely to arise given the manner of use of the AI (e.g. health risks). For high risk (and certain other) applications, the AI White Paper proposes requirements in relation to: training data; data and record-keeping; information to be provided; robustness and accuracy; human oversight; and specific requirements for certain particular AI applications, such as those used for purposes of remote biometric identification. For non-high risk AI applications, the AI White Paper proposes a voluntary labelling scheme, through which economic operators that opt-in would be awarded a \"quality label\" for their AI applications.</p><p>The AI White Paper also sets out proposals in relation to compliance, enforcement and governance with respect to the new regulatory framework, including in particular the use of prior conformity assessments (which is already in place for many products placed on the EU internal market), with procedures for testing, inspection or certification as adapted to AI applications, including potentially checks of the algorithms and of the data sets used in development phases. Finally, the AI White Paper raises possible adjustments to EU product safety and liability legislation and potentially new legislation specifically for AI, in order to make the EU legal framework fit for current and anticipated technological and commercial developments (this is further explored in a separate report accompanying the AI White Paper).</p><p>The AI White Paper will be open to consultation until 19 May 2020 (the consultation will be made available here).</p><p>Data Strategy Communication</p><p>The Data Strategy Communication sets out a number of initiatives that are essentially intended to promote the EU's data economy. Amongst other things, the Data Strategy Communication proposes possible legislative initiatives (as part of a \"Data Act\") to promote business-to-business data sharing on a voluntary basis. As part of this, the Commission will provide guidance with respect to the compliance of data sharing and pooling arrangements with EU competition law. The Commission will also consider making data-sharing compulsory in specific circumstances under \"fair, transparent, reasonable, proportionate and/or non-discriminatory conditions.\"</p><p>The Data Strategy Communication discusses \"Big Tech\" companies accumulating large amounts of data, which can result in competitive advantages that affect the contestability of markets and enable those firms to spread into neighbouring markets relatively easily. However, this issue does not form part of the \"Data Act\" - instead it will be examined under the proposals/initiatives in the Digital Future Communication (see below).</p><p>In relation to merger control, the Data Strategy Communication states that the Commission will look at the possible effects on competition of large-scale data accumulation through acquisitions and at the utility of data-access or data-sharing remedies to resolve any concerns. With respect to state aid, the Data Strategy Communication states that the Commission will examine, in its ongoing review of a number of state aid guidelines, \"the relationship between public support to undertakings (e.g. for digital transformation) and the minimisation of competition distortions through data-sharing requirements for beneficiaries.\"</p><p>Other proposals include:</p><p> an implementing act defining the public sector \"high-value data sets\" under the revised Open Data Directive on public sector information re-use, for which greater access rights apply;possible legislative initiatives addressing issues related to usage rights for co-generated data (such as internet of things data in industrial settings), and establishing data pools for data analysis and machine learning; andthe establishment of \"common European data spaces\" in strategic sectors and domains of public interest, with the aim of creating large pools of available data in these sectors combined with the technical tools and infrastructures necessary to use and exchange data, as well as appropriate governance mechanisms. The sectors listed are: industrial, the \"European green deal\" area, mobility, health, financial, energy, agriculture, public administration and skills.</p><p>The Commission is currently gathering feedback on its data strategy (no deadline appears to have been set).</p><p>Digital Future Communication</p><p>The Digital Future Communication sets out three key principles/objectives: (1) \"technology that works for people\", (2) \"a fair and competitive economy\", and (3) \"an open, democratic and sustainable society\". The communication contains an array of proposals to promote these principles/objectives, but is largely light on detail in relation to specific proposals. In relation to the second objective, the Commission emphasises the need to ensure a level playing field for businesses in the EU single market. As part of this initiative, the Commission will:</p><p> launch a sector inquiry into digital markets in 2020;evaluate/review the fitness of EU competition rules for the digital age on an ongoing basis (provisionally until 2023). The Commission is already reviewing rules governing horizontal and vertical agreements and market definition;explore the possibility of introducing ex ante regulation to ensure that \"markets characterised by large platforms with significant network effects acting as gate-keepers, remain fair and contestable for innovators, businesses, and new market entrants.\"; andlook to address the tax challenges arising from digitisation of the economy.</p><p>The other two objectives are less related to competition policy. Examples of proposals relating to the first objective include promoting investments in Europe's Gigabit connectivity, rolling out 5G corridors for connected and automated mobility, boosting digital literacy and skills, and improving the labour conditions of platform workers, while examples relating to the third objective include harmonising the responsibilities of online platforms in respect of the content they host, revising the eIDAS Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, and addressing the threats of external intervention in European elections, amongst other things.</p><p>Comment</p><p>One of the Commission's primary aims (in particular in relation to the Data Strategy and Digital Future Communications) is maintaining a level playing field for small-to-medium sized European businesses in terms of access to both consumers and data in the digital age. In this sense, the Commission appears to be suggesting a two-pronged attack to promote a level-playing field.</p><p>Firstly, mandatory data-sharing obligations could seek to ensure that small businesses have access to the same data as larger incumbents (in the same vein as the Commission's ongoing investigation into Amazon, where the Commission alleges that Amazon abuses its market position by collecting merchants' sales data and exploiting it to its own advantage). Secondly, we could also see ex ante regulation regarding the treatment by digital platforms of businesses that distribute their products/services through them. These proposals in particular seem to be aimed at \"Big Tech\", which is generally taken to mean Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and sometimes also Microsoft (although a wider application cannot be ruled out). Such regulatory intervention could supplant the current competition law regime as it applies in this area, avoiding the need for drawn-out and complex antitrust investigations (such as the concluded investigations - pending on appeal - in Google Shopping and Google Android and the ongoing investigation into Amazon's data practices).</p><p>More than anything else, however, the papers act as a roadmap for future regulatory initiatives in the digital sector, and in particular in relation to AI and data. The scope of the papers seems to be ambitious, and it remains to be seen how many of the proposals and ideas will ultimately be taken forward in the short to medium term. More detail on the proposals that are taken forward should become available later in 2020.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.'s main trust-buster, announced Wednesday that regulators are looking into Amazon's use of data from itssmallerthird-party sellers, Reuters reported[1]. The E.U.'s primary concern with Amazon is that the third-party merchants whose products are hosted on the site are also technically Amazon competitors. However, by going through Amazon's system to sell their wares, they are giving data to Amazon that the e-commerce giant could use in its competition with said retailers. </p><p>In a press conference, Vestager emphasized that this is a preliminary step and there is not yet a formal case against Amazon. The EU is investigating Amazon. A picture shows an Ipad with an 'Amazon' logo on November 13, 2012 in Paris. Photo: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images 'We are gathering information on the issue and we have sent quite a number of questionnaires to market participants in order to understand this issue in full,' Vestager said. The news comes on the same week in which Amazon launched a feature meant to support third-party sellers. The new Storefronts page[2] on Amazon gives customers a way to shop exclusively from the 'small and medium' businesses that make up a significant portion of the site's product offerings. In fact, Amazon claims half of everything on Amazon comes from these sellers. The E.U. generally fights harder antitrust battles than the U.S. government. Vestager's regulators have come down on big tech companies, in particular, having levied a $5 billion fine[3] against Google earlier this year. The commission charged Google with asserting its dominance in the mobile phone market by making hardware companies install pre-install Google apps on Android smartphones. President Donald Trump later criticized[4] the E.U. for its fine on Google, calling the California-based tech giants 'one of our great companies.' The E.U.'s investigation may not reach any significant conclusion, but it is the latest instance of someone with institutional power criticizing Amazon for its size and business practices. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has also blasted the company recently for allegedly unsafe working conditions at its many fulfillment centers. The company firmly denied the allegations[5], but Sanders still introduced corporate tax legislation[6], which was named after Bezos.

The leaders meeting at a summit in Brussels are setti...</p><p>BRUSSELS: European Union (EU) leaders will today back plans to impose unprecedented rules against Big Tech, promising to make Europe a global rule-maker against the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon.    The leaders meeting at a summit in Brussels are setting the groundwork for an EU \"Digital Services Act\", a massive legal proposal expected in December that will overhaul the regulation of internet platforms.    In prepared draft conclusions from the two-day summit, seen by AFP, the leaders stress that \"to be digitally sovereign\" the EU must \"reinforce its ability to define its own rules, to make autonomous technological choices.\"    The leaders will commit that \"at the international level, the EU will leverage its tools and regulatory powers to help shape global rules and standards.\"    At the heart of the proposals, currently in preparation for December by the European Commission, will be the notion that US tech giants have become internet \"gatekeepers\" that must be given specific rules and undergo stricter oversight.    \"Perhaps these platforms have become too big to care,\" said Thierry Breton this week, an EU commissioner who will be closely involved in the proposal.    \"That's something that we must deal with, just as we did with banks. We're going to have to acquire the necessary regulatory tools to control those players,\" he told MEPs.    The long-trailed plans have sparked a lobbying frenzy in Brussels, with Big Tech eager to dampen the resolve of European regulators to limit their reach.    According to EU documents seen by AFP, Google's search engine, Amazon's shopping platform and the Apple app store could potentially fall under the new \"gatekeeper\" designation.    In one of the documents, Brussels blacklists practices used by Big Tech that could face bans or strict limitations, including an order that they share their highly valuable data with businesses using their platforms.    The plans could also include bans on the exclusive pre-installation of apps, bans on preferential ranking in search results or news feeds and bans on forcing apps to use the Apple or Google app store for customer payments.    If confirmed, these rules would force tech giants into practices that major competition cases -- which often take years \u2013 have so far failed to do.    Over the past decades, the EU has pushed a series of such cases, which have so far resulted in billions of euros in fines against Google, but have left critics unsatisfied by the lack of meaningful change in behaviour by tech giants.    The main intention of the Digital Services Act will be to update legislation that dates back to 2004, when many of today's internet giants either did not exist or were in their infancy.    Another key component will be to give the EU's antitrust authority new powers to ensure that the likes of Facebook or Google do not dominate new markets.    The European Commission's end-of-year proposal will then enter a painful negotiation with the European Parliament as well as the 27 member states.    Euro MPs have already tabled their own versions of a Digital Services Act, which has thousands of amendments and input from a wide range of lobbyists eager to shape the outcome.    The Digital Services Act \"should ensure that companies that are established outside the EU, that target our market, our consumers, our users, must abide with our rules,\" said the social democrat MEP Alex Agius Saliba, a leading parliamentary voice on the issue. \u2013 AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43211396809</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-4MG1-F07F-855B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>The Sun Daily</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That stands in sharp contrast with the United States, which is pulling out of the accord under President Donald Trump who is a climate-change sceptic.</p><p>Von der Leyen reaffirmed the ambition for Europe to reach climate neutrality by 2050, but told Timmermans: \"We have to be more ambitious when it comes to our 2030 emission reduction target. This should increase to at least 50 percent by 2030, up from the 40 percent currently agreed.\"</p><p>She also tasked him with international negotiations to increase engagement along the same lines by \"other major emitters\" by 2021.</p><p>Vestager gains power</p><p>Announcing the key roles in her line-up, von der Leyen said Denmark's Margrethe Vestager would remain in charge of competition policy and step up to be an executive vice-president too.</p><p>Vestager was the star of the outgoing commission, upsetting Berlin and Paris by opposing a merger between train-makers Alstom and Siemens and clashing with the White House.</p><p>Last year, US President Donald Trump complained to outgoing commission head Jean-Claude Juncker about Vestager's efforts to regulate big tech, declaring: \"Your tax lady, she really hates the US.\"</p><p>Irishman Phil Hogan was put in charge of trade, a crucial position that will require him to settle the European Union's trade relations with post-Brexit Britain and with the United States.</p><p>Von der Leyen will become the first woman to head the European Commission after promising a platform of a greener, fairer and rule-based Europe.</p><p>Her proposed team offers rough gender balance, a plus point for EU lawmakers, with 13 women and 14 men.</p><p>\"This team will shape the European Way: we will take bold action against climate change, build our partnership with the United States, define our relations with a more self-assertive China and be a reliable neighbour, for example to Africa,\" she said in a statement.</p><p>\"This team will have to stand up for our values and world-class standards,\u201d she added. \u201cMy Commission will be a geopolitical Commission committed to sustainable policies. And I want the European Union to be the guardian of multilateralism. Because we know that we are stronger by doing together what we cannot do alone.\"</p><p>(FRANCE 24 with AFP, REUTERS)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FR24EN-153641953</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FR24EN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X17-4TF1-F11P-X205-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407771</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

The commission will focus on whether and how the use of data by Amazon, in its role as a retailer, affects competition.</p><p>In addition, the investigation will examine the role of the selection of winners of the \"Buy Box,\" a prominently displayed option that allows customers to add items from specific retailers directly to their shopping carts. \"Winning the 'Buy Box' seems key for marketplace sellers as a vast majority of transactions are done through it,\" the commission said.</p><p>Amazon is a global behemoth in online retailing. It reported revenue in the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2018, of $232.89 billion and it has a market value of about $1 trillion.</p><p>\"E-commerce has boosted retail competition and brought more [choices] and better prices,\" European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager said. \"We need to ensure that large online platforms don't eliminate these benefits through anticompetitive behavior.\"</p><p>Amazon pledged to cooperate with the probe. \"We will cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow,\" it said in a statement emailed to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Europe is increasingly scrutinizing big tech's data dominance in the wake of the tougher privacy laws passed under the General Data Protection Regulation ordinance in May 2018. Google, which has been fined three times for antitrust violations in the EU over its Android, advertising, and search services, was handed a $57 million levy in January by France's data watchdog for GDPR breaches over its opaque ad-targeting policies. Google is appealing the decision.</p><p>Ireland's data regulator also is investigating 17 global tech companies with offices in the country, including Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc., for possible privacy violations, according to a report in the Irish Times in May.</p><p>In October 2017, the commission ordered Luxembourg to recover about  250 million from Amazon after it concluded the country's tax rules allowed the company to avoid paying taxes on three-quarters of its profits earned in the EU between May 2006 and June 2014.</p><p>Earlier on July 17, Germany's competition authority said it reached a deal with Amazon that will see the company revamp its terms of service for third-party sellers.

Online sales in such countries as Spain, an EU member, are expected to grow by 20 percent , according to eMarketer.   The European Commission, the EU\u2019s arm for antitrust regulations, said in a press release that it will examine vertical block exemption regulations (VBER).   \u201cThe market has significantly changed, and (our) evaluation has identified a number of issues that need to be addressed,\u201d said the commission\u2019s Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager , who is in charge of competition policy. The goal, she added, is \u201cto ensure that the rules remain fit for a world that is increasingly digital and changing at a fast pace.\u201d   The need for an update in these regulations is particularly \u201cdue to the growth of online sales and of new market players, such as online platforms,\u201d said the commission. \u201cNew types of vertical restrictions, such as restrictions regarding sales through online marketplaces and restrictions on online advertising, as well as retail parity clauses, have become more widespread.\u201d   In addition, the commission wants to look at price comparison websites.   This summer, the EU put out new rules aimed at Google that include regulations on data sharing and the operation of digital marketplaces. The new rules, under the Digital Services Act (DSA), could force Big Tech firms like Google to offer data access to smaller firms and abide by reasonable, standardized and non-discriminatory terms.   In another move targeting Big Tech, the EU is also looking at the issue of limiting \u201cunfair contract terms,\u201d which could target  Amazon 's dual status as a marketplace for merchants as well as a competitor.   In addition, Google filed a lawsuit earlier this year after the EU levied a \u20ac2.4-billion ($2.6 billion) fine against the company, charging that it used its position in the online world to divert traffic to its own ads rather than the competition.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    NEW PYMNTS DATA: HOW WE SHOP STUDY \u2013 SEPTEMBER 2020     The How We Shop Report, a PYMNTS collaboration with PayPal , aims to understand how consumers of all ages and incomes are shifting to shopping and paying online in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research builds on a series of studies conducted since March, surveying more than 16,000 consumers on how their shopping habits and payments preferences are changing as the crisis continues. This report focuses on our latest survey of 2,163 respondents and examines how their increased appetite for online commerce and digital touchless methods, such as QR codes, contactless cards and digital wallets, is poised to shape the post-pandemic economy.

Online sales in such countries as Spain, an EU member, are expected to grow by 20 percent , according to eMarketer.   The European Commission, the EU\u2019s arm for antitrust regulations, said in a press release that it will examine vertical block exemption regulations (VBER).   \u201cThe market has significantly changed, and (our) evaluation has identified a number of issues that need to be addressed,\u201d said the commission\u2019s Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager , who is in charge of competition policy. The goal, she added, is \u201cto ensure that the rules remain fit for a world that is increasingly digital and changing at a fast pace.\u201d   The need for an update in these regulations is particularly \u201cdue to the growth of online sales and of new market players, such as online platforms,\u201d said the commission. \u201cNew types of vertical restrictions, such as restrictions regarding sales through online marketplaces and restrictions on online advertising, as well as retail parity clauses, have become more widespread.\u201d   In addition, the commission wants to look at price comparison websites.   This summer, the EU put out new rules aimed at Google that include regulations on data sharing and the operation of digital marketplaces. The new rules, under the Digital Services Act (DSA), could force Big Tech firms like Google to offer data access to smaller firms and abide by reasonable, standardized and non-discriminatory terms.   In another move targeting Big Tech, the EU is also looking at the issue of limiting \u201cunfair contract terms,\u201d which could target  Amazon 's dual status as a marketplace for merchants as well as a competitor.   In addition, Google filed a lawsuit earlier this year after the EU levied a \u20ac2.4-billion ($2.6 billion) fine against the company, charging that it used its position in the online world to divert traffic to its own ads rather than the competition.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    NEW PYMNTS DATA: HOW WE SHOP STUDY \u2013 SEPTEMBER 2020     The How We Shop Report, a PYMNTS collaboration with PayPal , aims to understand how consumers of all ages and incomes are shifting to shopping and paying online in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research builds on a series of studies conducted since March, surveying more than 16,000 consumers on how their shopping habits and payments preferences are changing as the crisis continues. This report focuses on our latest survey of 2,163 respondents and examines how their increased appetite for online commerce and digital touchless methods, such as QR codes, contactless cards and digital wallets, is poised to shape the post-pandemic economy.

A united Europe has bestowed peace and prosperty to each Member State and its people - the German people included. </p><p>And the future challenges facing each and every one of us can only be met by working together in Europe. </p><p>1. Scepticism towards the advantages of Europe</p><p>And yet Europe is increasingly subject to criticism. Public scepticism towards Europe has grown: in 2007 some 57% of the EU population said they trusted the EU, but this share has now fallen to 44%. At the same time, Eurosceptic parties have almost doubled their share of votes over the past ten years.</p><p>One explanation is that people feel unsettled, not only in the face of advancing globalisation and structural changes but also because of increasing migration. </p><p>Far-reaching changes, fear and a sense of disorientation often cause people to reject what's new and retreat to what is familiar. </p><p>And this withdrawal becomes menancing if people no longer want to exchange views and opinions and applaud seemingly simple answers as ultimate wisdom. </p><p>It becomes dangerous if, owing to social media and the filter bubbles affecting what we see online, we merely find confimation of our own beliefs.</p><p>And such withdrawal becomes particularly dangerous if people lose empathy and the inherent willingness to take other people's viewpoints and values seriously. </p><p>All of this leads to rejection and exclusion in our society. When people feel that their voices are no longer being heard and that they are no longer represented, populists find it easy to undermine the system and propagate simple solutions. The populists' success is based on the perception that they are seriously addressing people's concerns by proposing radical solutions. This is how they spread their new nationalism. </p><p>Some Eurosceptic parties are pushing for a retreat from Europe, a withdrawal behind national borders. All too often, regaining national sovereignty is seen as an opportunity to acquire more freedom of action and security in the face of global developments. This suggests that we can preserve our prosperity by sealing ourselves off. </p><p>This notion and the retreat to nationalist thinking is wrong. Because it fails to recognise the many benefits that Europe has brought us. </p><p>Europe has brought peace. </p><p>With the European Union we have found a way of resolving conflict that has ushered in the longest period of continuous peace in the history of Europe. The EU has transformed a continent of war into a continent of peace. We should not take this for granted - and the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the EU reminds us not to do so. </p><p>Europa has brought freedom. </p><p>Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are prerequisites for EU membership. Let's not forget that in 1957, only 12 of the current Member States were democracies, compared with 28 now. </p><p>Europe has provided an unprecedented degree of freedom of movement. Thanks to the EU, European citizens enjoy border-free travel and are free to study and work within the EU, creating inestimable development opportunities for everyone. And the consequences can be felt in everyday life:</p><p>17 million people and 1.4 million commuters live or work in another Member State, approximately equivalent to the entire population of the Netherlands. And every year we cross one of the internal borders within the Schengen area an almost inconceivable 1.27 billion times.</p><p>Europe has brought prosperity. </p><p>Some 25 years of the Single Market have generated real growth for more than 500 million consumers. Average per capita income in the EU has risen by half over this period.</p><p>This last point, more prosperity across Europe, is one I must address separately. Because the economic benefits of Europe are often a point of contention in Germany.</p><p>Hardly any other economy has profited from the Single Market as much as Germany. Were it not for an open Europe and the creation of the Single Market, the robust economic growth of the post-war era would have levelled off over time. </p><p>The free movement of goods, in other words, the abolishment of customs barriers and other obstacles, has created a large European market which promotes trade and growth. </p><p>Likewise, the freedom of services has enabled people to offer their services in all EU countries. </p><p>And the free movement of capital and payments created the conditions for the euro and a common financial market. </p><p>Free movement of goods, capital and payments and freedom of services have allowed Europe to grow more closely together, have advanced the German economy and have brought prosperity to us all. </p><p>German firms last year exported goods to the value of almost 780 billion to other EU Member States. </p><p>Without trade barriers, without exchange rate risk. </p><p>That accounts for almost two-thirds of all German exports. The Single Market creates and secures high-quality jobs in Germany. </p><p>According to the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Single Market contributes 37 billion a year to German real GDP growth. That represents additional income of 450 per person and year.</p><p>We also owe these advantages to the euro, as the bulk of trade is invoiced in euro. The euro cements the Single Market; our common currency prevents exchange rate fluctuations and competetive devaluations between the Member States. The euro has thus provided stability and prosperity. Without the euro, open markets in Europe would not have lasted long. </p><p>And all this has not only benefited enterprises, but first and foremost consumers too. The inflation rate has been stable for many years. For the euro it has averaged 1.7% since its introduction, compared with 2.8% for the D-Mark. </p><p>I have now spoken about the past advantages of a united Europe. Let's now take a look at the future. Here, too, I am convinced that all of us, Germany too, will be able to master the challenges of the future in a united Europe. </p><p>2. The advantages of Europe for future challenges </p><p>All countries in Europe face major, predominantly global, challenges, such as increasing worldwide competition, climate change and technological progress. </p><p>a. Global competition</p><p>No country, Germany included, can turn its back on globalisation if it wishes to secure future prosperity and distribute it evenly. </p><p>And we need the EU in order to retain our capacity to act and to shape global developments. </p><p>The economic weight of Europe's Member States has drastically declined over the past decades. Looking at the aggregate economic performance of EU countries, the EU's share in global economic output has fallen from around a third in the 1980s to a sixth today. Germany's share has more than halved over the same period and now stands at around 3%.</p><p>And individual European countries will continue to lose their significance in the world, for one because our birth rate is far lower than that of other countries. More than 500 million people now live in the EU, representing 8% of the world's population. In 2050, this share will have declined to just 5%. The German population will then make up no more than 0.8% of people in the world. </p><p>In such an interconnected world, individual countries will therefore find it increasingly difficult to uphold their prosperity and social security provisions. </p><p>Globalisation reduces the capacity of individual countries to levy corporate taxes and finance their social security systems. Free movement of capital allows enterprises to use differences between tax systems to their advantage and to distribute both profits and intangible assets across different countries. This leads to corporate tax bases being eroded. The OECD estimates that the global revenue shortfall owing to tax avoidance amounts to between 4% and 10% of corporate income tax receipts.</p><p>Moreover, globally-active companies can threaten to cut jobs and move production to other countries. Countries are thus tempted to use lower labour and social security standards to their competitive advantage and enter into a race to the bottom, making it harder for them to defend their social standards. </p><p>By pulling together, countries in Europe are in a better position to withstand global developments. As a whole, Europe is still large and economically significant enough to tax corporate profits and put an end to social dumping. The EU is a market that firms can hardly do without. </p><p>Power lies in numbers. </p><p>That is especially true for trade. The EU is the most tightly integrated economic region in the world. Two-thirds of EU trade takes place with other Member States. And around 50% of cross-border financial holdings in the euro area are from other euro area countries. That is true for Germany too. In practical terms, this means, for example, that Germany exports more goods to France than to China. </p><p>So it's not surprising that turning away from Europe could have disasterous consequences for our prosperity. One study shows that, for example, new trade restrictions in Europe could reduce Germany's economic output by 8 %.</p><p>In their external trade, too, countries that go it alone only stand to lose. No country has the heft required to make itself heard in international trade talks and signficantly influence trade conditions. And no national economy is large enough to set the common standards for globally integrated value chains. Neither is Germany: our share in global trade is only half the size of that of the EU. </p><p>Moreover, Germany's significance for world trade is set to dwindle further in future. The European Commission predicts that, over the next 10 to 15 years, 90% of global growth will be generated outside of Europe. But in Germany especially, employment relies heavily on open markets and international trade: nigh on 30% of German jobs depend directly or indirectly on exports, and this is true for as many as every second job in industry.</p><p>If we are to profit from this international growth, we need open markets and a strong voice in international trade talks. Only the EU can offer us these. </p><p>The EU improves the ability of all Member States to control outcomes. By acting together, we can attain objectives that we would have been unable to reach alone. For the EU is the main trading partner for 80 countries worldwide. And with the combined weight of EU Member States in global value chains, European firms can set their standards throughout the world.</p><p>b. Climate change </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, joint action in Europe is also needed to overcome a completely different challenge facing all countries, namely climate change. </p><p>People in this country are serious about tackling climate change. But countries cannot win the struggle against climate change on their own: pollution does not respect borders. </p><p>Think of, say, pollution entering the Rhine or the Danube and potentially affecting another country further downstream. Or the acid rain caused by UK coal-fired power plants in the 1980s which harmed the forests and lakes of Scandinavia. </p><p>Climate change is a global phenomenon that poses complex coordination issues for national governments and affects many areas of life, including the economy. Allow me to concentrate on some of the economic consequences of climate change. That in itself will reveal the immensity of the challenges which we can only successfully overcome together. </p><p>For one, climate change affects competitiveness in the Single Market. </p><p>As trade in goods and services expands, it's important to ensure a level playing field. However, individual countries may implement environmental measures that distort competition. That can happen if, for example, production standards are lowered in a bid to achieve cost advantages. Amid international competition, such practices can lead to environmental dumping - with detrimental consequences not only for the Single Market but also for the environment. So countries have to work together to stop this dangerous dynamic.</p><p>Even the direct effects of climate change alone may have an enormous impact on the economy. Rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns may depress earnings in different economic sectors such as agriculture, energy, tourism or construction. </p><p>And that may also affect the financial system. If companies have serious difficulty in repaying their loans or disbursing dividends, banks and their creditors and investors will in turn suffer damages too. </p><p>Moreover, environmental and climate protection measures may have extensive economic consequences. The bans on diesel cars and the fall-out from the emissions scandal, for example, not only triggered a decline in car manufacturers' share prices, but also in the prices for used diesel cars. And handling the trend towards electromobility is testing the German automobile industry's future viability to the limit. </p><p>All of this shows the extent to which climate change and environmental measures can affect economic activity, assets and jobs. </p><p>Europe offers a unique opportunity to combat climate change and so reduce the potential damage to the economy.</p><p>Europe can provide well-coordinated instruments and clear, reliable regulation, such as the Europe-wide carbon floor price. The European emissions trading scheme with fixed caps on emissions is the first and largest of its kind worldwide. </p><p>As one of the three largest economic blocs in the world, Europe can be at the vanguard of the fight against climate change. </p><p>Europe has long campaigned internationally for strong and binding targets. For one, the EU built up a broad alliance of industrial and developing countries with ambitious targets, which significantly contributed to the success of the Paris Conference. Moreover, the EU was the first large economic region to present its planned contribution to the agreement as early as in March 2015. </p><p>And Europe can ensure that the financial market helps attain climate targets. </p><p>It has now become clear that market participants are failing to take the social costs of their activities for the environment fully into account, leading to a lack of sustainable finance. This arises, for example, when market participants base their investment decisions on excessively short time horizons and fail to factor in environmental risks. Because they would otherwise, from a risk perspective, steadily shift the focus of their investment to green and sustainable assets and so contribute to the attainment of the climate targets. Europe can give impetus and set up the right framework.</p><p>Central banks such as the European Central Bank can also help to fight climate change. </p><p>First, the ECB can contribute to the development of tools and methods that can be used to identify, quantify and mitigate climate-related risks in the financial system.</p><p>Second, the ECB can use its investment portfolio to help fight climate change. For example, sustainability criteria are already taken into account in our portfolios that are not held for monetary policy purposes. We have also bought green bonds under our asset purchase programme. But we have to make sure that we are not creating market distortions, of course - we have to remain market-neutral. This means that the ECB can only buy a limited amount of the green bonds available on the market. </p><p>Third, the ECB - together with other leading central banks - can examine the potential effects of climate change on the conduct of monetary policy. We are still in the early stages of our research into whether and how climate change affects the transmission channels of monetary policy and could lead to bigger and more persistent shocks that could have consequences for price stability, among other things.</p><p>Fourth, forward-looking banking supervision can urge banks to ensure that they have an overview of the climate-related risks on their balance sheets, and that they do so on a continual basis and with reference to stress scenarios. This is the approach that European banking supervision is taking. </p><p>c. Payments</p><p>I have talked about the major challenges facing Europe. But there are also areas which are less prominent and not quite so fundamental, but which are still important in our interconnected world. </p><p>Payments are one such example. Safe, reliable and efficient payment systems are a vital part of a well-functioning and integrated economy.</p><p>Technological progress and changing payment habits have fundamentally altered the payment system and thrown up new challenges. End users now expect to be able to transfer money around the world in real time and at low cost.</p><p>But existing payment systems are fragmented along national lines. The German Girocard scheme and the French Carte Bancaire, for example, are both used by large numbers of end users in their domestic markets, but they exist in parallel and separately from one another. </p><p>Many payment service providers retreat behind national boundaries on account of national interests and preferences. </p><p>And customers can see this. If they want to make cross-border payments in Europe with ease, they frequently rely on global players such as VISA, Mastercard and PayPal. And the big tech companiesalso offer payment solutions with pan-European reach. This is easier for them, since their global customer base allows them to achieve the desired network effects.</p><p>At the moment there are only a handful of large payment service providers offering pan-European payment services. New payment methods are being developed, such as Facebook's planned digital currency, Libra, and its underlying payment system.</p><p>According to current plans, users across the globe should be able to make payments not in euro or US dollars, but in Libra. We will need to carefully monitor how this will affect competition, because a lack of competition can impair the efficiency and quality of services in the long term, to the detriment of consumers. </p><p>Irrespective of how the payments landscape evolves over the coming years, it is essential that users of the various payment systems can be confident that all payment solutions, old and new alike, are safe and efficient. </p><p>To ensure that we have a safe, efficient and modern European payment system in the long term, though, we will need to work together at the European level. National solutions on their own don't have the necessary weight to achieve sufficient scale and network effects. </p><p>What a future-oriented European payment system needs most of all are efficient, future-oriented, pan-European market initiatives. The Eurosystem would welcome such initiatives and would likely support them, within the limits of its mandate. </p><p>A European payment system which has cross-border reach, supports modern payment methods and is accessible to all could set global standards. And it would also foster integration in Europe.</p><p>It would allow people across Europe to make transactions cheaply and safely, and this would enhance the benefits of the Single Market, making it more efficient, more innovative and better able to support growth and prosperity in all EU countries. An integrated market would thus increase the benefits of Europe for all countries. </p><p>3. A plea for more European integration</p><p>Creating optimum conditions for the Single Market and the euro is also in Germany's interest. And optimum conditions include not just the type of robust payment system I have just been talking about, but also the lasting stabilisation and deepening of Economic and Monetary Union. </p><p>This topic has many different aspects, but I would like to focus today on one key question: how can we advance the banking union project?</p><p>Euro area firms still obtain most of their funding through banks. A robust banking sector is thus vital for a healthy European economy and a stable single currency. We need a banking sector that is able to offer services to customers across Europe. And we need a market in which banks can compete on a level playing field.</p><p>And the banking union - a single framework for the supervision and resolution of banks in the euro area - has already come a long way. All euro area banks are now supervised according to the same high standards. And the single mechanism for resolution ensures that cross-border bank resolutions can be carried out without damaging either the economy or financial stability. </p><p>But the banking union is still lacking an important component: a European deposit insurance scheme. For there to be an integrated banking sector and a true banking union, depositors in all countries must have the same level of confidence in their banks. People must be able to have confidence that their money is equally safe wherever it is deposited. </p><p>In the long run this can only be done through a European deposit insurance scheme. </p><p>A shared scheme would make Economic and Monetary Union more robust. It would allow financial resources to be pooled between countries and to be used to tackle severe shocks and systemic financial crises that go beyond the capacity of individual countries. </p><p>But it is difficult to reach agreement on this degree of joint liability. If we are to move forward on this, I believe that the journey would need to include three steps.</p><p>First, all members of a shared deposit insurance scheme would need to continue to do everything they can to further reduce risks in their banks. Stable banks are, after all, the best form of protection for deposits. </p><p>Second, the shared insurance should be introduced gradually, and in such a way that individual countries would provide a minimum level of funding to cover national deposits. </p><p>Third, it is critical that banks' contributions to the deposit insurance scheme are risk-based - in other words, that the contribution of each bank is based on the institution's default risk and the amounts involved. </p><p>These three features of a shared deposit insurance scheme would strengthen the individual responsibility of Member States, banks and shareholders and further incentivise risk-based behaviour. And this would ultimately be to the benefit of the EU and all its member countries. </p><p>4. Finding a common way in Europe</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>I can't say it often enough: Europe is our shared opportunity. </p><p>Europe is our opportunity to act together where we face global challenges. After all, no country - Germany included - can by itself meaningfully shape the trading system, the battle against climate change or technological progress. More Europe is therefore the way forward in such an interconnected world.</p><p>But don't get me wrong - this is not an appeal for Europe to regulate all aspects of our lives. The EU brings together the shared features of the 28 Member States, but also their many differences. </p><p>Successful cooperation requires us to work on the basis of shared values, objectives and cooperation principles, of course. </p><p>We need to observe the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality that have always governed the EU's powers. These principles help us to ensure that cultural diversity and national identities are recognised and respected. </p><p>In other words, that we are united in diversity. </p><p>This is an approach that has proved its worth and we should continue to build on it in the future, ensuring that political decisions are made as close to the public as possible.</p><p>And despite all the benefits and the motto united in diversity, there is growing scepticism about Europe. </p><p>One of the frequent complaints is that the EU always operates on the basis of rigid legal principles, making it seem often technocratic and somehow remote. </p><p>This criticism applies to all European institutions and we shouldn't just brush it aside. I firmly believe that the time has come for us to redefine the way in which we work and, in particular, the way in which we communicate. </p><p>And this applies to the European Central Bank too. The ECB needs to address all citizens, not just an expert audience - without ever becoming political, of course - but only in order to bring facts and explanations to economic issues. </p><p>Do good and talk about it - in simple and accessible language - should be the motto here. The people of Europe need to be given much more information about what the EU and its institutions are doing on their behalf - and that information should be coming not just from the EU institutions themselves but most of all from national governments and institutions. </p><p>Only then will we be able to tackle people's fear and disorientation. Only then will we be able to counter the growing polarisation among the people of Europe. </p><p>So we should not be communicating through complex facts, coefficients and rules. This only reinforces the impression that the EU is an arrogant elite that already knows all the answers.</p><p>We will also need to work fundamentally on our understanding of politics and our culture of debate. </p><p>Communication between the public and institutions needs to involve a great deal of commitment and to flow in both directions. The people need to be included so that we can regain their trust and convince them that the EU works for them and takes their concerns seriously.</p><p>A concept that has worked well in a number of countries is that of deliberative democracy. It essentially involves allowing the public to play a greater role in political decision-making processes.</p><p>Ireland provides an instructive example of how this can work. </p><p>In Ireland 99 randomly selected members of the public are brought together to discuss and deliberate on various issues, such as global warming, the challenges arising from demographic change or the law on abortion. The topic of abortion, for example, was for many years a very controversial topic in Ireland, and one that polarised society. </p><p>And so, before a referendum on abortion was held, a citizens' assembly was brought together to discuss the issue. The results of the conversations were published in a report and debated in Parliament. And while public reaction had initially been divided on the matter, the result of the referendum ultimately largely reflected the outcome of the citizens' assembly, which supported the right to abortion.</p><p>Many participants reported that the citizens' assembly had brought logic and structure to the discussion and allowed important facts to emerge. It had also shifted what had initially been a very emotional debate to a more rational plane and helped people to understand complex issues. In the end, the referendum did not lead to a massive divide in society, as had initially been thought. It was instead a process that gave rise to a clear result and social consensus.</p><p>A similar kind of model for exchanging views and participating in political discussions on European matters could also serve Europe well. </p><p>Citizens' assemblies could be a helpful way of bringing together citizens in a given country to talk about European issues. The example of Ireland shows that citizens' assemblies are particularly effective when they discuss a concrete topic. </p><p>But it could also be helpful to have European citizens' assemblies, which would allow citizens of different countries to exchange ideas. </p><p>It is particularly important that, within Europe, we develop additional methods and tools which establish shared values that transcend national borders and cultural differences and give rise to a sense of shared objectives. </p><p>Assemblies like these could also strengthen the dialogue between the people and the EU institutions. EU politicians and civil servants would be better able to understand the concerns of citizens, and thus better able to represent them. And the EU would be brought closer to the people and enjoy greater trust.</p><p>All of this requires hard work, commitment and perseverance, since diversity can slow down the decision-making process. Yes, discussions at the European level take longer than those at the corresponding national level. After all, the many different interests and approaches that often have their roots in national traditions need to be thoroughly discussed and compromises found. </p><p>And even if it does take longer, we all stand to gain from closer cooperation within Europe. </p><p>We need two things here. First, the determination to hold constructive discussions to establish shared values and objectives. And second, the ability to push through our values and objectives in a globalised world.</p><p>I believe that Europe can offer both of these things. </p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Europe's achievements are significant. Never before in the history of our continent have we lived together in such peace for so long, and never before have we enjoyed such freedom. Europe has brought us considerable prosperity, and this has benefited all countries, including Germany. None of this should be taken for granted.</p><p>And yet, Europe faces criticism.</p><p>The major challenges we face, such as globalisation, structural change and migration, are unsettling people and causing many to feel a sense of fear and disorientation. It is then often easier to think in national terms and to ignore the problems to a certain degree. And populists are exploiting this situation to spread a new kind of nationalism - a withdrawal from Europe. I believe that this national way of thinking is dangerous.</p><p>And that's because the global challenges affect all countries. At a time when all European countries are seeing their influence wane in the world, we need to hold together if we want to uphold our values and interests in the world.</p><p>As Konrad Adenauer once said, No European nation is able to protect itself militarily or develop economically on its own. If one wanted today to uphold the traditional concepts of nationalism, this would be a task for Europe.</p><p>And this is why we need a return to Europe, a process of politicisation which encourages people across Europe to find their way back to a common path. We need to work on loosening entrenched debates, understanding differences of opinion and arriving at compromises. </p><p>Only by doing so will we be able to ensure that the people of Europe stand by an EU that is internally united and externally strong.</p><p>Germany needs to play its role in Europe. This is not just in the interests of Europe, it is in the interests of Germany too.</p><p>(European Central Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

National arrogance and isolationism had culminated in two world wars - two world wars which had wreaked death, misery and chaos on Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Adenauer's conviction had a profound influence on many people, including my parents. His core belief that \"we're Europeans first and Germans second is still a great inspiration to me today. For those who lived through the Second World War, a strong Europe, a united Europe, represented the future and the path to lasting peace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But today some people harbour doubts about the European idea. Nationalism and populism are flaring up again and parties that are critical of the European project, or even reject it outright, are gaining ground in many countries.</p><p>This is an alarming development.</p><p>We must not forget the lessons from our history. Borders and walls within Europe have never created security. A united Europe has bestowed peace and prosperty to each Member State and its people - the German people included.</p><p>And the future challenges facing each and every one of us can only be met by working together in Europe.</p><p>1. Scepticism towards the advantages of Europe</p><p>And yet Europe is increasingly subject to criticism. Public scepticism towards Europe has grown: in 2007 some 57% of the EU population said they trusted the EU, but this share has now fallen to 44%. At the same time, Eurosceptic parties have almost doubled their share of votes over the past ten years.</p><p>One explanation is that people feel unsettled, not only in the face of advancing globalisation and structural changes but also because of increasing migration.</p><p>Far-reaching changes, fear and a sense of disorientation often cause people to reject what's new and retreat to what is familiar.</p><p>And this withdrawal becomes menancing if people no longer want to exchange views and opinions and applaud seemingly simple answers as ultimate wisdom.</p><p>It becomes dangerous if, owing to social media and the filter bubbles affecting what we see online, we merely find confimation of our own beliefs.</p><p>And such withdrawal becomes particularly dangerous if people lose empathy and the inherent willingness to take other people's viewpoints and values seriously.</p><p>All of this leads to rejection and exclusion in our society. When people feel that their voices are no longer being heard and that they are no longer represented, populists find it easy to undermine the system and propagate simple solutions. The populists' success is based on the perception that they are seriously addressing people's concerns by proposing radical solutions. This is how they spread their new nationalism.</p><p>Some Eurosceptic parties are pushing for a retreat from Europe, a withdrawal behind national borders. All too often, regaining national sovereignty is seen as an opportunity to acquire more freedom of action and security in the face of global developments. This suggests that we can preserve our prosperity by sealing ourselves off.</p><p>This notion and the retreat to nationalist thinking is wrong. Because it fails to recognise the many benefits that Europe has brought us.</p><p>Europe has brought peace.</p><p>With the European Union we have found a way of resolving conflict that has ushered in the longest period of continuous peace in the history of Europe. The EU has transformed a continent of war into a continent of peace. We should not take this for granted - and the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the EU reminds us not to do so.</p><p>Europa has brought freedom.</p><p>Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are prerequisites for EU membership. Let's not forget that in 1957, only 12 of the current Member States were democracies, compared with 28 now.</p><p>Europe has provided an unprecedented degree of freedom of movement. Thanks to the EU, European citizens enjoy border-free travel and are free to study and work within the EU, creating inestimable development opportunities for everyone. And the consequences can be felt in everyday life:</p><p>17 million people and 1.4 million commuters live or work in another Member State, approximately equivalent to the entire population of the Netherlands. And every year we cross one of the internal borders within the Schengen area an almost inconceivable 1.27 billion times.</p><p>Europe has brought prosperity.</p><p>Some 25 years of the Single Market have generated real growth for more than 500 million consumers. Average per capita income in the EU has risen by half over this period.</p><p>This last point, more prosperity across Europe, is one I must address separately. Because the economic benefits of Europe are often a point of contention in Germany.</p><p>Hardly any other economy has profited from the Single Market as much as Germany. Were it not for an open Europe and the creation of the Single Market, the robust economic growth of the post-war era would have levelled off over time.</p><p>The free movement of goods, in other words, the abolishment of customs barriers and other obstacles, has created a large European market which promotes trade and growth.</p><p>Likewise, the freedom of services has enabled people to offer their services in all EU countries.</p><p>And the free movement of capital and payments created the conditions for the euro and a common financial market.</p><p>Free movement of goods, capital and payments and freedom of services have allowed Europe to grow more closely together, have advanced the German economy and have brought prosperity to us all.</p><p>German firms last year exported goods to the value of almost 780 billion to other EU Member States.</p><p>Without trade barriers, without exchange rate risk.</p><p>That accounts for almost two-thirds of all German exports. The Single Market creates and secures high-quality jobs in Germany.</p><p>According to the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Single Market contributes 37 billion a year to German real GDP growth. That represents additional income of 450 per person and year.</p><p>We also owe these advantages to the euro, as the bulk of trade is invoiced in euro. The euro cements the Single Market; our common currency prevents exchange rate fluctuations and competetive devaluations between the Member States. The euro has thus provided stability and prosperity. Without the euro, open markets in Europe would not have lasted long.</p><p>And all this has not only benefited enterprises, but first and foremost consumers too. The inflation rate has been stable for many years. For the euro it has averaged 1.7% since its introduction, compared with 2.8% for the D-Mark.</p><p>I have now spoken about the past advantages of a united Europe. Let's now take a look at the future. Here, too, I am convinced that all of us, Germany too, will be able to master the challenges of the future in a united Europe.</p><p>2. The advantages of Europe for future challenges</p><p>All countries in Europe face major, predominantly global, challenges, such as increasing worldwide competition, climate change and technological progress.</p><p>a. Global competition</p><p>No country, Germany included, can turn its back on globalisation if it wishes to secure future prosperity and distribute it evenly.</p><p>And we need the EU in order to retain our capacity to act and to shape global developments.</p><p>The economic weight of Europe's Member States has drastically declined over the past decades. Looking at the aggregate economic performance of EU countries, the EU's share in global economic output has fallen from around a third in the 1980s to a sixth today. Germany's share has more than halved over the same period and now stands at around 3%.</p><p>And individual European countries will continue to lose their significance in the world, for one because our birth rate is far lower than that of other countries. More than 500 million people now live in the EU, representing 8% of the world's population. In 2050, this share will have declined to just 5%. The German population will then make up no more than 0.8% of people in the world.</p><p>In such an interconnected world, individual countries will therefore find it increasingly difficult to uphold their prosperity and social security provisions.</p><p>Globalisation reduces the capacity of individual countries to levy corporate taxes and finance their social security systems. Free movement of capital allows enterprises to use differences between tax systems to their advantage and to distribute both profits and intangible assets across different countries. This leads to corporate tax bases being eroded. The OECD estimates that the global revenue shortfall owing to tax avoidance amounts to between 4% and 10% of corporate income tax receipts.</p><p>Moreover, globally-active companies can threaten to cut jobs and move production to other countries. Countries are thus tempted to use lower labour and social security standards to their competitive advantage and enter into a race to the bottom, making it harder for them to defend their social standards.</p><p>By pulling together, countries in Europe are in a better position to withstand global developments. As a whole, Europe is still large and economically significant enough to tax corporate profits and put an end to social dumping. The EU is a market that firms can hardly do without.</p><p>Power lies in numbers.</p><p>That is especially true for trade. The EU is the most tightly integrated economic region in the world. Two-thirds of EU trade takes place with other Member States. And around 50% of cross-border financial holdings in the euro area are from other euro area countries. That is true for Germany too. In practical terms, this means, for example, that Germany exports more goods to France than to China.</p><p>So it's not surprising that turning away from Europe could have disasterous consequences for our prosperity. One study shows that, for example, new trade restrictions in Europe could reduce Germany's economic output by 8 %.</p><p>In their external trade, too, countries that go it alone only stand to lose. No country has the heft required to make itself heard in international trade talks and signficantly influence trade conditions. And no national economy is large enough to set the common standards for globally integrated value chains. Neither is Germany: our share in global trade is only half the size of that of the EU.</p><p>Moreover, Germany's significance for world trade is set to dwindle further in future. The European Commission predicts that, over the next 10 to 15 years, 90% of global growth will be generated outside of Europe. But in Germany especially, employment relies heavily on open markets and international trade: nigh on 30% of German jobs depend directly or indirectly on exports, and this is true for as many as every second job in industry.</p><p>If we are to profit from this international growth, we need open markets and a strong voice in international trade talks. Only the EU can offer us these.</p><p>The EU improves the ability of all Member States to control outcomes. By acting together, we can attain objectives that we would have been unable to reach alone. For the EU is the main trading partner for 80 countries worldwide. And with the combined weight of EU Member States in global value chains, European firms can set their standards throughout the world.</p><p>b. Climate change</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, joint action in Europe is also needed to overcome a completely different challenge facing all countries, namely climate change.</p><p>People in this country are serious about tackling climate change. But countries cannot win the struggle against climate change on their own: pollution does not respect borders.</p><p>Think of, say, pollution entering the Rhine or the Danube and potentially affecting another country further downstream. Or the acid rain caused by UK coal-fired power plants in the 1980s which harmed the forests and lakes of Scandinavia.</p><p>Climate change is a global phenomenon that poses complex coordination issues for national governments and affects many areas of life, including the economy. Allow me to concentrate on some of the economic consequences of climate change. That in itself will reveal the immensity of the challenges which we can only successfully overcome together.</p><p>For one, climate change affects competitiveness in the Single Market.</p><p>As trade in goods and services expands, it's important to ensure a level playing field. However, individual countries may implement environmental measures that distort competition. That can happen if, for example, production standards are lowered in a bid to achieve cost advantages. Amid international competition, such practices can lead to environmental dumping - with detrimental consequences not only for the Single Market but also for the environment. So countries have to work together to stop this dangerous dynamic.</p><p>Even the direct effects of climate change alone may have an enormous impact on the economy. Rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns may depress earnings in different economic sectors such as agriculture, energy, tourism or construction.</p><p>And that may also affect the financial system. If companies have serious difficulty in repaying their loans or disbursing dividends, banks and their creditors and investors will in turn suffer damages too.</p><p>Moreover, environmental and climate protection measures may have extensive economic consequences. The bans on diesel cars and the fall-out from the emissions scandal, for example, not only triggered a decline in car manufacturers' share prices, but also in the prices for used diesel cars. And handling the trend towards electromobility is testing the German automobile industry's future viability to the limit.</p><p>All of this shows the extent to which climate change and environmental measures can affect economic activity, assets and jobs.</p><p>Europe offers a unique opportunity to combat climate change and so reduce the potential damage to the economy.</p><p>Europe can provide well-coordinated instruments and clear, reliable regulation, such as the Europe-wide carbon floor price. The European emissions trading scheme with fixed caps on emissions is the first and largest of its kind worldwide.</p><p>As one of the three largest economic blocs in the world, Europe can be at the vanguard of the fight against climate change.</p><p>Europe has long campaigned internationally for strong and binding targets. For one, the EU built up a broad alliance of industrial and developing countries with ambitious targets, which significantly contributed to the success of the Paris Conference. Moreover, the EU was the first large economic region to present its planned contribution to the agreement as early as in March 2015.</p><p>And Europe can ensure that the financial market helps attain climate targets.</p><p>It has now become clear that market participants are failing to take the social costs of their activities for the environment fully into account, leading to a lack of sustainable finance. This arises, for example, when market participants base their investment decisions on excessively short time horizons and fail to factor in environmental risks. Because they would otherwise, from a risk perspective, steadily shift the focus of their investment to green and sustainable assets and so contribute to the attainment of the climate targets. Europe can give impetus and set up the right framework.</p><p>Central banks such as the European Central Bank can also help to fight climate change.</p><p>First, the ECB can contribute to the development of tools and methods that can be used to identify, quantify and mitigate climate-related risks in the financial system.</p><p>Second, the ECB can use its investment portfolio to help fight climate change. For example, sustainability criteria are already taken into account in our portfolios that are not held for monetary policy purposes. We have also bought green bonds under our asset purchase programme. But we have to make sure that we are not creating market distortions, of course - we have to remain market-neutral. This means that the ECB can only buy a limited amount of the green bonds available on the market.</p><p>Third, the ECB - together with other leading central banks - can examine the potential effects of climate change on the conduct of monetary policy. We are still in the early stages of our research into whether and how climate change affects the transmission channels of monetary policy and could lead to bigger and more persistent shocks that could have consequences for price stability, among other things.</p><p>Fourth, forward-looking banking supervision can urge banks to ensure that they have an overview of the climate-related risks on their balance sheets, and that they do so on a continual basis and with reference to stress scenarios. This is the approach that European banking supervision is taking.</p><p>c. Payments</p><p>I have talked about the major challenges facing Europe. But there are also areas which are less prominent and not quite so fundamental, but which are still important in our interconnected world.</p><p>Payments are one such example. Safe, reliable and efficient payment systems are a vital part of a well-functioning and integrated economy.</p><p>Technological progress and changing payment habits have fundamentally altered the payment system and thrown up new challenges. End users now expect to be able to transfer money around the world in real time and at low cost.</p><p>But existing payment systems are fragmented along national lines. The German Girocard scheme and the French Carte Bancaire, for example, are both used by large numbers of end users in their domestic markets, but they exist in parallel and separately from one another.</p><p>Many payment service providers retreat behind national boundaries on account of national interests and preferences.</p><p>And customers can see this. If they want to make cross-border payments in Europe with ease, they frequently rely on global players such as VISA, Mastercard and PayPal. And the big tech companiesalso offer payment solutions with pan-European reach. This is easier for them, since their global customer base allows them to achieve the desired network effects.</p><p>At the moment there are only a handful of large payment service providers offering pan-European payment services. New payment methods are being developed, such as Facebook's planned digital currency, Libra, and its underlying payment system.</p><p>According to current plans, users across the globe should be able to make payments not in euro or US dollars, but in Libra. We will need to carefully monitor how this will affect competition, because a lack of competition can impair the efficiency and quality of services in the long term, to the detriment of consumers.</p><p>Irrespective of how the payments landscape evolves over the coming years, it is essential that users of the various payment systems can be confident that all payment solutions, old and new alike, are safe and efficient.</p><p>To ensure that we have a safe, efficient and modern European payment system in the long term, though, we will need to work together at the European level. National solutions on their own don't have the necessary weight to achieve sufficient scale and network effects.</p><p>What a future-oriented European payment system needs most of all are efficient, future-oriented, pan-European market initiatives. The Eurosystem would welcome such initiatives and would likely support them, within the limits of its mandate.</p><p>A European payment system which has cross-border reach, supports modern payment methods and is accessible to all could set global standards. And it would also foster integration in Europe.</p><p>It would allow people across Europe to make transactions cheaply and safely, and this would enhance the benefits of the Single Market, making it more efficient, more innovative and better able to support growth and prosperity in all EU countries. An integrated market would thus increase the benefits of Europe for all countries.</p><p>3. A plea for more European integration</p><p>Creating optimum conditions for the Single Market and the euro is also in Germany's interest. And optimum conditions include not just the type of robust payment system I have just been talking about, but also the lasting stabilisation and deepening of Economic and Monetary Union.</p><p>This topic has many different aspects, but I would like to focus today on one key question: how can we advance the banking union project?</p><p>Euro area firms still obtain most of their funding through banks. A robust banking sector is thus vital for a healthy European economy and a stable single currency. We need a banking sector that is able to offer services to customers across Europe. And we need a market in which banks can compete on a level playing field.</p><p>And the banking union - a single framework for the supervision and resolution of banks in the euro area - has already come a long way. All euro area banks are now supervised according to the same high standards. And the single mechanism for resolution ensures that cross-border bank resolutions can be carried out without damaging either the economy or financial stability.</p><p>But the banking union is still lacking an important component: a European deposit insurance scheme. For there to be an integrated banking sector and a true banking union, depositors in all countries must have the same level of confidence in their banks. People must be able to have confidence that their money is equally safe wherever it is deposited.</p><p>In the long run this can only be done through a European deposit insurance scheme.</p><p>A shared scheme would make Economic and Monetary Union more robust. It would allow financial resources to be pooled between countries and to be used to tackle severe shocks and systemic financial crises that go beyond the capacity of individual countries.</p><p>But it is difficult to reach agreement on this degree of joint liability. If we are to move forward on this, I believe that the journey would need to include three steps.</p><p>First, all members of a shared deposit insurance scheme would need to continue to do everything they can to further reduce risks in their banks. Stable banks are, after all, the best form of protection for deposits.</p><p>Second, the shared insurance should be introduced gradually, and in such a way that individual countries would provide a minimum level of funding to cover national deposits.</p><p>Third, it is critical that banks' contributions to the deposit insurance scheme are risk-based - in other words, that the contribution of each bank is based on the institution's default risk and the amounts involved.</p><p>These three features of a shared deposit insurance scheme would strengthen the individual responsibility of Member States, banks and shareholders and further incentivise risk-based behaviour. And this would ultimately be to the benefit of the EU and all its member countries.</p><p>4. Finding a common way in Europe</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>I can't say it often enough: Europe is our shared opportunity.</p><p>Europe is our opportunity to act together where we face global challenges. After all, no country - Germany included - can by itself meaningfully shape the trading system, the battle against climate change or technological progress. More Europe is therefore the way forward in such an interconnected world.</p><p>But don't get me wrong - this is not an appeal for Europe to regulate all aspects of our lives. The EU brings together the shared features of the 28 Member States, but also their many differences.</p><p>Successful cooperation requires us to work on the basis of shared values, objectives and cooperation principles, of course.</p><p>We need to observe the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality that have always governed the EU's powers. These principles help us to ensure that cultural diversity and national identities are recognised and respected.</p><p>In other words, that we are united in diversity.</p><p>This is an approach that has proved its worth and we should continue to build on it in the future, ensuring that political decisions are made as close to the public as possible.</p><p>And despite all the benefits and the motto united in diversity, there is growing scepticism about Europe.</p><p>One of the frequent complaints is that the EU always operates on the basis of rigid legal principles, making it seem often technocratic and somehow remote.</p><p>This criticism applies to all European institutions and we shouldn't just brush it aside. I firmly believe that the time has come for us to redefine the way in which we work and, in particular, the way in which we communicate.</p><p>And this applies to the European Central Bank too. The ECB needs to address all citizens, not just an expert audience - without ever becoming political, of course - but only in order to bring facts and explanations to economic issues.</p><p>Do good and talk about it - in simple and accessible language - should be the motto here. The people of Europe need to be given much more information about what the EU and its institutions are doing on their behalf - and that information should be coming not just from the EU institutions themselves but most of all from national governments and institutions.</p><p>Only then will we be able to tackle people's fear and disorientation. Only then will we be able to counter the growing polarisation among the people of Europe.</p><p>So we should not be communicating through complex facts, coefficients and rules. This only reinforces the impression that the EU is an arrogant elite that already knows all the answers.</p><p>We will also need to work fundamentally on our understanding of politics and our culture of debate.</p><p>Communication between the public and institutions needs to involve a great deal of commitment and to flow in both directions. The people need to be included so that we can regain their trust and convince them that the EU works for them and takes their concerns seriously.</p><p>A concept that has worked well in a number of countries is that of deliberative democracy. It essentially involves allowing the public to play a greater role in political decision-making processes.</p><p>Ireland provides an instructive example of how this can work.</p><p>In Ireland 99 randomly selected members of the public are brought together to discuss and deliberate on various issues, such as global warming, the challenges arising from demographic change or the law on abortion. The topic of abortion, for example, was for many years a very controversial topic in Ireland, and one that polarised society.</p><p>And so, before a referendum on abortion was held, a citizens' assembly was brought together to discuss the issue. The results of the conversations were published in a report and debated in Parliament. And while public reaction had initially been divided on the matter, the result of the referendum ultimately largely reflected the outcome of the citizens' assembly, which supported the right to abortion.</p><p>Many participants reported that the citizens' assembly had brought logic and structure to the discussion and allowed important facts to emerge. It had also shifted what had initially been a very emotional debate to a more rational plane and helped people to understand complex issues. In the end, the referendum did not lead to a massive divide in society, as had initially been thought. It was instead a process that gave rise to a clear result and social consensus.</p><p>A similar kind of model for exchanging views and participating in political discussions on European matters could also serve Europe well.</p><p>Citizens' assemblies could be a helpful way of bringing together citizens in a given country to talk about European issues. The example of Ireland shows that citizens' assemblies are particularly effective when they discuss a concrete topic.</p><p>But it could also be helpful to have European citizens' assemblies, which would allow citizens of different countries to exchange ideas.</p><p>It is particularly important that, within Europe, we develop additional methods and tools which establish shared values that transcend national borders and cultural differences and give rise to a sense of shared objectives.</p><p>Assemblies like these could also strengthen the dialogue between the people and the EU institutions. EU politicians and civil servants would be better able to understand the concerns of citizens, and thus better able to represent them. And the EU would be brought closer to the people and enjoy greater trust.</p><p>All of this requires hard work, commitment and perseverance, since diversity can slow down the decision-making process. Yes, discussions at the European level take longer than those at the corresponding national level. After all, the many different interests and approaches that often have their roots in national traditions need to be thoroughly discussed and compromises found.</p><p>And even if it does take longer, we all stand to gain from closer cooperation within Europe.</p><p>We need two things here. First, the determination to hold constructive discussions to establish shared values and objectives. And second, the ability to push through our values and objectives in a globalised world.</p><p>I believe that Europe can offer both of these things.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Europe's achievements are significant. Never before in the history of our continent have we lived together in such peace for so long, and never before have we enjoyed such freedom. Europe has brought us considerable prosperity, and this has benefited all countries, including Germany. None of this should be taken for granted.</p><p>And yet, Europe faces criticism.</p><p>The major challenges we face, such as globalisation, structural change and migration, are unsettling people and causing many to feel a sense of fear and disorientation. It is then often easier to think in national terms and to ignore the problems to a certain degree. And populists are exploiting this situation to spread a new kind of nationalism - a withdrawal from Europe. I believe that this national way of thinking is dangerous.</p><p>And that's because the global challenges affect all countries. At a time when all European countries are seeing their influence wane in the world, we need to hold together if we want to uphold our values and interests in the world.</p><p>As Konrad Adenauer once said, No European nation is able to protect itself militarily or develop economically on its own.

But with current levels of access, \"that's very tricky right now\", she said.</p><p>\"That's what annoys researchers: the data is available, but only to private companies,\" she said.</p><p>Setting up the observatory was \"a much needed signal to send that we have to insist on this. And the only [insistence on this is coming from] Europe,\" she said.</p><p>Whether the technology firms will cooperate to open up their data is unclear. But the commission has said it could introduce regulation to combat what it sees as the threat of disinformation.</p><p>The EU would need \"special arrangements with the relevant platforms\" to access data - perhaps limited to public information like open Facebook pages - or to bring in regulations that \"require the platforms to provide data access for clearly defined public-interest research purposes\", said Axel Bruns, a professor of media and communication at the Queensland University of Technology and president of the Association of Internet Researchers.</p><p>\"The observatory tender itself, as well as other regulatory measures against platforms like Facebook and Google in recent months, show that the EU isn't afraid to pick a fight with these platforms,\" he said.</p><p>Brussels has grown increasingly concerned about online disinformation, and in October 2018, platforms including Facebook and Google - which owns the video-sharing platform YouTube - signed up to an EU code of practice, in which they promise to share \"privacy protected datasets\" as well as undertake joint research and partner with \"academics and civil society organisations if relevant and possible\".</p><p>However, in January this year, the\u00a0EU said\u00a0\"additional action\" was needed by the platforms to \"allow appropriate access to platforms' data for research purposes\".</p><p>One stumbling block, however, is user privacy.\u00a0Social scientists raised concerns last year that Facebook was further stifling research after it tightened up data access in the wake of the\u00a0Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political consultancy\u00a0was found to have harvested the data of millions of unwitting Facebook users\u00a0through collaboration with a University of Cambridge academic.</p><p>A much-heralded\u00a0partnership announced\u00a0last year between Facebook and academic researchers to understand the impact of social media on democracy, Social Science One, has recently run into problems, with the company reportedly unable to disclose all of the information it promised\u00a0owing to privacy concerns.</p><p>A Facebook spokeswoman said the project had \"already begun to allow researchers to answer important questions\".</p><p>\"We have built a first of its kind data-sharing infrastructure to provide researchers access to Facebook data. We remain committed to advancing this; we are also committed to ensuring that we provide data in a secure manner that protects people's privacy,\" she said. Google did not reply to a request for comment in time for\u00a0Times Higher Education's deadline.</p><p>Professor Vatrapu said he thought privacy concerns were a \"convenient\" excuse, however. \"They claim they really can't trust researchers,\" he said, but it meant that \"there's nothing researchers can do\" to get the data they need to understand what was happening online.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:david.matthews@timeshighereducation.com\">david.matthews@timeshighereducation.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIHEDS-THKZ1F62</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIHEDS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XD-MKY1-JCF5-B0P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">235861</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"839\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TSL Education Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times Higher Education Supplement</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33701\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>No. THE 2430</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>Saturday 17th October, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the European data strategy presented today show that Europe can set global standards on technological development while putting people first. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Europe as the global leader of the digital transformation </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital technologies considerably improve our lives, from better access to knowledge and content to how we do business, communicate or buy goods and services. The EU must ensure that the digital transformation works for the benefit of all people, not just a few. Citizens should have the opportunity to flourish, choose freely, engage in society and at the same time feel safe online. Businesses should benefit from a framework that allows them to start up, scale up, pool data, innovate and compete with large companies on fair terms. Society should benefit from social and environmental sustainability, and a secure digital environment that respects privacy, dignity, integrity and other rights in full transparency.</p><p>What does the strategy say?</p><p>Over the next five years, the Commission will focus on three key objectives to promote technological solutions that will help Europe pursue its own way towards a digital transformation that works for the benefit of people and respects our fundamental values:</p><p>Technology that works for people;</p><p>A fair and competitive economy; and</p><p>An open, democratic and sustainable society. The EU's digital strategy indicates the path that Europe needs to take to pursue its own way: a digital Europe that reflects the best of Europe. And it defines an ambitious approach towards digital technological development, as well as how technology will be used to meet our climate-neutrality objectives.</p><p>The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and the European data strategy are the first pillars of the new digital strategy of the Commission. They are fully aligned with the need to put people first in developing technology, as well as with the need to defend and promote European values and rights in how we design, make and deploy technology in the real economy and how we improve the services of the public sector towards the citizens.</p><p>How will the EU fund the proposals on AI and data?</p><p>The required investments will be channelled from the Digital Europe programme (DEP), the Connecting Europe Facility 2 and Horizon Europe. For Horizon Europe, the Commission proposed to invest 15 billion in the 'Digital, Industry and Space' cluster, with AI as a key activity to be supported. As part of DEP, the European Commission proposed to invest almost 2.5 billion in deploying data platforms and AI applications. Out of these, 2 billion euros could be invested into a European High Impact project on European data spaces, including trustworthy and energy efficient data sharing and cloud infrastructures.The DEP will also support national authorities in making high value data sets available for re-use in different common data spaces.</p><p>How can technology support the European Green Deal? </p><p>Digital technologies are a critical enabler for the Green Deal, the EU's new growth strategy to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. For example, they can increase energy efficiency by tracking when and where electricity is most needed. Smart heating could help us save the equivalent of 6 million tonnes of oil, and farmers will be able to use fewer pesticides and fertilisers thanks to data and AI. However, for digitalisation to deliver its benefits, the ICT sector needs to undergo its own green transformation. Data centres and telecommunications need to become more energy efficient, use more renewable sources and should become climate neutral by 2030.</p><p>How does Europe work for an open global digital economy and society?</p><p>The Commission can leverage regulatory power, stronger economic and technological capabilities, diplomatic strengths and external financial instruments to advance the European approach and shape the global frameworks. This is the case for work done under association agreements and trade agreements. Europe must now lead the standardisation process of the new generation of technology, i.e. on blockchain, high-performance and quantum computing, AI and tools for data sharing and usage. The European Union is and will remain the most open region for trade and investment in the world, but this is not unconditional. Everyone can access the European market as long as they accept and respect our rules. The Commission will continue to address unjustified restrictions for European companies in third countries, such as data localisation requirements, and pursue ambitious goals in terms of markets access, research and development and standardisation programmes.</p><p>Europe as a leader in human-centric Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Why does the Commission present a White Paper on Artificial Intelligence?</p><p>The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence sets out the Commission's proposals to promote the development of AI in Europe whilst ensuring respect of fundamental rights. AI is developing fast, which is why Europe needs to maintain and increase its level of investment. At the same time, AI entails a number of potential risks that need to be addressed. The White Paper sets out options to maximise the benefits and address the challenges of AI, and invites comments on these options by stakeholders.</p><p>What is the Commission's approach on Artificial Intelligence?</p><p>In the White Paper, the Commission is taking a balanced approach, based on excellence and trust.</p><p>To achieve an ecosystem of excellence, the Commission proposes to streamline research, foster collaboration between Member States and increase investment into AI development and deployment. These actions build on the Coordinated Plan on AI with Member States of December 2018.</p><p>To achieve an ecosystem of trust, the Commission presents options on creating a legal framework that addresses the risks for fundamental rights and safety. This builds on the work of the High-Level Expert Group on artificial intelligence, in particular the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, which were tested by companies in late 2019. A legal framework should be principles-based and focus on high-risk AI systems in order to avoid unnecessary burden for companies to innovate.</p><p>How will the EU ensure compliance with fundamental rights?</p><p>A human-centric approach means ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in a way that respects EU law and fundamental rights. For example, biases in algorithms or training data used for recruitment AI systems could lead to unjust and discriminatory outcomes, which would be illegal under EU non-discrimination laws. It is important to prevent breaches of fundamental rights and if they occur, to ensure that those breaches can be addressed by national authorities. High-risk AI systems need to be certified, tested and controlled, as cars, cosmetics, and toys are. For other AI systems, the Commission proposes voluntary labelling in case defined standards are respected. All AI systems and algorithms are welcome in the European market as long as they comply with EU rules.</p><p>What is facial recognition? </p><p>Facial recognition can take different forms. It can be used for user authentication i.e. to unlock a smartphone or for verification/ authentication at border crossings to check a person's identity against his/her travel documents (one-to-one matching). Facial recognition could also be used for remote biometric identification, where an image of a person is checked against a database (one-to-many matching). This is the most intrusive form of facial recognition and in principle prohibited in the EU.</p><p>Will the EU regulate facial recognition for remote identification?</p><p>The gathering and use of biometric data for remote identification purposes carries specific risks for fundamental rights. EU data protection rules already prohibit in principle the processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, except under specific conditions. Specifically, remote biometric identification can only take place for reasons of substantial public interest. It must be based on EU or national law, the use has to be duly justified, proportionate and subject to adequate safeguards. Hence, allowing facial recognition is currently the exception. With the AI White Paper, the Commission wants to launch a broad debate on which circumstances might justify exceptions in the future, if any.</p><p>What about victims or damage caused by AI?</p><p>There is no need to completely re-write liability rules at EU or national level. The Commission is inviting opinions on how best to ensure that safety remains at a high standard and that potential victims do not face more difficulties to get compensation compared to victims of traditional products and services.</p><p>A secure and dynamic single market for data</p><p>Why does the EU need a data strategy? </p><p>Data is the basis of different waves of innovation. The way that we organise data access and reuse will determine our future innovation capacity. While currently a small number of big tech firms hold a large part of the world's data, huge opportunities lie ahead for Europe. Rapidly increasing amounts of data will be generated in the next years and storage shifts from the cloud to the edge. The EU can build on a strong legal framework in data protection, fundamental rights, safety and cyber-security; its internal market; and a large degree of interconnection in public services.</p><p>Citizens, businesses and organisations should be empowered to make better decisions based on insights gleaned from non-personal data. That data should be available to all, whether public or private, start-up or giant.</p><p>TheEuropean data strategy presented today aims to enhance the use of data, which will bring enormous benefits to citizens and businesses. It will enable the development of new products and services and will lead to productivity gains and resource efficiency for businesses and better services provided by the public sector. It can for example help develop personalised medicine for patients, improve mobility for commuters or contribute to Europe becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050.</p><p>What is the aim of the data strategy?</p><p>The aim of the strategy is to create a genuine single market for data, where personal and non-personal data, including confidential and sensitive data, are secure and where businesses and the public sector have easy access to huge amounts of high quality data to create and innovate. It will be a space where all data-driven products and services fully respect EU rules and values. This will ensure Europe's technological sovereignty in a globalised world and unlock the enormous potential of new technologies like AI.</p><p>How does the data strategy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation?</p><p>Every day, people generate ever-increasing amounts of data through their daily activities. Its collection and reuse need to respect the rights and interests of the people first, in line with European values and rules. With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU has laid down a solid basis for a human-centric data economy by ensuring that individuals remain in full control of their data. This has made the EU a source of inspiration for the protection of privacy in many countries worldwide.</p><p>At the same time, individuals could benefit from technical tools and standards that make the exercise of their rights, in particular their right to data portability, simple and easy. This would also enable novel data flows, protect consumers and foster competition.</p><p>The data strategy presented today will empower people to have a stronger say on who can access the data they generate, including personal IoT data, and how it is used through personal data spaces. This could, for example, be supported by having stricter requirements on interfaces for real-time data access or by guaranteeing the neutrality of personal data spaces.</p><p>How can even more data be made available for reuse?</p><p>The legislative framework proposed in the data strategy would reinforce essential data governance structures and mechanisms in Member States and at the EU level to make more data available for reuse, with full respect of the data protection legislation.</p><p>This would help to prioritise standards and a more harmonised datasets to foster data interoperability within and across sectors; facilitate the access to and reuse of sensitive data such as health or social data for scientific research purposes (including for AI), in compliance with data protection legislation; help people make their data available for the common good for researchers to innovate for the benefit of society.</p><p>How will data be used in a way that benefits EU citizens?</p><p>Data can give insights that help combat emergencies, such as floods and wildfires, make our cities greener and cleaner, help people live longer and healthier lives. The existing Open Data Directive already makes vast amounts of data available for reuse for the benefit of society. Business-to-government data sharing can be a game-changer for providing general welfare in the EU.</p><p>The strategy on data intends to make more privately and publicly held data available by opening up public sector datasets of high commercial and societal value, such as environmental data and earth observation data; facilitating the use of publicly held sensitive data for scientific research and for the common good; exploring the creation of EU-wide legislation on the use of private sector data by the public sector for the common good.</p><p>How will the European data strategy help businesses?</p><p>Access to data is crucial to ensure competition and to create new business opportunities for smaller and larger firms. Companies need common standards and clear rules on how data transfers should take place. This also requires investments in new technologies and infrastructures so that data is the basis of future innovative products, services and improved efficiency.</p><p>Businesses should also be free to decide to whom and under what conditions access can be granted to their non-personal data. The Commission already started to address this problem with non-binding guidelines on businesses-to-business data sharing, which aimed to create fair and open markets for IoT-generated data.</p><p>Finally, the Commission envisages to propose a 'Data Act' to look at different types of data sharing scenarios and ways to empower individuals so that they become more involved in the data economy.</p><p>How can data contribute to the common good?</p><p>Data can give insights that help combat emergencies, such as floods and wildfires, make our cities greener and cleaner, and help people live longer and healthier in a secure environment. The existing Open Data Directive already make vast amounts of data available for reuse for the benefit of society. There are, however, some valuable but highly sensitive datasets gathered by some public institutions, falling outside the scope of that Directive, which could be reused for the common good under some strict conditions. For example, the reuse of publicly held health records or social data could help develop personalised medicine or advance research to find cures for specific diseases. Companies also collect huge amounts of data useful to society. If the public sector could access and reuse certain private sector data, it would be able to improve public services and policies.</p><p>What are the next steps?</p><p>The Commission will present later this year further measures, such as a Digital Services Act to establish clear rules for all businesses to access the Single Market, to strengthen the responsibility of online platforms and to protect fundamental rights. It will also propose a review of the eIDAS regulation, allowing for a secure electronic identity that puts people in control of the data they share online. Furthermore, the EU will put a strong emphasis on cybersecurity by promoting cooperation through a Joint Cyber Unit that protects critical European infrastructure and strengthens the cybersecurity single market. Finally, Europe will continue to build alliances with global partners, leveraging its regulatory power, capacity building, diplomacy and finance to promote the European digitalisation model internationally.</p><p>The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence is open for public consultation until 19 May 2020. The Commission is also gathering feedback on the data strategy. Based on the input received, the Commission is planning to take further action to support the development of trustworthy AI and a data-agile economy.</p><p>(European Union News)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2357516038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7S-XF11-JBHT-D248-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>European Union</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Algorithms</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Information sharing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Research &amp;

The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the European data strategy presented today show that Europe can set global standards on technological development while putting people first.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Europe as the global leader of the digital transformation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital technologies considerably improve our lives, from better access to knowledge and content to how we do business, communicate or buy goods and services. The EU must ensure that the digital transformation works for the benefit of all people, not just a few. Citizens should have the opportunity to flourish, choose freely, engage in society and at the same time feel safe online. Businesses should benefit from a framework that allows them to start up, scale up, pool data, innovate and compete with large companies on fair terms. Society should benefit from social and environmental sustainability, and a secure digital environment that respects privacy, dignity, integrity and other rights in full transparency.</p><p>What does the strategy say?</p><p>Over the next five years, the Commission will focus on three key objectives to promote technological solutions that will help Europe pursue its own way towards a digital transformation that works for the benefit of people and respects our fundamental values:</p><p>Technology that works for people; A fair and competitive economy; and An open, democratic and sustainable society. The EU's digital strategy indicates the path that Europe needs to take to pursue its own way: a digital Europe that reflects the best of Europe. And it defines an ambitious approach towards digital technological development, as well as how technology will be used to meet our climate-neutrality objectives.</p><p>The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and the European data strategy are the first pillars of the new digital strategy of the Commission. They are fully aligned with the need to put people first in developing technology, as well as with the need to defend and promote European values and rights in how we design, make and deploy technology in the real economy and how we improve the services of the public sector towards the citizens.</p><p>How will the EU fund the proposals on AI and data?</p><p>The required investments will be channelled from the Digital Europe programme (DEP), the Connecting Europe Facility 2 and Horizon Europe. For Horizon Europe, the Commission proposed to invest 15 billion in the 'Digital, Industry and Space' cluster, with AI as a key activity to be supported. As part of DEP, the European Commission proposed to invest almost 2.5 billion in deploying data platforms and AI applications. Out of these, 2 billion euros could be invested into a European High Impact project on European data spaces, including trustworthy and energy efficient data sharing and cloud infrastructures.The DEP will also support national authorities in making high value data sets available for re-use in different common data spaces.</p><p>How can technology support the European Green Deal?</p><p>Digital technologies are a critical enabler for the Green Deal, the EU's new growth strategy to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. For example, they can increase energy efficiency by tracking when and where electricity is most needed. Smart heating could help us save the equivalent of 6 million tonnes of oil, and farmers will be able to use fewer pesticides and fertilisers thanks to data and AI. However, for digitalisation to deliver its benefits, the ICT sector needs to undergo its own green transformation. Data centres and telecommunications need to become more energy efficient, use more renewable sources and should become climate neutral by 2030.</p><p>How does Europe work for an open global digital economy and society?</p><p>The Commission can leverage regulatory power, stronger economic and technological capabilities, diplomatic strengths and external financial instruments to advance the European approach and shape the global frameworks. This is the case for work done under association agreements and trade agreements. Europe must now lead the standardisation process of the new generation of technology, i.e. on blockchain, high-performance and quantum computing, AI and tools for data sharing and usage. The European Union is and will remain the most open region for trade and investment in the world, but this is not unconditional. Everyone can access the European market as long as they accept and respect our rules. The Commission will continue to address unjustified restrictions for European companies in third countries, such as data localisation requirements, and pursue ambitious goals in terms of markets access, research and development and standardisation programmes.</p><p>Europe as a leader in human-centric Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Why does the Commission present a White Paper on Artificial Intelligence?</p><p>The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence sets out the Commission's proposals to promote the development of AI in Europe whilst ensuring respect of fundamental rights. AI is developing fast, which is why Europe needs to maintain and increase its level of investment. At the same time, AI entails a number of potential risks that need to be addressed. The White Paper sets out options to maximise the benefits and address the challenges of AI, and invites comments on these options by stakeholders.</p><p>What is the Commission's approach on Artificial Intelligence?</p><p>In the White Paper, the Commission is taking a balanced approach, based on excellence and trust.</p><p>To achieve an ecosystem of excellence, the Commission proposes to streamline research, foster collaboration between Member States and increase investment into AI development and deployment. These actions build on the Coordinated Plan on AI with Member States of December 2018.</p><p>To achieve an ecosystem of trust, the Commission presents options on creating a legal framework that addresses the risks for fundamental rights and safety. This builds on the work of the High-Level Expert Group on artificial intelligence, in particular the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, which were tested by companies in late 2019. A legal framework should be principles-based and focus on high-risk AI systems in order to avoid unnecessary burden for companies to innovate.</p><p>How will the EU ensure compliance with fundamental rights?</p><p>A human-centric approach means ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in a way that respects EU law and fundamental rights. For example, biases in algorithms or training data used for recruitment AI systems could lead to unjust and discriminatory outcomes, which would be illegal under EU non-discrimination laws. It is important to prevent breaches of fundamental rights and if they occur, to ensure that those breaches can be addressed by national authorities. High-risk AI systems need to be certified, tested and controlled, as cars, cosmetics, and toys are. For other AI systems, the Commission proposes voluntary labelling in case defined standards are respected. All AI systems and algorithms are welcome in the European market as long as they comply with EU rules.</p><p>What is facial recognition?</p><p>Facial recognition can take different forms. It can be used for user authentication i.e. to unlock a smartphone or for verification/ authentication at border crossings to check a person's identity against his/her travel documents (one-to-one matching). Facial recognition could also be used for remote biometric identification, where an image of a person is checked against a database (one-to-many matching). This is the most intrusive form of facial recognition and in principle prohibited in the EU.</p><p>Will the EU regulate facial recognition for remote identification?</p><p>The gathering and use of biometric data for remote identification purposes carries specific risks for fundamental rights. EU data protection rules already prohibit in principle the processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, except under specific conditions. Specifically, remote biometric identification can only take place for reasons of substantial public interest. It must be based on EU or national law, the use has to be duly justified, proportionate and subject to adequate safeguards. Hence, allowing facial recognition is currently the exception. With the AI White Paper, the Commission wants to launch a broad debate on which circumstances might justify exceptions in the future, if any.</p><p>What about victims or damage caused by AI?</p><p>There is no need to completely re-write liability rules at EU or national level. The Commission is inviting opinions on how best to ensure that safety remains at a high standard and that potential victims do not face more difficulties to get compensation compared to victims of traditional products and services.</p><p>A secure and dynamic single market for data</p><p>Why does the EU need a data strategy?</p><p>Data is the basis of different waves of innovation. The way that we organise data access and reuse will determine our future innovation capacity. While currently a small number of big tech firms hold a large part of the world's data, huge opportunities lie ahead for Europe. Rapidly increasing amounts of data will be generated in the next years and storage shifts from the cloud to the edge. The EU can build on a strong legal framework in data protection, fundamental rights, safety and cyber-security; its internal market; and a large degree of interconnection in public services.</p><p>Citizens, businesses and organisations should be empowered to make better decisions based on insights gleaned from non-personal data. That data should be available to all, whether public or private, start-up or giant.</p><p>TheEuropean data strategy presented today aims to enhance the use of data, which will bring enormous benefits to citizens and businesses. It will enable the development of new products and services and will lead to productivity gains and resource efficiency for businesses and better services provided by the public sector. It can for example help develop personalised medicine for patients, improve mobility for commuters or contribute to Europe becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050.</p><p>What is the aim of the data strategy?</p><p>The aim of the strategy is to create a genuine single market for data, where personal and non-personal data, including confidential and sensitive data, are secure and where businesses and the public sector have easy access to huge amounts of high quality data to create and innovate. It will be a space where all data-driven products and services fully respect EU rules and values. This will ensure Europe's technological sovereignty in a globalised world and unlock the enormous potential of new technologies like AI.</p><p>How does the data strategy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation?</p><p>Every day, people generate ever-increasing amounts of data through their daily activities. Its collection and reuse need to respect the rights and interests of the people first, in line with European values and rules. With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU has laid down a solid basis for a human-centric data economy by ensuring that individuals remain in full control of their data. This has made the EU a source of inspiration for the protection of privacy in many countries worldwide.</p><p>At the same time, individuals could benefit from technical tools and standards that make the exercise of their rights, in particular their right to data portability, simple and easy. This would also enable novel data flows, protect consumers and foster competition.</p><p>The data strategy presented today will empower people to have a stronger say on who can access the data they generate, including personal IoT data, and how it is used through personal data spaces. This could, for example, be supported by having stricter requirements on interfaces for real-time data access or by guaranteeing the neutrality of personal data spaces.</p><p>How can even more data be made available for reuse?</p><p>The legislative framework proposed in the data strategy would reinforce essential data governance structures and mechanisms in Member States and at the EU level to make more data available for reuse, with full respect of the data protection legislation.</p><p>This would help to prioritise standards and a more harmonised datasets to foster data interoperability within and across sectors; facilitate the access to and reuse of sensitive data such as health or social data for scientific research purposes (including for AI), in compliance with data protection legislation; help people make their data available for the common good for researchers to innovate for the benefit of society.</p><p>How will data be used in a way that benefits EU citizens?</p><p>Data can give insights that help combat emergencies, such as floods and wildfires, make our cities greener and cleaner, help people live longer and healthier lives. The existing Open Data Directive already makes vast amounts of data available for reuse for the benefit of society. Business-to-government data sharing can be a game-changer for providing general welfare in the EU.</p><p>The strategy on data intends to make more privately and publicly held data available by opening up public sector datasets of high commercial and societal value, such as environmental data and earth observation data; facilitating the use of publicly held sensitive data for scientific research and for the common good; exploring the creation of EU-wide legislation on the use of private sector data by the public sector for the common good.</p><p>How will the European data strategy help businesses?</p><p>Access to data is crucial to ensure competition and to create new business opportunities for smaller and larger firms. Companies need common standards and clear rules on how data transfers should take place. This also requires investments in new technologies and infrastructures so that data is the basis of future innovative products, services and improved efficiency.</p><p>Businesses should also be free to decide to whom and under what conditions access can be granted to their non-personal data. The Commission already started to address this problem with non-binding guidelines on businesses-to-business data sharing, which aimed to create fair and open markets for IoT-generated data.</p><p>Finally, the Commission envisages to propose a 'Data Act' to look at different types of data sharing scenarios and ways to empower individuals so that they become more involved in the data economy.</p><p>How can data contribute to the common good?</p><p>Data can give insights that help combat emergencies, such as floods and wildfires, make our cities greener and cleaner, and help people live longer and healthier in a secure environment. The existing Open Data Directive already make vast amounts of data available for reuse for the benefit of society. There are, however, some valuable but highly sensitive datasets gathered by some public institutions, falling outside the scope of that Directive, which could be reused for the common good under some strict conditions. For example, the reuse of publicly held health records or social data could help develop personalised medicine or advance research to find cures for specific diseases. Companies also collect huge amounts of data useful to society. If the public sector could access and reuse certain private sector data, it would be able to improve public services and policies.</p><p>What are the next steps?</p><p>The Commission will present later this year further measures, such as a Digital Services Act to establish clear rules for all businesses to access the Single Market, to strengthen the responsibility of online platforms and to protect fundamental rights. It will also propose a review of the eIDAS regulation, allowing for a secure electronic identity that puts people in control of the data they share online. Furthermore, the EU will put a strong emphasis on cybersecurity by promoting cooperation through a Joint Cyber Unit that protects critical European infrastructure and strengthens the cybersecurity single market. Finally, Europe will continue to build alliances with global partners, leveraging its regulatory power, capacity building, diplomacy and finance to promote the European digitalisation model internationally.</p><p>The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence is open for public consultation until 19 May 2020. The Commission is also gathering feedback on the data strategy. Based on the input received, the Commission is planning to take further action to support the development of trustworthy AI and a data-agile economy.</p><p>(European Union News)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7S-KX51-DXMS-805G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

But about 4,000 years ago, one of our ancestors invented the wheel. It was one of the most important inventions in the entire history of humanity. Ever since, our lives have been shaped by innovations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some of these innovations have made our life better - just think of vaccines or the telephone. Others have had more ambivalent impact - think of nuclear power. In any case, it is always hard to guess where an innovation will take us. And it is all too easy to get it wrong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the President of IBM said in 1943: I think there is a world market for maybe five computers. He got it wrong, it seems. And so did Robert Metcalfe in 1995. As the founder of a tech company, he predicted that the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.</p><p>The internet did not collapse. Instead, it has changed our lives. Could you live without the internet? Could you live without a mobile phone? Our entire life has become digital, and this includes the way we do banking. Fintech, as it is known, seems to be the next big thing.</p><p>It's true that, in continental Europe, fintechs still account for just a small share of the markets for banking, payment services and asset management. Still, over the past years, they have received a lot of attention and a lot of funds. Fintechs are on the rise. They have entered the markets, and they are competing with banks - at least in some parts of the value chain.</p><p>The question is: where will this innovation take us? Is it the end of banking as we know it? Will it create new risks? As I said before, it is hard to guess how innovations will evolve and easy to get it wrong. That said, let us take a very brief look at some potential futures.</p><p>Scenario one: banks might embrace the digital trend and team up with fintechs. For banks this would be one of the more benign outcomes. And it seems to be happening right now.</p><p>Scenario two: fintechs might break up the value chain of banking. Banks would end up losing revenue, market share and direct contact with clients. The result might be a more fragmented market where some players operate outside the scope of regulation and supervision.</p><p>Scenario three: banks might still end up being crowded out. At the same time, however, the fintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.

But about 4,000 years ago, one of our ancestors invented the wheel. It was one of the most important inventions in the entire history of humanity. Ever since, our lives have been shaped by innovations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some of these innovations have made our life better - just think of vaccines or the telephone. Others have had more ambivalent impact - think of nuclear power. In any case, it is always hard to guess where an innovation will take us. And it is all too easy to get it wrong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the President of IBM said in 1943: I think there is a world market for maybe five computers. He got it wrong, it seems. And so did Robert Metcalfe in 1995. As the founder of a tech company, he predicted that the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.</p><p>The internet did not collapse. Instead, it has changed our lives. Could you live without the internet? Could you live without a mobile phone? Our entire life has become digital, and this includes the way we do banking. Fintech, as it is known, seems to be the next big thing.</p><p>It's true that, in continental Europe, fintechs still account for just a small share of the markets for banking, payment services and asset management. Still, over the past years, they have received a lot of attention and a lot of funds. Fintechs are on the rise. They have entered the markets, and they are competing with banks - at least in some parts of the value chain.</p><p>The question is: where will this innovation take us? Is it the end of banking as we know it? Will it create new risks? As I said before, it is hard to guess how innovations will evolve and easy to get it wrong. That said, let us take a very brief look at some potential futures.</p><p>Scenario one: banks might embrace the digital trend and team up with fintechs. For banks this would be one of the more benign outcomes. And it seems to be happening right now.</p><p>Scenario two: fintechs might break up the value chain of banking. Banks would end up losing revenue, market share and direct contact with clients. The result might be a more fragmented market where some players operate outside the scope of regulation and supervision.</p><p>Scenario three: banks might still end up being crowded out. At the same time, however, the fintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. The market would become more concentrated, less competitive and less diversified.</p><p>Whichever direction we are headed, there is one thing we supervisors worry about: increasing or unidentified risk. And there are indeed some risks that have become more apparent now that fintechs have entered the scene.</p><p>A basic truth is that new players make the market more competitive. And that could squeeze profits and force banks to cut costs in areas such as risk management. This is a general concern we have.</p><p>At the same time, bank funding might become less stable. New products, tools and services enable depositors to easily and quickly switch banks; they can select a better offer in a heartbeat. For banks, deposits might become a less reliable and more costly source of funding.</p><p>With regard to lending, we are also seeing new trends such as peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Here, savers and borrowers interact directly - banks no longer serve as middlemen. As these new businesses grow, risks associated with traditional banking might emerge - just think of the risks from maturity and liquidity transformation. Some peer-to-peer lenders are already securitising the loans they originate from their platforms. Regulators will need to deal with the resulting vulnerabilities. The work on shadow banking done by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision might serve as a basis.</p><p>Some fintechs also apply new models for scoring the quality of loans. These models are based on vast amounts of data and are supposed to be more precise than traditional approaches. But they have hardly ever been tested in a severe recession or a crisis. So we don't know how well they would work in such situations.</p><p>In respect of asset management, new products such as robo-advice are now appearing. These are computer programmes that advise customers on how to invest their money. Depending on their design, they might lead many investors to take the same positions at the same time. Such herding could then enforce current trends, creating bubbles or bursting them.</p><p>And then there are threats of a more technical kind: cyber risks. Cyber risks affect everyone - banks, fintechs and their customers. Arguably, fintechs are more exposed to cyberattacks and data theft. Their IT platforms are small and interconnected, and they often use public cloud solutions and outsource data storage. That said, fintechs are digital natives and are very aware of the risks.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to predict where the fintech journey will take us. It is obvious, however, that the train has left the station and is speeding up. Customers want to extend their digital life to banking; they want banking services anytime and anywhere. Those who can satisfy their needs will become dominant players.</p><p>There is a chance that fintechs will deeply transform the banking business. It is up to regulators and supervisors to ensure that this does not come at the cost of stability. The issue is, of course, that fintechs often operate outside the regulated banking sector. With that in mind, policymakers should follow the general principle of same business, same risks, same rules. That is important.</p><p>As banking supervisors, we focus on risks related to banks. In that regard, we are working on a number of projects.</p><p>Take bank licences, for example. We see a rising number of applications related to fintechs. In response to this, we have teamed up with the national supervisors to work on a joint policy approach. It will ensure that applications are treated in the same manner across the entire euro area. Risks that are specific to fintechs will be assessed appropriately and proportionately.</p><p>We are also seeing more and more supervisors exploring and setting up mechanisms to facilitate the authorisation process for fintech banks. Innovation hubs and sandboxes are two of the key words here. And we too are seeking to implement a euro area-wide hub for fintechs.</p><p>We are also assessing the risks that might arise when banks or fintechs outsource data or even entire IT systems. We already carried out some work in this regard; in 2015, we did a cybercrime survey, which was a unique project at the global level.

We also take a look at HHS' new guidance on direct liability of business associates, a pair of circuit court decisions involving privacy issues and legislation passed in three states involving protection of personal information.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE GDPR AT THE ONE YEAR MARK: A WORK IN PROGRESS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On May 25, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect, causing uncertainty regarding the volume and nature of enforcement, with many organizations fearing a shift toward more frequent and aggressive fines. However, following its first anniversary, the reality of GDPR is significantly more nuanced.</p><p>The first year of GDPR implementation has met mixed reviews. While there have been some clear developments among data protection regimes, the heavily anticipated level of sweeping enforcement activity has yet to materialize. While enforcement has, by many accounts, lagged expectations, entities, whether they be \"data controllers\" or \"data processors,\" are taking steps to adapt to the GDPR's new requirements. Additionally, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and national supervisory authorities are putting effort into releasing regular guidance and creating tools to assist companies with compliance in their day-to-day practices.</p><p>The GDPR also has played an important role in increasing individual awareness of data protection. The European Commission's March 2019 Eurobarometer survey of approximately 27,000 European citizens showed that around 67 percent of those surveyed know what the GDPR is. The Eurobarometer survey also reported that 73 percent have heard of at least one of the six rights guaranteed by the GDPR, while 57 percent indicated they know there is a public authority in their country responsible for protecting their data rights (compared to 2015's survey, in which only 37 percent were aware).</p><p>Internationally, the GDPR may start to appear as less of an outlier in data enforcement. Brazil has enacted the Brazilian Data Protection Law (which takes effect August 2020), and other countries, including India and China, are considering similar legislation. In the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (which takes effect January 2020) imposes requirements that are similar to those included in the GDPR.</p><p>Data Breach Notifications and Enforcement Actions</p><p>The GDPR mandates data breach notifications when personal data an entity is responsible for is accidentally or unlawfully disclosed. Since May 25, 2018, there have been 89,271 data breaches logged by European Economic Area (EEA) supervisory authorities. Of those, 63 percent have been closed and 37 percent are ongoing. The Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom have reported the highest numbers of breaches, with the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) noting that it has logged more than 14,000 data breaches (a marked increase over the roughly 3,300 notifications it received in the preceding year). There have been 144,376 queries and complaints  primarily concerning promotional emails, telemarketing and video surveillance, or CCTV  from individuals in the EU since the GDPR's implementation, with 41,000 of those coming from the U.K. and 6,000 from Ireland.</p><p>Additionally, GDPR enforcement is still evolving. As of May 22, 2019, there were over 280,000 cases pending investigation across 27 EEA countries. The Data Protection Commission (DPC) in Ireland, a country with a large tech hub, is currently investigating 18 \"large data breaches, systemic privacy issues and other serious violations at technology firms,\" but actions have not yet been taken.</p><p>As of February 2019, only 91 fines had been imposed under the GDPR. Total fines have reached 56 million, but the majority of that figure stems from the single 50 million fine levied against Google by the French supervisory authority, Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s (CNIL) (Google is currently challenging this action). Prior to its implementation, privacy advocates had expected more accountability and higher levels of enforcement under the GDPR's comprehensive reforms. That said, the U.K. ICO and the Irish DPC publicly have hinted that enforcement actions under the GDPR will be coming in the next few months, but that cases take time to build.</p><p>The enforcement actions taken by EEA Supervisory Authorities thus far span a variety of industries and entities, signaling that GDPR fines and enforcement notices will not be reserved for big tech firms or major breaches, as evidenced below by some of the first enforcement actions at a national level:</p><p> On May 28, 2019, the Belgian Data Protection Authority fined a Belgian mayor 2,000 for the use of personal data that initially was collected for local administration purposes in an electoral campaign.On July 17, 2018, the first GDPR fine in Portugal was levied against Centro Hospitalar Barreiro Montijo. The Portuguese data protection authority fined the hospital 400,000 for allowing indiscriminate access to personal data, alongside other violations of basic principles of processing, the absence of adequate technical and organizational measures, and inability to ensure continued confidentiality.On April 4, 2019, the Italian Data Protection Authority issued a 50,000 fine against the Rosseau internet platform for a number of privacy security issues related to data controlled by Italian political party Movimento 5 Stelle.As of May 22, 2019, German regional data protection authorities had imposed a total of 449,000 in fines, including in November 2018, in which a 20,000 fine was levied against a chat and dating service for a breach in which hackers stole 300,000 customers' personal data. The service notified the relevant authority about the breach and an investigation uncovered a lack of appropriate technical safeguards for the protection of data by storing its users' passwords in unencrypted plain text.On April 4, 2019, the U.K. ICO issued a preliminary enforcement notice against Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for the biometric data processed in their Voice ID system. The ICO found that HMRC had given customers insufficient information about the data processing and did not give them a chance to consent. The U.K. ICO's first enforcement notice under the GDPR was levied in October 24, 2018, against AggregateIQ Data Services Ltd, a Canadian company targeting EEA data subjects, for processing personal data without the data subjects' knowledge, as well as for undeclared purposes and without a lawful basis. In both cases, the ICO demanded data deletion as a precursor to imposing a fine.</p><p>Looking Ahead and Key Takeaways</p><p>While 25 EU member states have adopted national legislation for implementing the GDPR, Greece, Slovenia and Portugal have yet to put their domestic laws in place. Organizations also have called for more clarity on specific elements of the law, including details around data breach notifications and subject rights requests.</p><p>As simple cases give way to more complex cases, there are more regulatory questions that will require resolution. For example, there are concerns that individuals, such as former employees, may use data subject rights as punitive measures against companies or to obtain pre-litigation disclosure. In addition, as increasing volumes of personal data are processed in cross-border investigations, the eDiscovery process  and other statutorily or treaty-enabled production requirements, such as those contemplated under the U.S. Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or CLOUD Act  will require the EDPB and supervisory authorities to be clear about the GDPR's scope, as well as require investigators and companies to be more attentive to the GDPR's requirements.</p><p>At the one year mark, there is no doubt that the GDPR has set standards through which legislators and citizens around the world are becoming more aware of their governments' abilities to protect individual rights.</p><p>NEVADA ENACTS RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF SALE OF INFORMATION</p><p>A new Nevada law requires website operators to offer consumers the ability to request that their personal information not be sold to data brokers.</p><p>On May 29, 2019, Nevada enacted Senate Bill 220 (the Nevada Amendment),<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>The full text of the bill can be read here.</p></bodyText></footnote> which amends the Nevada Internet Privacy Act to require \"operators\" to establish a designated email address, toll-free telephone number or website through which consumers can make a verified request that their covered information not be sold. A verified request means the operator has verified the authenticity of the opt-out request and the identity of the consumer \"using commercially reasonable means.\"</p><p>An \"operator\" is broadly defined as a person who:</p><p> owns or operates a website or online service for commercial purposes; collects and maintains certain items of personally identifiable information from consumers who reside in Nevada and use or visit the website or online service; andengages in any activity that constitutes a sufficient nexus with Nevada to satisfy constitutional requirements. Such activity includes doing business in Nevada, purposefully directing activities toward Nevada or transacting with the state or a Nevada resident.</p><p>Certain entities are exempt from the definition of \"operator,\" including, among others, financial institutions and entities subject to certain federal privacy laws. These entities include any entity regulated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), any service provider to an operator, and certain manufacturers of a motor vehicle or persons who service motor vehicles who process covered information.</p><p>A \"sale\" for purpose of the Nevada Amendment is \"the exchange of covered information for monetary consideration by the operator to a person for the person to license or sell the covered information to additional persons,\" unless the information is disclosed for purposes consistent with a consumer's reasonable expectations.</p><p>\"Covered information\" refers to any one or more of the following data points about a consumer collected by an operator through a website or online service: first and last name, street name and name of city or town, email address, telephone number, Social Security number, an identifier permitting a specific person to be contacted, and/or any other information about a consumer collected from that consumer through the website or online service of the operator and maintained in combination with an identifier that makes the information personally identifiable.</p><p>Operators must respond to consumers' requests within 60 days. A 30-day extension is available if \"reasonably necessary\" and notice has been provided to the consumer. An operator that has received a verified request submitted by a consumer must not make any sale of any covered information the operator has collected or will collect about that consumer.</p><p>The attorney general may bring a legal action against an operator who violates the Nevada Amendment and can seek an injunction or civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation.</p><p>California Consumer Privacy Act</p><p>Although some have been quick to compare the Nevada Amendment to a comparable provision in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), there are some critical differences between the two states' approaches.</p><p>First, the Nevada Amendment defines \"sale\" more narrowly than the CCPA, effectively limiting it to the sale (for monetary consideration) to data brokers. The CCPA includes any type of consideration and the \"sale\" to any other person, not just data brokers. Consumers also are defined more narrowly in the Nevada Amendment than under the CCPA in that employee and business data is not included, although the definition is broad enough to include what most businesses care about (i.e. , consumers purchasing goods or services). That said, the Nevada Amendment does not carve out smaller businesses the way the CCPA does. In addition, \"covered information\" is more narrowly defined under the Nevada Amendment, excluding some of the broad areas picked up by the CCPA, such as device identifiers or household information. Finally, in contrast to the CCPA, the Nevada Amendment does not require a business to provide clear and conspicuous notice to consumers of their opt-out right regarding the sale of their information.</p><p>Key Takeaways</p><p>Overall, the Nevada Amendment is a prime example of the growing reality that, in the absence of federal privacy legislation, companies will be forced to comply with a patchwork of inconsistent state law obligations.</p><p>MAINE RESTRICTS SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY ISPS</p><p>A new Maine law requires internet service providers (ISPs) in the state to obtain customer consent before using, disclosing or selling their personal information.</p><p>On June 30, 2019, Maine enacted An Act to Protect the Privacy of Online Customer Information (the Maine Act)<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>The full text of the bill can be read here.</p></bodyText></footnote>. The Maine Act, which goes into effect July 1, 2020, will ban, subject to certain exceptions, ISPs in Maine from \"using, disclosing, selling or permitting access to customer personal information unless the customer expressly consents to that use, disclosure, sale or access.\" Instead of providing customers the right to opt out of utilization of their data, the Maine Act restricts ISPs from using customers' data unless they have affirmative customer consent. It also requires ISPs to provide \"clear, conspicuous and nondeceptive\" notice of customer rights and ISP obligations. Additionally, the act requires that ISPs take \"reasonable measures\" to protect customer information from unauthorized use, disclosure or access when implementing security measures.</p><p>\"Customer personal information\" restricted from sale refers to:</p><p> personally identifiable information about the customer including, but not limited to, the customer's name, billing information, Social Security number, billing address and demographic data; andinformation from a customer's use of broadband internet access service including, but not limited to, the customer's search history, application usage history, precise geolocation information, financial information, health information, IP address, communications contents and information pertaining to the customer's children.</p><p>A customer may revoke consent to use, disclose, sell or permit access to customer personal information at any time. As well, a provider may not refuse to serve a customer who does not provide such consent, nor may a provider charge a customer a penalty or offer a customer a discount, based on a decision to provide or withhold such consent.</p><p>Among other exceptions, the law states that providers may use, disclose, sell or permit access to customer personal information without express, affirmative customer consent to:</p><p> provide the service from which the information is derived;advertise or market the provider's communications-related services to the customer;comply with a lawful court order;initiate, render, bill for and collect payment for broadband internet access service;protect users from fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of or subscription to ISP services; andprovide geolocation information concerning the customer in connection with certain enumerated emergency situations.</p><p>Key Takeaways</p><p>With the enactment of the Maine Act, the state's ISPs now face the strictest consumer privacy protections in the country. More importantly, passage of the legislation represents another \"one-off\" privacy law that will force companies to either adopt different policies for different states or consider each new privacy law the \"floor\" for what they need to do nationwide. Many expect the new law to be challenged as violating Federal Communications Commission rules or the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution.</p><p>OREGON EXPANDS DATA BREACH NOTICE LAW</p><p>Oregon updated its data breach notification requirements to improve transparency surrounding data breaches and expand the definition of personal information.</p><p>On May 24, 2019, Oregon enacted a new law, SB 864,<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>The full text of the amendment can be read here.</p></bodyText></footnote> which amends the Oregon Consumer Identity Theft Protection Act, effective January 1, 2020, and renames it the Oregon Consumer Protection Act (the act). The act now extends existing data breach notification obligations to a \"vendor,\" defined as a person \"with which a covered entity contracts to maintain, store, manage, process or otherwise access personal information for the purpose of, or in connection with, providing services to or on behalf of the covered entity.\" A \"covered entity\" is defined as a person that \"owns, licenses, maintains, stores, manages, collects, processes, acquires or otherwise possesses personal information in the course of the person's business, vocation, occupation or volunteer activities,\" except with respect to a person who acts solely as a vendor.</p><p>A vendor that discovers a security breach or has reason to believe a security breach occurred must (1) notify any contracted covered entities as soon as practicable, but no later than 10 days after discovering (or having reason to believe that) a breach has occurred, and (2) notify the attorney general if a breach or suspected breach involved the personal information of more than 250 consumers or a number of consumers that the vendor could not determine.</p><p>The amendment revises the original legislation's definition of \"personal information\" to include user names or other means of identifying a consumer for purposes of permitting access to the consumer's online account, together with any other method necessary to authenticate the user name or means of identification.</p><p>The act also provides that compliance with security measures under federal data security laws (including HIPAA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) gives covered entities and vendors in alleged violation of the act an affirmative defense regarding information protected under the act, but not protected under federal laws.</p><p>Key Takeaways</p><p>Oregon joins a number of states which, in recent years, have strengthened their data breach notification obligations. But, as discussed earlier, the growing number of state legislation continues to make it difficult for entities to adhere to the patchwork of cybersecurity rules and legislation that exist in each state jurisdiction, but not at the federal level.</p><p>FOURTH CIRCUIT HOLDS THAT DISH NETWORK IS LIABLE FOR VIOLATING TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT</p><p>The U.S. District Court for the Fourth Circuit affirmed a $61 million treble damages award, finding that the National Do Not Call Registry applies to agents, including sales representatives and third-party marketers, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).</p><p>On May 30, 2019, the Fourth Circuit affirmed a district court decision in favor of a certified class, concluding that satellite television company Dish Network (Dish) is liable for the actions of its agent, Satellite Systems Network (SSN), and reaffirmed judgment for approximately 11,000 plaintiffs.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote4\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>Krakauer v. Dish Network, L.L.C., No. 18-1518 (4th Cir. May 30, 2019).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Unlawful Phone Calls</p><p>The named plaintiff, Dr. Thomas Krakauer, alleged that he began to receive telemarketing phone calls in May 2009, asking him to buy services from Dish, at a number he had listed in the Do Not Call Registry. The calls were placed by SSN, acting on behalf of Dish. Krakauer called Dish to complain about the calls, and he was placed on the company's individual Do Not Call list. In 2015, Krakauer sued Dish for the improper calls under the TCPA, seeking redress for himself and all persons who objected to these calls.</p><p>TCPA Regulations</p><p>The TCPA allows a private right of action for violations of the Do Not Call Registry regulations. By its plain language, the TCPA's private right of action contemplates that a company can be held liable for calls made on its behalf, even if not placed by the company directly. The District Court Finds Liability and Willful Violations</p><p>In September 2015, the court certified a class that closely followed the text of the TCPA, allowing Krakauer to bring his claim on behalf of all persons (1) whose numbers were on the National Do Not Call Registry or the individual Do Not Call lists of either Dish or SSN for at least 30 days and (2) received two calls in a single year. The case went to trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Krakauer and the class plaintiffs, finding that the telemarketing practices violated the TCPA and that Dish was liable for the calls placed by SSN. The jury awarded damages of $400 per call. The district court determined that Dish's violations were willful and knowing, and thus trebled the damages award under the TCPA. Dish appealed, challenging the class certification and its own liability for the wrongful calls placed by SSN.</p><p>The Fourth Circuit Affirms</p><p>The Fourth Circuit affirmed the class certification, ruling that the class was harmed under the TCPA by receiving unwarranted phone calls from SSN, acting as a third-party marketer for Dish. The court rejected all three issues that Dish raised on appeal. First, the court rejected Dish's argument that the members lacked standing because their injury did not rise to \"a level that would support a common law cause of action\" based on Spokeo, Inc. v.

Ct. 1540 (2016).</p></bodyText></footnote>, which explains \"the traditional core of standing\" is a personal stake in the case. The court found that receiving unwanted calls on multiple occasions is an intrusion of personal privacy, and therefore, the members had standing.</p><p>Second, the court held the class was properly certified as a matter of civil procedure. Under Rule 23 and the remedial purpose of the TCPA, the cause of action allows for \"resolution of issues without extensive individual complications.\" Dish's contention that the class definition was overbroad was rejected, as the court found the TCPA's cause of action for violations of the Do Not Call Registry can be brought by any \"consumer,\" not only \"subscribers.\"</p><p>Finally, the court affirmed the jury's conclusion that SSN was acting as Dish's agent at the time it made the improper calls. The evidence supporting an agency relationship was considerable, including suggestive contract provisions, authorization to use Dish's name and logo to carry out business operations, and the Voluntary Compliance Agreement that Dish entered into with 46 state attorneys general, wherein Dish clearly stated its authority over SSN with regard to TCPA compliance. Although Dish contended that its contract with SSN expressly disavowed an agency relationship, the court found that parties cannot avoid legal obligations of agency by contracting out of them. Dish also asserted it should not be responsible for SSN's actions because it occasionally instructed SSN to follow the law, and, therefore, no reasonable jury could conclude the calls were made within the scope of SSN's authority as Dish's agent. The court found that the jury appropriately resolved this question, concluding that the evidence showed Dish failed to address these concerns in any meaningful way and was profiting from the SSN sales tactics. Accordingly, the court concluded that \"this case demonstrates the need to look beyond the contract, as a failure to do so might lead to absolving a company, like Dish, that acquiesced in and benefitted from a wrongful course of conduct that was carried out on its behalf.\"</p><p>Key Takeaways</p><p>As the court's decision in Krakauer illustrates, TCPA plaintiffs are not required to show any threshold level of injury to have standing if they are able to prove the statutory elements of a TCPA claim, which could possibly lead to an increase in such claims. The Fourth Circuit's decision also may lead to claims involving instances where third parties were used to conduct telemarketing activities.</p><p>SIXTH CIRCUIT HOLDS PAYMENT PROCESSING COMPANY LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RELATED TO ATTACK ON MERCHANT&amp;RSQUO;S CREDIT CARD SYSTEM</p><p>On June 7, 2019, the Sixth Circuit affirmed<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote6\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>Spec's Family Partners, Ltd. v. First Data Merchant Services LLC No. 17-5884/5950, 2019 WL 2407306 (6th Cir. June 7, 2019).</p></bodyText></footnote> a district court ruling in favor of Spec's Family Partners, a chain of liquor stores in Texas, finding that First Data Merchant Services, the payment processing company used by Spec's, must bear the costs stemming from two attacks on the payment card network used by the stores.</p><p>Attacks on Payment Card System and Cost-Shifting Chain Reaction</p><p>Spec's Family Partners fell victim to two attacks on its payment card network in which malware was installed to access customer data. An investigation revealed that Spec's failed to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) prior to the attacks, which left it vulnerable to breaches in its customers' data security.</p><p>The attacks, and subsequent data theft, triggered a cost-shifting reaction down the credit card chain. The banks that issued the compromised credit cards first reimbursed the defrauded cardholders and replaced their customers' credit cards. Card brands Visa and Mastercard then issued assessments on the acquiring bank, Citicorp Payment Services Inc., to cover its costs. Third, Citicorp demanded payment from First Data to cover the costs imposed on Citicorp by the credit card companies. Finally, First Data sought reimbursement for those costs from Spec's.</p><p>In order to recoup its costs, First Data withheld the proceeds of routine payment card transactions from Spec's, placing the proceeds in a reserve account. Spec's refused to pay First Data and filed suit in an attempt to recover the $6.2 million that First Data withheld.</p><p>District Court Grants Summary Judgment</p><p>The District Court for the Western District of Tennessee granted summary judgment in favor of Spec's, holding that First Data materially breached the Merchant Agreement when it diverted funds to reimburse itself for the card brand assessments. Specifically, the court found that such assessments constituted consequential damages that could not be recovered under a limitation of liability clause in the First Data contract. The District Court refused to interpret the assessments as \"third-party fees and charges,\" for which Spec's would be liable under the contract.</p><p>Sixth Circuit Affirms</p><p>The Sixth Circuit reviewed de novo the grant of summary judgment and affirmed the District Court ruling in its entirety. First Data argued on appeal that Spec's was liable for the assessments under the contract's indemnification clause and because they constituted \"third-party fees and charges\" under the agreement.</p><p>The Sixth Circuit rejected First Data's indemnity argument, finding that the assessments passed down to First Data constituted consequential damages because, according to Tennessee law, consequential damages are the natural consequences of the act complained of, but not the necessary results of such conduct. In other words, the assessments constituted consequential damages because the data breaches, reimbursements to cardholders and levying of assessments were the natural results of PCI DSS non-compliance. However, the results were not a necessary consequence of non-compliance in the sense that a non-compliant merchant might never suffer a data breach and the card brands might not issue assessments in the case of PCI DSS non-compliance on its own. The court concluded that because the data breaches and the imposition of assessments did not necessarily follow from the actions of Spec's, the losses sustained were consequential and Spec's could not be held liable for such damages under the contract.</p><p>First Data also argued that Spec's was liable under a provision in the contract stating that Spec's was responsible for all \"third-party fees and charges\" associated with the use of First Data's services. By looking to the ordinary and plain meaning of the term, as well as its meaning within the context of the entire agreement, the Sixth Circuit held that the term \"third-party fees and charges\" did not include or contemplate assessments imposed by credit card companies. The court also noted that the only other federal appeals court to address this exact issue reached the same conclusion that the term excludes assessments following a data breach.<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote7\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p>Schnuck Markets, Inc. v. First Data Merchant Services, 852 F.3d 732 (8th Cir. 2017)</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Finally, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling that First Data materially breached the agreement by withholding payments due to Spec's. The Sixth Circuit found that the PCI DSS non-compliance was an immaterial breach that was cured when Spec's took steps to achieve full compliance. The court concluded that First Data materially breached the agreement by withholding payments due to Spec's and thereby deprived Spec's of the principal expected benefit under the contract.</p><p>NEW GUIDANCE CLARIFIES DIRECT LIABILITY OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATES UNDER HIPAA</p><p>In late May 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights released guidance regarding business associate liability under HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH).</p><p>In 2013, HHS issued a rule, under the HITECH Act, that made business associates directly liable for certain HIPAA-related violations. However, since its enactment, the scope and reach of the rule has been unclear. On May 24, 2019, the Office of Civil Rights issued a fact sheet to clarify the rule, listing 10 provisions of HIPAA for which business associates can be held directly liable.</p><p>The HHS guidance will clarify matters regarding business associates, which include consultants, billing companies and medical record providers, among others. Though HIPAA applies directly to health care providers, plans and clearinghouses, certain vendors qualify as business associates if they handle protected health information (PHI) on behalf of, or in providing services to, a HIPAA-covered entity.</p><p>The 10 provisions under which business associates will be held liable are:</p><p> Failure to provide the HHS secretary with records and compliance reports; cooperate with complaint investigations and compliance reviews; and permit access by the secretary to information, including PHI, pertinent to determining compliance.Taking any retaliatory action against any individual for filing a HIPAA complaint; participating in a retaliatory investigation or other enforcement process; or opposing an act or practice that is unlawful under the HIPAA rules.Failure to comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule (which includes the risk analysis requirement).Failure to provide breach notification to a covered entity or another business associate as required by the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.Impermissible uses and disclosures of PHI.Failure to disclose a copy of electronic PHI to either the covered entity, the individual or the individual's designee (whichever is specified in the business associate agreement) to satisfy a covered entity's obligations regarding the form and format, as well as the time and manner, of access.Failure to make reasonable efforts to limit PHI to the minimum extent necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use, disclosure or request.Failure, in certain circumstances, to provide an accounting of disclosures.Failure to enter into business associate agreements with subcontractors that create or receive PHI on their behalf, and failure to comply with the implementation specifications for such agreements.Failure to take reasonable steps to address a material breach or violation of the subcontractor's business associate agreement.</p><p>Key Takeaways</p><p>The new guidance clarifies uncertainty regarding when and how business associates can be held directly liable for HIPAA violations. In addition to liability imposed by the Office for Civil Rights, a business associate should be aware of contractual commitments regarding the handling of PHI imposed by covered entities.</p><p>EUROPEAN COUNCIL APPROVES NEW EU CYBERSECURITY ACT</p><p>The newly passed EU Cybersecurity Act intends to combat the increasing risks of cyberattacks as they become more sophisticated and, more frequently, international. The Cybersecurity Act aims to prompt a coordinated and collaborative response across the EU.</p><p>Background</p><p>On June 7, 2019, the European Council formally approved Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (the Cybersecurity Act), which came into force on June 27, 2019. The Cybersecurity Act enacts two principal measures: (1) strengthens the role of the European Union Agency for Network and Information and Security (ENISA), the EU agency that improves network and information security in the EU and (2) introduces the first EU-wide cybersecurity certification framework. For now, the single certification framework will be voluntary rather than compulsory, with the goal of building a harmonized framework for uniform cybersecurity standards across the EU. The introduction of the Cybersecurity Act will not, therefore, necessarily prompt immediate action, but demonstrates the EU's cybersecurity focus and gives a framework for manufacturers and service providers of information and communications technology (ICT) products, services and processes to be mindful of.</p><p>The Ever-Expanding Role and Powers of ENISA</p><p>The Cybersecurity Act strengthens ENISA by granting a permanent mandate and strengthening its human element. ENISA has been a temporary EU agency since its establishment in 2004. While ENISA is not a regulatory authority, it enhances cybersecurity prevention work by advising the European Commission, analyzing data and raising awareness on potential cyber threats. With the Cybersecurity Act, ENISA's role expands through the supervision and facilitation of information sharing across the EU. ENISA also will now maintain a website providing information on cybersecurity, including the certification framework.</p><p>Additionally, ENISA will now assist with designing certification schemes for ICT products and services. At a foundational level, these schemes will ensure that key cybersecurity standards are adhered to by ICT manufacturers and service providers, such as by ensuring an adequate level of protection of personal data against unauthorized storage, processing, destruction, exfiltration, loss or alteration. ENISA also is tasked with reviewing certification schemes every five years to ensure their ongoing compliance with adequate cybersecurity standards.</p><p>Certification Framework</p><p>The Cybersecurity Act establishes an EU cybersecurity certification framework that aims to assure consumers of the safety of their data, allowing them to trust the cybersecurity of ICT products, services and processes. The framework also provides a uniform certification process in the EU, avoiding multiple, conflicting and overlapping certifications between countries. The ENISA certification schemes will be based on European or international cybersecurity standards, though they will be supervised and implemented by national authorities. EU member states also may establish individual national penalties for infringing the schemes.</p><p>It is expected that the first ENISA certification scheme will be published within a year of the Cybersecurity Act's effective date. The Cybersecurity Act grants the European Commission the power to decide whether to adopt the published ENISA certification schemes. The European Commission also will re-evaluate, by 2023, whether some schemes should be mandatory. As such, it will take time to conclude whether the Cybersecurity Act is successful and whether the certification regime will become an effective, trusted and useful exercise for ICT providers and manufacturers, as well as consumers.</p><p>Relationship With Other Data Protection and Cybersecurity Laws</p><p>The Cybersecurity Act dovetails closely with other European Union laws addressing data protection and cybersecurity, most notably the GDPR, which requires technical and organizational measures to safeguard the processing of personal data, and the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive), which was the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity and addresses potential cybersecurity threats against network and information systems. However, the Cybersecurity Act differs in that its purview extends beyond the NIS directive, which only applies to businesses classified as \"operators of essential services\" and \"digital service providers,\" whereas the Cybersecurity Act extends to all manufacturers and service providers of ICT offerings.</p><p>Key Takeaways</p><p>The Cybersecurity Act's true impact and efficacy remain to be seen. However, the increased focus on cybersecurity issues could facilitate the successful and widespread adoption of ENISA certification schemes. Cybersecurity has been a high priority for both businesses and the EU in recent years, and the Cybersecurity Act, if nothing else, reinforces the importance of strong cybersecurity standards.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

We welcome your feedback at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:morningbrief@foreignpolicy.com[1]\">morningbrief@foreignpolicy.com[1]</email> ; Brussels Pitches New Tech RulesMargrethe Vestager, the European Union's digital and competition chief, today will release[2] the first draft of an EU digital strategy likely to have major consequences for technology giants such as Apple, Facebook, and Google. The strategy will focus on a so-called digital single market[3] that will support growth and innovation in the European tech industry. </p><p>Vestager is currently examining big tech's data practices, including how companies use third-party data to compete. The EU is taking on a global role in tech regulation, in contrast to the United States. The new plans have prompted Silicon Valley executives to visit Brussels. On Monday, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg met[4] with Vestager and other officials at the EU headquarters. Zuckerberg has emphasized[5] the need for 'good regulation,' while Facebook itself has warned that potential rules risk harming innovation. Artificial intelligence. The new digital policy includes rules on companies' use of artificial intelligence (AI) that could set a precedent for other countries. The proposed regulation will likely focus on how governments should monitor the riskier aspects of AI, such as its use in health care or transportation. Restricting facial recognition technology is also a key concern. 'It is quite the European approach to say if things are risky, then we as a society want to regulate this,' Vestager told the New York Times. 'The main thing is for us to create societies where people feel that they can trust what is going on.' Taxing tech. Later this year, Spain will introduce a 3 percent digital services tax on the revenue of companies including Facebook and Google, Bloomberg reports[6]. It joins countries like France and Britain moving forward with similar regulations. Digital tax plans have angered the United States, which threatened retaliatory tariffs on France late last year. The OECD is working on a push for a global digital tax, and the EU could also consider a bloc-wide tax. What We're Following TodayU.N. says Syrian government is targeting civilians. Government airstrikes in northwest Syria have hit[7] hospitals and refugee camps, killing at least 300 civilians. Nearly 1 million people have been displaced in recent weeks as Syrian forces accelerate their campaign in Idlib province. The U.N. human rights chief has accused[8] the Syrian government and Russia of deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure during the campaign to take back the country's last rebel strongholds. After a second day of talks in Moscow, Turkish officials said no agreement had been reached, and Ankara plans to deploy more troops to the region as it demands that Syria pull back. New British immigration rules. Boris Johnson's government has announced[9] new U.K. immigration rules which would drastically reduce the number of unskilled workers[10] from non-English speaking countries. The government claims that its overhaul of the immigration process along the lines of Australia's points system will fulfill a key pledge of the Brexit campaign\u2014to 'take back control' of the nation's borders and put an end to cheap labor from EU citizens in factories, on farms, and in the service sector. Businessleaders branded the move 'an assault on the economy,' according to the Guardian and warned of 'disastrous' consequences, job losses, and shop and factory closures while union leaders said it could lead to chaos in the health care sector. Trudeau under pressure to end rail blockade. Indigenous protesters in Canada are blockading[11] a railway for the 13th straight day, in solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en First Nation in British Columbia, which is fighting the construction of a natural gas pipeline through their land. The standoff has raised fears fuel shortages and layoffs, increasing the pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resolve the situation. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, he called for[12] 'dialogue and mutual respect,' but his government hasn't provided details on its ongoing negotiations with the indigenous leaders. China tightens Wuhan quarantine. Chinese state media reported on Wednesday that Hubei province\u2014the epicenter of the coronavirus\u2014would adopt stricter containment measures[13], even as the provincial capital Wuhan remains under lockdown. It was announced Tuesday that the director of a hospital in the city had died[14]\u2014one of many health workers to succumb to the virus. The overall death toll in China passed 2,000[15] on Wednesday, but the number of new reported cases fell for the second day in a row. Meanwhile, the impact of the coronavirus outbreak is becoming more apparent in global markets. It strikes at a particularly bad time for Japan and Germany, FP's Keith Johnson reports[16]. For more news and analysis on stories like this, sign up[17] for China Brief, delivered on Wednesdays. Keep an Eye OnU.S. rules on Chinese media. The Trump administration announced[18] Tuesday that it will now treat five Chinese state-run media companies with U.S. operations like foreign embassies, meaning they will have to register their employees and properties with the State Department. The decision isn't linked to any new developments, but an official described the entities, including Xinhua News Agency and China Daily, as part of China's 'propaganda apparatus.' Lebanon's protest movement. Last month, a new government took power in Lebanon, but it has put protesters in an awkward position. Most agree it's just a shadow body representing the political elite, but the protest movement is still unable to articulate a long-term strategy for change\u2014likely because it never developed one, Anchal Vohra writes[19] for FP. Turkey's Gezi Park case. On Tuesday, a Turkish court acquitted[20] nine people of charges over the anti-government Gezi Park protests in 2013\u2014surprising many who have questioned the independence of Turkey's courts under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But prosecutors immediately demanded that police rearrest one of the defendants, Osman Kavala, who faced a life sentence. Odds and EndsU.S. President Donald Trump indicated[21] on Tuesday that he'd like to attend the summer Olympic Games in Tokyo later this year, despite the events coinciding with his campaign for reelection. The president is likely to have a limited travel schedule as election season gets fully underway. 'We'll make that determination,' he said. 'We're going to try if we can.' The Olympics begin on July 24.That's it for today. For more from FP, visit foreignpolicy.com[22], subscribe here[23], or sign up[24] for our other newsletters.

Executive summary</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is a set of technologies and practices used in programmatic advertising. It has evolved and grown rapidly in recent years and is underpinned by advertising technology (adtech), allowing advertisers to compete for available digital advertising space in milliseconds, placing billions of online adverts on webpages and apps in the UK every day by automated means.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whilst RTB is only part of the online advertising ecosystem, we decided we needed to investigate further due to its complexity and scale, the risks posed to the rights and freedoms of individuals and the concerns we've received.</p><p>This update report therefore clarifies the ICO's views on adtech, specifically the use of personal data in RTB, and our intended next steps. The findings have come from our:</p><p> research undertaken as part of our Technology Strategy<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2258299/ico-technology-strategy-2018-2021.pdf\">https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2258299/ico-technology-strategy-2018-2021.pdf</url></p></bodyText></footnote> ;stakeholder engagement with industry;consideration of concerns we have received<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>Specifically, the concerns raised by Michael Veale, Jim Killock and Dr Johnny Ryan made in September 2018 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://brave.com/adtech-data-breach-complaint\">https://brave.com/adtech-data-breach-complaint</url>) and by Privacy International in November 2018 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://privacyinternational.org/advocacy/2434/why-weve-filed-complaints-against-companies-most-peoplehave-never-heard-and-what\">https://privacyinternational.org/advocacy/2434/why-weve-filed-complaints-against-companies-most-peoplehave-never-heard-and-what</url>).</p></bodyText></footnote> ; andrecent Fact Finding Forum (where participants from across the adtech industry met to discuss lawful basis, transparency and security challenges) <footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>See <url normalizedValue=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/research-and-reports/adtech-fact-finding-forum/\">https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/research-and-reports/adtech-fact-finding-forum/</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/blog-adtech-fact-finding-forum-shows-consensus-on-needfor-change/\">https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/blog-adtech-fact-finding-forum-shows-consensus-on-needfor-change/</url></p></bodyText></footnote> .</p><p>While many RTB market participants place some controls on their processing and sharing of personal data, it's become apparent during our work that there are substantially different levels of engagement and understanding of how data protection law applies, and the issues that arise.</p><p>Our initial investigations raised a number of concerns with the data protection practices within RTB. For the purposes of this report we have prioritised the following areas:</p><p> Transparency and consent: The protocols used in RTB include data fields that constitute special category data, which requires the explicit consent of the data subject. Furthermore, current practices remain problematic for the processing of personal data in general, even if the special category data were removed. For example: identifying a lawful basis for the processing of personal data in RTB remains challenging, as the scenarios where legitimate interests could apply are limited, and methods of obtaining consent are often insufficient in respect of data protection law requirements;the privacy notices provided to individuals lack clarity and do not give them full visibility of what happens to their data;the scale of the creation and sharing of personal data profiles in RTB appears disproportionate, intrusive and unfair, particularly when in many cases data subjects are unaware that this processing is taking place; andit is unclear whether RTB participants have fully established what data needs to be processed in order to achieve the intended outcome of targeted advertising to individuals. The complex nature of the ecosystem means that in our view participants are engaging with it without fully understanding the privacy and ethical issues involved. Data supply chain: In many cases there is a reliance on contractual agreements to protect how bid request data is shared, secured and deleted. This does not seem appropriate given the type of personal data sharing and the number of intermediaries involved.</p><p>Our prioritisation of both RTB and the above issues in this report is not an indication that we think other areas in adtech and online advertising are 'issue-free' in terms of data protection. Additionally, we are aware of the wide range of non-data protection issues that are also associated with RTB and adtech more generally, including fraud (eg from the use of 'bots'), the market dominance of so-called 'big tech' firms, and the financial vulnerability of some publishers; these are also beyond the scope of this report. This report is issued as part of our role as the data protection regulator; however, these other issues, to the extent they impact on data protection,, have been considered as factors in determining our next steps.</p><p>Our work has highlighted the lack of maturity of some market participants, and the ongoing commercial incentives to associate personal data with bid requests. We do not think these issues will be addressed without intervention. We are therefore planning a measured and iterative approach, so that we act decisively and transparently, but also in ways in which we can observe the market's reaction and adapt our approach accordingly. This is because:</p><p> this is an extremely complex market involving multiple technologies and actors - and we will doubtless learn more going forward;there are some industry initiatives to address these challenges that may gain further impetus and adoption following our initial interventions;there are additional considerations, in particular the economic vulnerability of many smaller UK publishers, which make it advisable for us to move carefully and observe the consequences of our actions; andadtech continues to grow and develop rapidly, and is spreading beyond the online environment - ensuring appropriate and responsible data protection practices is crucial.</p><p>As part of this approach, we intend to provide market participants with an appropriate period of time to adjust their practices. After this period, we expect data controllers and market participants to have addressed our concerns.</p><p>In the short term, we will:</p><p> obtain further detailed submissions from a sample of data controllers on their management of bid request data, to enhance further our understanding of industry practices;further consult with IAB Europe and Google about the detailed schema they are utilising in their respective frameworks to identify whether specific data fields are excessive and intrusive, and possibly agree (or mandate) revised schema; andcontinue to share information with other data protection authorities across Europe and identify opportunities to work together where appropriate.</p><p>To read the full article click here</p><p>Originally published by ico.org</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Whilst JaguarLand Rover acknowledges that it is government incentives and policies and advances in electrification technologies that will drive consumer take-up of zero emission vehicles, it emphasises that 100% emissions-free mobility requires decarbonisation of the entire energy production process.</p><p>The overarching premise that electric vehicles are only as green as the electricity that they are run on and as is used in the manufacturing and end-of-life disposal process remains fundamental and a number of OEMs are seeking to address this issue (see boxes above and below).</p><p>Volkswagen Group Elli</p><p>Volkswagen has established Elli Group with the goal of the digital networking of energy and mobility, which is expressly stated to be based on the conviction that e-mobility can only be sustainable if vehicles are powered by electricity generated on a CO 2 free basis.</p><p>Elli has launched an 'eco-power tariff' product called \"Volkswagen Naturstrom\u00ae\" which has certification (from T\u00dcV Nord) that the electricity provided through the tariff comes from 100% renewable sources.</p><p>Elli's electricity supplier, VW Kraftwerk, also invests actively in the expansion of renewable electricity generation to be included in the power mix for Volkswagen Naturstrom\u00ae.</p><p>Other considerations, such as electric vehicle models being heavier than their ICE equivalent models resulting in an increased power requirement and more particulates being produced from tyres and brakes, cannot be ignored, nor the apparent growth in demand for larger, heavier, SUV electric vehicles. The extensive use of plastic within cars with all the advantages of being lightweight, easy to shape and not prone to corrosion will likely also attract increased public concern at some point, once the primary concern of eradicating single use plastics has been addressed.</p><p>Arguably the greatest current focus, however, is on the environmental impacts relating to electric-vehicle battery production and waste management.</p><p>Raw materials mining</p><p>Lithium-ion is a key ingredient in EV batteries along with nickel, manganese, cobalt and aluminium oxide. It has been estimated that the lithium-ion industry will grow from 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of annual production in 2017 to 800 GWhs in 2027 (albeit that not all of this growth is attributable to EV batteries).</p><p>The majority of lithium mining takes place in the Argentinean, Bolivian and Chilean salt flats, which hold more than half of the world's lithium supply. In order to mine lithium, holes are drilled into the salt flats to pump brine to the surface allowing lithium carbonate to be extracted using a chemical process. As well as consuming a large quantity of water, there are concerns over pollution of soil and air.</p><p>Recycling of batteries</p><p>Environmental impacts may also result from batteries being improperly disposed of after use, resulting in the materials contained in batteries being released into the environment, relevant also in the context that, currently, EV batteries may need to be replaced over the expected life of a vehicle and thus each vehicle sold may be associated with multiple spent batteries. Accordingly, the industry is looking at ways in which to minimise the environmental footprint of used batteries.</p><p>Conventional car batteries are already subject to waste regulation in the EU under the 2000 End of Life Vehicles Directive and the 2006 Batteries Directive. The former restricts the use of cadmium in batteries used in EVs; the latter restricts the use of mercury.</p><p>The Batteries Directive places certain requirements on manufacturers who design products that contain batteries. Unlike for portable batteries, there are no national collection targets for used car batteries, but they have been banned from landfill or incineration in the EU since September 2008 and therefore need to be recycled or reused. Battery producers are required to register themselves and belong to a recycling scheme, which they finance. Recycling of the waste batteries must meet certain minimum specified treatment requirements and there are minimum recycling efficiency targets (50% in the case of non nickel-cadmium or lead acid batteries) that apply.</p><p>The European Commission earlier this year consulted stakeholders on additional product standards with the objective of fostering high performing, safe, sustainable and durable (ie long-lasting) battery cells and battery packs/modules, produced with the lowest environmental footprint possible in a way that is cost-effective.</p><p>Beyond the EU, in 2018 China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced measures seeking to ensure automotive manufacturers are held responsible for the recovery of new energy vehicle batteries, requiring them to set up recycling channels and service outlets for the collection and storage of batteries and the transfer of the same to specialist recyclers.</p><p>For reuse, batteries need to be developed with sufficient adaptability for other products; producers of goods may struggle to give sufficient customer product warranties if their products are reliant on second-hand batteries and the right pricing model for second-hand batteries as against new technologicallyadvanced batteries may be difficult to achieve.</p><p>For recycling, lithium, whilst only a small component of a battery, has traditionally been uneconomic to recycle resulting in batteries having to be broken down to separate the different metal components with considerable lithium wasted in the process. Encouragingly, in early 2018, Nissan announced the opening of a plant to recycle electric-car batteries to be operated by 4R Energy Corporation (a joint venture with Sumitomo Corporation) stating the factory was Japan's first specialising in the reuse and recycling of used lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles.</p><p>Such reuse and recycle initiatives are not however without their challenges. Friends of the Earth has for example claimed that \"Low collection rates, the low and volatile market price of lithium, and the high cost of recycling relative to primary production have contributed to the absence of lithium recycling.\" Standardisation of the underlying technology will assist in enabling greater investment into recycling in coming years.</p><p>Despite these challenges, it is unquestionable that the battery reuse and recycle market will need to be front of mind if industry players are to achieve substantive progress in environmental sustainability, including through technological developments.</p><p>Audi (Volkswagen Group)</p><p>Earlier this year, Audi announced that aluminium producer Hydro now supplies sustainable aluminium for the battery housing of the first fully electric Audi e-tron* model. Hydro states that it processes and manufactures aluminium from the extraction of the bauxite raw material to the end product in an environmentally friendly manner, with the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative having awarded the collaboration a \"chain of custody\" certificate.</p><p>Social</p><p>Given the current focus on environmental sustainability, it would be easy for industry players to lose sight of also tackling social impacts in the supply chain. Stakeholders are, however, increasingly uncompromising in their expectations.</p><p>In March 2019, Amnesty International publicly challenged leaders within the electric vehicle industry to make the world's first completely ethical battery within five years and in doing so highlighted how lithium-ion batteries powering electric vehicles are linked to human rights abuses, including the use of child labour in the Democratic Republic of Congo in respect of cobalt mining. More recently, the legal action taken by families of children killed or injured while mining for cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo against big tech companies including, Apple and Google, is a prime example of supply chains facing litigation in respect of potential human rights abuses.</p><p>Statements such as that issued by Amnesty International have followed a general trend of strengthened transparency. In March 2011, UN Special Representative John Ruggie issued his Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; in 2015 the ground-breaking UK Modern Slavery Act forced issues of modern slavery and supply chain transparency to board level discussions and in November 2018 a similar, more onerous, Modern Slavery Bill 2018 was passed in Australia.</p><p>Despite this pressure, given the opacity of the current supply chain, tackling supply chain issues is far from a simple challenge for the automotive industry to overcome. Some industry players are, therefore, turning to technology as the solution whilst others are seeking to increase a supervisory presence within the supply chain itself.</p><p>Consortium blockchain project</p><p>A pilot began in December 2018 through a consortium comprising Ford, IBM, LG Chem and RCS Global aimed at using blockchain to demonstrate how materials in the cobalt supply chain can be responsibly produced, traded, and processed from mine to end manufacturer. The pilot is advertised to start at an industrial mine site in the Democratic Republic of Congo (with oversight from responsible sourcing group RCS Global). The cobalt produced is then traced through the supply chain as it travels from mine and smelter to LG Chem's cathode and battery plant in South Korea, and finally to a Ford plant in the United States. An immutable audit trail is then created using blockchain, which will include corresponding data to provide evidence of the cobalt production from mine to end manufacturer. The end user of the cobalt will then know which entities in the supply chain to approach for information on observance of proper environmental and social standards.</p><p>\"Cobalt for Development\" pilot project</p><p>In September 2018 the \"Cobalt for Development\" pilot project was officially launched to seek to promote responsible mining practices and improve conditions at an artisanal cobalt mine site in a southern province of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>The project is a collaboration between Samsung Electronics, Samsung SDI, BMW and BASF who have commissioned the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) to test within three years how living and working conditions in the artisanal cobalt mine site and the surrounding communities can be improved.</p><p>At the pilot site, the initiative aims to promote practices that comply with human rights, respect the environment and contribute to the development of the wider community as well as seeking to improve access to education, financial literacy and alternative sources of income for residents in the surrounding community.</p><p>Whether or not projects such as the consortium blockchain project or the cobalt development pilot (see boxes) will give stakeholders sufficient comfort that the industry is tackling issues such as human rights abuses in supply chains is to be seen, but what is apparent is that tackling such issues will be critical to industry players' reputations and, over time, viability.</p><p>Conversely, there is also a potential legal risk for manufacturers who seek to control their supply chain risks by intervening too closely in the affairs of their suppliers, especially if those suppliers are their own subsidiaries. There is a developing area of class action claims being brought in the English courts founded on the theory that a parent company which sets global policies around, for example, environmental compliance, may be treated as having assumed a duty of care with regard to individuals affected by those policies being wrongly applied by other group companies. Thus, claims have been brought in the English courts against an English parent company based on harm caused to people living near the subsidiary's operations even where that subsidiary was separately operated and outside the UK. Manufacturers need to take care to ensure that group operating companies adopt their own policies and procedures and are responsible for implementing them. While the ultimate goal remains to maintain appropriate standards, and avoid harm being caused in any location, the structure by which this is achieved is important if well-intentioned oversight is not to result in manufacturers facing direct legal liability for failing to avert harm somewhere in its supply chain.</p><p>Governance</p><p>Whilst, there are less unique developments in the governance aspects of ESG facing the automotive industry, establishing systems and checks and conducting due diligence to understand where risks may occur within supply chains and manufacturing processes and financial and information systems are increasing in importance.</p><p>For example, the UK Department for Transport emphasised the significance of governance in respect of cyber security risks back in August 2017 by stating that the need for organisational security to be owned, governed and promoted at board level with a 'culture of a security' fostered within organisations was a key principle to be applied throughout the automotive sector, the connected and autonomous vehicles and intelligent transport systems ecosystems and their supply chains.</p><p>Developments have also been seen:</p><p> in whistleblowing policies and processes relating to understanding how precious metals in batteries being procured are mined, the collation of emissions information on whether vehicle parts are being shipped in a suitably green way and the monitoring of autonomous vehicle glitches;through strategies to respond to the interaction between traditional engineering and software in vehicles creating a number of new areas for potential anti-competitive behaviour (including as bundled financing, credit, insurance, repair and servicing models increase); andas a result of businesses having to demonstrate good governance in response to well-publicised previous failings (see boxes above and opposite).</p><p>Nissan Carlos Ghosn scandal</p><p>Following the allegations of financial misconduct against their former chairman, Nissan established a Special Committee for Improving Governance (\"SCIG\") to ascertain the root causes behind Nissan's governance issues and to provide recommendations for Nissan to create a healthy state of governance as a foundation for sustainable business as a world-leading company.</p><p>The SCIG acknowledged in its conclusions that Nissan's corporate capabilities had suffered at a point when the automobile industry had reached a great-turning point due to a continued corporate culture valuing short-sighted performance targets over mid to long term strategies.</p><p>Volkswagen Group 'Dieselgate' emissions scandal</p><p>In Volkswagen Group's Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015, in the wake of the 'Dieselgate' emissions scandal, it was acknowledged that the Volkswagen Group's management need to be more decentralised in future, with greater independence for brands and regions resulting in a better sharing of responsibility and encouraging entrepreneurial thinking and behaviour.</p><p>Volkswagen Group believed this change in governance approach would result in decisions and processes becoming leaner, faster and more efficient (enabling management to focus on its core role: pursuing major group-wide topics for the future and working on synergies, control and strategy).</p><p>Ensuring the necessary governance systems are in place often requires establishing systems, both at a central management level and at a local level, that allow inspection and audit rights to give visibility throughout the manufacturing processes and supply chain and then the monitoring of the same. Industry players will need to try to unpack the relevant manufacturing players' supply chains to see whether they are fit for purpose, noting that what is fit for purpose now is unlikely to be fit for purpose in ten or even five years' time and therefore scrutiny has to be undertaken on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The scope for development of these systems will be driven by each player's role in the industry. OEMs will continue to set clear standards as to what they expect through the supply chain. Such standards will then need to be managed in order to retain relationships and to comply with contractual obligations. Industry players will, however, also have to be answerable to their own direct stakeholders, including their own consumers. Relying on OEM driven governance standards alone is unlikely to suffice.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>As this article highlights, the automotive industry is subject to the general movement towards increased ESG scrutiny and such scrutiny will only be heightened as society and customers become even less tolerant of environmental and human collateral.</p><p>Accordingly, all participants in the industry whether they be OEMs, component manufacturers, distributors, retailers or shared mobility service providers will need to treat ESG with increasing importance and have a strategy to protect themselves from both legal liability and reputational risk.</p><p>The greater the number of industry participants that establish their own sustainability impact strategies and governance standards will, in some respects, make it easier for businesses to comply with their own legal and moral obligations, as increased standards becomes the market trend. However, the other side of that coin is that once higher standards are demonstrated by some there will come a point where they are mandated for all, as is already being actively considered by the UK Government for climate change risk disclosure and is already the case for example in the UK for disclosure by large and listed companies' of energy usage and carbon emissions.</p><p>Failure to respond to stakeholders and to society's ESG-related demands can no longer be seen purely as underperformance on corporate social responsibility matters. ESG-related performance is already and will continue to be a key factor in attracting capital, in insurability and, ultimately, in economic viability.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com\">https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com</url>/ our-expertise/sector/connected-andautonomous-vehicles;</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com\">https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com</url>/ our-expertise/sector/electrification;</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com\">https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com</url>/ our-expertise/sector/shared-mobility</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Almost all of us now shop online, but how can we ensure that we are staying safe and avoiding fraudsters?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Low-down on the New Consumer Rights Act</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The new Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) came into force on 1 October 2015. It repealed most consumer-specific legislation including The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA), the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (SOGA), and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 (SOGSA). So why the big change? Prior to 2015 there were 100 pieces of consumer-related legislation which caused some inconsistency and ambiguity. Legislation was also struggling to keep pace with technology and retail practice.</p><p>As with previous consumer legislation, the new CRA applies to business-to-consumer transactions, not business-to-business. A 'consumer' is defined as an individual acting for purposes wholly or mainly outside that individual's trade, business, craft or profession.</p><p>Shopping Safely</p><p>As a so-called 'consumer', what can you do to ensure that you are protecting yourself from being scammed?</p><p> Ensure that the website you are using will keep your card details safe. To identify this, simply look for 'https'inthewebsiteaddress (the 's' stands for secure). Also check for a padlock icon in the browser bar.If you are buying from a website or brand that you haven't shopped with before, do some research, and check reviews and previous customer feedback to give you peace of mind.Don't click on web links sent via email. These can often look authentic but will redirect you to a fake site.There are a number of technical and legal options available to the savvy online retailer and shopper. Many big tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google now offer encrypted password apps which will remember or create any number of complex different passwords for all your online accounts. The best part of using one of these solutions is that you only need to remember one password to use them.</p><p>EU General Data Protection Regulation</p><p> The new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which comes into operation on 25 May 2018 makes certain individuals at companies responsible for data breaches and allows for large fines based on a percentage of annual turnover. Recent statistics suggest that a staggering 70% of consumers have not even heard of the GDPR. Educating yourself on the new Regulation is the most powerful weapon you could have to protect yourself from fraud.One of the main changes for consumers under the GDPR is that companies wishing to use consumer data must get more explicit consent rather than simply burying the consent in small print and putting the onus on the consumer to object to it. Look out for an influx of \"consent\" requests attached to any data collection as well as notices regarding any data breaches.</p><p>I've Been Scammed. What Should I Do Now?</p><p> Shoppers concerned that a data breach may have affected them or led to them being defrauded online can contact the Information Commissioner's Office online for help in securing their data or claiming compensation. If the matter is high value or urgent, an intellectual property solicitor should be consulted.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.</p><p><br/> Mr Oliver Smith<br/> Keystone Law<br/> 48 Chancery Lane<br/> London<br/> WC2A 1JF<br/> UK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONDAQ-10683436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MONDAQ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWF-MHD1-DYX7-J00C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">149522</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Mondaq Ltd.

Financial technology has existed for practically as long as the financial services industry itself. The telegraph and the transatlantic cable laid in 1866 to connect North America and Europe is a clear example. That technology provided the infrastructure for the first era of major financial globalisation in the late 19th century.[1] And innovations such as the automated teller machine (ATM), credit cards, electronic payments and internet banking have each changed the face of modern banking.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now we are entering the next phase of the digital age, when the combination of new telecommunications, big data analytics, cryptography and machine learning technologies has the potential to change the whole banking industry in faster and more disruptive ways than ever before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As technology gives new entrants better and cheaper ways to compete for core banking business, banks' dominant position could be challenged. And indeed, we are already seeing disruptions in the financial services market:</p><p>In the first half of 2018, global investment in fintech reached $57.9 billion across 875 deals, a significant increase from the $38.1 billion invested in the whole of 2017. The time span for adopting various banking innovations, such as online or mobile banking, is getting shorter and shorter. Many consumers are switching to e-commerce, and more e-retail payments are made from mobile phones. Consumers expect pan-European services that are safe, efficient and easy to use. With the recent launch of TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), the Eurosystem has laid the groundwork for innovative, customer-friendly retail payment solutions that benefit everyone in Europe. TIPS is a truly domestic market infrastructure for pan-European instant payments with settlement in central bank money within 10 seconds and a price fixed at 0.20 eurocent. Technological investment in cash cycles is also strong and helping to make this safe, instant and cheap means of payment resilient. Indeed, on average, cash payments take just over 22 seconds and cost around 24 cent per transaction according to a recent study of retail sector cash payments in Germany. Fintechs could make the financial system more diverse and competitive, offering customers better-targeted, faster and cheaper financial services. But fintech could also lead to the emergence of new risks and greater concentration.</p><p>So far, regulators have tolerated or even facilitated these developments. In the EU, for instance, the revision of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) aims to foster innovation and enhance competition by requiring banks to share account information.</p><p>But to the extent that fintechs are providing core banking services, regulators and central bankers need to monitor their activities in order to follow risk migration.</p><p>Fintech credit: lending in transition</p><p>Fintechs have now moved into core banking services, including the credit business.</p><p>Currently, fintech credit makes up only a very small fraction of overall credit, but it is growing rapidly and could become more dominant in certain market segments. In the United States, for example, 36% of unsecured personal lending was issued by fintechs in 2017.</p><p>Fintech is often associated with small start-ups - technologically innovative firms with agile business models. But huge, globally active technology companies, the so-called big tech companies, are also entering the market. These companies have a competitive advantage because they can leverage their existing customer networks and huge amounts of proprietary data to provide financial services. Moreover, their enormous balance sheets give them the financial capacity to handle credit risks economically on a large scale.</p><p>These comparative advantages of big tech could, in principle, generate benefits for customers. By using predictive algorithms, machine learning and a wider range of data, available from online spending or social media, for example, big tech could become more efficient at lending than traditional banks.</p><p>Moreover, if big tech can speed up loan application processing, reduce transaction costs and improve credit risk assessments, it could increase the overall degree of competition in credit markets.</p><p>And with their increasing market share, these companies could help diversify the sources of credit to the economy, thus fostering investment and growth.</p><p>However, these big tech companies are generally less motivated by the return on their credit activity and more by the access they get to data that let them sell products and services over and above their financial activities.</p><p>Therefore we can't rule out some negative side effects. Not only could large technology companies increase market concentration by exploiting their network externalities, they could also create new risks.</p><p>For example, risks could arise from big tech's funding models, which often use a mix of internal and external investors to finance loans or repackage and sell them to third-party investors. Such originate-to-distribute models can lead to information asymmetries, incentive problems and financial instability - as we painfully learned from the mortgage lending that led to the subprime crisis.</p><p>Another type of fintech is the so-called peer-to-peer lender, which offers credit services in a fundamentally different way to banks in that the services are unbundled. Electronic platforms typically match borrowers and investors without taking on balance sheet risks and generate fee revenue rather than net interest.</p><p>Technological innovation may enable lending platforms to become more efficient and more targeted in terms of how they intermediate between borrowers and lenders and thus put pressure on incumbent banks. Still, I would argue that, until lending platforms can replicate the benefits of intermediation, they will not meaningfully challenge the role of banks in the economy. I see two main reasons for this:</p><p>1. Lending platforms are unable to perform liquidity transformation on a significant scale - that is, to provide short-term liquidity services for depositors and long-term loans for borrowers.</p><p>2. Lending platforms are less resilient during shocks, being more prone to funding freezes and swings in credit risk appetite than banks, as at this stage they are small and not diversified. Also, banks have both insured deposits, which contain depositor runs, and higher levels of capital, which supports lending during downturns.</p><p>For these reasons, lending platforms are currently unlikely to threaten banks' market position in lending. Still, these developments should be continuously monitored.</p><p>Fintechs are changing the payments landscape</p><p>Fintech has had a more pronounced impact in the payments market, where firms have expanded their presence in non-capital intensive business such as cross-border transfers, micropayments and card payments because those are the areas where the incumbents have accumulated the most glaring shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced products.</p><p>This is affecting the payments landscape. In a European Banking Authority survey, a majority of incumbent banks indicated that payments is the business area most affected by fintech competition, eroding fees and commission income.</p><p>In response, many banks have begun to adjust their strategies by investing more in technology and partnering up with fintechs.</p><p>The emerging competition is welcome and may bring lasting social benefits to customers in terms of efficiency gains, increased choice and more resilient payment systems.</p><p>But our role is to ensure not only efficiency, but also safety. As a central banker with the statutory task of ensuring the smooth functioning of payment systems my view is that we also need to carefully observe how this disruptive process unfolds. We should be mindful that risks could accumulate in the unregulated sector, which could affect payment security.</p><p>Customers' interests need to be taken into account. This includes consumer protection and prudential requirements to defend customer funds. But these concerns must not be confused with pretexts to secure vested interest and inhibit innovation.</p><p>Likewise, although it is desirable to have strong domestic European payment providers, not the least to be less exposed to extraterritorial jurisdiction, we should not use protectionist measures to shield incumbents from market pressures. On the contrary, we should remain open to global players to foster competition. In fact, the industry itself should address the obstacles hampering the emergence of European players.</p><p>Scenarios for the future</p><p>As the competition between fintechs and incumbent banks unfolds, the financial system could become more diverse and competitive. But it could also become more concentrated, and new risks to financial stability could emerge.</p><p>Two extreme scenarios for the future are possible. Both come with regulatory implications.</p><p>In the first one, banks rise to the digital challenge by upgrading their technological systems and teaming up with fintechs. There are signs of this happening, as global banks' IT expenses rose to $250 billion in 2017, from $180 billion in 2013.</p><p>In this scenario, banks leverage technology to enhance their products, services and operations, allowing them to retain their customer relationships and core banking services. Risks to financial stability would be rather low, as financial services provision would remain largely subject to the existing prudential regime.</p><p>In the second scenario, banks fail to provide the digital financial services demanded by customers. New, innovative and fast-moving fintechs, or big tech firms with large customer networks, would come to dominate the market - with all the risks that I outlined.</p><p>Obviously, reality is much more complex than this binary distinction of extreme scenarios. And the range of business models of big or small banks, re-prioritization and mutualisation of certain services cannot be captured by such simplifying templates.</p><p>Indeed, some traditional banking services could move to less-regulated parts of the financial system. But pre-emptively drawing in the reins in the name of financial stability could harm innovation and prevent fintechs from growing.</p><p>We certainly must continue monitoring developments closely and adjust regulation when and where needed to ensure that financial services remain safe and sound.</p><p>But competition - to refer to the Austrian economist Friedrich August von Hayek - is a discovery procedure[10], and it is up to the markets' verdict which product or service is the optimal solution. Legislation and regulation should therefore ensure a level playing field for all market players, incumbent\\xB4s and new entrants alike.</p><p>(European Central Bank)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHJ-50Y1-JB5P-J236-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1812\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000569</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC BANKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTk5RDIyOTlFMEQzNEIxMjlBQkIyQTA4RDY2Q0QzM0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDJDQjg1RTk0N0RFNEQ3MkJGRTk2OUZDMEZBN0QzOTA</classCode><className>External Audits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000132</classCode><className>AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzNBMDhENDczMEYzNDJCN0I5MTRCQTM1OTIyNDM1NTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzBDNzQyN0JENDRFNDYwMkEyNjVFRTgxNjNFRDExNUI</classCode><className>Automatic Teller Machines</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000656</classCode><className>EURO</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

And nobody's certain that France will yet succeed either.</p><p>The first problem is that media companies might not share the same commercial interests, said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of Oxford University's Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.</p><p>\"One very real possibility is that there will be a divide-and-conquer moment where some of the major platforms essentially cut a deal with a limited number of very large publishers, or politically powerful publishers, who will then benefit - and everyone else risks not really getting any meaningful compensation,\" he said.</p><p>This is partly what happened in Germany, said Angela Mills Wade, executive director of the European Publishers Council. \"Google played a divide-and-rule game, and persuaded publishers to give them a licence for free.\"</p><p>Google removed snippets by media outlets that didn't want to agree to the terms the tech company was offering, and those outlets saw their traffic plummet.</p><p>\"The coalition [of media companies] fell apart very quickly, as companies came to the conclusion that the monetary value of search traffic was better than nothing,\" said Professor Nielsen.</p><p>In Spain, Google faced a law rather than a negotiation. Forced by Spanish statute in 2014 to pay licence fees to display news content, the company responded by shutting down Google News there.</p><p>Ms Mills Wade said this prompted a temporary dip in traffic to media websites, but many companies eventually replaced it with more organic growth that they were able to monetise themselves.</p><p>The trouble was that the pain of the Google News pullout was borne more heavily by smaller publishers, sowing divisions within the Spanish media industry.</p><p>The smaller publishers argued that bigger ones had sought to pursue their own interests at the expense of innovation and financial health of the sector as a whole.</p><p>\"A number of publishers in Spain are unhappy with how it turned out but a few are also content with what happened,\" said Professor Nielsen.</p><p>\"It's essentially a question of whether that was to be expected, or whether there could have been a better model for everyone. A model that might benefit, say, the largest publishers is not necessarily the model that will benefit small or local publishers or benefit digital-only publishers.\"</p><p>Fresh fracas in France</p><p>The Continent is now trying to tackle the problem at European Union level, through an early-2019 Copyright Directive that all 27 EU members must implement at national level.</p><p>In essence, countries waive their anti-trust laws to allow media companies to work collectively in negotiating a \"publishers' right\" to royalties or copyright payments from tech platforms that display their product.</p><p>The bargaining takes place in the private sector, between the industry - through its licensing agency or copyright agency, for example - and the tech companies.</p><p>France, which has a history of taking on American tech giants, enacted a law last October. In response, Google began removing French media companies' snippets from its search results, leaving only headlines and URLs - a means of avoiding licence payments, but one which threatened to reduce traffic flows to the news stories.</p><p>This month, France's competition regulator ordered Google to negotiate in good faith, and set a three-month deadline. It also told Google to display the snippets during that period.</p><p>Google points to the work it already does with French publishers, based on an earlier agreement, which involves offering training, technology, innovation and support to publishers to help them adapt to the disrupted market.</p><p>The company is now also looking at ways to help big-name news groups in France increase their subscriber base, as Google \"engages with publishers to increase our support and investment in news\", according to company vice-president Richard Gringras.</p><p>Professor Nielsen said the outcome of the tech-media wrangle was far from certain. \"It's not clear so far that the French approach has changed the balance of power so much that the publishing industry is content with the state of affairs,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's also not clear what the definition of success is here, either from the publishers or from the platforms, or for that matter from the French government - other than they have been pretty clear that they expect American companies to hand over cash to French publishers.\"</p><p>He said the \"easy part\" was to say there should be a fair share, but the hard part was working out what the value was and doing the sums.</p><p>\"If expectations are that platforms will be forced to hand over hundreds of millions of euros amongst hundreds of different publishers, so that everyone gets something that makes a material difference to them, then I think these negotiations will be quite tough.\"</p><p>He worried that the smaller and bigger companies could find their interests diverging again. But Ms Mills Wade said she expected a different dynamic might emerge this time. \"Attitudes have changed, mainly based on knowledge of how these companies operate,\" she said.</p><p>The French and Australian efforts will be closely watched elsewhere, although Professor Nielsen said most Western governments weren't engaging yet and most publishers seem to have acquiesced to the status quo.</p><p>But the two Petri dishes are very different, he said. \"France has a very long tradition of state intervention in the media sector. It's interesting to see this being a focus in Australia that doesn't traditionally have this interventionist, nationalist approach to media policy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520268103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YR9-VKP1-DY19-C39G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They voted 438-226 on Sept. 12 to approve a new Copyright Directive, overcoming fierce opposition from web giants, including Google and Facebook.</p><p>The new law contains two controversial measures that regulators hope will help creators, like journalists and musicians, claim back a bigger slice of the revenue websites generate from using their content.</p><p>However, representatives for large tech companies have argued the current wording of the regulation is heavy-handed and will impinge on free speech on the internet, even amounting to a \"ban on memes.\"</p><p>Internet personalities including web pioneer Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales have complained that, if implemented, the measures will significantly restrict online creativity.</p><p>However, most artists, including former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney and French DJ David Guetta, have come out in favor of European efforts to increasingly regulate online space.</p><p>Controversy has particularly centered around Article 13 of the regulation, which will make websites take \"appropriate measures\" to prevent user-generated content that infringes copyright. Arguments also focused on Article 11, which grants news outlets a claim to copyright over the sharing of their content online and is aimed at aggregating sites such as Google News and Facebook.</p><p>The result of the vote was immediately welcomed by the industry group News Media Europe, which said the measures will \"help secure a more sustainable and digital future for Europe's news media industry.\"</p><p>\"We need a publishers' right to protect the hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe's news media sector and, in particular, to protect the future of professional journalism and its role in facilitating the democratic debate.\" News Media Europe Executive Director Wout van Wijk said.</p><p>Meanwhile, EDiMA, the trade association representing online platforms, condemned the vote and vowed to keep lobbying individual European governments to oppose the proposals.</p><p>EDiMA Director General Siada El Ramly said, \"Today, MEPs have decided to support the filtering of the internet to the benefit of big businesses in the music and publishing industries, despite huge public outcry. We hope that governments of the EU will hear their citizens' concerns in the next stage of negotiations.\"</p><p>The landmark vote heralded the end of a bitter campaign that has deeply divided MEPs not only along national lines but also within their respective parties.</p><p>Representative Sajjad Karim, who is legal affairs spokesman for the British Conservative in the EU Parliament, said it showed that \"copyright law is at last catching up with the digital age.\"</p><p>However Daniel Dalton, a lawmaker from the same party, was dismayed by the result.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2112152468</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCW-3D61-JC85-J15X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 273</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 13, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the new ruling means Facebook would have to make such material inaccessible globally.</p><p>Facebook charged that the decision \u201cundermines the longstanding principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country.\u201d</p><p> While lawmakers in the U.S. are considering tighter regulation of Facebook and other tech giants, politicians in Europe have gone much further on a variety of fronts, including passing stricter data privacy laws in 2018.</p><p> \u201cThis shows a sharpening divide between the way the EU is handling privacy and data content versus the U.S.,\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Ives said. \u201cIt poses broader risks for the likes of Google and other big tech companies as the \u2018Brussels versus tech\u2019 battle continues to take hold.\u201d</p><p> Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, former chairwoman of Austria\u2019s Green Party, had sued Facebook in her home country to remove a news story that she considered libelous and insulting and could be viewed globally.

It is Tuesday, October the 6th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOARES (voice-over):  Tonight, Edward Snowden celebrates as Europe  cracks down on American tech firms. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">France's prime minister says the attacks on Air France bosses could  leave the country's reputation in tatters.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And if it's a real fraud, is this just fantasy?  Two sports gaming  sites caught in a gambling controversy.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Isa Soares and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES:  A very good evening to you.  </p><p>Tonight, Edward Snowden hails a landmark decision that may change the  way tech companies do business on both sides of the Atlantic.  The European  Court of Justice has thrown out an agreement that allows businesses to  transfer data on European users to the U.S.</p><p>Now Snowden, his revelations about U.S. government surveillance set  off the legal fight, praised the court.  This is his tweet.  This is what  he had to say.  </p><p>\"This is the second time in as many years the world has rallied upon  the Court of Justice of European Union to defend digital rights,\" he said.   \"Thank you, Europe.\"  Those were his words.  </p><p>Well, the so-called safe harbor law was set up back in 2000.  What it  did, it allowed American firms to store European data in the U.S., removing  the need for extra data centers right here in Europe.  </p><p>In its ruling, the European court said it was worried that data could  be subject to, quote, \"mass indiscriminate surveillance as well as  interception.\"  Now companies may be forced to make their service more  secure or even move into Europe.  </p><p>On top of that individual member states are now required to  investigate complaints on their own and could impose additional bans.  </p><p>So you can see how this is all shaping up.  And it could be made  particularly onerous for the 4,400 companies both big and small that are  covered by safe harbor laws.  </p><p>Speaking after the ruling was announced, European Commission vice  president Frans Timmermans said work to strengthen private protections  would continue.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANS TIMMERMANS, EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE PRESIDENT:  In the meantime  trans-Atlantic data flows between companies can continue using other  mechanisms for international transfers of personal data available under  E.U. data protection law.  </p><p>Our priorities as commissioner are, first of all the protection of  personal data transferred across the Atlantic; secondly, the continuation  of trans-Atlantic data, flows which are important for our economy with  adequate safeguards; thirdly, the uniform application of E.U. law in the  internal market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  To put all this all into perspective for us is our business  correspondent, Samuel Burke.  </p><p>And Samuel, this pact has basically existed for 15 years.  </p><p>So why change it now?  </p><p>And more importantly, why is this a big deal?  </p><p>Explain to viewers around the world why it matters to them.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  What we have is a perfect situation  here, a European on one side of this table and an American on the other  side of the table because what we are seeing here is a real divergence in  the way Americans are handling privacy, treating it more as a consumer  protection.</p><p>And the way you that you guys, the Europeans are treating it, more as  a civil right.  And we're seeing this over and over again in the courts.   We're seeing it in rules and laws.  And we're seeing it in how governments  are approaching this.  </p><p>This is part of a bigger picture that's happening here in Europe.  I  want to just put up on the screen where we can see this, the right to be  forgotten.  Remember, Google now has to comply with each local regulator.  </p><p>If somebody doesn't like a Google result, they can go to their local  regulator and say I want it removed.  We even have reports of Germany  considering building its own Internet.  They're, of course, upset about  some of the reports that they have heard about Americans spying allegedly.  </p><p>So maybe their own Internet to protect them.  And now this safe harbor  agreement ruled invalid.  So what this means is a lot like the Google  situation.  People will now have to go to their local regulator.  </p><p>That's what it's going to mean for each of these companies.  Each  country in Europe will now have a say over how their data is handled.  So  if you're a German citizen, you're upset, you might go to the German  regulators and say I want this change and now all those companies are going  to have to comply with that.</p><p>But this picture you're painting, it means it's going to be a  bureaucratic nightmare, just red tape after red tape in every single  country.  For the big companies we've been talking about, the big tech  giants, they have the financial means.  </p><p>What about the small companies?  What do they do?  </p><p>I've been talking to analysts all day long who say, oh, you guys on  television, in the news you're talking about Facebook, Google, Twitter.   They all have the money to deal with this.  </p><p>Some of them will find ways to get around it, in some ways but they  also find ways to comply with it with their lawyers.  If you're a small  company in the U.S. like many of these small businesses we profile on CNN  and you've just set up shop in Europe, can you imagine --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>BURKE:  -- dealing with a regulator in Germany, in Austria, in the  U.K.? </p><p>It's going to be a real headache for those people.  </p><p>I want to just read you what Facebook said in their statement because  I think it really summed it up really quite well.  </p><p>They said, \"This case is not about Facebook,\" even though it was  originally about Facebook but they're right.  </p><p>\"The advocate general himself said that Facebook has done nothing  wrong.  What is at issue is one of the mechanisms that European law  provides to enable essential trans-Atlantic data flows.\"  </p><p>So Facebook is right.  Yes, the case was specifically about them but  it applies to everybody.  For the moment, data's going to keep on flowing  from Europe to the United States.  But we're in a gray zone right now.  In  the coming weeks and coming months, each country with their own set of  regulations.</p><p>SOARES:  Samuel Burke, putting it into context for us; as always,  great job.  Thanks very much, Samuel.</p><p>Now Vera Jourova is the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers  and Gender Equality.  She told me the ruling was not a surprise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE:  The ruling of the  court, which was announced today, in fact, was not a big surprise for the  commission because it confirmed we need to negotiate a better and safer  system for the protection of data of European citizens when the data is  transferred to the United States.</p><p>SOARES:  The understanding is, the analysis seems to be, that with  this, with the suspension of safe harbor then that will impact the economy,  in particular hurt small and medium-size companies.  </p><p>What is your view on this?  </p><p>JOUROVA:  Yes.  Of course, we have a specific system for transfer of  data between E.U. and U.S. for a very good purpose, because there is a very  large scope of data transferring between business to business.  We have  4,400 companies subscribed under the safe harbor system.  </p><p>So what do we need to do now is to provide clear guidance for the  companies, what to do under the changed legal conditions.  And what they  should do, of course, they will have to comply with the rules provided for  in the current directive for data protection.</p><p>SOARES:  What would this new guidance, this new framework, what would  that look like?  </p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, the guidance will refer to the existing rules, which,  as I said are coming from the directive.  So it means that companies will  have to make agreements, the contracts with the special clause on data  protection.  </p><p>Or they would or should have the binding corporate rules in case we  speak about corporations which are based in E.U. and U.S. at the same time.  </p><p>And there are some other rules which can be applied.  Simply said, now  without having safe harbor, there will be other mechanisms used.</p><p>Commissioner, many may say that this is just another sign of Europe  being unfriendly to the big tech companies.  </p><p>What do you have to say to that?  </p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, I don't want to speak about what's friendly or  unfriendly.  Our main duty is to ensure very high standard of the  protection of the data of European citizens when the data is transferred to  third countries, which is the case of European -- of the United States.  </p><p>And the second big priority for me is now to make sure that the  businesses will know the conditions under which they will continue  transferring the data.  </p><p>And I must say that I find this as a very strong commitment on our  side because the companies act in good faith and we need to help them to  overcome this, let's say, difficult moment.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES:  Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, an attack  on Air France bosses is an attack on France's reputation.  The French prime  minister vows to crack down on violent protesters.  We're live in Paris,  just ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[16:10:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SOARES:  France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls says Monday's attack on  Air France executives has damaged his country's reputation right around the  world.  </p><p>Furious protesters ripped the shirts off the backs of HR bosses after  the company revealed plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs.  Several executives  needed help from security staff to flee the crowds.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice-over):  As you can see there, some climbed those fences  to try to get away.  Air France said the majority of demonstrators were  peaceful.  Manuel Valls visited the airline's headquarters on Tuesday and  said those responsible will be brought to account.</p><p>MANUEL VALLS, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  Nothing can  justify such acts.  These acts are the work of thugs.  The criminal justice  system will have to identify those who behaved with such unspeakable  violence.  </p><p>Violence is unacceptable in our society.  It has to be condemned.  And  those who perpetrated such acts should be severely punished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  Now it's not the first time we've seen things turn nasty at  French labor protests.  Take a look at some of these examples.  These are  Goodyear protests.  Goodyear employees, who feared job cuts, set tires on  fire and then clashed with officers back in 2013.  That's actually near  Paris.  </p><p>When those cuts were announced the following year, the workers held  two executives hostage for two days.  </p><p>But it doesn't stop here.  In another case of boss-napping, as it's  called, workers detained a 3M factory director for more than 24 hours in a  spat over severance pay in 2009.  </p><p>Now after he was released, a court awarded 800,000 euros to be shared  between more than 100 laid-off employees.  </p><p>And if we stay in that year, also in 2009, workers in Central France  rigged an auto factory booby trap and then threatened to set off explosions  lest they were given the desired payouts.  </p><p>You're starting to get the picture.  </p><p>Christian Malard is an international diplomatic consultant.  He's a  very familiar voice here on the show, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p>Christian, always good to have you on the show.  We've seen the  protests taking place in France the last few days, some of them pretty  heated and combative.  </p><p>Do you think they'll make any difference when it comes to reaching an  agreement?  </p><p>CHRISTIAN MALARD, INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC CONSULTANT:  Well, you have  to understand, Isa, that Air France is a company which has been undergoing  for weeks and years now a lot of crisis but now we come to a peak with  2,900 jobs which are going to be suppressed by the chairman, by the  company.  </p><p>So on the one hand you have a company which has been doing great in  the past with a lot of privileges for the employees but the timing, the  world has changed.  The world has modernized.  And it seems that the  company has not been following all this.  </p><p>So we need to really reform this company like we need to reform the  country in France, economically speaking.  And a lot of the employees are  just mad at the way the chairman of the company has been managing it.  So  it's clear that the situation is going to harden in the future.  It seems  that the social dialogue in this country --</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>MALARD:  -- is broken.  Let's say two months before regional elections  and 17  months before presidential elections, it seems that the crisis is  going to go up and up.  And the unions are not helping.  </p><p>When the prime minister -- you probably put it on the CNN on air --  when the prime minister qualified a part of the demonstrators as thugs, I  think he is right.  </p><p>Not all the people who have been trying to attack the Air France  people, the representative of the company, are steward or stewardesses or  pilots.  It seems like the word, \"thugs,\" used by the prime minister Valls  is the right things.  So the situation is seriously deteriorating.</p><p>SOARES:  And Christian, I mean, the prime minister basically said the  images of the protests, he said, hurts our economy.  Those were his words.  </p><p>How damaging do you think this can be for the French economy?  </p><p>MALARD:  Well, Air France is representing France.  It's something very  important, Air France.  And definitely when the French president says it's  damaging the image and the reputation of the country, on this he is right.  </p><p>But I think the economy of this country has been handled the wrong  way.  I think President Hollande has been responsible.  He's been asking  for -- putting so many promises.  He made so many promises.  And he didn't  even all the promises.  So people are very disappointed.  </p><p>There is a social climate which is very bad in this country right now.   And this is why you would see a lot of people has been shocked by what  happened today with the Air France and they are shocked also by the way  things go in this country. </p><p>The rate of unemployment has been rising and rising.  And it seems to  us that the government don't have any solutions.  And this is why it's  becoming political.  </p><p>And the lead -- one of the top leader of the opposition, former  President Sarkozy, used the word today, \"chienlit.\"  It was a word used by  General de Gaulle in 1968 when we had this social student revolution.  And  it seems to say in a certain way that the country is not under control  anymore.  And this is what we worry about here.</p><p>SOARES:  So these combative feelings definitely go much deeper. </p><p>Christian Malard there for us in Paris.  </p><p>Thanks very much, Christian.  </p><p>We'll take a quick look at how European stocks closed the day today.   Markets were led by mostly auto and oil sector stocks.  </p><p>Let's look at the markets.  At the end of the day, well, they finished  -- well, the CAC 40 was probably the best performer at 1 percent; FTSE  didn't do too bad.  </p><p>But look at the Xetra DAX, that's pretty much flat.  A lot of these  stock prices, share markets were boosted by expectations the Fed will  maintain easy monetary policy.  And a lot of the big gain is there for auto  shares.  It's quite a turnaround from what we've seen in the last two weeks  also.</p><p>Now painful cutbacks on the way at Volkswagen.  That's what the  company's new CEO told 20,000 employees as they gathered at the VW  headquarters.  Muller said massive savings.  Those were the words.  Are  needed because of the emissions scandal.  </p><p>All non-essential investments will be canceled as well as postponed.   Volkswagen shares closed almost 4 percent higher today.  </p><p>Well, Alan Brown is chairman of the Volkswagen National Dealer  Advisory Council in the U.S.  He's also partner at largest freestanding VW  dealership in the country.  He told Richard Quest that the brand can indeed  recover.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALAN BROWN, CHAIRMAN, VOLKSWAGEN NATIONAL DEALER ADVISORY COUNCIL:   Our hope and prayer as a dealer network and as a brand is that we get the  fix and the fix has no interruption in fuel economy and performance on what  the customer paid for on their vehicle.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST:  And, I know sir, I'm taking you into  speculative waters.  But you must be having many clients and customers and  other dealers ringing you, calling you up and saying, what if, what if  people are not getting it? </p><p>What if people want their money back?  </p><p>What if people say the car isn't worth as much?  </p><p>These are real practical problems that you, sir, as a dealer are going  to have to face.</p><p>BROWN:  No, you're absolutely right.  And you know every customer's  need, every customer's question is going to be very specific and unique to  them in that particular moment.  That's what we're preparing for as a brand  and as a dealer body, is how we take each one of those questions and walk  down through it to make everyone feel like they've come out of the other  end of this situation better than the way we went into it.</p><p>QUEST:  Have you had, in terms of people coming into your showrooms,  are -- do you get the feeling that people are shunning Volkswagen, at least  for the time being?  </p><p>BROWN:  You know we have a very iconic brand here in North America.   We have a very loyal customer.</p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>BROWN:  The customers that I've talked with so far have been very  forgiving through the process.  And obviously, down here in Texas, we've  got a lot of customers who are saying, hey, don't touch my car; leave it  just the way it is.</p><p>QUEST:  Ah.  Now.  Ha, ha.  You've said exactly the point.  </p><p>\"Don't touch my car.  Leave it just the way it is.\"  </p><p>Do you think that is even going to be an option for people to say  \"Don't touch my car, leave it just the way it is\"?  </p><p>Or effectively will those cars that aren't touched become unsellable?  </p><p>BROWN:  You know we don't know.  And those are some of the questions,  obviously, that the dealer network has.  </p><p>I know those are questions that the brand is working through day and  night to make sure we check all the boxes of every single question we're  going to come up against but it is something that we're going to have to be  prepared for.</p><p>QUEST:  Finally -- and you've been very kind and very honest in  dealing with this.  </p><p>Finally, can the brand recover?  </p><p>I suspect you'll say yes.  </p><p>But how does it recover?  </p><p>BROWN:  Well, my immediate response is, \"Absolutely.\"  We have a brand  with tremendous resources.  And they are, as you've seen, pouring those  resources into this situation at light speed, with restructuring of  management, with putting their arms around the dealer network so that we  can get prepared to put the customer first through this process.  </p><p>I'm very reassured and it is exciting to see that I believe, truly,  this will be our finest hour and we will come out better than the way we  went in.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES:  Positive thinking there.  </p><p>Still ahead right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's a multibillion- dollar industry that trades on the imagination of its fans.  It's the real  world of fantasy sports.  And it's been rocked by accusations of insider  cheating.  We'll break it down for you next.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES:  Two of its biggest players in fantasy sports is staring at  real trouble.  DraftKings and FanDuel have had to ban employees from  playing fantasy games for money.  This ultra allegation they use inside  information to win big.</p><p>Let me talk you through how fantasy sports works and this is how it  works.  Users choose a line-up and they create a team from a list of real  players.  </p><p>[16:25:00]</p><p>SOARES:  Those players' statistics on the field are given point values  and then added up to give the fantasy team a whole score.  </p><p>Now on DraftKings and FanDuel, users pay to enter competitions,  comparing their scores to thousands of others with a chance to win cash  prizes if they come out clearly on top.  </p><p>Now the allegation here is that employees at these companies could see  which players were being used the most and, therefore, they placed bets  using different players to increase their chances of actually winning.  </p><p>In a joint statement, DraftKings and FanDuel refuted these claims.  This is what they had to say.  </p><p>\"Employees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by  internal fraud control teams and we have no evidence that anyone has  misused it.\"  </p><p>Well, in the last hour, CNN has learned that the sports network, ESPN,  is pulling all segments sponsored by DraftKings from its air.  That's the  concerns.  </p><p>Well, I spoke to \"WORLD SPORT's\" Rachel Nichols and asked her to talk  us through this scandal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RACHEL NICHOLS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Fantasy football probably sounds  like your kid in his back yard, trying to pretend he's some big star.   That's not what we're talking about here.  </p><p>We're talking about an industry worth billions of dollars in revenue a  year; 58 million Americans play.  Fantasy football started out as a much  more mom-and-pop kind of operation, the things college friends would play  with each other, maybe a couple hundred bucks on the line for an entire  season.  </p><p>It has turned into an industry.  These websites, instead of just  pitting you and three or four buddies against each other, pit you against  millions of other players.  And the allure is that you get a quick payout  and you know the stakes are high.  If you win, then you get these million  high-money dollar payouts.  </p><p>The problem is that you have to come up with a line-up of players that  is better than everyone else's line-up.  And if you are competing against  someone who has some inside information, who is an employee of one these  companies and knows from a bunch of aggregate algorithms who the best  players are to pick, well, that's not fair.  </p><p>So these companies had previously had a rule that their own employees  couldn't compete on their own sites but their employees just went and  competed on another site, maybe using some of that inside information.  It  hasn't been proven yet.  </p><p>But the truth is we'll never know because, right now, this is not  regulated.  There's no oversight.  All we have are the companies saying,  no, no, no, everything's fine, nothing to see here.  And with all the money  changing hands, people think, maybe that's not the best approach.</p><p>SOARES:  Absolutely.  You're talking about the money changing hands as  you bet, as you pick your team.  </p><p>But we're also talking about a lot of advertising money that goes  behind these companies really, doesn't it?  </p><p>NICHOLS:  Well, it's a tremendous amount of money.  A lot of sports  networks, it seems, just from watching them, that these websites are paying  up to 30 percent to 40 percent of their advertising budget -- sports teams. </p><p>The NFL doesn't have any kind official deal with these websites but  many sports teams have marketing deals with them.  I believe 29 of the 32  NFL teams do.  The NBA has an actual investment in one of these websites.   Major League Baseball has an actual investment in one these websites.  </p><p>So the problem is these websites need oversight but there are some  very powerful figures in the world of sports -- the NBA, Major League  Baseball -- that maybe don't have the interest in getting them regulated.  </p><p>Well, that's a big conflict, right?  </p><p>SOARES:  Oh, absolutely, which begs the question, many people would  say, look, this is getting close to online gambling.  This, of course, is  legal.  </p><p>So how do you go on to regulate these sites like this, Rachel?  </p><p>NICHOLS:  It's a great question because, look, the United States is a  little different than a lot of countries in Europe, where online gambling  is completely acceptable.  But here in the U.S., online gambling was  outlawed.  There was a rule passed in Congress, a law passed in 2006.  But  it had a loophole.  That was back when it was just most people with their  college friends for a couple hundred bucks.  </p><p>And so Congress decided, hey, we don't want to get involved in  regulating that.  So there was a loophole in that 2006 legislation against  online gambling.  </p><p>Well, now it's turned into not just you and your friends.  It's turned  into what appears to be gambling to a lot of the naked eye, that judgment  test.  </p><p>And the question is, will Congress take steps to close the loophole if  individual sporting organizations don't?  </p><p>There is a Democratic representative from New Jersey, who has said  that he wants to take another look at this.  But we also have powerful  lobbyists in Washington, D.C., from all these sports franchises, from these  websites, that are going to try to convince other congressmen and senators  not to look at it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES:  Rachel Nichols there.  </p><p>Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a stark warning from  the International Monetary Fund.

That's not my assessment, that's what the IMF is  warning of as it cuts its forecast once again.</p><p>It now believes the world economy will grow 3.1 percent this year and  3.6 percent in 2016.  The IMF says the following, \"The holy grail robust  growth and synchronized growth remains elusive.

Now although oil prices spiked 5 percent on Tuesday,  it's still down around 40 percent also over the past year.  </p><p>Take a look at how it's fallen, and there you go.  You see really what  we have seen in terms of Brent crude for the past two weeks.  It's been  extremely, extremely volatile.</p><p>Well the UAE's economy minister says his economy will grow 3 1/2  percent this year.  That's largely thanks to diversification, away from  things like oil.  </p><p>Sultan Al Mansouri told our emerging markets editor John Defterios  there are still some factors though they just can't control.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SULTAN BIN SAEED AL MANSOURI, UAE MINISTER OF ECONOMY:  With the UAE I  think we have spent the 3 1/2 percent is based on that other economies are  not growing.  And of course we are very much export-oriented nation,  whether it is oil or other products.</p><p>And definitely if the other nations start to grow, we will grow with  it.  If not, we will also be affected more.  I do believe that the UAE also  have the tools and the abilities and we have seen that during the crisis  2008 to turn around, open new markets, diversify the economy more,  including of course the Islamic economy, introduction into the UAE economy  and creating a niche for the UAE and for the world - for the Islamic world  and the world also.  </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  You know, I've covered  this region for about a quarter century.  I don' think I've seen as much  dislocation now, even going back to the first Gulf War. </p><p>How do you protect the role as a safe haven?  It's a very fine line  where people start to panic - pull money out of the banks, move away from  the Middle East.  </p><p>AL MANSOURI:  History, history.  The UAE if you look at it during  (AUDIO GAP) crisis where it was the Iran/Iraq war or the Kuwait crisis, the  Iraq situation and eventually many other crises that the whole region went  through, the UAE came up with really flying colors when it comes to  supporting and standing behind the issue of stability in the region and -  number one of course the UAE.  </p><p>And also that's an example for the others that the UAE really  sustained its policy of stability and the leadership --- where they  promise, they deliver.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  You have a very tough job right now.  I mean, $50 oil or  less cuts your revenues in half.  That is extremely painful and this could  be the new normal.  Are you OK riding this storm out as the Gulf countries  fight for their market share?</p><p>Can this economy withstand?  </p><p>AL MANSOURI:  Absolutely, because we are just - you know, remember -  the UAE has been able to grow over the years in many directions including  of course diversification of the economy.  </p><p>And oil only contributes less than 50 percent of the GDP of the UAE.</p><p>And hence the effect of that is not as big as so many other countries.   But also in a way it give us a strong message that has been passed by the  leadership, and that is continue with your diversification, use the oil  resources and then if it comes out as someday oil will not be here, so we  are ever ready to grow and develop a proper (ph) economy.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Fuel prices have gone up 20 percent, you're looking at  introducing a VAT, power prices have gone up substantially.  Is this the  new reality?</p><p>AL MANSOURI:  (AUDIO GAP) International prices has been affected of  course on reality of the prices as a whole around the world including of  course the UAE.</p><p>And hence this is why we took this step which is really important that  were a bit worried about in the beginning.  But it has proven to be  acceptable by the masses of people which is really excellent.</p><p>And now I think many other nations around us and the GCC are looking  at what the UAE has done on this.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:40:05] SOARES:  We showed you how European markets fared today.

Thanks very much,  Richard.</p><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" the world's  biggest tech companies are looking to space as they race to bring internet  access to the entire globe.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES:  Facebook has just announced its first project to deliver the  internet from space - you heard it right.  It is the latest move in a new  technology race that's gripping many of the world's biggest tech companies.  </p><p>The race really is to connect billions of people who don't have - yet  have - access to the Web.  Our Claire Sebastian reports on the challenges  as well as the opportunities of this new frontier.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER:  This is the AMOS-6, Facebook's latest  salvo in the race to bring the internet to the entire world.  </p><p>Facebook has partnered with French telecoms company Eutelsat to share  all the broadband of the AMOS-6 satellite.  </p><p>[16:50:04] You can see here the bits of dark orange are exactly where  this particular satellite covers.  Now take a look at the exact same map,  this shows internet usage in Africa, the darker colors are the higher  number of users.  </p><p>So you can see just how sparse it is.  Put all that together and the  need for this technology is very clear.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We believe that connectivity is a  human right.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  The AMOS-6 is the latest feature of a broader Facebook-led  initiative called internet.org, a project that connects the 4 billion  people globally who still have no internet access.</p><p>Behind the altruistic campaign is a clear business message.</p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, EURASIA GROUP:  If you're telling  me that you're going to connect a billion people into Facebook that  potentially didn't have it before, it's great that those people will have  that access, but this isn't like water, right?  </p><p>I mean, this is something that you're absolutely going to be able to  monetize and I suspect that the people that are holding Facebook shares  that want to be optimistic about Facebook will be looking at this very  carefully.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  The challenge of connecting remote areas like Africa has  galvanized Silicon Valley into action.  Google is building more than 1,000  kilometers of fiber for broadband in Uganda and Ghana, an initiative known  as Project Link.</p><p>And Microsoft is exploiting a new technology - the gaps between TV  channels, unused spectrum known as white space.  </p><p>BREMMER:  We think TV white space is the type of technology that can  help to get that last few billion people in the world connected.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Still, in the quest to provide internet access to that  last few billion, space is emerging as a leading candidate.  </p><p>Elan Musk's SpaceX will be launching the AMOS-6 and that's alongside  Musk's own plan to launch a network of 4,000 broadband satellites within  five years.</p><p>In June Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic also announced it was  funding SpaceX rival OneWeb to create a similar network.  </p><p>BREMMER:  In the internet space, we've moved very, very fast over the  course of the past years.  I expect that's only going to speed up and right  now this is the big shiny object we should be talking about it.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Facebook's big shiny object is still under construction,  set to launch next year - a small step towards a new frontier for the  Worldwide Web.</p><p>Claire Sebastian, CNN New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  Now to the world this world (ph) idea.  Now the British  businessman Ashish Thakkar is among those lobbying for internet access for  all.  </p><p>He's the author of \"The Lion Awakes\" and told Richard that the African  economy is stirring from its slumber.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ASHISH THAKKAR, AUTHOR, \"THE LION AWAKES\" AND FOUNDER, MARA GROUP:  We  do have real opportunities and they are waiting to be tapped.  </p><p>I mean, there's a lot of - I mean, our businesses are kind of growing  extremely well across the continent.  So it just proves that there are  things happening.</p><p>Yes, there are challenges, but that increases the entry level barrier  and therefore the opportunities' even that much more.  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW:  I suggest to you that what happens is people become  so subsumed and rosy and misty-eyed about the opportunities, but they don't  deal with issues like corruption, transparency, the rule of law, anti-gay  laws.  </p><p>All these things that are to some extent prevalent or present in  different countries in Africa.  They don't deal with these because  everybody's so busy thinking about the latest bank or the latest telecoms.</p><p>THAKKAR:  I disagree.  I think these issues are being addressed.  I  advise a few heads of state - I'm on the Global Agenda Council for Africa  for the World Economic Forum - I am seeing it firsthand.  </p><p>Every single day that the continent is transforming, there's more  governance, there's more transparency coming into the system.</p><p>Again, I can't generally - generalize - it positively the way we can't  generalize it negatively.  There are parts of the continent which are truly  being transformed.</p><p>QUEST:  Why am I more pessimistic than you?  </p><p>THAKKAR:  Because you haven't spent enough time there.  I think seeing  it is believing it.  Actually seeing the opportunities - </p><p>QUEST:  Seeing what?</p><p>THAKKAR:  The continent's opportunities, the countries meeting the  government officials and seeing what kind of passion they have about  transforming their country.  </p><p>President Ka - </p><p>QUEST:  Seeing a variety of countries that couldn't deal with an Ebola  crisis - that let it get completely out of control.</p><p>THAKKAR:  But that was three countries out of the 54 countries which  have been affected by Ebola.  </p><p>QUEST:  You see, that's the problem with this - with your argument.   It's always 'that was this country,' 'that was Nigeria,' 'that was this' - </p><p>THAKKAR:  No, but Nigeria fought Ebola and cleared it but it's never  been celebrated because they did fight it and clear it.  Like Nigeria had  peaceful free and fair democratic elections.  Why isn't it talked about?   Because they were peaceful, free and fair.  </p><p>That's the issue.</p><p>QUEST:  They were talked about.</p><p>THAKKAR:  Not enough, not enough.  And everybody expected the result  to be different, yet the it was a peaceful, free and fair and we're going  to have an amazing transformation in the country. </p><p>But no one talks about that.  And that's the issue we have.</p><p>QUEST:  South Africa's economy is in a terrible state.  Have you  looked at the electricity, the provision of supply and energy - it's  appalling.  </p><p>THAKKAR:  South Africa's growth is a lot slower than the rest of the  continent - I agree.  And that's why our group is - </p><p>QUEST:  But isn't that a classic example of mismanagement of an  economy that used - that was in very good stead?  </p><p>THAKKAR:  But that is a classic example of again being generalized.   That one county has that issue - and I agree.  There's a few countries like  that.  But we are a continent, Richard, and that's where it keeps on going  wrong.</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST:  With respect, you seem to only what to generalize  when it's positive in your book.  You don't want to generalize the moment  it becomes something more critical.</p><p>THAKKAR:  No, because it's a one-sided story right now.  And this is  why I'm trying to give you a real story of what I have been living every  day.</p><p>QUEST:  So what does Africa need if it's going to reach its potential?  </p><p>THAKKAR:  In my opinion, I think we've had enough.  We don't need the  pity, we don't need people to feel sorry for us.  What we need is  investment, we need partners and we need to do trade.  We don't need aid.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  Very heated discussion there.  If you're an African, let us  know your thoughts.  Why don't you tweet Richard rather than me I should  say.  @richardquest is his Twitter account.</p><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" he's scored more  goals than any other player in history.  Next, Pele tells me that modern- day footballers have a very different goal in mind.  What that is, just  ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES:  We told you earlier how money's affecting fantasy sports and  it's no secret how it affects the real game as well.  </p><p>Pele says modern-day players are only concerned with getting paid.  I  sat down with him at a new exhibition in London devoted to his life.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  Have players lost their passion for the game?  </p><p>PELE, RETIRED BRAZILIAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER:  The player has lost  his passion for his country, for his club.  But for football itself?  No.   He'll continue to play and have passion for it.</p><p>But nobody is loyal to a single club anymore.  Now they play for the  country or club that pays the most money.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[17:00:00] SOARES:  And you can see my full interview with Pele in  around half an hour from now on World Sport, only here on CNN.  </p><p>And that does it for \"Quest Means Business.\"  I'm Isa Soares.

The European Court of Justice has thrown out an agreement that allows businesses to transfer data on European users to the U.S.</p><p/><p>Now Snowden, his revelations about U.S. government surveillance set off the legal fight, praised the court. This is his tweet. This is what he had to say.</p><p/><p>\"This is the second time in as many years the world has rallied upon the Court of Justice of European Union to defend digital rights,\" he said. \"Thank you, Europe.\" Those were his words.</p><p/><p>Well, the so-called safe harbor law was set up back in 2000. What it did, it allowed American firms to store European data in the U.S., removing the need for extra data centers right here in Europe.</p><p/><p>In its ruling, the European court said it was worried that data could be subject to, quote, \"mass indiscriminate surveillance as well as interception.\" Now companies may be forced to make their service more secure or even move into Europe.</p><p/><p>On top of that individual member states are now required to investigate complaints on their own and could impose additional bans.</p><p/><p>So you can see how this is all shaping up. And it could be made particularly onerous for the 4,400 companies both big and small that are covered by safe harbor laws.</p><p/><p>Speaking after the ruling was announced, European Commission vice president Frans Timmermans said work to strengthen private protections would continue. Take a listen.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>FRANS TIMMERMANS, EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE PRESIDENT: In the meantime trans-Atlantic data flows between companies can continue using other mechanisms for international transfers of personal data available under E.U. data protection law.</p><p/><p>Our priorities as commissioner are, first of all the protection of personal data transferred across the Atlantic; secondly, the continuation of trans-Atlantic data, flows which are important for our economy with adequate safeguards; thirdly, the uniform application of E.U. law in the internal market.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SOARES: To put all this all into perspective for us is our business correspondent, Samuel Burke.</p><p/><p>And Samuel, this pact has basically existed for 15 years.</p><p/><p>So why change it now?</p><p/><p>And more importantly, why is this a big deal?</p><p/><p>Explain to viewers around the world why it matters to them.</p><p/><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What we have is a perfect situation here, a European on one side of this table and an American on the other side of the table because what we are seeing here is a real divergence in the way Americans are handling privacy, treating it more as a consumer protection.</p><p/><p>And the way you that you guys, the Europeans are treating it, more as a civil right. And we're seeing this over and over again in the courts. We're seeing it in rules and laws. And we're seeing it in how governments are approaching this.</p><p/><p>This is part of a bigger picture that's happening here in Europe. I want to just put up on the screen where we can see this, the right to be forgotten. Remember, Google now has to comply with each local regulator.</p><p/><p>If somebody doesn't like a Google result, they can go to their local regulator and say I want it removed. We even have reports of Germany considering building its own Internet. They're, of course, upset about some of the reports that they have heard about Americans spying allegedly.</p><p/><p>So maybe their own Internet to protect them. And now this safe harbor agreement ruled invalid. So what this means is a lot like the Google situation. People will now have to go to their local regulator.</p><p/><p>That's what it's going to mean for each of these companies. Each country in Europe will now have a say over how their data is handled. So if you're a German citizen, you're upset, you might go to the German regulators and say I want this change and now all those companies are going to have to comply with that.</p><p/><p>But this picture you're painting, it means it's going to be a bureaucratic nightmare, just red tape after red tape in every single country. For the big companies we've been talking about, the big tech giants, they have the financial means.</p><p/><p>What about the small companies? What do they do?</p><p/><p>I've been talking to analysts all day long who say, oh, you guys on television, in the news you're talking about Facebook, Google, Twitter. They all have the money to deal with this.</p><p/><p>Some of them will find ways to get around it, in some ways but they also find ways to comply with it with their lawyers. If you're a small company in the U.S. like many of these small businesses we profile on CNN and you've just set up shop in Europe, can you imagine --</p><p/><p>[16:05:00]</p><p/><p>BURKE: -- dealing with a regulator in Germany, in Austria, in the U.K.?</p><p/><p>It's going to be a real headache for those people.</p><p/><p>I want to just read you what Facebook said in their statement because I think it really summed it up really quite well.</p><p/><p>They said, \"This case is not about Facebook,\" even though it was originally about Facebook but they're right.</p><p/><p>\"The advocate general himself said that Facebook has done nothing wrong. What is at issue is one of the mechanisms that European law provides to enable essential trans-Atlantic data flows.\"</p><p/><p>So Facebook is right. Yes, the case was specifically about them but it applies to everybody. For the moment, data's going to keep on flowing from Europe to the United States. But we're in a gray zone right now. In the coming weeks and coming months, each country with their own set of regulations.</p><p/><p>SOARES: Samuel Burke, putting it into context for us; as always, great job. Thanks very much, Samuel.</p><p/><p>Now Vera Jourova is the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. She told me the ruling was not a surprise.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE: The ruling of the court, which was announced today, in fact, was not a big surprise for the commission because it confirmed we need to negotiate a better and safer system for the protection of data of European citizens when the data is transferred to the United States.</p><p/><p>SOARES: The understanding is, the analysis seems to be, that with this, with the suspension of safe harbor then that will impact the economy, in particular hurt small and medium-size companies.</p><p/><p>What is your view on this?</p><p/><p>JOUROVA: Yes. Of course, we have a specific system for transfer of data between E.U. and U.S. for a very good purpose, because there is a very large scope of data transferring between business to business. We have 4,400 companies subscribed under the safe harbor system.</p><p/><p>So what do we need to do now is to provide clear guidance for the companies, what to do under the changed legal conditions. And what they should do, of course, they will have to comply with the rules provided for in the current directive for data protection.</p><p/><p>SOARES: What would this new guidance, this new framework, what would that look like?</p><p/><p>JOUROVA: Well, the guidance will refer to the existing rules, which, as I said are coming from the directive. So it means that companies will have to make agreements, the contracts with the special clause on data protection.</p><p/><p>Or they would or should have the binding corporate rules in case we speak about corporations which are based in E.U. and U.S. at the same time.</p><p/><p>And there are some other rules which can be applied. Simply said, now without having safe harbor, there will be other mechanisms used.</p><p/><p>Commissioner, many may say that this is just another sign of Europe being unfriendly to the big tech companies.</p><p/><p>What do you have to say to that?</p><p/><p>JOUROVA: Well, I don't want to speak about what's friendly or unfriendly. Our main duty is to ensure very high standard of the protection of the data of European citizens when the data is transferred to third countries, which is the case of European -- of the United States.</p><p/><p>And the second big priority for me is now to make sure that the businesses will know the conditions under which they will continue transferring the data.</p><p/><p>And I must say that I find this as a very strong commitment on our side because the companies act in good faith and we need to help them to overcome this, let's say, difficult moment.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, an attack on Air France bosses is an attack on France's reputation. The French prime minister vows to crack down on violent protesters. We're live in Paris, just ahead.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[16:10:00]</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SOARES: France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls says Monday's attack on Air France executives has damaged his country's reputation right around the world.</p><p/><p>Furious protesters ripped the shirts off the backs of HR bosses after the company revealed plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs. Several executives needed help from security staff to flee the crowds.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SOARES (voice-over): As you can see there, some climbed those fences to try to get away. Air France said the majority of demonstrators were peaceful. Manuel Valls visited the airline's headquarters on Tuesday and said those responsible will be brought to account.</p><p/><p>MANUEL VALLS, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Nothing can justify such acts. These acts are the work of thugs. The criminal justice system will have to identify those who behaved with such unspeakable violence.</p><p/><p>Violence is unacceptable in our society. It has to be condemned. And those who perpetrated such acts should be severely punished.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Now it's not the first time we've seen things turn nasty at French labor protests. Take a look at some of these examples. These are Goodyear protests. Goodyear employees, who feared job cuts, set tires on fire and then clashed with officers back in 2013. That's actually near Paris.</p><p/><p>When those cuts were announced the following year, the workers held two executives hostage for two days.</p><p/><p>But it doesn't stop here. In another case of boss-napping, as it's called, workers detained a 3M factory director for more than 24 hours in a spat over severance pay in 2009.</p><p/><p>Now after he was released, a court awarded 800,000 euros to be shared between more than 100 laid-off employees.</p><p/><p>And if we stay in that year, also in 2009, workers in Central France rigged an auto factory booby trap and then threatened to set off explosions lest they were given the desired payouts.</p><p/><p>You're starting to get the picture.</p><p/><p>Christian Malard is an international diplomatic consultant. He's a very familiar voice here on the show, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p/><p>Christian, always good to have you on the show. We've seen the protests taking place in France the last few days, some of them pretty heated and combative.</p><p/><p>Do you think they'll make any difference when it comes to reaching an agreement?</p><p/><p>CHRISTIAN MALARD, INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC CONSULTANT: Well, you have to understand, Isa, that Air France is a company which has been undergoing for weeks and years now a lot of crisis but now we come to a peak with 2,900 jobs which are going to be suppressed by the chairman, by the company.</p><p/><p>So on the one hand you have a company which has been doing great in the past with a lot of privileges for the employees but the timing, the world has changed. The world has modernized. And it seems that the company has not been following all this.</p><p/><p>So we need to really reform this company like we need to reform the country in France, economically speaking. And a lot of the employees are just mad at the way the chairman of the company has been managing it. So it's clear that the situation is going to harden in the future. It seems that the social dialogue in this country --</p><p/><p>[16:15:00]</p><p/><p>MALARD: -- is broken. Let's say two months before regional elections and 17 months before presidential elections, it seems that the crisis is going to go up and up. And the unions are not helping.</p><p/><p>When the prime minister -- you probably put it on the CNN on air -- when the prime minister qualified a part of the demonstrators as thugs, I think he is right.</p><p/><p>Not all the people who have been trying to attack the Air France people, the representative of the company, are steward or stewardesses or pilots. It seems like the word, \"thugs,\" used by the prime minister Valls is the right things. So the situation is seriously deteriorating.</p><p/><p>SOARES: And Christian, I mean, the prime minister basically said the images of the protests, he said, hurts our economy. Those were his words.</p><p/><p>How damaging do you think this can be for the French economy?</p><p/><p>MALARD: Well, Air France is representing France. It's something very important, Air France. And definitely when the French president says it's damaging the image and the reputation of the country, on this he is right.</p><p/><p>But I think the economy of this country has been handled the wrong way. I think President Hollande has been responsible. He's been asking for -- putting so many promises. He made so many promises. And he didn't even all the promises. So people are very disappointed.</p><p/><p>There is a social climate which is very bad in this country right now. And this is why you would see a lot of people has been shocked by what happened today with the Air France and they are shocked also by the way things go in this country.</p><p/><p>The rate of unemployment has been rising and rising. And it seems to us that the government don't have any solutions. And this is why it's becoming political.</p><p/><p>And the lead -- one of the top leader of the opposition, former President Sarkozy, used the word today, \"chienlit.\" It was a word used by General de Gaulle in 1968 when we had this social student revolution. And it seems to say in a certain way that the country is not under control anymore. And this is what we worry about here.</p><p/><p>SOARES: So these combative feelings definitely go much deeper.</p><p/><p>Christian Malard there for us in Paris.</p><p/><p>Thanks very much, Christian.</p><p/><p>We'll take a quick look at how European stocks closed the day today. Markets were led by mostly auto and oil sector stocks.</p><p/><p>Let's look at the markets. At the end of the day, well, they finished -- well, the CAC 40 was probably the best performer at 1 percent; FTSE didn't do too bad.</p><p/><p>But look at the Xetra DAX, that's pretty much flat. A lot of these stock prices, share markets were boosted by expectations the Fed will maintain easy monetary policy. And a lot of the big gain is there for auto shares. It's quite a turnaround from what we've seen in the last two weeks also.</p><p/><p>Now painful cutbacks on the way at Volkswagen. That's what the company's new CEO told 20,000 employees as they gathered at the VW headquarters. Muller said massive savings. Those were the words. Are needed because of the emissions scandal.</p><p/><p>All non-essential investments will be canceled as well as postponed. Volkswagen shares closed almost 4 percent higher today.</p><p/><p>Well, Alan Brown is chairman of the Volkswagen National Dealer Advisory Council in the U.S. He's also partner at largest freestanding VW dealership in the country. He told Richard Quest that the brand can indeed recover. Take a listen.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>ALAN BROWN, CHAIRMAN, VOLKSWAGEN NATIONAL DEALER ADVISORY COUNCIL: Our hope and prayer as a dealer network and as a brand is that we get the fix and the fix has no interruption in fuel economy and performance on what the customer paid for on their vehicle.</p><p/><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST: And, I know sir, I'm taking you into speculative waters. But you must be having many clients and customers and other dealers ringing you, calling you up and saying, what if, what if people are not getting it?</p><p/><p>What if people want their money back?</p><p/><p>What if people say the car isn't worth as much?</p><p/><p>These are real practical problems that you, sir, as a dealer are going to have to face.</p><p/><p>BROWN: No, you're absolutely right. And you know every customer's need, every customer's question is going to be very specific and unique to them in that particular moment. That's what we're preparing for as a brand and as a dealer body, is how we take each one of those questions and walk down through it to make everyone feel like they've come out of the other end of this situation better than the way we went into it.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Have you had, in terms of people coming into your showrooms, are -- do you get the feeling that people are shunning Volkswagen, at least for the time being?</p><p/><p>BROWN: You know we have a very iconic brand here in North America. We have a very loyal customer.</p><p/><p>[16:20:00]</p><p/><p>BROWN: The customers that I've talked with so far have been very forgiving through the process. And obviously, down here in Texas, we've got a lot of customers who are saying, hey, don't touch my car; leave it just the way it is.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Ah. Now. Ha, ha. You've said exactly the point.</p><p/><p>\"Don't touch my car. Leave it just the way it is.\"</p><p/><p>Do you think that is even going to be an option for people to say \"Don't touch my car, leave it just the way it is\"?</p><p/><p>Or effectively will those cars that aren't touched become unsellable?</p><p/><p>BROWN: You know we don't know. And those are some of the questions, obviously, that the dealer network has.</p><p/><p>I know those are questions that the brand is working through day and night to make sure we check all the boxes of every single question we're going to come up against but it is something that we're going to have to be prepared for.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Finally -- and you've been very kind and very honest in dealing with this.</p><p/><p>Finally, can the brand recover?</p><p/><p>I suspect you'll say yes.</p><p/><p>But how does it recover?</p><p/><p>BROWN: Well, my immediate response is, \"Absolutely.\" We have a brand with tremendous resources. And they are, as you've seen, pouring those resources into this situation at light speed, with restructuring of management, with putting their arms around the dealer network so that we can get prepared to put the customer first through this process.</p><p/><p>I'm very reassured and it is exciting to see that I believe, truly, this will be our finest hour and we will come out better than the way we went in.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Positive thinking there.</p><p/><p>Still ahead right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's a multibillion- dollar industry that trades on the imagination of its fans. It's the real world of fantasy sports. And it's been rocked by accusations of insider cheating. We'll break it down for you next.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Two of its biggest players in fantasy sports is staring at real trouble. DraftKings and FanDuel have had to ban employees from playing fantasy games for money. This ultra allegation they use inside information to win big.</p><p/><p>Let me talk you through how fantasy sports works and this is how it works. Users choose a line-up and they create a team from a list of real players.</p><p/><p>[16:25:00]</p><p/><p>SOARES: Those players' statistics on the field are given point values and then added up to give the fantasy team a whole score.</p><p/><p>Now on DraftKings and FanDuel, users pay to enter competitions, comparing their scores to thousands of others with a chance to win cash prizes if they come out clearly on top.</p><p/><p>Now the allegation here is that employees at these companies could see which players were being used the most and, therefore, they placed bets using different players to increase their chances of actually winning.</p><p/><p>In a joint statement, DraftKings and FanDuel refuted these claims. This is what they had to say.</p><p/><p>\"Employees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by internal fraud control teams and we have no evidence that anyone has misused it.\"</p><p/><p>Well, in the last hour, CNN has learned that the sports network, ESPN, is pulling all segments sponsored by DraftKings from its air. That's the concerns.</p><p/><p>Well, I spoke to \"WORLD SPORT's\" Rachel Nichols and asked her to talk us through this scandal.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>RACHEL NICHOLS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Fantasy football probably sounds like your kid in his back yard, trying to pretend he's some big star. That's not what we're talking about here.</p><p/><p>We're talking about an industry worth billions of dollars in revenue a year; 58 million Americans play. Fantasy football started out as a much more mom-and-pop kind of operation, the things college friends would play with each other, maybe a couple hundred bucks on the line for an entire season.</p><p/><p>It has turned into an industry. These websites, instead of just pitting you and three or four buddies against each other, pit you against millions of other players. And the allure is that you get a quick payout and you know the stakes are high. If you win, then you get these million high-money dollar payouts.</p><p/><p>The problem is that you have to come up with a line-up of players that is better than everyone else's line-up. And if you are competing against someone who has some inside information, who is an employee of one these companies and knows from a bunch of aggregate algorithms who the best players are to pick, well, that's not fair.</p><p/><p>So these companies had previously had a rule that their own employees couldn't compete on their own sites but their employees just went and competed on another site, maybe using some of that inside information. It hasn't been proven yet.</p><p/><p>But the truth is we'll never know because, right now, this is not regulated. There's no oversight. All we have are the companies saying, no, no, no, everything's fine, nothing to see here. And with all the money changing hands, people think, maybe that's not the best approach.</p><p/><p>SOARES: Absolutely. You're talking about the money changing hands as you bet, as you pick your team.</p><p/><p>But we're also talking about a lot of advertising money that goes behind these companies really, doesn't it?</p><p/><p>NICHOLS: Well, it's a tremendous amount of money. A lot of sports networks, it seems, just from watching them, that these websites are paying up to 30 percent to 40 percent of their advertising budget -- sports teams.</p><p/><p>The NFL doesn't have any kind official deal with these websites but many sports teams have marketing deals with them. I believe 29 of the 32 NFL teams do. The NBA has an actual investment in one of these websites. Major League Baseball has an actual investment in one these websites.</p><p/><p>So the problem is these websites need oversight but there are some very powerful figures in the world of sports -- the NBA, Major League Baseball -- that maybe don't have the interest in getting them regulated.</p><p/><p>Well, that's a big conflict, right?</p><p/><p>SOARES: Oh, absolutely, which begs the question, many people would say, look, this is getting close to online gambling. This, of course, is legal.</p><p/><p>So how do you go on to regulate these sites like this, Rachel?</p><p/><p>NICHOLS: It's a great question because, look, the United States is a little different than a lot of countries in Europe, where online gambling is completely acceptable. But here in the U.S., online gambling was outlawed. There was a rule passed in Congress, a law passed in 2006. But it had a loophole. That was back when it was just most people with their college friends for a couple hundred bucks.</p><p/><p>And so Congress decided, hey, we don't want to get involved in regulating that. So there was a loophole in that 2006 legislation against online gambling.</p><p/><p>Well, now it's turned into not just you and your friends. It's turned into what appears to be gambling to a lot of the naked eye, that judgment test.</p><p/><p>And the question is, will Congress take steps to close the loophole if individual sporting organizations don't?</p><p/><p>There is a Democratic representative from New Jersey, who has said that he wants to take another look at this. But we also have powerful lobbyists in Washington, D.C., from all these sports franchises, from these websites, that are going to try to convince other congressmen and senators not to look at it.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Rachel Nichols there.</p><p/><p>Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a stark warning from the International Monetary Fund.

That's not my assessment, that's what the IMF is warning of as it cuts its forecast once again.</p><p/><p>It now believes the world economy will grow 3.1 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2016. The IMF says the following, \"The holy grail robust growth and synchronized growth remains elusive. Market volatility and the depreciation of China's currency is fueling uncertainty.\"</p><p/><p>On top of that, falling commodity prices hit emerging economies particularly hard. Now although oil prices spiked 5 percent on Tuesday, it's still down around 40 percent also over the past year.</p><p/><p>Take a look at how it's fallen, and there you go. You see really what we have seen in terms of Brent crude for the past two weeks. It's been extremely, extremely volatile.</p><p/><p>Well the UAE's economy minister says his economy will grow 3 1/2 percent this year. That's largely thanks to diversification, away from things like oil.</p><p/><p>Sultan Al Mansouri told our emerging markets editor John Defterios there are still some factors though they just can't control.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>SULTAN BIN SAEED AL MANSOURI, UAE MINISTER OF ECONOMY: With the UAE I think we have spent the 3 1/2 percent is based on that other economies are not growing. And of course we are very much export-oriented nation, whether it is oil or other products.</p><p/><p>And definitely if the other nations start to grow, we will grow with it. If not, we will also be affected more. I do believe that the UAE also have the tools and the abilities and we have seen that during the crisis 2008 to turn around, open new markets, diversify the economy more, including of course the Islamic economy, introduction into the UAE economy and creating a niche for the UAE and for the world - for the Islamic world and the world also.</p><p/><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: You know, I've covered this region for about a quarter century. I don' think I've seen as much dislocation now, even going back to the first Gulf War.</p><p/><p>How do you protect the role as a safe haven? It's a very fine line where people start to panic - pull money out of the banks, move away from the Middle East.</p><p/><p>AL MANSOURI: History, history. The UAE if you look at it during (AUDIO GAP) crisis where it was the Iran/Iraq war or the Kuwait crisis, the Iraq situation and eventually many other crises that the whole region went through, the UAE came up with really flying colors when it comes to supporting and standing behind the issue of stability in the region and - number one of course the UAE.</p><p/><p>And also that's an example for the others that the UAE really sustained its policy of stability and the leadership --- where they promise, they deliver.</p><p/><p>DEFTERIOS: You have a very tough job right now. I mean, $50 oil or less cuts your revenues in half. That is extremely painful and this could be the new normal. Are you OK riding this storm out as the Gulf countries fight for their market share?</p><p/><p>Can this economy withstand?</p><p/><p>AL MANSOURI: Absolutely, because we are just - you know, remember - the UAE has been able to grow over the years in many directions including of course diversification of the economy.</p><p/><p>And oil only contributes less than 50 percent of the GDP of the UAE.</p><p/><p>And hence the effect of that is not as big as so many other countries. But also in a way it give us a strong message that has been passed by the leadership, and that is continue with your diversification, use the oil resources and then if it comes out as someday oil will not be here, so we are ever ready to grow and develop a proper (ph) economy.</p><p/><p>DEFTERIOS: Fuel prices have gone up 20 percent, you're looking at introducing a VAT, power prices have gone up substantially. Is this the new reality?</p><p/><p>AL MANSOURI: (AUDIO GAP) International prices has been affected of course on reality of the prices as a whole around the world including of course the UAE.</p><p/><p>And hence this is why we took this step which is really important that were a bit worried about in the beginning. But it has proven to be acceptable by the masses of people which is really excellent.</p><p/><p>And now I think many other nations around us and the GCC are looking at what the UAE has done on this.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>[16:40:05] SOARES: We showed you how European markets fared today.

More when we return.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Welcome back to \"Quest Means Business.\" Now, the former president of the United Nations General Assembly has been arrested and charged with taking more than $1 million in bribes. U.S. attorneys in New York said John Ash was given Rolexes, Spokes suits and even a private basketball - a basketball court - in exchange for favors at the U.N.'s biggest event.</p><p/><p>Our senior U.N. correspondent Richard Roth joins me now to explain the details of all this. And, Richard, this is pretty damning.</p><p/><p>If he was receiving all this money and bribes, the question is what was he offering in exchange? Because as we know, nothing is free these days.</p><p/><p>RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT: That's right. What he was offering according to federal prosecutors was he was given the money to help set up a conference center on Macaw, there were other Chinese business officials who were arrested along with the president - former president - of the General Assembly today in New York, John Ash.</p><p/><p>He was the president of the General Assembly two years ago. Largely ceremonial posts, but definitely with some influence. This is what the U.S. attorney said at a press conference a few hours ago about the level of bribes he received.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>PREET BHARARA, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR MANHATTAN: So what did these bribers do for Ash, the then-U.N. General Assembly president.</p><p/><p>First, they gave him money, lots of it. From 2011 to 2014, they allegedly transferred over a million dollars in cash and in wire transfers to Ash's bank accounts in New York, often in installments of up to $200,000 or $300,000 at a time.</p><p/><p>[16:45:16] As alleged, Ash spent this cash lavishly on himself and on his family -- $59,000 on a single order of custom tailored suits, $54,000 for a pair of Rolex watches and $40,000 to lease a new BMW.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>ROTH: And as you mentioned, there was a $30,000 basketball court at his suburban in Dobbs Ferry, New York. And that is where he was arrested at 6 a.m. today.</p><p/><p>It is an astounding development for the U.N., a real thunderbolt coming just days after the 70th anniversary hoopla of the U.N. Isa.</p><p/><p>SOARES: Absolutely. And you said, Richard, this is mostly a ceremonial role, but nevertheless highly embarrassing for the U.N.</p><p/><p>So what is the U.N. saying about this? Is it commenting on it?</p><p/><p>ROTH: They're saying they're shocked and sad. And the secretary- general through his spokesman said how disturbed he was. And even the man who now has the job the alleged corrupt John Ash has, the president of the General Assembly, someone from Denmark said that if proven, this is an attack at the very heart of the integrity of the U.N.</p><p/><p>He had just learned of it like all the U.N. officials this morning, Isa.</p><p/><p>SOARES: Richard Roth there for us in New York. Thanks very much, Richard.</p><p/><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" the world's biggest tech companies are looking to space as they race to bring internet access to the entire globe. That's next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Facebook has just announced its first project to deliver the internet from space - you heard it right. It is the latest move in a new technology race that's gripping many of the world's biggest tech companies.</p><p/><p>The race really is to connect billions of people who don't have - yet have - access to the Web. Our Claire Sebastian reports on the challenges as well as the opportunities of this new frontier.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>CLAIRE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER: This is the AMOS-6, Facebook's latest salvo in the race to bring the internet to the entire world.</p><p/><p>Facebook has partnered with French telecoms company Eutelsat to share all the broadband of the AMOS-6 satellite.</p><p/><p>[16:50:04] You can see here the bits of dark orange are exactly where this particular satellite covers. Now take a look at the exact same map, this shows internet usage in Africa, the darker colors are the higher number of users.</p><p/><p>So you can see just how sparse it is. Put all that together and the need for this technology is very clear.</p><p/><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We believe that connectivity is a human right.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN: The AMOS-6 is the latest feature of a broader Facebook-led initiative called internet.org, a project that connects the 4 billion people globally who still have no internet access.</p><p/><p>Behind the altruistic campaign is a clear business message.</p><p/><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, EURASIA GROUP: If you're telling me that you're going to connect a billion people into Facebook that potentially didn't have it before, it's great that those people will have that access, but this isn't like water, right?</p><p/><p>I mean, this is something that you're absolutely going to be able to monetize and I suspect that the people that are holding Facebook shares that want to be optimistic about Facebook will be looking at this very carefully.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN: The challenge of connecting remote areas like Africa has galvanized Silicon Valley into action. Google is building more than 1,000 kilometers of fiber for broadband in Uganda and Ghana, an initiative known as Project Link.</p><p/><p>And Microsoft is exploiting a new technology - the gaps between TV channels, unused spectrum known as white space.</p><p/><p>BREMMER: We think TV white space is the type of technology that can help to get that last few billion people in the world connected.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN: Still, in the quest to provide internet access to that last few billion, space is emerging as a leading candidate.</p><p/><p>Elan Musk's SpaceX will be launching the AMOS-6 and that's alongside Musk's own plan to launch a network of 4,000 broadband satellites within five years.</p><p/><p>In June Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic also announced it was funding SpaceX rival OneWeb to create a similar network.</p><p/><p>BREMMER: In the internet space, we've moved very, very fast over the course of the past years. I expect that's only going to speed up and right now this is the big shiny object we should be talking about it.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN: Facebook's big shiny object is still under construction, set to launch next year - a small step towards a new frontier for the Worldwide Web.</p><p/><p>Claire Sebastian, CNN New York.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Now to the world this world (ph) idea. Now the British businessman Ashish Thakkar is among those lobbying for internet access for all.</p><p/><p>He's the author of \"The Lion Awakes\" and told Richard that the African economy is stirring from its slumber.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>ASHISH THAKKAR, AUTHOR, \"THE LION AWAKES\" AND FOUNDER, MARA GROUP: We do have real opportunities and they are waiting to be tapped.</p><p/><p>I mean, there's a lot of - I mean, our businesses are kind of growing extremely well across the continent. So it just proves that there are things happening.</p><p/><p>Yes, there are challenges, but that increases the entry level barrier and therefore the opportunities' even that much more.</p><p/><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW: I suggest to you that what happens is people become so subsumed and rosy and misty-eyed about the opportunities, but they don't deal with issues like corruption, transparency, the rule of law, anti-gay laws.</p><p/><p>All these things that are to some extent prevalent or present in different countries in Africa. They don't deal with these because everybody's so busy thinking about the latest bank or the latest telecoms.</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: I disagree. I think these issues are being addressed. I advise a few heads of state - I'm on the Global Agenda Council for Africa for the World Economic Forum - I am seeing it firsthand.</p><p/><p>Every single day that the continent is transforming, there's more governance, there's more transparency coming into the system.</p><p/><p>Again, I can't generally - generalize - it positively the way we can't generalize it negatively. There are parts of the continent which are truly being transformed.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Why am I more pessimistic than you?</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: Because you haven't spent enough time there. I think seeing it is believing it. Actually seeing the opportunities -</p><p/><p>QUEST: Seeing what?</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: The continent's opportunities, the countries meeting the government officials and seeing what kind of passion they have about transforming their country.</p><p/><p>President Ka -</p><p/><p>QUEST: Seeing a variety of countries that couldn't deal with an Ebola crisis - that let it get completely out of control.</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: But that was three countries out of the 54 countries which have been affected by Ebola.</p><p/><p>QUEST: You see, that's the problem with this - with your argument. It's always 'that was this country,' 'that was Nigeria,' 'that was this' -</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: No, but Nigeria fought Ebola and cleared it but it's never been celebrated because they did fight it and clear it. Like Nigeria had peaceful free and fair democratic elections. Why isn't it talked about? Because they were peaceful, free and fair.</p><p/><p>That's the issue.</p><p/><p>QUEST: They were talked about.</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: Not enough, not enough. And everybody expected the result to be different, yet the it was a peaceful, free and fair and we're going to have an amazing transformation in the country.</p><p/><p>But no one talks about that. And that's the issue we have.</p><p/><p>QUEST: South Africa's economy is in a terrible state. Have you looked at the electricity, the provision of supply and energy - it's appalling.</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: South Africa's growth is a lot slower than the rest of the continent - I agree. And that's why our group is -</p><p/><p>QUEST: But isn't that a classic example of mismanagement of an economy that used - that was in very good stead?</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: But that is a classic example of again being generalized. That one county has that issue - and I agree. There's a few countries like that. But we are a continent, Richard, and that's where it keeps on going wrong.</p><p/><p>[16:55:00] QUEST: With respect, you seem to only what to generalize when it's positive in your book. You don't want to generalize the moment it becomes something more critical.</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: No, because it's a one-sided story right now. And this is why I'm trying to give you a real story of what I have been living every day.</p><p/><p>QUEST: So what does Africa need if it's going to reach its potential?</p><p/><p>THAKKAR: In my opinion, I think we've had enough. We don't need the pity, we don't need people to feel sorry for us. What we need is investment, we need partners and we need to do trade. We don't need aid.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Very heated discussion there. If you're an African, let us know your thoughts. Why don't you tweet Richard rather than me I should say. @richardquest is his Twitter account.</p><p/><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" he's scored more goals than any other player in history. Next, Pele tells me that modern- day footballers have a very different goal in mind. What that is, just ahead.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SOARES: We told you earlier how money's affecting fantasy sports and it's no secret how it affects the real game as well.</p><p/><p>Pele says modern-day players are only concerned with getting paid. I sat down with him at a new exhibition in London devoted to his life.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>SOARES: Have players lost their passion for the game?</p><p/><p>PELE, RETIRED BRAZILIAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER: The player has lost his passion for his country, for his club. But for football itself? No. He'll continue to play and have passion for it.</p><p/><p>But nobody is loyal to a single club anymore. Now they play for the country or club that pays the most money.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>[17:00:00] SOARES: And you can see my full interview with Pele in around half an hour from now on World Sport, only here on CNN.</p><p/><p>And that does it for \"Quest Means Business.\" I'm Isa Soares.

This is what  he had to say.  </p><p>  \"This is the second time in as many years the world has rallied upon  the Court of Justice of European Union to defend digital rights,\" he said.   \"Thank you, Europe.\"  Those were his words.  </p><p>  Well, the so-called safe harbor law was set up back in 2000.  What it  did, it allowed American firms to store European data in the U.S., removing  the need for extra data centers right here in Europe.  </p><p>  In its ruling, the European court said it was worried that data could  be subject to, quote, \"mass indiscriminate surveillance as well as  interception.\"  Now companies may be forced to make their service more  secure or even move into Europe.  </p><p>  On top of that individual member states are now required to  investigate complaints on their own and could impose additional bans.  </p><p>  So you can see how this is all shaping up.  And it could be made  particularly onerous for the 4,400 companies both big and small that are  covered by safe harbor laws.  </p><p>  Speaking after the ruling was announced, European Commission vice  president Frans Timmermans said work to strengthen private protections  would continue.  Take a listen.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  FRANS TIMMERMANS, EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE PRESIDENT:  In the meantime  trans-Atlantic data flows between companies can continue using other  mechanisms for international transfers of personal data available under  E.U. data protection law.  </p><p>  Our priorities as commissioner are, first of all the protection of  personal data transferred across the Atlantic; secondly, the continuation  of trans-Atlantic data, flows which are important for our economy with  adequate safeguards; thirdly, the uniform application of E.U. law in the  internal market.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  SOARES:  To put all this all into perspective for us is our business  correspondent, Samuel Burke.  </p><p>  And Samuel, this pact has basically existed for 15 years.  </p><p>  So why change it now?  </p><p>  And more importantly, why is this a big deal?  </p><p>  Explain to viewers around the world why it matters to them.</p><p>  SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  What we have is a perfect situation  here, a European on one side of this table and an American on the other  side of the table because what we are seeing here is a real divergence in  the way Americans are handling privacy, treating it more as a consumer  protection.</p><p>  And the way you that you guys, the Europeans are treating it, more as  a civil right.  And we're seeing this over and over again in the courts.   We're seeing it in rules and laws.  And we're seeing it in how governments  are approaching this.  </p><p>  This is part of a bigger picture that's happening here in Europe.  I  want to just put up on the screen where we can see this, the right to be  forgotten.  Remember, Google now has to comply with each local regulator.  </p><p>  If somebody doesn't like a Google result, they can go to their local  regulator and say I want it removed.  We even have reports of Germany  considering building its own Internet.  They're, of course, upset about  some of the reports that they have heard about Americans spying allegedly.  </p><p>  So maybe their own Internet to protect them.  And now this safe harbor  agreement ruled invalid.  So what this means is a lot like the Google  situation.  People will now have to go to their local regulator.  </p><p>  That's what it's going to mean for each of these companies.  Each  country in Europe will now have a say over how their data is handled.  So  if you're a German citizen, you're upset, you might go to the German  regulators and say I want this change and now all those companies are going  to have to comply with that.</p><p>  But this picture you're painting, it means it's going to be a  bureaucratic nightmare, just red tape after red tape in every single  country.  For the big companies we've been talking about, the big tech  giants, they have the financial means.  </p><p>  What about the small companies?  What do they do?  </p><p>  I've been talking to analysts all day long who say, oh, you guys on  television, in the news you're talking about Facebook, Google, Twitter.   They all have the money to deal with this.  </p><p>  Some of them will find ways to get around it, in some ways but they  also find ways to comply with it with their lawyers.  If you're a small  company in the U.S. like many of these small businesses we profile on CNN  and you've just set up shop in Europe, can you imagine --</p><p>  [16:05:00]</p><p>  BURKE:  -- dealing with a regulator in Germany, in Austria, in the  U.K.? </p><p>  It's going to be a real headache for those people.  </p><p>  I want to just read you what Facebook said in their statement because  I think it really summed it up really quite well.  </p><p>  They said, \"This case is not about Facebook,\" even though it was  originally about Facebook but they're right.  </p><p>  \"The advocate general himself said that Facebook has done nothing  wrong.  What is at issue is one of the mechanisms that European law  provides to enable essential trans-Atlantic data flows.\"  </p><p>  So Facebook is right.  Yes, the case was specifically about them but  it applies to everybody.  For the moment, data's going to keep on flowing  from Europe to the United States.  But we're in a gray zone right now.  In  the coming weeks and coming months, each country with their own set of  regulations.</p><p>  SOARES:  Samuel Burke, putting it into context for us; as always,  great job.  Thanks very much, Samuel.</p><p>  Now Vera Jourova is the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers  and Gender Equality.  She told me the ruling was not a surprise.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE:  The ruling of the  court, which was announced today, in fact, was not a big surprise for the  commission because it confirmed we need to negotiate a better and safer  system for the protection of data of European citizens when the data is  transferred to the United States.</p><p>  SOARES:  The understanding is, the analysis seems to be, that with  this, with the suspension of safe harbor then that will impact the economy,  in particular hurt small and medium-size companies.  </p><p>  What is your view on this?  </p><p>  JOUROVA:  Yes.  Of course, we have a specific system for transfer of  data between E.U. and U.S. for a very good purpose, because there is a very  large scope of data transferring between business to business.  We have  4,400 companies subscribed under the safe harbor system.  </p><p>  So what do we need to do now is to provide clear guidance for the  companies, what to do under the changed legal conditions.  And what they  should do, of course, they will have to comply with the rules provided for  in the current directive for data protection.</p><p>  SOARES:  What would this new guidance, this new framework, what would  that look like?  </p><p>  JOUROVA:  Well, the guidance will refer to the existing rules, which,  as I said are coming from the directive.  So it means that companies will  have to make agreements, the contracts with the special clause on data  protection.  </p><p>  Or they would or should have the binding corporate rules in case we  speak about corporations which are based in E.U. and U.S. at the same time.  </p><p>  And there are some other rules which can be applied.  Simply said, now  without having safe harbor, there will be other mechanisms used.</p><p>  Commissioner, many may say that this is just another sign of Europe  being unfriendly to the big tech companies.  </p><p>  What do you have to say to that?  </p><p>  JOUROVA:  Well, I don't want to speak about what's friendly or  unfriendly.  Our main duty is to ensure very high standard of the  protection of the data of European citizens when the data is transferred to  third countries, which is the case of European -- of the United States.  </p><p>  And the second big priority for me is now to make sure that the  businesses will know the conditions under which they will continue  transferring the data.  </p><p>  And I must say that I find this as a very strong commitment on our  side because the companies act in good faith and we need to help them to  overcome this, let's say, difficult moment.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  SOARES:  Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, an attack  on Air France bosses is an attack on France's reputation.  The French prime  minister vows to crack down on violent protesters.  We're live in Paris,  just ahead.</p><p>  (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  [16:10:00]</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  SOARES:  France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls says Monday's attack on  Air France executives has damaged his country's reputation right around the  world.  </p><p>  Furious protesters ripped the shirts off the backs of HR bosses after  the company revealed plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs.  Several executives  needed help from security staff to flee the crowds.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  SOARES (voice-over):  As you can see there, some climbed those fences  to try to get away.  Air France said the majority of demonstrators were  peaceful.  Manuel Valls visited the airline's headquarters on Tuesday and  said those responsible will be brought to account.</p><p>  MANUEL VALLS, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  Nothing can  justify such acts.  These acts are the work of thugs.  The criminal justice  system will have to identify those who behaved with such unspeakable  violence.  </p><p>  Violence is unacceptable in our society.  It has to be condemned.  And  those who perpetrated such acts should be severely punished.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  SOARES:  Now it's not the first time we've seen things turn nasty at  French labor protests.  Take a look at some of these examples.  These are  Goodyear protests.  Goodyear employees, who feared job cuts, set tires on  fire and then clashed with officers back in 2013.  That's actually near  Paris.  </p><p>  When those cuts were announced the following year, the workers held  two executives hostage for two days.  </p><p>  But it doesn't stop here.  In another case of boss-napping, as it's  called, workers detained a 3M factory director for more than 24 hours in a  spat over severance pay in 2009.  </p><p>  Now after he was released, a court awarded 800,000 euros to be shared  between more than 100 laid-off employees.  </p><p>  And if we stay in that year, also in 2009, workers in Central France  rigged an auto factory booby trap and then threatened to set off explosions  lest they were given the desired payouts.  </p><p>  You're starting to get the picture.  </p><p>  Christian Malard is an international diplomatic consultant.  He's a  very familiar voice here on the show, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p>  Christian, always good to have you on the show.  We've seen the  protests taking place in France the last few days, some of them pretty  heated and combative.  </p><p>  Do you think they'll make any difference when it comes to reaching an  agreement?  </p><p>  CHRISTIAN MALARD, INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC CONSULTANT:  Well, you have  to understand, Isa, that Air France is a company which has been undergoing  for weeks and years now a lot of crisis but now we come to a peak with  2,900 jobs which are going to be suppressed by the chairman, by the  company.  </p><p>  So on the one hand you have a company which has been doing great in  the past with a lot of privileges for the employees but the timing, the  world has changed.  The world has modernized.  And it seems that the  company has not been following all this.  </p><p>  So we need to really reform this company like we need to reform the  country in France, economically speaking.  And a lot of the employees are  just mad at the way the chairman of the company has been managing it.  So  it's clear that the situation is going to harden in the future.  It seems  that the social dialogue in this country --</p><p>  [16:15:00]</p><p>  MALARD:  -- is broken.  Let's say two months before regional elections  and 17  months before presidential elections, it seems that the crisis is  going to go up and up.  And the unions are not helping.  </p><p>  When the prime minister -- you probably put it on the CNN on air --  when the prime minister qualified a part of the demonstrators as thugs, I  think he is right.  </p><p>  Not all the people who have been trying to attack the Air France  people, the representative of the company, are steward or stewardesses or  pilots.  It seems like the word, \"thugs,\" used by the prime minister Valls  is the right things.  So the situation is seriously deteriorating.</p><p>  SOARES:  And Christian, I mean, the prime minister basically said the  images of the protests, he said, hurts our economy.  Those were his words.  </p><p>  How damaging do you think this can be for the French economy?  </p><p>  MALARD:  Well, Air France is representing France.  It's something very  important, Air France.  And definitely when the French president says it's  damaging the image and the reputation of the country, on this he is right.  </p><p>  But I think the economy of this country has been handled the wrong  way.  I think President Hollande has been responsible.  He's been asking  for -- putting so many promises.  He made so many promises.  And he didn't  even all the promises.  So people are very disappointed.  </p><p>  There is a social climate which is very bad in this country right now.   And this is why you would see a lot of people has been shocked by what  happened today with the Air France and they are shocked also by the way  things go in this country. </p><p>  The rate of unemployment has been rising and rising.  And it seems to  us that the government don't have any solutions.  And this is why it's  becoming political.  </p><p>  And the lead -- one of the top leader of the opposition, former  President Sarkozy, used the word today, \"chienlit.\"  It was a word used by  General de Gaulle in 1968 when we had this social student revolution.  And  it seems to say in a certain way that the country is not under control  anymore.  And this is what we worry about here.</p><p>  SOARES:  So these combative feelings definitely go much deeper. </p><p>  Christian Malard there for us in Paris.  </p><p>  Thanks very much, Christian.  </p><p>  We'll take a quick look at how European stocks closed the day today.   Markets were led by mostly auto and oil sector stocks.  </p><p>  Let's look at the markets.  At the end of the day, well, they finished  -- well, the CAC 40 was probably the best performer at 1 percent; FTSE  didn't do too bad.  </p><p>  But look at the Xetra DAX, that's pretty much flat.  A lot of these  stock prices, share markets were boosted by expectations the Fed will  maintain easy monetary policy.  And a lot of the big gain is there for auto  shares.  It's quite a turnaround from what we've seen in the last two weeks  also.</p><p>  Now painful cutbacks on the way at Volkswagen.  That's what the  company's new CEO told 20,000 employees as they gathered at the VW  headquarters.  Muller said massive savings.  Those were the words.  Are  needed because of the emissions scandal.  </p><p>  All non-essential investments will be canceled as well as postponed.   Volkswagen shares closed almost 4 percent higher today.  </p><p>  Well, Alan Brown is chairman of the Volkswagen National Dealer  Advisory Council in the U.S.  He's also partner at largest freestanding VW  dealership in the country.  He told Richard Quest that the brand can indeed  recover.  Take a listen.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  ALAN BROWN, CHAIRMAN, VOLKSWAGEN NATIONAL DEALER ADVISORY COUNCIL:   Our hope and prayer as a dealer network and as a brand is that we get the  fix and the fix has no interruption in fuel economy and performance on what  the customer paid for on their vehicle.</p><p>  RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST:  And, I know sir, I'm taking you into  speculative waters.  But you must be having many clients and customers and  other dealers ringing you, calling you up and saying, what if, what if  people are not getting it? </p><p>  What if people want their money back?  </p><p>  What if people say the car isn't worth as much?  </p><p>  These are real practical problems that you, sir, as a dealer are going  to have to face.</p><p>  BROWN:  No, you're absolutely right.  And you know every customer's  need, every customer's question is going to be very specific and unique to  them in that particular moment.  That's what we're preparing for as a brand  and as a dealer body, is how we take each one of those questions and walk  down through it to make everyone feel like they've come out of the other  end of this situation better than the way we went into it.</p><p>  QUEST:  Have you had, in terms of people coming into your showrooms,  are -- do you get the feeling that people are shunning Volkswagen, at least  for the time being?  </p><p>  BROWN:  You know we have a very iconic brand here in North America.   We have a very loyal customer.</p><p>  [16:20:00]</p><p>  BROWN:  The customers that I've talked with so far have been very  forgiving through the process.  And obviously, down here in Texas, we've  got a lot of customers who are saying, hey, don't touch my car; leave it  just the way it is.</p><p>  QUEST:  Ah.  Now.  Ha, ha.  You've said exactly the point.  </p><p>  \"Don't touch my car.  Leave it just the way it is.\"  </p><p>  Do you think that is even going to be an option for people to say  \"Don't touch my car, leave it just the way it is\"?  </p><p>  Or effectively will those cars that aren't touched become unsellable?  </p><p>  BROWN:  You know we don't know.  And those are some of the questions,  obviously, that the dealer network has.  </p><p>  I know those are questions that the brand is working through day and  night to make sure we check all the boxes of every single question we're  going to come up against but it is something that we're going to have to be  prepared for.</p><p>  QUEST:  Finally -- and you've been very kind and very honest in  dealing with this.  </p><p>  Finally, can the brand recover?  </p><p>  I suspect you'll say yes.  </p><p>  But how does it recover?  </p><p>  BROWN:  Well, my immediate response is, \"Absolutely.\"  We have a brand  with tremendous resources.  And they are, as you've seen, pouring those  resources into this situation at light speed, with restructuring of  management, with putting their arms around the dealer network so that we  can get prepared to put the customer first through this process.  </p><p>  I'm very reassured and it is exciting to see that I believe, truly,  this will be our finest hour and we will come out better than the way we  went in.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  SOARES:  Positive thinking there.  </p><p>  Still ahead right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's a multibillion- dollar industry that trades on the imagination of its fans.  It's the real  world of fantasy sports.  And it's been rocked by accusations of insider  cheating.  We'll break it down for you next.</p><p>  (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>  SOARES:  Two of its biggest players in fantasy sports is staring at  real trouble.  DraftKings and FanDuel have had to ban employees from  playing fantasy games for money.  This ultra allegation they use inside  information to win big.</p><p>  Let me talk you through how fantasy sports works and this is how it  works.  Users choose a line-up and they create a team from a list of real  players.  </p><p>  [16:25:00]</p><p>  SOARES:  Those players' statistics on the field are given point values  and then added up to give the fantasy team a whole score.  </p><p>  Now on DraftKings and FanDuel, users pay to enter competitions,  comparing their scores to thousands of others with a chance to win cash  prizes if they come out clearly on top.  </p><p>  Now the allegation here is that employees at these companies could see  which players were being used the most and, therefore, they placed bets  using different players to increase their chances of actually winning.  </p><p>  In a joint statement, DraftKings and FanDuel refuted these claims.  This is what they had to say.  </p><p>  \"Employees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by  internal fraud control teams and we have no evidence that anyone has  misused it.\"  </p><p>  Well, in the last hour, CNN has learned that the sports network, ESPN,  is pulling all segments sponsored by DraftKings from its air.  That's the  concerns.  </p><p>  Well, I spoke to \"WORLD SPORT's\" Rachel Nichols and asked her to talk  us through this scandal.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  RACHEL NICHOLS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Fantasy football probably sounds  like your kid in his back yard, trying to pretend he's some big star.   That's not what we're talking about here.  </p><p>  We're talking about an industry worth billions of dollars in revenue a  year; 58 million Americans play.  Fantasy football started out as a much  more mom-and-pop kind of operation, the things college friends would play  with each other, maybe a couple hundred bucks on the line for an entire  season.  </p><p>  It has turned into an industry.  These websites, instead of just  pitting you and three or four buddies against each other, pit you against  millions of other players.  And the allure is that you get a quick payout  and you know the stakes are high.  If you win, then you get these million  high-money dollar payouts.  </p><p>  The problem is that you have to come up with a line-up of players that  is better than everyone else's line-up.  And if you are competing against  someone who has some inside information, who is an employee of one these  companies and knows from a bunch of aggregate algorithms who the best  players are to pick, well, that's not fair.  </p><p>  So these companies had previously had a rule that their own employees  couldn't compete on their own sites but their employees just went and  competed on another site, maybe using some of that inside information.  It  hasn't been proven yet.  </p><p>  But the truth is we'll never know because, right now, this is not  regulated.  There's no oversight.  All we have are the companies saying,  no, no, no, everything's fine, nothing to see here.  And with all the money  changing hands, people think, maybe that's not the best approach.</p><p>  SOARES:  Absolutely.  You're talking about the money changing hands as  you bet, as you pick your team.  </p><p>  But we're also talking about a lot of advertising money that goes  behind these companies really, doesn't it?  </p><p>  NICHOLS:  Well, it's a tremendous amount of money.  A lot of sports  networks, it seems, just from watching them, that these websites are paying  up to 30 percent to 40 percent of their advertising budget -- sports teams. </p><p>  The NFL doesn't have any kind official deal with these websites but  many sports teams have marketing deals with them.  I believe 29 of the 32  NFL teams do.  The NBA has an actual investment in one of these websites.   Major League Baseball has an actual investment in one these websites.  </p><p>  So the problem is these websites need oversight but there are some  very powerful figures in the world of sports -- the NBA, Major League  Baseball -- that maybe don't have the interest in getting them regulated.  </p><p>  Well, that's a big conflict, right?  </p><p>  SOARES:  Oh, absolutely, which begs the question, many people would  say, look, this is getting close to online gambling.  This, of course, is  legal.  </p><p>  So how do you go on to regulate these sites like this, Rachel?  </p><p>  NICHOLS:  It's a great question because, look, the United States is a  little different than a lot of countries in Europe, where online gambling  is completely acceptable.  But here in the U.S., online gambling was  outlawed.  There was a rule passed in Congress, a law passed in 2006.  But  it had a loophole.  That was back when it was just most people with their  college friends for a couple hundred bucks.  </p><p>  And so Congress decided, hey, we don't want to get involved in  regulating that.  So there was a loophole in that 2006 legislation against  online gambling.  </p><p>  Well, now it's turned into not just you and your friends.  It's turned  into what appears to be gambling to a lot of the naked eye, that judgment  test.  </p><p>  And the question is, will Congress take steps to close the loophole if  individual sporting organizations don't?  </p><p>  There is a Democratic representative from New Jersey, who has said  that he wants to take another look at this.  But we also have powerful  lobbyists in Washington, D.C., from all these sports franchises, from these  websites, that are going to try to convince other congressmen and senators  not to look at it.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  SOARES:  Rachel Nichols there.  </p><p>  Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a stark warning from  the International Monetary Fund.

General Assembly is caught up in an extraordinary bribery scandal.</p><p>  Before that though, these are the top news headlines we're following  for you this hour.</p><p>  The U.S. Secretary of Defense says the bombing of a Doctors without  Borders hospital was a mistake.  Ash Carter said he deeply regrets  Saturday's attack at Kunduz, Afghanistan which killed 22 people.  </p><p>  Earlier, the head of U.S. forces in Afghanistan said that he may have  had to adjust his recommendation for troop levels there.  </p><p>  NATO confirms Russian combat planes had violated Turkish airspace for  a second time.  Secretary General Jens Soltenberg said the violations do  not appear to have been accidental and that ISIS may not be the primary  target of Russian airstrikes in neighboring Syria.</p><p>  He told CNN that Russian activity in the region is increasing.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL:  We have seen a substantial  military buildup by Russia in Syria, both in the air with combat planes and  air defense systems but also an increasing number of ground troops.  </p><p>  In addition to that, they have deployed naval assets - a large number  naval assets - close to the Syrian shores.  And they continue to do so.   I'm not able to provide any exact numbers but they have increased their  military presence very much over the last weeks. </p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  SOARES:  Meanwhile, Turkey's president says NATO airspace must not be  violated.  Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkish relations with Russia would be  jeopardized if the incursions continue.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  [16:35:00] RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT, VIA INTERPRETER:   An attack against Turkey is an attack against NATO.  I want people to know  that.  We know our relationship with Russia.  But if Russia wants to lose  Turkey as a friend with whom it has a great cooperation, then Russia will  lose a lot of things.  Russia needs to know that.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  SOARES:  Palestinian authorities President Palestinian authorities  President Mahmoud Abbas says he does not want an escalation of violence  with Israel as days of unrest threaten to spiral out of control.   Palestinian protestors clashed again with Israeli forces in the West Bank.</p><p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 90 Palestinians were hurt.   Israel's military says it has no report of injuries.</p><p>  Return you now to business news and the weakest global growth since  the financial crisis.  That's not my assessment, that's what the IMF is  warning of as it cuts its forecast once again.</p><p>  It now believes the world economy will grow 3.1 percent this year and  3.6 percent in 2016.  The IMF says the following, \"The holy grail robust  growth and synchronized growth remains elusive.  Market volatility and the  depreciation of China's currency is fueling uncertainty.\"  </p><p>  On top of that, falling commodity prices hit emerging economies  particularly hard.  Now although oil prices spiked 5 percent on Tuesday,  it's still down around 40 percent also over the past year.  </p><p>  Take a look at how it's fallen, and there you go.  You see really what  we have seen in terms of Brent crude for the past two weeks.  It's been  extremely, extremely volatile.</p><p>  Well the UAE's economy minister says his economy will grow 3 1/2  percent this year.  That's largely thanks to diversification, away from  things like oil.  </p><p>  Sultan Al Mansouri told our emerging markets editor John Defterios  there are still some factors though they just can't control.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  SULTAN BIN SAEED AL MANSOURI, UAE MINISTER OF ECONOMY:  With the UAE I  think we have spent the 3 1/2 percent is based on that other economies are  not growing.  And of course we are very much export-oriented nation,  whether it is oil or other products.</p><p>  And definitely if the other nations start to grow, we will grow with  it.  If not, we will also be affected more.  I do believe that the UAE also  have the tools and the abilities and we have seen that during the crisis  2008 to turn around, open new markets, diversify the economy more,  including of course the Islamic economy, introduction into the UAE economy  and creating a niche for the UAE and for the world - for the Islamic world  and the world also.  </p><p>  JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  You know, I've covered  this region for about a quarter century.  I don' think I've seen as much  dislocation now, even going back to the first Gulf War. </p><p>  How do you protect the role as a safe haven?  It's a very fine line  where people start to panic - pull money out of the banks, move away from  the Middle East.  </p><p>  AL MANSOURI:  History, history.  The UAE if you look at it during  (AUDIO GAP) crisis where it was the Iran/Iraq war or the Kuwait crisis, the  Iraq situation and eventually many other crises that the whole region went  through, the UAE came up with really flying colors when it comes to  supporting and standing behind the issue of stability in the region and -  number one of course the UAE.  </p><p>  And also that's an example for the others that the UAE really  sustained its policy of stability and the leadership --- where they  promise, they deliver.</p><p>  DEFTERIOS:  You have a very tough job right now.  I mean, $50 oil or  less cuts your revenues in half.  That is extremely painful and this could  be the new normal.  Are you OK riding this storm out as the Gulf countries  fight for their market share?</p><p>  Can this economy withstand?  </p><p>  AL MANSOURI:  Absolutely, because we are just - you know, remember -  the UAE has been able to grow over the years in many directions including  of course diversification of the economy.  </p><p>  And oil only contributes less than 50 percent of the GDP of the UAE.</p><p>  And hence the effect of that is not as big as so many other countries.   But also in a way it give us a strong message that has been passed by the  leadership, and that is continue with your diversification, use the oil  resources and then if it comes out as someday oil will not be here, so we  are ever ready to grow and develop a proper (ph) economy.</p><p>  DEFTERIOS:  Fuel prices have gone up 20 percent, you're looking at  introducing a VAT, power prices have gone up substantially.  Is this the  new reality?</p><p>  AL MANSOURI:  (AUDIO GAP) International prices has been affected of  course on reality of the prices as a whole around the world including of  course the UAE.</p><p>  And hence this is why we took this step which is really important that  were a bit worried about in the beginning.  But it has proven to be  acceptable by the masses of people which is really excellent.</p><p>  And now I think many other nations around us and the GCC are looking  at what the UAE has done on this.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  [16:40:05] SOARES:  We showed you how European markets fared today.  I  want to show you how U.S. stocks ended the day.  And mostly they ended  pretty mixed after what we've seen as two days of strong gains. </p><p>  Have a look at the Dow.  They've eked out about 13 points or so -- a  rise.  But what a comparison that is to what we've seen the last two days  both on Monday as well.  On Friday, really strong gains.</p><p>  Now the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ both finished lower.  Shares of Yum!  brands are down around 16 percent - that's in after-hours trading.  Yum!  owns brands such as - that you know very well - Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco  Bell.</p><p>  They warned of disappointment sales in China and then cut its forecast  there for the rest of the year.  Many companies obviously still concerned  about China and slowing growth there.  </p><p>  Well still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" luxury  watches, fine clothes - allegedly the price of influence at the United  Nations.</p><p>  A U.S. attorney says the former president of the U.N. General Assembly  sold himself and the global institution he led.  More when we return.</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  SOARES:  Welcome back to \"Quest Means Business.\"  Now, the former  president of the United Nations General Assembly has been arrested and  charged with taking more than $1 million in bribes.  U.S. attorneys in New  York said John Ash was given Rolexes, Spokes suits and even a private  basketball - a basketball court - in exchange for favors at the U.N.'s  biggest event. </p><p>  Our senior U.N. correspondent Richard Roth joins me now to explain the  details of all this.  And, Richard, this is pretty damning.  </p><p>  If he was receiving all this money and bribes, the question is what  was he offering in exchange?  Because as we know, nothing is free these  days.</p><p>  RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.  What he  was offering according to federal prosecutors was he was given the money to  help set up a conference center on Macaw, there were other Chinese business  officials who were arrested along with the president - former president -  of the General Assembly today in New York, John Ash.  </p><p>  He was the president of the General Assembly two years ago.  Largely  ceremonial posts, but definitely with some influence.  This is what the  U.S. attorney said at a press conference a few hours ago about the level of  bribes he received.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  PREET BHARARA, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR MANHATTAN:  So what did these bribers  do for Ash, the then-U.N. General Assembly president.  </p><p>  First, they gave him money, lots of it.  From 2011 to 2014, they  allegedly transferred over a million dollars in cash and in wire transfers  to Ash's bank accounts in New York, often in installments of up to $200,000  or $300,000 at a time.  </p><p>  [16:45:16] As alleged, Ash spent this cash lavishly on himself and on  his family -- $59,000 on a single order of custom tailored suits, $54,000  for a pair of Rolex watches and $40,000 to lease a new BMW.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  ROTH:  And as you mentioned, there was a $30,000 basketball court at  his suburban in Dobbs Ferry, New York.  And that is where he was arrested  at 6 a.m. today.</p><p>  It is an astounding development for the U.N., a real thunderbolt  coming just days after the 70th anniversary hoopla of the U.N.  Isa.</p><p>  SOARES:  Absolutely.  And you said, Richard, this is mostly a  ceremonial role, but nevertheless highly embarrassing for the U.N.</p><p>  So what is the U.N. saying about this?  Is it commenting on it?  </p><p>  ROTH:  They're saying they're shocked and sad.  And the secretary- general through his spokesman said how disturbed he was.  And even the man  who now has the job the alleged corrupt John Ash has, the president of the  General Assembly, someone from Denmark said that if proven, this is an  attack at the very heart of the integrity of the U.N.</p><p>  He had just learned of it like all the U.N. officials this morning,  Isa.</p><p>  SOARES:  Richard Roth there for us in New York.  Thanks very much,  Richard.</p><p>  Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" the world's  biggest tech companies are looking to space as they race to bring internet  access to the entire globe.  That's next.</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  SOARES:  Facebook has just announced its first project to deliver the  internet from space - you heard it right.  It is the latest move in a new  technology race that's gripping many of the world's biggest tech companies.  </p><p>  The race really is to connect billions of people who don't have - yet  have - access to the Web.  Our Claire Sebastian reports on the challenges  as well as the opportunities of this new frontier.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  CLAIRE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER:  This is the AMOS-6, Facebook's latest  salvo in the race to bring the internet to the entire world.  </p><p>  Facebook has partnered with French telecoms company Eutelsat to share  all the broadband of the AMOS-6 satellite.  </p><p>  [16:50:04] You can see here the bits of dark orange are exactly where  this particular satellite covers.  Now take a look at the exact same map,  this shows internet usage in Africa, the darker colors are the higher  number of users.  </p><p>  So you can see just how sparse it is.  Put all that together and the  need for this technology is very clear.</p><p>  MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We believe that connectivity is a  human right.</p><p>  SEBASTIAN:  The AMOS-6 is the latest feature of a broader Facebook-led  initiative called internet.org, a project that connects the 4 billion  people globally who still have no internet access.</p><p>  Behind the altruistic campaign is a clear business message.</p><p>  IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, EURASIA GROUP:  If you're telling  me that you're going to connect a billion people into Facebook that  potentially didn't have it before, it's great that those people will have  that access, but this isn't like water, right?  </p><p>  I mean, this is something that you're absolutely going to be able to  monetize and I suspect that the people that are holding Facebook shares  that want to be optimistic about Facebook will be looking at this very  carefully.  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN:  The challenge of connecting remote areas like Africa has  galvanized Silicon Valley into action.  Google is building more than 1,000  kilometers of fiber for broadband in Uganda and Ghana, an initiative known  as Project Link.</p><p>  And Microsoft is exploiting a new technology - the gaps between TV  channels, unused spectrum known as white space.  </p><p>  BREMMER:  We think TV white space is the type of technology that can  help to get that last few billion people in the world connected.  </p><p>  SEBASTIAN:  Still, in the quest to provide internet access to that  last few billion, space is emerging as a leading candidate.  </p><p>  Elan Musk's SpaceX will be launching the AMOS-6 and that's alongside  Musk's own plan to launch a network of 4,000 broadband satellites within  five years.</p><p>  In June Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic also announced it was  funding SpaceX rival OneWeb to create a similar network.  </p><p>  BREMMER:  In the internet space, we've moved very, very fast over the  course of the past years.  I expect that's only going to speed up and right  now this is the big shiny object we should be talking about it.</p><p>  SEBASTIAN:  Facebook's big shiny object is still under construction,  set to launch next year - a small step towards a new frontier for the  Worldwide Web.</p><p>  Claire Sebastian, CNN New York.</p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  SOARES:  Now to the world this world (ph) idea.  Now the British  businessman Ashish Thakkar is among those lobbying for internet access for  all.  </p><p>  He's the author of \"The Lion Awakes\" and told Richard that the African  economy is stirring from its slumber.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  ASHISH THAKKAR, AUTHOR, \"THE LION AWAKES\" AND FOUNDER, MARA GROUP:  We  do have real opportunities and they are waiting to be tapped.  </p><p>  I mean, there's a lot of - I mean, our businesses are kind of growing  extremely well across the continent.  So it just proves that there are  things happening.</p><p>  Yes, there are challenges, but that increases the entry level barrier  and therefore the opportunities' even that much more.  </p><p>  RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW:  I suggest to you that what happens is people become  so subsumed and rosy and misty-eyed about the opportunities, but they don't  deal with issues like corruption, transparency, the rule of law, anti-gay  laws.  </p><p>  All these things that are to some extent prevalent or present in  different countries in Africa.  They don't deal with these because  everybody's so busy thinking about the latest bank or the latest telecoms.</p><p>  THAKKAR:  I disagree.  I think these issues are being addressed.  I  advise a few heads of state - I'm on the Global Agenda Council for Africa  for the World Economic Forum - I am seeing it firsthand.  </p><p>  Every single day that the continent is transforming, there's more  governance, there's more transparency coming into the system.</p><p>  Again, I can't generally - generalize - it positively the way we can't  generalize it negatively.  There are parts of the continent which are truly  being transformed.</p><p>  QUEST:  Why am I more pessimistic than you?  </p><p>  THAKKAR:  Because you haven't spent enough time there.  I think seeing  it is believing it.  Actually seeing the opportunities - </p><p>  QUEST:  Seeing what?</p><p>  THAKKAR:  The continent's opportunities, the countries meeting the  government officials and seeing what kind of passion they have about  transforming their country.  </p><p>  President Ka - </p><p>  QUEST:  Seeing a variety of countries that couldn't deal with an Ebola  crisis - that let it get completely out of control.</p><p>  THAKKAR:  But that was three countries out of the 54 countries which  have been affected by Ebola.  </p><p>  QUEST:  You see, that's the problem with this - with your argument.   It's always 'that was this country,' 'that was Nigeria,' 'that was this' - </p><p>  THAKKAR:  No, but Nigeria fought Ebola and cleared it but it's never  been celebrated because they did fight it and clear it.  Like Nigeria had  peaceful free and fair democratic elections.  Why isn't it talked about?   Because they were peaceful, free and fair.  </p><p>  That's the issue.</p><p>  QUEST:  They were talked about.</p><p>  THAKKAR:  Not enough, not enough.  And everybody expected the result  to be different, yet the it was a peaceful, free and fair and we're going  to have an amazing transformation in the country. </p><p>  But no one talks about that.  And that's the issue we have.</p><p>  QUEST:  South Africa's economy is in a terrible state.  Have you  looked at the electricity, the provision of supply and energy - it's  appalling.  </p><p>  THAKKAR:  South Africa's growth is a lot slower than the rest of the  continent - I agree.  And that's why our group is - </p><p>  QUEST:  But isn't that a classic example of mismanagement of an  economy that used - that was in very good stead?  </p><p>  THAKKAR:  But that is a classic example of again being generalized.   That one county has that issue - and I agree.  There's a few countries like  that.  But we are a continent, Richard, and that's where it keeps on going  wrong.</p><p>  [16:55:00] QUEST:  With respect, you seem to only what to generalize  when it's positive in your book.  You don't want to generalize the moment  it becomes something more critical.</p><p>  THAKKAR:  No, because it's a one-sided story right now.  And this is  why I'm trying to give you a real story of what I have been living every  day.</p><p>  QUEST:  So what does Africa need if it's going to reach its potential?  </p><p>  THAKKAR:  In my opinion, I think we've had enough.  We don't need the  pity, we don't need people to feel sorry for us.  What we need is  investment, we need partners and we need to do trade.  We don't need aid.</p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  SOARES:  Very heated discussion there.  If you're an African, let us  know your thoughts.  Why don't you tweet Richard rather than me I should  say.  @richardquest is his Twitter account.</p><p>  Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" he's scored more  goals than any other player in history.  Next, Pele tells me that modern- day footballers have a very different goal in mind.  What that is, just  ahead.</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  SOARES:  We told you earlier how money's affecting fantasy sports and  it's no secret how it affects the real game as well.  </p><p>  Pele says modern-day players are only concerned with getting paid.  I  sat down with him at a new exhibition in London devoted to his life.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  SOARES:  Have players lost their passion for the game?  </p><p>  PELE, RETIRED BRAZILIAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER:  The player has lost  his passion for his country, for his club.  But for football itself?  No.   He'll continue to play and have passion for it.</p><p>  But nobody is loyal to a single club anymore.  Now they play for the  country or club that pays the most money.</p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  [17:00:00] SOARES:  And you can see my full interview with Pele in  around half an hour from now on World Sport, only here on CNN.  </p><p>  And that does it for \"Quest Means Business.\"  I'm Isa Soares.

It is Tuesday, October the 6th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOARES (voice-over):  Tonight, Edward Snowden celebrates as Europe  cracks down on American tech firms. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">France's prime minister says the attacks on Air France bosses could  leave the country's reputation in tatters.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And if it's a real fraud, is this just fantasy?  Two sports gaming  sites caught in a gambling controversy.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Isa Soares and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES:  A very good evening to you.  </p><p>Tonight, Edward Snowden hails a landmark decision that may change the  way tech companies do business on both sides of the Atlantic.  The European  Court of Justice has thrown out an agreement that allows businesses to  transfer data on European users to the U.S.</p><p>Now Snowden, his revelations about U.S. government surveillance set  off the legal fight, praised the court.  This is his tweet.  This is what  he had to say.  </p><p>\"This is the second time in as many years the world has rallied upon  the Court of Justice of European Union to defend digital rights,\" he said.   \"Thank you, Europe.\"  Those were his words.  </p><p>Well, the so-called safe harbor law was set up back in 2000.  What it  did, it allowed American firms to store European data in the U.S., removing  the need for extra data centers right here in Europe.  </p><p>In its ruling, the European court said it was worried that data could  be subject to, quote, \"mass indiscriminate surveillance as well as  interception.\"  Now companies may be forced to make their service more  secure or even move into Europe.  </p><p>On top of that individual member states are now required to  investigate complaints on their own and could impose additional bans.  </p><p>So you can see how this is all shaping up.  And it could be made  particularly onerous for the 4,400 companies both big and small that are  covered by safe harbor laws.  </p><p>Speaking after the ruling was announced, European Commission vice  president Frans Timmermans said work to strengthen private protections  would continue.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANS TIMMERMANS, EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE PRESIDENT:  In the meantime  trans-Atlantic data flows between companies can continue using other  mechanisms for international transfers of personal data available under  E.U. data protection law.  </p><p>Our priorities as commissioner are, first of all the protection of  personal data transferred across the Atlantic; secondly, the continuation  of trans-Atlantic data, flows which are important for our economy with  adequate safeguards; thirdly, the uniform application of E.U. law in the  internal market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  To put all this all into perspective for us is our business  correspondent, Samuel Burke.  </p><p>And Samuel, this pact has basically existed for 15 years.  </p><p>So why change it now?  </p><p>And more importantly, why is this a big deal?  </p><p>Explain to viewers around the world why it matters to them.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  What we have is a perfect situation  here, a European on one side of this table and an American on the other  side of the table because what we are seeing here is a real divergence in  the way Americans are handling privacy, treating it more as a consumer  protection.</p><p>And the way you that you guys, the Europeans are treating it, more as  a civil right.  And we're seeing this over and over again in the courts.   We're seeing it in rules and laws.  And we're seeing it in how governments  are approaching this.  </p><p>This is part of a bigger picture that's happening here in Europe.  I  want to just put up on the screen where we can see this, the right to be  forgotten.  Remember, Google now has to comply with each local regulator.  </p><p>If somebody doesn't like a Google result, they can go to their local  regulator and say I want it removed.  We even have reports of Germany  considering building its own Internet.  They're, of course, upset about  some of the reports that they have heard about Americans spying allegedly.  </p><p>So maybe their own Internet to protect them.  And now this safe harbor  agreement ruled invalid.  So what this means is a lot like the Google  situation.  People will now have to go to their local regulator.  </p><p>That's what it's going to mean for each of these companies.  Each  country in Europe will now have a say over how their data is handled.  So  if you're a German citizen, you're upset, you might go to the German  regulators and say I want this change and now all those companies are going  to have to comply with that.</p><p>But this picture you're painting, it means it's going to be a  bureaucratic nightmare, just red tape after red tape in every single  country.  For the big companies we've been talking about, the big tech  giants, they have the financial means.  </p><p>What about the small companies?  What do they do?  </p><p>I've been talking to analysts all day long who say, oh, you guys on  television, in the news you're talking about Facebook, Google, Twitter.   They all have the money to deal with this.  </p><p>Some of them will find ways to get around it, in some ways but they  also find ways to comply with it with their lawyers.  If you're a small  company in the U.S. like many of these small businesses we profile on CNN  and you've just set up shop in Europe, can you imagine --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>BURKE:  -- dealing with a regulator in Germany, in Austria, in the  U.K.? </p><p>It's going to be a real headache for those people.  </p><p>I want to just read you what Facebook said in their statement because  I think it really summed it up really quite well.  </p><p>They said, \"This case is not about Facebook,\" even though it was  originally about Facebook but they're right.  </p><p>\"The advocate general himself said that Facebook has done nothing  wrong.  What is at issue is one of the mechanisms that European law  provides to enable essential trans-Atlantic data flows.\"  </p><p>So Facebook is right.  Yes, the case was specifically about them but  it applies to everybody.  For the moment, data's going to keep on flowing  from Europe to the United States.  But we're in a gray zone right now.  In  the coming weeks and coming months, each country with their own set of  regulations.</p><p>SOARES:  Samuel Burke, putting it into context for us; as always,  great job.  Thanks very much, Samuel.</p><p>Now Vera Jourova is the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers  and Gender Equality.  She told me the ruling was not a surprise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE:  The ruling of the  court, which was announced today, in fact, was not a big surprise for the  commission because it confirmed we need to negotiate a better and safer  system for the protection of data of European citizens when the data is  transferred to the United States.</p><p>SOARES:  The understanding is, the analysis seems to be, that with  this, with the suspension of safe harbor then that will impact the economy,  in particular hurt small and medium-size companies.  </p><p>What is your view on this?  </p><p>JOUROVA:  Yes.  Of course, we have a specific system for transfer of  data between E.U. and U.S. for a very good purpose, because there is a very  large scope of data transferring between business to business.  We have  4,400 companies subscribed under the safe harbor system.  </p><p>So what do we need to do now is to provide clear guidance for the  companies, what to do under the changed legal conditions.  And what they  should do, of course, they will have to comply with the rules provided for  in the current directive for data protection.</p><p>SOARES:  What would this new guidance, this new framework, what would  that look like?  </p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, the guidance will refer to the existing rules, which,  as I said are coming from the directive.  So it means that companies will  have to make agreements, the contracts with the special clause on data  protection.  </p><p>Or they would or should have the binding corporate rules in case we  speak about corporations which are based in E.U. and U.S. at the same time.  </p><p>And there are some other rules which can be applied.  Simply said, now  without having safe harbor, there will be other mechanisms used.</p><p>Commissioner, many may say that this is just another sign of Europe  being unfriendly to the big tech companies.  </p><p>What do you have to say to that?  </p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, I don't want to speak about what's friendly or  unfriendly.  Our main duty is to ensure very high standard of the  protection of the data of European citizens when the data is transferred to  third countries, which is the case of European -- of the United States.  </p><p>And the second big priority for me is now to make sure that the  businesses will know the conditions under which they will continue  transferring the data.  </p><p>And I must say that I find this as a very strong commitment on our  side because the companies act in good faith and we need to help them to  overcome this, let's say, difficult moment.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES:  Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, an attack  on Air France bosses is an attack on France's reputation.  The French prime  minister vows to crack down on violent protesters.  We're live in Paris,  just ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[16:10:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SOARES:  France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls says Monday's attack on  Air France executives has damaged his country's reputation right around the  world.  </p><p>Furious protesters ripped the shirts off the backs of HR bosses after  the company revealed plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs.  Several executives  needed help from security staff to flee the crowds.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice-over):  As you can see there, some climbed those fences  to try to get away.  Air France said the majority of demonstrators were  peaceful.  Manuel Valls visited the airline's headquarters on Tuesday and  said those responsible will be brought to account.</p><p>MANUEL VALLS, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  Nothing can  justify such acts.  These acts are the work of thugs.  The criminal justice  system will have to identify those who behaved with such unspeakable  violence.  </p><p>Violence is unacceptable in our society.  It has to be condemned.  And  those who perpetrated such acts should be severely punished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  Now it's not the first time we've seen things turn nasty at  French labor protests.  Take a look at some of these examples.  These are  Goodyear protests.  Goodyear employees, who feared job cuts, set tires on  fire and then clashed with officers back in 2013.  That's actually near  Paris.  </p><p>When those cuts were announced the following year, the workers held  two executives hostage for two days.  </p><p>But it doesn't stop here.  In another case of boss-napping, as it's  called, workers detained a 3M factory director for more than 24 hours in a  spat over severance pay in 2009.  </p><p>Now after he was released, a court awarded 800,000 euros to be shared  between more than 100 laid-off employees.  </p><p>And if we stay in that year, also in 2009, workers in Central France  rigged an auto factory booby trap and then threatened to set off explosions  lest they were given the desired payouts.  </p><p>You're starting to get the picture.  </p><p>Christian Malard is an international diplomatic consultant.  He's a  very familiar voice here on the show, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p>Christian, always good to have you on the show.  We've seen the  protests taking place in France the last few days, some of them pretty  heated and combative.  </p><p>Do you think they'll make any difference when it comes to reaching an  agreement?  </p><p>CHRISTIAN MALARD, INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC CONSULTANT:  Well, you have  to understand, Isa, that Air France is a company which has been undergoing  for weeks and years now a lot of crisis but now we come to a peak with  2,900 jobs which are going to be suppressed by the chairman, by the  company.  </p><p>So on the one hand you have a company which has been doing great in  the past with a lot of privileges for the employees but the timing, the  world has changed.  The world has modernized.  And it seems that the  company has not been following all this.  </p><p>So we need to really reform this company like we need to reform the  country in France, economically speaking.  And a lot of the employees are  just mad at the way the chairman of the company has been managing it.  So  it's clear that the situation is going to harden in the future.  It seems  that the social dialogue in this country --</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>MALARD:  -- is broken.  Let's say two months before regional elections  and 17  months before presidential elections, it seems that the crisis is  going to go up and up.  And the unions are not helping.  </p><p>When the prime minister -- you probably put it on the CNN on air --  when the prime minister qualified a part of the demonstrators as thugs, I  think he is right.  </p><p>Not all the people who have been trying to attack the Air France  people, the representative of the company, are steward or stewardesses or  pilots.  It seems like the word, \"thugs,\" used by the prime minister Valls  is the right things.  So the situation is seriously deteriorating.</p><p>SOARES:  And Christian, I mean, the prime minister basically said the  images of the protests, he said, hurts our economy.  Those were his words.  </p><p>How damaging do you think this can be for the French economy?  </p><p>MALARD:  Well, Air France is representing France.  It's something very  important, Air France.  And definitely when the French president says it's  damaging the image and the reputation of the country, on this he is right.  </p><p>But I think the economy of this country has been handled the wrong  way.  I think President Hollande has been responsible.  He's been asking  for -- putting so many promises.  He made so many promises.  And he didn't  even all the promises.  So people are very disappointed.  </p><p>There is a social climate which is very bad in this country right now.   And this is why you would see a lot of people has been shocked by what  happened today with the Air France and they are shocked also by the way  things go in this country. </p><p>The rate of unemployment has been rising and rising.  And it seems to  us that the government don't have any solutions.  And this is why it's  becoming political.  </p><p>And the lead -- one of the top leader of the opposition, former  President Sarkozy, used the word today, \"chienlit.\"  It was a word used by  General de Gaulle in 1968 when we had this social student revolution.  And  it seems to say in a certain way that the country is not under control  anymore.  And this is what we worry about here.</p><p>SOARES:  So these combative feelings definitely go much deeper. </p><p>Christian Malard there for us in Paris.  </p><p>Thanks very much, Christian.  </p><p>We'll take a quick look at how European stocks closed the day today.   Markets were led by mostly auto and oil sector stocks.  </p><p>Let's look at the markets.  At the end of the day, well, they finished  -- well, the CAC 40 was probably the best performer at 1 percent; FTSE  didn't do too bad.  </p><p>But look at the Xetra DAX, that's pretty much flat.  A lot of these  stock prices, share markets were boosted by expectations the Fed will  maintain easy monetary policy.  And a lot of the big gain is there for auto  shares.  It's quite a turnaround from what we've seen in the last two weeks  also.</p><p>Now painful cutbacks on the way at Volkswagen.  That's what the  company's new CEO told 20,000 employees as they gathered at the VW  headquarters.  Muller said massive savings.  Those were the words.  Are  needed because of the emissions scandal.  </p><p>All non-essential investments will be canceled as well as postponed.   Volkswagen shares closed almost 4 percent higher today.  </p><p>Well, Alan Brown is chairman of the Volkswagen National Dealer  Advisory Council in the U.S.  He's also partner at largest freestanding VW  dealership in the country.  He told Richard Quest that the brand can indeed  recover.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALAN BROWN, CHAIRMAN, VOLKSWAGEN NATIONAL DEALER ADVISORY COUNCIL:   Our hope and prayer as a dealer network and as a brand is that we get the  fix and the fix has no interruption in fuel economy and performance on what  the customer paid for on their vehicle.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST:  And, I know sir, I'm taking you into  speculative waters.  But you must be having many clients and customers and  other dealers ringing you, calling you up and saying, what if, what if  people are not getting it? </p><p>What if people want their money back?  </p><p>What if people say the car isn't worth as much?  </p><p>These are real practical problems that you, sir, as a dealer are going  to have to face.</p><p>BROWN:  No, you're absolutely right.  And you know every customer's  need, every customer's question is going to be very specific and unique to  them in that particular moment.  That's what we're preparing for as a brand  and as a dealer body, is how we take each one of those questions and walk  down through it to make everyone feel like they've come out of the other  end of this situation better than the way we went into it.</p><p>QUEST:  Have you had, in terms of people coming into your showrooms,  are -- do you get the feeling that people are shunning Volkswagen, at least  for the time being?  </p><p>BROWN:  You know we have a very iconic brand here in North America.   We have a very loyal customer.</p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>BROWN:  The customers that I've talked with so far have been very  forgiving through the process.  And obviously, down here in Texas, we've  got a lot of customers who are saying, hey, don't touch my car; leave it  just the way it is.</p><p>QUEST:  Ah.  Now.  Ha, ha.  You've said exactly the point.  </p><p>\"Don't touch my car.  Leave it just the way it is.\"  </p><p>Do you think that is even going to be an option for people to say  \"Don't touch my car, leave it just the way it is\"?  </p><p>Or effectively will those cars that aren't touched become unsellable?  </p><p>BROWN:  You know we don't know.  And those are some of the questions,  obviously, that the dealer network has.  </p><p>I know those are questions that the brand is working through day and  night to make sure we check all the boxes of every single question we're  going to come up against but it is something that we're going to have to be  prepared for.</p><p>QUEST:  Finally -- and you've been very kind and very honest in  dealing with this.  </p><p>Finally, can the brand recover?  </p><p>I suspect you'll say yes.  </p><p>But how does it recover?  </p><p>BROWN:  Well, my immediate response is, \"Absolutely.\"  We have a brand  with tremendous resources.  And they are, as you've seen, pouring those  resources into this situation at light speed, with restructuring of  management, with putting their arms around the dealer network so that we  can get prepared to put the customer first through this process.  </p><p>I'm very reassured and it is exciting to see that I believe, truly,  this will be our finest hour and we will come out better than the way we  went in.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES:  Positive thinking there.  </p><p>Still ahead right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's a multibillion- dollar industry that trades on the imagination of its fans.  It's the real  world of fantasy sports.  And it's been rocked by accusations of insider  cheating.  We'll break it down for you next.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES:  Two of its biggest players in fantasy sports is staring at  real trouble.  DraftKings and FanDuel have had to ban employees from  playing fantasy games for money.  This ultra allegation they use inside  information to win big.</p><p>Let me talk you through how fantasy sports works and this is how it  works.  Users choose a line-up and they create a team from a list of real  players.  </p><p>[16:25:00]</p><p>SOARES:  Those players' statistics on the field are given point values  and then added up to give the fantasy team a whole score.  </p><p>Now on DraftKings and FanDuel, users pay to enter competitions,  comparing their scores to thousands of others with a chance to win cash  prizes if they come out clearly on top.  </p><p>Now the allegation here is that employees at these companies could see  which players were being used the most and, therefore, they placed bets  using different players to increase their chances of actually winning.  </p><p>In a joint statement, DraftKings and FanDuel refuted these claims.  This is what they had to say.  </p><p>\"Employees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by  internal fraud control teams and we have no evidence that anyone has  misused it.\"  </p><p>Well, in the last hour, CNN has learned that the sports network, ESPN,  is pulling all segments sponsored by DraftKings from its air.  That's the  concerns.  </p><p>Well, I spoke to \"WORLD SPORT's\" Rachel Nichols and asked her to talk  us through this scandal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RACHEL NICHOLS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Fantasy football probably sounds  like your kid in his back yard, trying to pretend he's some big star.   That's not what we're talking about here.  </p><p>We're talking about an industry worth billions of dollars in revenue a  year; 58 million Americans play.  Fantasy football started out as a much  more mom-and-pop kind of operation, the things college friends would play  with each other, maybe a couple hundred bucks on the line for an entire  season.  </p><p>It has turned into an industry.  These websites, instead of just  pitting you and three or four buddies against each other, pit you against  millions of other players.  And the allure is that you get a quick payout  and you know the stakes are high.  If you win, then you get these million  high-money dollar payouts.  </p><p>The problem is that you have to come up with a line-up of players that  is better than everyone else's line-up.  And if you are competing against  someone who has some inside information, who is an employee of one these  companies and knows from a bunch of aggregate algorithms who the best  players are to pick, well, that's not fair.  </p><p>So these companies had previously had a rule that their own employees  couldn't compete on their own sites but their employees just went and  competed on another site, maybe using some of that inside information.  It  hasn't been proven yet.  </p><p>But the truth is we'll never know because, right now, this is not  regulated.  There's no oversight.  All we have are the companies saying,  no, no, no, everything's fine, nothing to see here.  And with all the money  changing hands, people think, maybe that's not the best approach.</p><p>SOARES:  Absolutely.  You're talking about the money changing hands as  you bet, as you pick your team.  </p><p>But we're also talking about a lot of advertising money that goes  behind these companies really, doesn't it?  </p><p>NICHOLS:  Well, it's a tremendous amount of money.  A lot of sports  networks, it seems, just from watching them, that these websites are paying  up to 30 percent to 40 percent of their advertising budget -- sports teams. </p><p>The NFL doesn't have any kind official deal with these websites but  many sports teams have marketing deals with them.  I believe 29 of the 32  NFL teams do.  The NBA has an actual investment in one of these websites.   Major League Baseball has an actual investment in one these websites.  </p><p>So the problem is these websites need oversight but there are some  very powerful figures in the world of sports -- the NBA, Major League  Baseball -- that maybe don't have the interest in getting them regulated.  </p><p>Well, that's a big conflict, right?  </p><p>SOARES:  Oh, absolutely, which begs the question, many people would  say, look, this is getting close to online gambling.  This, of course, is  legal.  </p><p>So how do you go on to regulate these sites like this, Rachel?  </p><p>NICHOLS:  It's a great question because, look, the United States is a  little different than a lot of countries in Europe, where online gambling  is completely acceptable.  But here in the U.S., online gambling was  outlawed.  There was a rule passed in Congress, a law passed in 2006.  But  it had a loophole.  That was back when it was just most people with their  college friends for a couple hundred bucks.  </p><p>And so Congress decided, hey, we don't want to get involved in  regulating that.  So there was a loophole in that 2006 legislation against  online gambling.  </p><p>Well, now it's turned into not just you and your friends.  It's turned  into what appears to be gambling to a lot of the naked eye, that judgment  test.  </p><p>And the question is, will Congress take steps to close the loophole if  individual sporting organizations don't?  </p><p>There is a Democratic representative from New Jersey, who has said  that he wants to take another look at this.  But we also have powerful  lobbyists in Washington, D.C., from all these sports franchises, from these  websites, that are going to try to convince other congressmen and senators  not to look at it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES:  Rachel Nichols there.  </p><p>Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a stark warning from  the International Monetary Fund.  Global growth at its worst level since  the financial crisis.  We'll tell you why -- just ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[16:30:00] SOARES:  Hello, I'm Isa Soares.

Russia needs to know that.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  Palestinian authorities President Palestinian authorities  President Mahmoud Abbas says he does not want an escalation of violence  with Israel as days of unrest threaten to spiral out of control.   Palestinian protestors clashed again with Israeli forces in the West Bank.</p><p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 90 Palestinians were hurt.   Israel's military says it has no report of injuries.</p><p>Return you now to business news and the weakest global growth since  the financial crisis.  That's not my assessment, that's what the IMF is  warning of as it cuts its forecast once again.</p><p>It now believes the world economy will grow 3.1 percent this year and  3.6 percent in 2016.  The IMF says the following, \"The holy grail robust  growth and synchronized growth remains elusive.  Market volatility and the  depreciation of China's currency is fueling uncertainty.\"  </p><p>On top of that, falling commodity prices hit emerging economies  particularly hard.  Now although oil prices spiked 5 percent on Tuesday,  it's still down around 40 percent also over the past year.  </p><p>Take a look at how it's fallen, and there you go.  You see really what  we have seen in terms of Brent crude for the past two weeks.  It's been  extremely, extremely volatile.</p><p>Well the UAE's economy minister says his economy will grow 3 1/2  percent this year.  That's largely thanks to diversification, away from  things like oil.  </p><p>Sultan Al Mansouri told our emerging markets editor John Defterios  there are still some factors though they just can't control.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SULTAN BIN SAEED AL MANSOURI, UAE MINISTER OF ECONOMY:  With the UAE I  think we have spent the 3 1/2 percent is based on that other economies are  not growing.  And of course we are very much export-oriented nation,  whether it is oil or other products.</p><p>And definitely if the other nations start to grow, we will grow with  it.  If not, we will also be affected more.  I do believe that the UAE also  have the tools and the abilities and we have seen that during the crisis  2008 to turn around, open new markets, diversify the economy more,  including of course the Islamic economy, introduction into the UAE economy  and creating a niche for the UAE and for the world - for the Islamic world  and the world also.  </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  You know, I've covered  this region for about a quarter century.  I don' think I've seen as much  dislocation now, even going back to the first Gulf War. </p><p>How do you protect the role as a safe haven?  It's a very fine line  where people start to panic - pull money out of the banks, move away from  the Middle East.  </p><p>AL MANSOURI:  History, history.  The UAE if you look at it during  (AUDIO GAP) crisis where it was the Iran/Iraq war or the Kuwait crisis, the  Iraq situation and eventually many other crises that the whole region went  through, the UAE came up with really flying colors when it comes to  supporting and standing behind the issue of stability in the region and -  number one of course the UAE.  </p><p>And also that's an example for the others that the UAE really  sustained its policy of stability and the leadership --- where they  promise, they deliver.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  You have a very tough job right now.  I mean, $50 oil or  less cuts your revenues in half.  That is extremely painful and this could  be the new normal.  Are you OK riding this storm out as the Gulf countries  fight for their market share?</p><p>Can this economy withstand?  </p><p>AL MANSOURI:  Absolutely, because we are just - you know, remember -  the UAE has been able to grow over the years in many directions including  of course diversification of the economy.  </p><p>And oil only contributes less than 50 percent of the GDP of the UAE.</p><p>And hence the effect of that is not as big as so many other countries.   But also in a way it give us a strong message that has been passed by the  leadership, and that is continue with your diversification, use the oil  resources and then if it comes out as someday oil will not be here, so we  are ever ready to grow and develop a proper (ph) economy.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Fuel prices have gone up 20 percent, you're looking at  introducing a VAT, power prices have gone up substantially.  Is this the  new reality?</p><p>AL MANSOURI:  (AUDIO GAP) International prices has been affected of  course on reality of the prices as a whole around the world including of  course the UAE.</p><p>And hence this is why we took this step which is really important that  were a bit worried about in the beginning.  But it has proven to be  acceptable by the masses of people which is really excellent.</p><p>And now I think many other nations around us and the GCC are looking  at what the UAE has done on this.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:40:05] SOARES:  We showed you how European markets fared today.  I  want to show you how U.S. stocks ended the day.  And mostly they ended  pretty mixed after what we've seen as two days of strong gains. </p><p>Have a look at the Dow.  They've eked out about 13 points or so -- a  rise.  But what a comparison that is to what we've seen the last two days  both on Monday as well.  On Friday, really strong gains.</p><p>Now the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ both finished lower.  Shares of Yum!  brands are down around 16 percent - that's in after-hours trading.  Yum!  owns brands such as - that you know very well - Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco  Bell.</p><p>They warned of disappointment sales in China and then cut its forecast  there for the rest of the year.  Many companies obviously still concerned  about China and slowing growth there.  </p><p>Well still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" luxury  watches, fine clothes - allegedly the price of influence at the United  Nations.</p><p>A U.S. attorney says the former president of the U.N. General Assembly  sold himself and the global institution he led.  More when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES:  Welcome back to \"Quest Means Business.\"  Now, the former  president of the United Nations General Assembly has been arrested and  charged with taking more than $1 million in bribes.  U.S. attorneys in New  York said John Ash was given Rolexes, Spokes suits and even a private  basketball - a basketball court - in exchange for favors at the U.N.'s  biggest event. </p><p>Our senior U.N. correspondent Richard Roth joins me now to explain the  details of all this.  And, Richard, this is pretty damning.  </p><p>If he was receiving all this money and bribes, the question is what  was he offering in exchange?  Because as we know, nothing is free these  days.</p><p>RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.  What he  was offering according to federal prosecutors was he was given the money to  help set up a conference center on Macaw, there were other Chinese business  officials who were arrested along with the president - former president -  of the General Assembly today in New York, John Ash.  </p><p>He was the president of the General Assembly two years ago.  Largely  ceremonial posts, but definitely with some influence.  This is what the  U.S. attorney said at a press conference a few hours ago about the level of  bribes he received.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PREET BHARARA, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR MANHATTAN:  So what did these bribers  do for Ash, the then-U.N. General Assembly president.  </p><p>First, they gave him money, lots of it.  From 2011 to 2014, they  allegedly transferred over a million dollars in cash and in wire transfers  to Ash's bank accounts in New York, often in installments of up to $200,000  or $300,000 at a time.  </p><p>[16:45:16] As alleged, Ash spent this cash lavishly on himself and on  his family -- $59,000 on a single order of custom tailored suits, $54,000  for a pair of Rolex watches and $40,000 to lease a new BMW.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROTH:  And as you mentioned, there was a $30,000 basketball court at  his suburban in Dobbs Ferry, New York.  And that is where he was arrested  at 6 a.m. today.</p><p>It is an astounding development for the U.N., a real thunderbolt  coming just days after the 70th anniversary hoopla of the U.N.  Isa.</p><p>SOARES:  Absolutely.  And you said, Richard, this is mostly a  ceremonial role, but nevertheless highly embarrassing for the U.N.</p><p>So what is the U.N. saying about this?  Is it commenting on it?  </p><p>ROTH:  They're saying they're shocked and sad.  And the secretary- general through his spokesman said how disturbed he was.  And even the man  who now has the job the alleged corrupt John Ash has, the president of the  General Assembly, someone from Denmark said that if proven, this is an  attack at the very heart of the integrity of the U.N.</p><p>He had just learned of it like all the U.N. officials this morning,  Isa.</p><p>SOARES:  Richard Roth there for us in New York.  Thanks very much,  Richard.</p><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" the world's  biggest tech companies are looking to space as they race to bring internet  access to the entire globe.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES:  Facebook has just announced its first project to deliver the  internet from space - you heard it right.  It is the latest move in a new  technology race that's gripping many of the world's biggest tech companies.  </p><p>The race really is to connect billions of people who don't have - yet  have - access to the Web.  Our Claire Sebastian reports on the challenges  as well as the opportunities of this new frontier.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER:  This is the AMOS-6, Facebook's latest  salvo in the race to bring the internet to the entire world.  </p><p>Facebook has partnered with French telecoms company Eutelsat to share  all the broadband of the AMOS-6 satellite.  </p><p>[16:50:04] You can see here the bits of dark orange are exactly where  this particular satellite covers.  Now take a look at the exact same map,  this shows internet usage in Africa, the darker colors are the higher  number of users.  </p><p>So you can see just how sparse it is.  Put all that together and the  need for this technology is very clear.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We believe that connectivity is a  human right.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  The AMOS-6 is the latest feature of a broader Facebook-led  initiative called internet.org, a project that connects the 4 billion  people globally who still have no internet access.</p><p>Behind the altruistic campaign is a clear business message.</p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, EURASIA GROUP:  If you're telling  me that you're going to connect a billion people into Facebook that  potentially didn't have it before, it's great that those people will have  that access, but this isn't like water, right?  </p><p>I mean, this is something that you're absolutely going to be able to  monetize and I suspect that the people that are holding Facebook shares  that want to be optimistic about Facebook will be looking at this very  carefully.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  The challenge of connecting remote areas like Africa has  galvanized Silicon Valley into action.  Google is building more than 1,000  kilometers of fiber for broadband in Uganda and Ghana, an initiative known  as Project Link.</p><p>And Microsoft is exploiting a new technology - the gaps between TV  channels, unused spectrum known as white space.  </p><p>BREMMER:  We think TV white space is the type of technology that can  help to get that last few billion people in the world connected.  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Still, in the quest to provide internet access to that  last few billion, space is emerging as a leading candidate.  </p><p>Elan Musk's SpaceX will be launching the AMOS-6 and that's alongside  Musk's own plan to launch a network of 4,000 broadband satellites within  five years.</p><p>In June Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic also announced it was  funding SpaceX rival OneWeb to create a similar network.  </p><p>BREMMER:  In the internet space, we've moved very, very fast over the  course of the past years.  I expect that's only going to speed up and right  now this is the big shiny object we should be talking about it.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Facebook's big shiny object is still under construction,  set to launch next year - a small step towards a new frontier for the  Worldwide Web.</p><p>Claire Sebastian, CNN New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  Now to the world this world (ph) idea.  Now the British  businessman Ashish Thakkar is among those lobbying for internet access for  all.  </p><p>He's the author of \"The Lion Awakes\" and told Richard that the African  economy is stirring from its slumber.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ASHISH THAKKAR, AUTHOR, \"THE LION AWAKES\" AND FOUNDER, MARA GROUP:  We  do have real opportunities and they are waiting to be tapped.  </p><p>I mean, there's a lot of - I mean, our businesses are kind of growing  extremely well across the continent.  So it just proves that there are  things happening.</p><p>Yes, there are challenges, but that increases the entry level barrier  and therefore the opportunities' even that much more.  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW:  I suggest to you that what happens is people become  so subsumed and rosy and misty-eyed about the opportunities, but they don't  deal with issues like corruption, transparency, the rule of law, anti-gay  laws.  </p><p>All these things that are to some extent prevalent or present in  different countries in Africa.  They don't deal with these because  everybody's so busy thinking about the latest bank or the latest telecoms.</p><p>THAKKAR:  I disagree.  I think these issues are being addressed.  I  advise a few heads of state - I'm on the Global Agenda Council for Africa  for the World Economic Forum - I am seeing it firsthand.  </p><p>Every single day that the continent is transforming, there's more  governance, there's more transparency coming into the system.</p><p>Again, I can't generally - generalize - it positively the way we can't  generalize it negatively.  There are parts of the continent which are truly  being transformed.</p><p>QUEST:  Why am I more pessimistic than you?  </p><p>THAKKAR:  Because you haven't spent enough time there.  I think seeing  it is believing it.  Actually seeing the opportunities - </p><p>QUEST:  Seeing what?</p><p>THAKKAR:  The continent's opportunities, the countries meeting the  government officials and seeing what kind of passion they have about  transforming their country.  </p><p>President Ka - </p><p>QUEST:  Seeing a variety of countries that couldn't deal with an Ebola  crisis - that let it get completely out of control.</p><p>THAKKAR:  But that was three countries out of the 54 countries which  have been affected by Ebola.  </p><p>QUEST:  You see, that's the problem with this - with your argument.   It's always 'that was this country,' 'that was Nigeria,' 'that was this' - </p><p>THAKKAR:  No, but Nigeria fought Ebola and cleared it but it's never  been celebrated because they did fight it and clear it.  Like Nigeria had  peaceful free and fair democratic elections.  Why isn't it talked about?   Because they were peaceful, free and fair.  </p><p>That's the issue.</p><p>QUEST:  They were talked about.</p><p>THAKKAR:  Not enough, not enough.  And everybody expected the result  to be different, yet the it was a peaceful, free and fair and we're going  to have an amazing transformation in the country. </p><p>But no one talks about that.  And that's the issue we have.</p><p>QUEST:  South Africa's economy is in a terrible state.  Have you  looked at the electricity, the provision of supply and energy - it's  appalling.  </p><p>THAKKAR:  South Africa's growth is a lot slower than the rest of the  continent - I agree.  And that's why our group is - </p><p>QUEST:  But isn't that a classic example of mismanagement of an  economy that used - that was in very good stead?  </p><p>THAKKAR:  But that is a classic example of again being generalized.   That one county has that issue - and I agree.  There's a few countries like  that.  But we are a continent, Richard, and that's where it keeps on going  wrong.</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST:  With respect, you seem to only what to generalize  when it's positive in your book.  You don't want to generalize the moment  it becomes something more critical.</p><p>THAKKAR:  No, because it's a one-sided story right now.  And this is  why I'm trying to give you a real story of what I have been living every  day.</p><p>QUEST:  So what does Africa need if it's going to reach its potential?  </p><p>THAKKAR:  In my opinion, I think we've had enough.  We don't need the  pity, we don't need people to feel sorry for us.  What we need is  investment, we need partners and we need to do trade.  We don't need aid.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES:  Very heated discussion there.  If you're an African, let us  know your thoughts.  Why don't you tweet Richard rather than me I should  say.  @richardquest is his Twitter account.</p><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" he's scored more  goals than any other player in history.

It is Tuesday, October the 6th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOARES (voice-over): Tonight, Edward Snowden celebrates as Europe cracks down on American tech firms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">France's prime minister says the attacks on Air France bosses could leave the country's reputation in tatters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And if it's a real fraud, is this just fantasy? Two sports gaming sites caught in a gambling controversy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Isa Soares and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES: A very good evening to you.</p><p>Tonight, Edward Snowden hails a landmark decision that may change the way tech companies do business on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Court of Justice has thrown out an agreement that allows businesses to transfer data on European users to the U.S.</p><p>Now Snowden, his revelations about U.S. government surveillance set off the legal fight, praised the court. This is his tweet. This is what he had to say.</p><p>\"This is the second time in as many years the world has rallied upon the Court of Justice of European Union to defend digital rights,\" he said. \"Thank you, Europe.\" Those were his words.</p><p>Well, the so-called safe harbor law was set up back in 2000. What it did, it allowed American firms to store European data in the U.S., removing the need for extra data centers right here in Europe.</p><p>In its ruling, the European court said it was worried that data could be subject to, quote, \"mass indiscriminate surveillance as well as interception.\" Now companies may be forced to make their service more secure or even move into Europe.</p><p>On top of that individual member states are now required to investigate complaints on their own and could impose additional bans.</p><p>So you can see how this is all shaping up. And it could be made particularly onerous for the 4,400 companies both big and small that are covered by safe harbor laws.</p><p>Speaking after the ruling was announced, European Commission vice president Frans Timmermans said work to strengthen private protections would continue. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANS TIMMERMANS, EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE PRESIDENT: In the meantime trans-Atlantic data flows between companies can continue using other mechanisms for international transfers of personal data available under E.U. data protection law.</p><p>Our priorities as commissioner are, first of all the protection of personal data transferred across the Atlantic; secondly, the continuation of trans-Atlantic data, flows which are important for our economy with adequate safeguards; thirdly, the uniform application of E.U. law in the internal market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: To put all this all into perspective for us is our business correspondent, Samuel Burke.</p><p>And Samuel, this pact has basically existed for 15 years.</p><p>So why change it now?</p><p>And more importantly, why is this a big deal?</p><p>Explain to viewers around the world why it matters to them.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What we have is a perfect situation here, a European on one side of this table and an American on the other side of the table because what we are seeing here is a real divergence in the way Americans are handling privacy, treating it more as a consumer protection.</p><p>And the way you that you guys, the Europeans are treating it, more as a civil right. And we're seeing this over and over again in the courts. We're seeing it in rules and laws. And we're seeing it in how governments are approaching this.</p><p>This is part of a bigger picture that's happening here in Europe. I want to just put up on the screen where we can see this, the right to be forgotten. Remember, Google now has to comply with each local regulator.</p><p>If somebody doesn't like a Google result, they can go to their local regulator and say I want it removed. We even have reports of Germany considering building its own Internet. They're, of course, upset about some of the reports that they have heard about Americans spying allegedly.</p><p>So maybe their own Internet to protect them. And now this safe harbor agreement ruled invalid. So what this means is a lot like the Google situation. People will now have to go to their local regulator.</p><p>That's what it's going to mean for each of these companies. Each country in Europe will now have a say over how their data is handled. So if you're a German citizen, you're upset, you might go to the German regulators and say I want this change and now all those companies are going to have to comply with that.</p><p>But this picture you're painting, it means it's going to be a bureaucratic nightmare, just red tape after red tape in every single country. For the big companies we've been talking about, the big tech giants, they have the financial means.</p><p>What about the small companies? What do they do?</p><p>I've been talking to analysts all day long who say, oh, you guys on television, in the news you're talking about Facebook, Google, Twitter. They all have the money to deal with this.</p><p>Some of them will find ways to get around it, in some ways but they also find ways to comply with it with their lawyers. If you're a small company in the U.S. like many of these small businesses we profile on CNN and you've just set up shop in Europe, can you imagine --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>BURKE: -- dealing with a regulator in Germany, in Austria, in the U.K.?</p><p>It's going to be a real headache for those people.</p><p>I want to just read you what Facebook said in their statement because I think it really summed it up really quite well.</p><p>They said, \"This case is not about Facebook,\" even though it was originally about Facebook but they're right.</p><p>\"The advocate general himself said that Facebook has done nothing wrong. What is at issue is one of the mechanisms that European law provides to enable essential trans-Atlantic data flows.\"</p><p>So Facebook is right. Yes, the case was specifically about them but it applies to everybody. For the moment, data's going to keep on flowing from Europe to the United States. But we're in a gray zone right now. In the coming weeks and coming months, each country with their own set of regulations.</p><p>SOARES: Samuel Burke, putting it into context for us; as always, great job. Thanks very much, Samuel.</p><p>Now Vera Jourova is the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. She told me the ruling was not a surprise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE: The ruling of the court, which was announced today, in fact, was not a big surprise for the commission because it confirmed we need to negotiate a better and safer system for the protection of data of European citizens when the data is transferred to the United States.</p><p>SOARES: The understanding is, the analysis seems to be, that with this, with the suspension of safe harbor then that will impact the economy, in particular hurt small and medium-size companies.</p><p>What is your view on this?</p><p>JOUROVA: Yes. Of course, we have a specific system for transfer of data between E.U. and U.S. for a very good purpose, because there is a very large scope of data transferring between business to business. We have 4,400 companies subscribed under the safe harbor system.</p><p>So what do we need to do now is to provide clear guidance for the companies, what to do under the changed legal conditions. And what they should do, of course, they will have to comply with the rules provided for in the current directive for data protection.</p><p>SOARES: What would this new guidance, this new framework, what would that look like?</p><p>JOUROVA: Well, the guidance will refer to the existing rules, which, as I said are coming from the directive. So it means that companies will have to make agreements, the contracts with the special clause on data protection.</p><p>Or they would or should have the binding corporate rules in case we speak about corporations which are based in E.U. and U.S. at the same time.</p><p>And there are some other rules which can be applied. Simply said, now without having safe harbor, there will be other mechanisms used.</p><p>Commissioner, many may say that this is just another sign of Europe being unfriendly to the big tech companies.</p><p>What do you have to say to that?</p><p>JOUROVA: Well, I don't want to speak about what's friendly or unfriendly. Our main duty is to ensure very high standard of the protection of the data of European citizens when the data is transferred to third countries, which is the case of European -- of the United States.</p><p>And the second big priority for me is now to make sure that the businesses will know the conditions under which they will continue transferring the data.</p><p>And I must say that I find this as a very strong commitment on our side because the companies act in good faith and we need to help them to overcome this, let's say, difficult moment.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, an attack on Air France bosses is an attack on France's reputation. The French prime minister vows to crack down on violent protesters. We're live in Paris, just ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:10:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES: France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls says Monday's attack on Air France executives has damaged his country's reputation right around the world.</p><p>Furious protesters ripped the shirts off the backs of HR bosses after the company revealed plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs. Several executives needed help from security staff to flee the crowds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): As you can see there, some climbed those fences to try to get away. Air France said the majority of demonstrators were peaceful. Manuel Valls visited the airline's headquarters on Tuesday and said those responsible will be brought to account.</p><p>MANUEL VALLS, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Nothing can justify such acts. These acts are the work of thugs. The criminal justice system will have to identify those who behaved with such unspeakable violence.</p><p>Violence is unacceptable in our society. It has to be condemned. And those who perpetrated such acts should be severely punished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Now it's not the first time we've seen things turn nasty at French labor protests. Take a look at some of these examples. These are Goodyear protests. Goodyear employees, who feared job cuts, set tires on fire and then clashed with officers back in 2013. That's actually near Paris.</p><p>When those cuts were announced the following year, the workers held two executives hostage for two days.</p><p>But it doesn't stop here. In another case of boss-napping, as it's called, workers detained a 3M factory director for more than 24 hours in a spat over severance pay in 2009.</p><p>Now after he was released, a court awarded 800,000 euros to be shared between more than 100 laid-off employees.</p><p>And if we stay in that year, also in 2009, workers in Central France rigged an auto factory booby trap and then threatened to set off explosions lest they were given the desired payouts.</p><p>You're starting to get the picture.</p><p>Christian Malard is an international diplomatic consultant. He's a very familiar voice here on the show, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Christian, always good to have you on the show. We've seen the protests taking place in France the last few days, some of them pretty heated and combative.</p><p>Do you think they'll make any difference when it comes to reaching an agreement?</p><p>CHRISTIAN MALARD, INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC CONSULTANT: Well, you have to understand, Isa, that Air France is a company which has been undergoing for weeks and years now a lot of crisis but now we come to a peak with 2,900 jobs which are going to be suppressed by the chairman, by the company.</p><p>So on the one hand you have a company which has been doing great in the past with a lot of privileges for the employees but the timing, the world has changed. The world has modernized. And it seems that the company has not been following all this.</p><p>So we need to really reform this company like we need to reform the country in France, economically speaking. And a lot of the employees are just mad at the way the chairman of the company has been managing it. So it's clear that the situation is going to harden in the future. It seems that the social dialogue in this country --</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>MALARD: -- is broken. Let's say two months before regional elections and 17 months before presidential elections, it seems that the crisis is going to go up and up. And the unions are not helping.</p><p>When the prime minister -- you probably put it on the CNN on air -- when the prime minister qualified a part of the demonstrators as thugs, I think he is right.</p><p>Not all the people who have been trying to attack the Air France people, the representative of the company, are steward or stewardesses or pilots. It seems like the word, \"thugs,\" used by the prime minister Valls is the right things. So the situation is seriously deteriorating.</p><p>SOARES: And Christian, I mean, the prime minister basically said the images of the protests, he said, hurts our economy. Those were his words.</p><p>How damaging do you think this can be for the French economy?</p><p>MALARD: Well, Air France is representing France. It's something very important, Air France. And definitely when the French president says it's damaging the image and the reputation of the country, on this he is right.</p><p>But I think the economy of this country has been handled the wrong way. I think President Hollande has been responsible. He's been asking for -- putting so many promises. He made so many promises. And he didn't even all the promises. So people are very disappointed.</p><p>There is a social climate which is very bad in this country right now. And this is why you would see a lot of people has been shocked by what happened today with the Air France and they are shocked also by the way things go in this country.</p><p>The rate of unemployment has been rising and rising. And it seems to us that the government don't have any solutions. And this is why it's becoming political.</p><p>And the lead -- one of the top leader of the opposition, former President Sarkozy, used the word today, \"chienlit.\" It was a word used by General de Gaulle in 1968 when we had this social student revolution. And it seems to say in a certain way that the country is not under control anymore. And this is what we worry about here.</p><p>SOARES: So these combative feelings definitely go much deeper.</p><p>Christian Malard there for us in Paris.</p><p>Thanks very much, Christian.</p><p>We'll take a quick look at how European stocks closed the day today. Markets were led by mostly auto and oil sector stocks.</p><p>Let's look at the markets. At the end of the day, well, they finished -- well, the CAC 40 was probably the best performer at 1 percent; FTSE didn't do too bad.</p><p>But look at the Xetra DAX, that's pretty much flat. A lot of these stock prices, share markets were boosted by expectations the Fed will maintain easy monetary policy. And a lot of the big gain is there for auto shares. It's quite a turnaround from what we've seen in the last two weeks also.</p><p>Now painful cutbacks on the way at Volkswagen. That's what the company's new CEO told 20,000 employees as they gathered at the VW headquarters. Muller said massive savings. Those were the words. Are needed because of the emissions scandal.</p><p>All non-essential investments will be canceled as well as postponed. Volkswagen shares closed almost 4 percent higher today.</p><p>Well, Alan Brown is chairman of the Volkswagen National Dealer Advisory Council in the U.S. He's also partner at largest freestanding VW dealership in the country. He told Richard Quest that the brand can indeed recover. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALAN BROWN, CHAIRMAN, VOLKSWAGEN NATIONAL DEALER ADVISORY COUNCIL: Our hope and prayer as a dealer network and as a brand is that we get the fix and the fix has no interruption in fuel economy and performance on what the customer paid for on their vehicle.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST: And, I know sir, I'm taking you into speculative waters. But you must be having many clients and customers and other dealers ringing you, calling you up and saying, what if, what if people are not getting it?</p><p>What if people want their money back?</p><p>What if people say the car isn't worth as much?</p><p>These are real practical problems that you, sir, as a dealer are going to have to face.</p><p>BROWN: No, you're absolutely right. And you know every customer's need, every customer's question is going to be very specific and unique to them in that particular moment. That's what we're preparing for as a brand and as a dealer body, is how we take each one of those questions and walk down through it to make everyone feel like they've come out of the other end of this situation better than the way we went into it.</p><p>QUEST: Have you had, in terms of people coming into your showrooms, are -- do you get the feeling that people are shunning Volkswagen, at least for the time being?</p><p>BROWN: You know we have a very iconic brand here in North America. We have a very loyal customer.</p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>BROWN: The customers that I've talked with so far have been very forgiving through the process. And obviously, down here in Texas, we've got a lot of customers who are saying, hey, don't touch my car; leave it just the way it is.</p><p>QUEST: Ah. Now. Ha, ha. You've said exactly the point.</p><p>\"Don't touch my car. Leave it just the way it is.\"</p><p>Do you think that is even going to be an option for people to say \"Don't touch my car, leave it just the way it is\"?</p><p>Or effectively will those cars that aren't touched become unsellable?</p><p>BROWN: You know we don't know. And those are some of the questions, obviously, that the dealer network has.</p><p>I know those are questions that the brand is working through day and night to make sure we check all the boxes of every single question we're going to come up against but it is something that we're going to have to be prepared for.</p><p>QUEST: Finally -- and you've been very kind and very honest in dealing with this.</p><p>Finally, can the brand recover?</p><p>I suspect you'll say yes.</p><p>But how does it recover?</p><p>BROWN: Well, my immediate response is, \"Absolutely.\" We have a brand with tremendous resources. And they are, as you've seen, pouring those resources into this situation at light speed, with restructuring of management, with putting their arms around the dealer network so that we can get prepared to put the customer first through this process.</p><p>I'm very reassured and it is exciting to see that I believe, truly, this will be our finest hour and we will come out better than the way we went in.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Positive thinking there.</p><p>Still ahead right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's a multibillion- dollar industry that trades on the imagination of its fans. It's the real world of fantasy sports. And it's been rocked by accusations of insider cheating. We'll break it down for you next.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES: Two of its biggest players in fantasy sports is staring at real trouble. DraftKings and FanDuel have had to ban employees from playing fantasy games for money. This ultra allegation they use inside information to win big.</p><p>Let me talk you through how fantasy sports works and this is how it works. Users choose a line-up and they create a team from a list of real players.</p><p>[16:25:00]</p><p>SOARES: Those players' statistics on the field are given point values and then added up to give the fantasy team a whole score.</p><p>Now on DraftKings and FanDuel, users pay to enter competitions, comparing their scores to thousands of others with a chance to win cash prizes if they come out clearly on top.</p><p>Now the allegation here is that employees at these companies could see which players were being used the most and, therefore, they placed bets using different players to increase their chances of actually winning.</p><p>In a joint statement, DraftKings and FanDuel refuted these claims. This is what they had to say.</p><p>\"Employees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by internal fraud control teams and we have no evidence that anyone has misused it.\"</p><p>Well, in the last hour, CNN has learned that the sports network, ESPN, is pulling all segments sponsored by DraftKings from its air. That's the concerns.</p><p>Well, I spoke to \"WORLD SPORT's\" Rachel Nichols and asked her to talk us through this scandal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RACHEL NICHOLS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Fantasy football probably sounds like your kid in his back yard, trying to pretend he's some big star. That's not what we're talking about here.</p><p>We're talking about an industry worth billions of dollars in revenue a year; 58 million Americans play. Fantasy football started out as a much more mom-and-pop kind of operation, the things college friends would play with each other, maybe a couple hundred bucks on the line for an entire season.</p><p>It has turned into an industry. These websites, instead of just pitting you and three or four buddies against each other, pit you against millions of other players. And the allure is that you get a quick payout and you know the stakes are high. If you win, then you get these million high-money dollar payouts.</p><p>The problem is that you have to come up with a line-up of players that is better than everyone else's line-up. And if you are competing against someone who has some inside information, who is an employee of one these companies and knows from a bunch of aggregate algorithms who the best players are to pick, well, that's not fair.</p><p>So these companies had previously had a rule that their own employees couldn't compete on their own sites but their employees just went and competed on another site, maybe using some of that inside information. It hasn't been proven yet.</p><p>But the truth is we'll never know because, right now, this is not regulated. There's no oversight. All we have are the companies saying, no, no, no, everything's fine, nothing to see here. And with all the money changing hands, people think, maybe that's not the best approach.</p><p>SOARES: Absolutely. You're talking about the money changing hands as you bet, as you pick your team.</p><p>But we're also talking about a lot of advertising money that goes behind these companies really, doesn't it?</p><p>NICHOLS: Well, it's a tremendous amount of money. A lot of sports networks, it seems, just from watching them, that these websites are paying up to 30 percent to 40 percent of their advertising budget -- sports teams.</p><p>The NFL doesn't have any kind official deal with these websites but many sports teams have marketing deals with them. I believe 29 of the 32 NFL teams do. The NBA has an actual investment in one of these websites. Major League Baseball has an actual investment in one these websites.</p><p>So the problem is these websites need oversight but there are some very powerful figures in the world of sports -- the NBA, Major League Baseball -- that maybe don't have the interest in getting them regulated.</p><p>Well, that's a big conflict, right?</p><p>SOARES: Oh, absolutely, which begs the question, many people would say, look, this is getting close to online gambling. This, of course, is legal.</p><p>So how do you go on to regulate these sites like this, Rachel?</p><p>NICHOLS: It's a great question because, look, the United States is a little different than a lot of countries in Europe, where online gambling is completely acceptable. But here in the U.S., online gambling was outlawed. There was a rule passed in Congress, a law passed in 2006. But it had a loophole. That was back when it was just most people with their college friends for a couple hundred bucks.</p><p>And so Congress decided, hey, we don't want to get involved in regulating that. So there was a loophole in that 2006 legislation against online gambling.</p><p>Well, now it's turned into not just you and your friends. It's turned into what appears to be gambling to a lot of the naked eye, that judgment test.</p><p>And the question is, will Congress take steps to close the loophole if individual sporting organizations don't?</p><p>There is a Democratic representative from New Jersey, who has said that he wants to take another look at this. But we also have powerful lobbyists in Washington, D.C., from all these sports franchises, from these websites, that are going to try to convince other congressmen and senators not to look at it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Rachel Nichols there.</p><p>Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a stark warning from the International Monetary Fund. Global growth at its worst level since the financial crisis. We'll tell you why -- just ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:30:00] SOARES: Hello, I'm Isa Soares. Coming up on the next half hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" the UAE's economy minister tells us why his country will rise and fall with the rest of the world.</p><p>And shiny Rolexes and tailored suits - the former president of the U.N.

Secretary General Jens Soltenberg said the violations do not appear to have been accidental and that ISIS may not be the primary target of Russian airstrikes in neighboring Syria.</p><p>He told CNN that Russian activity in the region is increasing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: We have seen a substantial military buildup by Russia in Syria, both in the air with combat planes and air defense systems but also an increasing number of ground troops.</p><p>In addition to that, they have deployed naval assets - a large number naval assets - close to the Syrian shores. And they continue to do so. I'm not able to provide any exact numbers but they have increased their military presence very much over the last weeks.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Meanwhile, Turkey's president says NATO airspace must not be violated. Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkish relations with Russia would be jeopardized if the incursions continue.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:35:00] RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT, VIA INTERPRETER: An attack against Turkey is an attack against NATO. I want people to know that. We know our relationship with Russia. But if Russia wants to lose Turkey as a friend with whom it has a great cooperation, then Russia will lose a lot of things. Russia needs to know that.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Palestinian authorities President Palestinian authorities President Mahmoud Abbas says he does not want an escalation of violence with Israel as days of unrest threaten to spiral out of control. Palestinian protestors clashed again with Israeli forces in the West Bank.</p><p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 90 Palestinians were hurt. Israel's military says it has no report of injuries.</p><p>Return you now to business news and the weakest global growth since the financial crisis. That's not my assessment, that's what the IMF is warning of as it cuts its forecast once again.</p><p>It now believes the world economy will grow 3.1 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2016. The IMF says the following, \"The holy grail robust growth and synchronized growth remains elusive. Market volatility and the depreciation of China's currency is fueling uncertainty.\"</p><p>On top of that, falling commodity prices hit emerging economies particularly hard. Now although oil prices spiked 5 percent on Tuesday, it's still down around 40 percent also over the past year.</p><p>Take a look at how it's fallen, and there you go. You see really what we have seen in terms of Brent crude for the past two weeks. It's been extremely, extremely volatile.</p><p>Well the UAE's economy minister says his economy will grow 3 1/2 percent this year. That's largely thanks to diversification, away from things like oil.</p><p>Sultan Al Mansouri told our emerging markets editor John Defterios there are still some factors though they just can't control.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SULTAN BIN SAEED AL MANSOURI, UAE MINISTER OF ECONOMY: With the UAE I think we have spent the 3 1/2 percent is based on that other economies are not growing. And of course we are very much export-oriented nation, whether it is oil or other products.</p><p>And definitely if the other nations start to grow, we will grow with it. If not, we will also be affected more. I do believe that the UAE also have the tools and the abilities and we have seen that during the crisis 2008 to turn around, open new markets, diversify the economy more, including of course the Islamic economy, introduction into the UAE economy and creating a niche for the UAE and for the world - for the Islamic world and the world also.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: You know, I've covered this region for about a quarter century. I don' think I've seen as much dislocation now, even going back to the first Gulf War.</p><p>How do you protect the role as a safe haven? It's a very fine line where people start to panic - pull money out of the banks, move away from the Middle East.</p><p>AL MANSOURI: History, history. The UAE if you look at it during (AUDIO GAP) crisis where it was the Iran/Iraq war or the Kuwait crisis, the Iraq situation and eventually many other crises that the whole region went through, the UAE came up with really flying colors when it comes to supporting and standing behind the issue of stability in the region and - number one of course the UAE.</p><p>And also that's an example for the others that the UAE really sustained its policy of stability and the leadership --- where they promise, they deliver.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: You have a very tough job right now. I mean, $50 oil or less cuts your revenues in half. That is extremely painful and this could be the new normal. Are you OK riding this storm out as the Gulf countries fight for their market share?</p><p>Can this economy withstand?</p><p>AL MANSOURI: Absolutely, because we are just - you know, remember - the UAE has been able to grow over the years in many directions including of course diversification of the economy.</p><p>And oil only contributes less than 50 percent of the GDP of the UAE.</p><p>And hence the effect of that is not as big as so many other countries. But also in a way it give us a strong message that has been passed by the leadership, and that is continue with your diversification, use the oil resources and then if it comes out as someday oil will not be here, so we are ever ready to grow and develop a proper (ph) economy.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Fuel prices have gone up 20 percent, you're looking at introducing a VAT, power prices have gone up substantially. Is this the new reality?</p><p>AL MANSOURI: (AUDIO GAP) International prices has been affected of course on reality of the prices as a whole around the world including of course the UAE.</p><p>And hence this is why we took this step which is really important that were a bit worried about in the beginning. But it has proven to be acceptable by the masses of people which is really excellent.</p><p>And now I think many other nations around us and the GCC are looking at what the UAE has done on this.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:40:05] SOARES: We showed you how European markets fared today. I want to show you how U.S. stocks ended the day. And mostly they ended pretty mixed after what we've seen as two days of strong gains.</p><p>Have a look at the Dow. They've eked out about 13 points or so -- a rise. But what a comparison that is to what we've seen the last two days both on Monday as well. On Friday, really strong gains.</p><p>Now the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ both finished lower. Shares of Yum! brands are down around 16 percent - that's in after-hours trading. Yum! owns brands such as - that you know very well - Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell.</p><p>They warned of disappointment sales in China and then cut its forecast there for the rest of the year. Many companies obviously still concerned about China and slowing growth there.</p><p>Well still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" luxury watches, fine clothes - allegedly the price of influence at the United Nations.</p><p>A U.S. attorney says the former president of the U.N. General Assembly sold himself and the global institution he led. More when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES: Welcome back to \"Quest Means Business.\" Now, the former president of the United Nations General Assembly has been arrested and charged with taking more than $1 million in bribes. U.S. attorneys in New York said John Ash was given Rolexes, Spokes suits and even a private basketball - a basketball court - in exchange for favors at the U.N.'s biggest event.</p><p>Our senior U.N. correspondent Richard Roth joins me now to explain the details of all this. And, Richard, this is pretty damning.</p><p>If he was receiving all this money and bribes, the question is what was he offering in exchange? Because as we know, nothing is free these days.</p><p>RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT: That's right. What he was offering according to federal prosecutors was he was given the money to help set up a conference center on Macaw, there were other Chinese business officials who were arrested along with the president - former president - of the General Assembly today in New York, John Ash.</p><p>He was the president of the General Assembly two years ago. Largely ceremonial posts, but definitely with some influence. This is what the U.S. attorney said at a press conference a few hours ago about the level of bribes he received.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PREET BHARARA, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR MANHATTAN: So what did these bribers do for Ash, the then-U.N. General Assembly president.</p><p>First, they gave him money, lots of it. From 2011 to 2014, they allegedly transferred over a million dollars in cash and in wire transfers to Ash's bank accounts in New York, often in installments of up to $200,000 or $300,000 at a time.</p><p>[16:45:16] As alleged, Ash spent this cash lavishly on himself and on his family -- $59,000 on a single order of custom tailored suits, $54,000 for a pair of Rolex watches and $40,000 to lease a new BMW.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROTH: And as you mentioned, there was a $30,000 basketball court at his suburban in Dobbs Ferry, New York. And that is where he was arrested at 6 a.m. today.</p><p>It is an astounding development for the U.N., a real thunderbolt coming just days after the 70th anniversary hoopla of the U.N. Isa.</p><p>SOARES: Absolutely. And you said, Richard, this is mostly a ceremonial role, but nevertheless highly embarrassing for the U.N.</p><p>So what is the U.N. saying about this? Is it commenting on it?</p><p>ROTH: They're saying they're shocked and sad. And the secretary- general through his spokesman said how disturbed he was. And even the man who now has the job the alleged corrupt John Ash has, the president of the General Assembly, someone from Denmark said that if proven, this is an attack at the very heart of the integrity of the U.N.</p><p>He had just learned of it like all the U.N. officials this morning, Isa.</p><p>SOARES: Richard Roth there for us in New York. Thanks very much, Richard.</p><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" the world's biggest tech companies are looking to space as they race to bring internet access to the entire globe. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES: Facebook has just announced its first project to deliver the internet from space - you heard it right. It is the latest move in a new technology race that's gripping many of the world's biggest tech companies.</p><p>The race really is to connect billions of people who don't have - yet have - access to the Web. Our Claire Sebastian reports on the challenges as well as the opportunities of this new frontier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER: This is the AMOS-6, Facebook's latest salvo in the race to bring the internet to the entire world.</p><p>Facebook has partnered with French telecoms company Eutelsat to share all the broadband of the AMOS-6 satellite.</p><p>[16:50:04] You can see here the bits of dark orange are exactly where this particular satellite covers. Now take a look at the exact same map, this shows internet usage in Africa, the darker colors are the higher number of users.</p><p>So you can see just how sparse it is. Put all that together and the need for this technology is very clear.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We believe that connectivity is a human right.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The AMOS-6 is the latest feature of a broader Facebook-led initiative called internet.org, a project that connects the 4 billion people globally who still have no internet access.</p><p>Behind the altruistic campaign is a clear business message.</p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, EURASIA GROUP: If you're telling me that you're going to connect a billion people into Facebook that potentially didn't have it before, it's great that those people will have that access, but this isn't like water, right?</p><p>I mean, this is something that you're absolutely going to be able to monetize and I suspect that the people that are holding Facebook shares that want to be optimistic about Facebook will be looking at this very carefully.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The challenge of connecting remote areas like Africa has galvanized Silicon Valley into action. Google is building more than 1,000 kilometers of fiber for broadband in Uganda and Ghana, an initiative known as Project Link.</p><p>And Microsoft is exploiting a new technology - the gaps between TV channels, unused spectrum known as white space.</p><p>BREMMER: We think TV white space is the type of technology that can help to get that last few billion people in the world connected.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Still, in the quest to provide internet access to that last few billion, space is emerging as a leading candidate.</p><p>Elan Musk's SpaceX will be launching the AMOS-6 and that's alongside Musk's own plan to launch a network of 4,000 broadband satellites within five years.</p><p>In June Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic also announced it was funding SpaceX rival OneWeb to create a similar network.</p><p>BREMMER: In the internet space, we've moved very, very fast over the course of the past years. I expect that's only going to speed up and right now this is the big shiny object we should be talking about it.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Facebook's big shiny object is still under construction, set to launch next year - a small step towards a new frontier for the Worldwide Web.</p><p>Claire Sebastian, CNN New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Now to the world this world (ph) idea. Now the British businessman Ashish Thakkar is among those lobbying for internet access for all.</p><p>He's the author of \"The Lion Awakes\" and told Richard that the African economy is stirring from its slumber.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ASHISH THAKKAR, AUTHOR, \"THE LION AWAKES\" AND FOUNDER, MARA GROUP: We do have real opportunities and they are waiting to be tapped.</p><p>I mean, there's a lot of - I mean, our businesses are kind of growing extremely well across the continent. So it just proves that there are things happening.</p><p>Yes, there are challenges, but that increases the entry level barrier and therefore the opportunities' even that much more.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW: I suggest to you that what happens is people become so subsumed and rosy and misty-eyed about the opportunities, but they don't deal with issues like corruption, transparency, the rule of law, anti-gay laws.</p><p>All these things that are to some extent prevalent or present in different countries in Africa. They don't deal with these because everybody's so busy thinking about the latest bank or the latest telecoms.</p><p>THAKKAR: I disagree. I think these issues are being addressed. I advise a few heads of state - I'm on the Global Agenda Council for Africa for the World Economic Forum - I am seeing it firsthand.</p><p>Every single day that the continent is transforming, there's more governance, there's more transparency coming into the system.</p><p>Again, I can't generally - generalize - it positively the way we can't generalize it negatively. There are parts of the continent which are truly being transformed.</p><p>QUEST: Why am I more pessimistic than you?</p><p>THAKKAR: Because you haven't spent enough time there. I think seeing it is believing it. Actually seeing the opportunities -</p><p>QUEST: Seeing what?</p><p>THAKKAR: The continent's opportunities, the countries meeting the government officials and seeing what kind of passion they have about transforming their country.</p><p>President Ka -</p><p>QUEST: Seeing a variety of countries that couldn't deal with an Ebola crisis - that let it get completely out of control.</p><p>THAKKAR: But that was three countries out of the 54 countries which have been affected by Ebola.</p><p>QUEST: You see, that's the problem with this - with your argument. It's always 'that was this country,' 'that was Nigeria,' 'that was this' -</p><p>THAKKAR: No, but Nigeria fought Ebola and cleared it but it's never been celebrated because they did fight it and clear it. Like Nigeria had peaceful free and fair democratic elections. Why isn't it talked about? Because they were peaceful, free and fair.</p><p>That's the issue.</p><p>QUEST: They were talked about.</p><p>THAKKAR: Not enough, not enough. And everybody expected the result to be different, yet the it was a peaceful, free and fair and we're going to have an amazing transformation in the country.</p><p>But no one talks about that. And that's the issue we have.</p><p>QUEST: South Africa's economy is in a terrible state. Have you looked at the electricity, the provision of supply and energy - it's appalling.</p><p>THAKKAR: South Africa's growth is a lot slower than the rest of the continent - I agree. And that's why our group is -</p><p>QUEST: But isn't that a classic example of mismanagement of an economy that used - that was in very good stead?</p><p>THAKKAR: But that is a classic example of again being generalized. That one county has that issue - and I agree. There's a few countries like that. But we are a continent, Richard, and that's where it keeps on going wrong.</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST: With respect, you seem to only what to generalize when it's positive in your book. You don't want to generalize the moment it becomes something more critical.</p><p>THAKKAR: No, because it's a one-sided story right now. And this is why I'm trying to give you a real story of what I have been living every day.</p><p>QUEST: So what does Africa need if it's going to reach its potential?</p><p>THAKKAR: In my opinion, I think we've had enough. We don't need the pity, we don't need people to feel sorry for us. What we need is investment, we need partners and we need to do trade. We don't need aid.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Very heated discussion there. If you're an African, let us know your thoughts. Why don't you tweet Richard rather than me I should say. @richardquest is his Twitter account.</p><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" he's scored more goals than any other player in history. Next, Pele tells me that modern- day footballers have a very different goal in mind. What that is, just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES: We told you earlier how money's affecting fantasy sports and it's no secret how it affects the real game as well.</p><p>Pele says modern-day players are only concerned with getting paid. I sat down with him at a new exhibition in London devoted to his life.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Have players lost their passion for the game?</p><p>PELE, RETIRED BRAZILIAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER: The player has lost his passion for his country, for his club. But for football itself? No. He'll continue to play and have passion for it.</p><p>But nobody is loyal to a single club anymore. Now they play for the country or club that pays the most money.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[17:00:00] SOARES: And you can see my full interview with Pele in around half an hour from now on World Sport, only here on CNN.</p><p>And that does it for \"Quest Means Business.\" I'm Isa Soares.

It is Tuesday, October the 6th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SOARES (voice-over): Tonight, Edward Snowden celebrates as Europe cracks down on American tech firms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">France's prime minister says the attacks on Air France bosses could leave the country's reputation in tatters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And if it's a real fraud, is this just fantasy? Two sports gaming sites caught in a gambling controversy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Isa Soares and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES: A very good evening to you.</p><p>Tonight, Edward Snowden hails a landmark decision that may change the way tech companies do business on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Court of Justice has thrown out an agreement that allows businesses to transfer data on European users to the U.S.</p><p>Now Snowden, his revelations about U.S. government surveillance set off the legal fight, praised the court. This is his tweet. This is what he had to say.</p><p>\"This is the second time in as many years the world has rallied upon the Court of Justice of European Union to defend digital rights,\" he said. \"Thank you, Europe.\" Those were his words.</p><p>Well, the so-called safe harbor law was set up back in 2000. What it did, it allowed American firms to store European data in the U.S., removing the need for extra data centers right here in Europe.</p><p>In its ruling, the European court said it was worried that data could be subject to, quote, \"mass indiscriminate surveillance as well as interception.\" Now companies may be forced to make their service more secure or even move into Europe.</p><p>On top of that individual member states are now required to investigate complaints on their own and could impose additional bans.</p><p>So you can see how this is all shaping up. And it could be made particularly onerous for the 4,400 companies both big and small that are covered by safe harbor laws.</p><p>Speaking after the ruling was announced, European Commission vice president Frans Timmermans said work to strengthen private protections would continue. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANS TIMMERMANS, EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE PRESIDENT: In the meantime trans-Atlantic data flows between companies can continue using other mechanisms for international transfers of personal data available under E.U. data protection law.</p><p>Our priorities as commissioner are, first of all the protection of personal data transferred across the Atlantic; secondly, the continuation of trans-Atlantic data, flows which are important for our economy with adequate safeguards; thirdly, the uniform application of E.U. law in the internal market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: To put all this all into perspective for us is our business correspondent, Samuel Burke.</p><p>And Samuel, this pact has basically existed for 15 years.</p><p>So why change it now?</p><p>And more importantly, why is this a big deal?</p><p>Explain to viewers around the world why it matters to them.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What we have is a perfect situation here, a European on one side of this table and an American on the other side of the table because what we are seeing here is a real divergence in the way Americans are handling privacy, treating it more as a consumer protection.</p><p>And the way you that you guys, the Europeans are treating it, more as a civil right. And we're seeing this over and over again in the courts. We're seeing it in rules and laws. And we're seeing it in how governments are approaching this.</p><p>This is part of a bigger picture that's happening here in Europe. I want to just put up on the screen where we can see this, the right to be forgotten. Remember, Google now has to comply with each local regulator.</p><p>If somebody doesn't like a Google result, they can go to their local regulator and say I want it removed. We even have reports of Germany considering building its own Internet. They're, of course, upset about some of the reports that they have heard about Americans spying allegedly.</p><p>So maybe their own Internet to protect them. And now this safe harbor agreement ruled invalid. So what this means is a lot like the Google situation. People will now have to go to their local regulator.</p><p>That's what it's going to mean for each of these companies. Each country in Europe will now have a say over how their data is handled. So if you're a German citizen, you're upset, you might go to the German regulators and say I want this change and now all those companies are going to have to comply with that.</p><p>But this picture you're painting, it means it's going to be a bureaucratic nightmare, just red tape after red tape in every single country. For the big companies we've been talking about, the big tech giants, they have the financial means.</p><p>What about the small companies? What do they do?</p><p>I've been talking to analysts all day long who say, oh, you guys on television, in the news you're talking about Facebook, Google, Twitter. They all have the money to deal with this.</p><p>Some of them will find ways to get around it, in some ways but they also find ways to comply with it with their lawyers. If you're a small company in the U.S. like many of these small businesses we profile on CNN and you've just set up shop in Europe, can you imagine --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>BURKE: -- dealing with a regulator in Germany, in Austria, in the U.K.?</p><p>It's going to be a real headache for those people.</p><p>I want to just read you what Facebook said in their statement because I think it really summed it up really quite well.</p><p>They said, \"This case is not about Facebook,\" even though it was originally about Facebook but they're right.</p><p>\"The advocate general himself said that Facebook has done nothing wrong. What is at issue is one of the mechanisms that European law provides to enable essential trans-Atlantic data flows.\"</p><p>So Facebook is right. Yes, the case was specifically about them but it applies to everybody. For the moment, data's going to keep on flowing from Europe to the United States. But we're in a gray zone right now. In the coming weeks and coming months, each country with their own set of regulations.</p><p>SOARES: Samuel Burke, putting it into context for us; as always, great job. Thanks very much, Samuel.</p><p>Now Vera Jourova is the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. She told me the ruling was not a surprise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE: The ruling of the court, which was announced today, in fact, was not a big surprise for the commission because it confirmed we need to negotiate a better and safer system for the protection of data of European citizens when the data is transferred to the United States.</p><p>SOARES: The understanding is, the analysis seems to be, that with this, with the suspension of safe harbor then that will impact the economy, in particular hurt small and medium-size companies.</p><p>What is your view on this?</p><p>JOUROVA: Yes. Of course, we have a specific system for transfer of data between E.U. and U.S. for a very good purpose, because there is a very large scope of data transferring between business to business. We have 4,400 companies subscribed under the safe harbor system.</p><p>So what do we need to do now is to provide clear guidance for the companies, what to do under the changed legal conditions. And what they should do, of course, they will have to comply with the rules provided for in the current directive for data protection.</p><p>SOARES: What would this new guidance, this new framework, what would that look like?</p><p>JOUROVA: Well, the guidance will refer to the existing rules, which, as I said are coming from the directive. So it means that companies will have to make agreements, the contracts with the special clause on data protection.</p><p>Or they would or should have the binding corporate rules in case we speak about corporations which are based in E.U. and U.S. at the same time.</p><p>And there are some other rules which can be applied. Simply said, now without having safe harbor, there will be other mechanisms used.</p><p>Commissioner, many may say that this is just another sign of Europe being unfriendly to the big tech companies.</p><p>What do you have to say to that?</p><p>JOUROVA: Well, I don't want to speak about what's friendly or unfriendly. Our main duty is to ensure very high standard of the protection of the data of European citizens when the data is transferred to third countries, which is the case of European -- of the United States.</p><p>And the second big priority for me is now to make sure that the businesses will know the conditions under which they will continue transferring the data.</p><p>And I must say that I find this as a very strong commitment on our side because the companies act in good faith and we need to help them to overcome this, let's say, difficult moment.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, an attack on Air France bosses is an attack on France's reputation. The French prime minister vows to crack down on violent protesters. We're live in Paris, just ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[16:10:00]</p><p>SOARES: France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls says Monday's attack on Air France executives has damaged his country's reputation right around the world.</p><p>Furious protesters ripped the shirts off the backs of HR bosses after the company revealed plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs. Several executives needed help from security staff to flee the crowds.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): As you can see there, some climbed those fences to try to get away. Air France said the majority of demonstrators were peaceful. Manuel Valls visited the airline's headquarters on Tuesday and said those responsible will be brought to account.</p><p>MANUEL VALLS, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Nothing can justify such acts. These acts are the work of thugs. The criminal justice system will have to identify those who behaved with such unspeakable violence.</p><p>Violence is unacceptable in our society. It has to be condemned. And those who perpetrated such acts should be severely punished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Now it's not the first time we've seen things turn nasty at French labor protests. Take a look at some of these examples. These are Goodyear protests. Goodyear employees, who feared job cuts, set tires on fire and then clashed with officers back in 2013. That's actually near Paris.</p><p>When those cuts were announced the following year, the workers held two executives hostage for two days.</p><p>But it doesn't stop here. In another case of boss-napping, as it's called, workers detained a 3M factory director for more than 24 hours in a spat over severance pay in 2009.</p><p>Now after he was released, a court awarded 800,000 euros to be shared between more than 100 laid-off employees.</p><p>And if we stay in that year, also in 2009, workers in Central France rigged an auto factory booby trap and then threatened to set off explosions lest they were given the desired payouts.</p><p>You're starting to get the picture.</p><p>Christian Malard is an international diplomatic consultant. He's a very familiar voice here on the show, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Christian, always good to have you on the show. We've seen the protests taking place in France the last few days, some of them pretty heated and combative.</p><p>Do you think they'll make any difference when it comes to reaching an agreement?</p><p>CHRISTIAN MALARD, INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC CONSULTANT: Well, you have to understand, Isa, that Air France is a company which has been undergoing for weeks and years now a lot of crisis but now we come to a peak with 2,900 jobs which are going to be suppressed by the chairman, by the company.</p><p>So on the one hand you have a company which has been doing great in the past with a lot of privileges for the employees but the timing, the world has changed. The world has modernized. And it seems that the company has not been following all this.</p><p>So we need to really reform this company like we need to reform the country in France, economically speaking. And a lot of the employees are just mad at the way the chairman of the company has been managing it. So it's clear that the situation is going to harden in the future. It seems that the social dialogue in this country --</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>MALARD: -- is broken. Let's say two months before regional elections and 17 months before presidential elections, it seems that the crisis is going to go up and up. And the unions are not helping.</p><p>When the prime minister -- you probably put it on the CNN on air -- when the prime minister qualified a part of the demonstrators as thugs, I think he is right.</p><p>Not all the people who have been trying to attack the Air France people, the representative of the company, are steward or stewardesses or pilots. It seems like the word, \"thugs,\" used by the prime minister Valls is the right things. So the situation is seriously deteriorating.</p><p>SOARES: And Christian, I mean, the prime minister basically said the images of the protests, he said, hurts our economy. Those were his words.</p><p>How damaging do you think this can be for the French economy?</p><p>MALARD: Well, Air France is representing France. It's something very important, Air France. And definitely when the French president says it's damaging the image and the reputation of the country, on this he is right.</p><p>But I think the economy of this country has been handled the wrong way. I think President Hollande has been responsible. He's been asking for -- putting so many promises. He made so many promises. And he didn't even all the promises. So people are very disappointed.</p><p>There is a social climate which is very bad in this country right now. And this is why you would see a lot of people has been shocked by what happened today with the Air France and they are shocked also by the way things go in this country.</p><p>The rate of unemployment has been rising and rising. And it seems to us that the government don't have any solutions. And this is why it's becoming political.</p><p>And the lead -- one of the top leader of the opposition, former President Sarkozy, used the word today, \"chienlit.\" It was a word used by General de Gaulle in 1968 when we had this social student revolution. And it seems to say in a certain way that the country is not under control anymore. And this is what we worry about here.</p><p>SOARES: So these combative feelings definitely go much deeper.</p><p>Christian Malard there for us in Paris.</p><p>Thanks very much, Christian.</p><p>We'll take a quick look at how European stocks closed the day today. Markets were led by mostly auto and oil sector stocks.</p><p>Let's look at the markets. At the end of the day, well, they finished -- well, the CAC 40 was probably the best performer at 1 percent; FTSE didn't do too bad.</p><p>But look at the Xetra DAX, that's pretty much flat. A lot of these stock prices, share markets were boosted by expectations the Fed will maintain easy monetary policy. And a lot of the big gain is there for auto shares. It's quite a turnaround from what we've seen in the last two weeks also.</p><p>Now painful cutbacks on the way at Volkswagen. That's what the company's new CEO told 20,000 employees as they gathered at the VW headquarters. Muller said massive savings. Those were the words. Are needed because of the emissions scandal.</p><p>All non-essential investments will be canceled as well as postponed. Volkswagen shares closed almost 4 percent higher today.</p><p>Well, Alan Brown is chairman of the Volkswagen National Dealer Advisory Council in the U.S. He's also partner at largest freestanding VW dealership in the country. He told Richard Quest that the brand can indeed recover. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALAN BROWN, CHAIRMAN, VOLKSWAGEN NATIONAL DEALER ADVISORY COUNCIL: Our hope and prayer as a dealer network and as a brand is that we get the fix and the fix has no interruption in fuel economy and performance on what the customer paid for on their vehicle.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST: And, I know sir, I'm taking you into speculative waters. But you must be having many clients and customers and other dealers ringing you, calling you up and saying, what if, what if people are not getting it?</p><p>What if people want their money back?</p><p>What if people say the car isn't worth as much?</p><p>These are real practical problems that you, sir, as a dealer are going to have to face.</p><p>BROWN: No, you're absolutely right. And you know every customer's need, every customer's question is going to be very specific and unique to them in that particular moment. That's what we're preparing for as a brand and as a dealer body, is how we take each one of those questions and walk down through it to make everyone feel like they've come out of the other end of this situation better than the way we went into it.</p><p>QUEST: Have you had, in terms of people coming into your showrooms, are -- do you get the feeling that people are shunning Volkswagen, at least for the time being?</p><p>BROWN: You know we have a very iconic brand here in North America. We have a very loyal customer.</p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>BROWN: The customers that I've talked with so far have been very forgiving through the process. And obviously, down here in Texas, we've got a lot of customers who are saying, hey, don't touch my car; leave it just the way it is.</p><p>QUEST: Ah. Now. Ha, ha. You've said exactly the point.</p><p>\"Don't touch my car. Leave it just the way it is.\"</p><p>Do you think that is even going to be an option for people to say \"Don't touch my car, leave it just the way it is\"?</p><p>Or effectively will those cars that aren't touched become unsellable?</p><p>BROWN: You know we don't know. And those are some of the questions, obviously, that the dealer network has.</p><p>I know those are questions that the brand is working through day and night to make sure we check all the boxes of every single question we're going to come up against but it is something that we're going to have to be prepared for.</p><p>QUEST: Finally -- and you've been very kind and very honest in dealing with this.</p><p>Finally, can the brand recover?</p><p>I suspect you'll say yes.</p><p>But how does it recover?</p><p>BROWN: Well, my immediate response is, \"Absolutely.\" We have a brand with tremendous resources. And they are, as you've seen, pouring those resources into this situation at light speed, with restructuring of management, with putting their arms around the dealer network so that we can get prepared to put the customer first through this process.</p><p>I'm very reassured and it is exciting to see that I believe, truly, this will be our finest hour and we will come out better than the way we went in.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Positive thinking there.</p><p>Still ahead right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it's a multibillion- dollar industry that trades on the imagination of its fans. It's the real world of fantasy sports. And it's been rocked by accusations of insider cheating. We'll break it down for you next.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES: Two of its biggest players in fantasy sports is staring at real trouble. DraftKings and FanDuel have had to ban employees from playing fantasy games for money. This ultra allegation they use inside information to win big.</p><p>Let me talk you through how fantasy sports works and this is how it works. Users choose a line-up and they create a team from a list of real players.</p><p>[16:25:00]</p><p>SOARES: Those players' statistics on the field are given point values and then added up to give the fantasy team a whole score.</p><p>Now on DraftKings and FanDuel, users pay to enter competitions, comparing their scores to thousands of others with a chance to win cash prizes if they come out clearly on top.</p><p>Now the allegation here is that employees at these companies could see which players were being used the most and, therefore, they placed bets using different players to increase their chances of actually winning.</p><p>In a joint statement, DraftKings and FanDuel refuted these claims. This is what they had to say.</p><p>\"Employees with access to this data are rigorously monitored by internal fraud control teams and we have no evidence that anyone has misused it.\"</p><p>Well, in the last hour, CNN has learned that the sports network, ESPN, is pulling all segments sponsored by DraftKings from its air. That's the concerns.</p><p>Well, I spoke to \"WORLD SPORT's\" Rachel Nichols and asked her to talk us through this scandal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RACHEL NICHOLS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Fantasy football probably sounds like your kid in his back yard, trying to pretend he's some big star. That's not what we're talking about here.</p><p>We're talking about an industry worth billions of dollars in revenue a year; 58 million Americans play. Fantasy football started out as a much more mom-and-pop kind of operation, the things college friends would play with each other, maybe a couple hundred bucks on the line for an entire season.</p><p>It has turned into an industry. These websites, instead of just pitting you and three or four buddies against each other, pit you against millions of other players. And the allure is that you get a quick payout and you know the stakes are high. If you win, then you get these million high-money dollar payouts.</p><p>The problem is that you have to come up with a line-up of players that is better than everyone else's line-up. And if you are competing against someone who has some inside information, who is an employee of one these companies and knows from a bunch of aggregate algorithms who the best players are to pick, well, that's not fair.</p><p>So these companies had previously had a rule that their own employees couldn't compete on their own sites but their employees just went and competed on another site, maybe using some of that inside information. It hasn't been proven yet.</p><p>But the truth is we'll never know because, right now, this is not regulated. There's no oversight. All we have are the companies saying, no, no, no, everything's fine, nothing to see here. And with all the money changing hands, people think, maybe that's not the best approach.</p><p>SOARES: Absolutely. You're talking about the money changing hands as you bet, as you pick your team.</p><p>But we're also talking about a lot of advertising money that goes behind these companies really, doesn't it?</p><p>NICHOLS: Well, it's a tremendous amount of money. A lot of sports networks, it seems, just from watching them, that these websites are paying up to 30 percent to 40 percent of their advertising budget -- sports teams.</p><p>The NFL doesn't have any kind official deal with these websites but many sports teams have marketing deals with them. I believe 29 of the 32 NFL teams do. The NBA has an actual investment in one of these websites. Major League Baseball has an actual investment in one these websites.</p><p>So the problem is these websites need oversight but there are some very powerful figures in the world of sports -- the NBA, Major League Baseball -- that maybe don't have the interest in getting them regulated.</p><p>Well, that's a big conflict, right?</p><p>SOARES: Oh, absolutely, which begs the question, many people would say, look, this is getting close to online gambling. This, of course, is legal.</p><p>So how do you go on to regulate these sites like this, Rachel?</p><p>NICHOLS: It's a great question because, look, the United States is a little different than a lot of countries in Europe, where online gambling is completely acceptable. But here in the U.S., online gambling was outlawed. There was a rule passed in Congress, a law passed in 2006. But it had a loophole. That was back when it was just most people with their college friends for a couple hundred bucks.</p><p>And so Congress decided, hey, we don't want to get involved in regulating that. So there was a loophole in that 2006 legislation against online gambling.</p><p>Well, now it's turned into not just you and your friends. It's turned into what appears to be gambling to a lot of the naked eye, that judgment test.</p><p>And the question is, will Congress take steps to close the loophole if individual sporting organizations don't?</p><p>There is a Democratic representative from New Jersey, who has said that he wants to take another look at this. But we also have powerful lobbyists in Washington, D.C., from all these sports franchises, from these websites, that are going to try to convince other congressmen and senators not to look at it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Rachel Nichols there.</p><p>Still to come right here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a stark warning from the International Monetary Fund. Global growth at its worst level since the financial crisis. We'll tell you why -- just ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[16:30:00] SOARES: Hello, I'm Isa Soares.

Secretary General Jens Soltenberg said the violations do not appear to have been accidental and that ISIS may not be the primary target of Russian airstrikes in neighboring Syria.</p><p>He told CNN that Russian activity in the region is increasing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: We have seen a substantial military buildup by Russia in Syria, both in the air with combat planes and air defense systems but also an increasing number of ground troops.</p><p>In addition to that, they have deployed naval assets - a large number naval assets - close to the Syrian shores. And they continue to do so. I'm not able to provide any exact numbers but they have increased their military presence very much over the last weeks.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Meanwhile, Turkey's president says NATO airspace must not be violated. Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkish relations with Russia would be jeopardized if the incursions continue.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:35:00] RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT, VIA INTERPRETER: An attack against Turkey is an attack against NATO. I want people to know that. We know our relationship with Russia. But if Russia wants to lose Turkey as a friend with whom it has a great cooperation, then Russia will lose a lot of things. Russia needs to know that.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Palestinian authorities President Palestinian authorities President Mahmoud Abbas says he does not want an escalation of violence with Israel as days of unrest threaten to spiral out of control. Palestinian protestors clashed again with Israeli forces in the West Bank.</p><p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 90 Palestinians were hurt. Israel's military says it has no report of injuries.</p><p>Return you now to business news and the weakest global growth since the financial crisis. That's not my assessment, that's what the IMF is warning of as it cuts its forecast once again.</p><p>It now believes the world economy will grow 3.1 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2016. The IMF says the following, \"The holy grail robust growth and synchronized growth remains elusive. Market volatility and the depreciation of China's currency is fueling uncertainty.\"</p><p>On top of that, falling commodity prices hit emerging economies particularly hard. Now although oil prices spiked 5 percent on Tuesday, it's still down around 40 percent also over the past year.</p><p>Take a look at how it's fallen, and there you go. You see really what we have seen in terms of Brent crude for the past two weeks. It's been extremely, extremely volatile.</p><p>Well the UAE's economy minister says his economy will grow 3 1/2 percent this year. That's largely thanks to diversification, away from things like oil.</p><p>Sultan Al Mansouri told our emerging markets editor John Defterios there are still some factors though they just can't control.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SULTAN BIN SAEED AL MANSOURI, UAE MINISTER OF ECONOMY: With the UAE I think we have spent the 3 1/2 percent is based on that other economies are not growing. And of course we are very much export-oriented nation, whether it is oil or other products.</p><p>And definitely if the other nations start to grow, we will grow with it. If not, we will also be affected more. I do believe that the UAE also have the tools and the abilities and we have seen that during the crisis 2008 to turn around, open new markets, diversify the economy more, including of course the Islamic economy, introduction into the UAE economy and creating a niche for the UAE and for the world - for the Islamic world and the world also.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: You know, I've covered this region for about a quarter century. I don' think I've seen as much dislocation now, even going back to the first Gulf War.</p><p>How do you protect the role as a safe haven? It's a very fine line where people start to panic - pull money out of the banks, move away from the Middle East.</p><p>AL MANSOURI: History, history. The UAE if you look at it during (AUDIO GAP) crisis where it was the Iran/Iraq war or the Kuwait crisis, the Iraq situation and eventually many other crises that the whole region went through, the UAE came up with really flying colors when it comes to supporting and standing behind the issue of stability in the region and - number one of course the UAE.</p><p>And also that's an example for the others that the UAE really sustained its policy of stability and the leadership --- where they promise, they deliver.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: You have a very tough job right now. I mean, $50 oil or less cuts your revenues in half. That is extremely painful and this could be the new normal. Are you OK riding this storm out as the Gulf countries fight for their market share?</p><p>Can this economy withstand?</p><p>AL MANSOURI: Absolutely, because we are just - you know, remember - the UAE has been able to grow over the years in many directions including of course diversification of the economy.</p><p>And oil only contributes less than 50 percent of the GDP of the UAE.</p><p>And hence the effect of that is not as big as so many other countries. But also in a way it give us a strong message that has been passed by the leadership, and that is continue with your diversification, use the oil resources and then if it comes out as someday oil will not be here, so we are ever ready to grow and develop a proper (ph) economy.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Fuel prices have gone up 20 percent, you're looking at introducing a VAT, power prices have gone up substantially. Is this the new reality?</p><p>AL MANSOURI: (AUDIO GAP) International prices has been affected of course on reality of the prices as a whole around the world including of course the UAE.</p><p>And hence this is why we took this step which is really important that were a bit worried about in the beginning. But it has proven to be acceptable by the masses of people which is really excellent.</p><p>And now I think many other nations around us and the GCC are looking at what the UAE has done on this.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:40:05] SOARES: We showed you how European markets fared today. I want to show you how U.S. stocks ended the day. And mostly they ended pretty mixed after what we've seen as two days of strong gains.</p><p>Have a look at the Dow. They've eked out about 13 points or so -- a rise. But what a comparison that is to what we've seen the last two days both on Monday as well. On Friday, really strong gains.</p><p>Now the S&amp;P500 and the NASDAQ both finished lower. Shares of Yum! brands are down around 16 percent - that's in after-hours trading. Yum! owns brands such as - that you know very well - Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell.</p><p>They warned of disappointment sales in China and then cut its forecast there for the rest of the year. Many companies obviously still concerned about China and slowing growth there.</p><p>Well still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" luxury watches, fine clothes - allegedly the price of influence at the United Nations.</p><p>A U.S. attorney says the former president of the U.N. General Assembly sold himself and the global institution he led. More when we return.</p><p>SOARES: Welcome back to \"Quest Means Business.\" Now, the former president of the United Nations General Assembly has been arrested and charged with taking more than $1 million in bribes. U.S. attorneys in New York said John Ash was given Rolexes, Spokes suits and even a private basketball - a basketball court - in exchange for favors at the U.N.'s biggest event.</p><p>Our senior U.N. correspondent Richard Roth joins me now to explain the details of all this. And, Richard, this is pretty damning.</p><p>If he was receiving all this money and bribes, the question is what was he offering in exchange? Because as we know, nothing is free these days.</p><p>RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT: That's right. What he was offering according to federal prosecutors was he was given the money to help set up a conference center on Macaw, there were other Chinese business officials who were arrested along with the president - former president - of the General Assembly today in New York, John Ash.</p><p>He was the president of the General Assembly two years ago. Largely ceremonial posts, but definitely with some influence. This is what the U.S. attorney said at a press conference a few hours ago about the level of bribes he received.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PREET BHARARA, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR MANHATTAN: So what did these bribers do for Ash, the then-U.N. General Assembly president.</p><p>First, they gave him money, lots of it. From 2011 to 2014, they allegedly transferred over a million dollars in cash and in wire transfers to Ash's bank accounts in New York, often in installments of up to $200,000 or $300,000 at a time.</p><p>[16:45:16] As alleged, Ash spent this cash lavishly on himself and on his family -- $59,000 on a single order of custom tailored suits, $54,000 for a pair of Rolex watches and $40,000 to lease a new BMW.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROTH: And as you mentioned, there was a $30,000 basketball court at his suburban in Dobbs Ferry, New York. And that is where he was arrested at 6 a.m. today.</p><p>It is an astounding development for the U.N., a real thunderbolt coming just days after the 70th anniversary hoopla of the U.N. Isa.</p><p>SOARES: Absolutely. And you said, Richard, this is mostly a ceremonial role, but nevertheless highly embarrassing for the U.N.</p><p>So what is the U.N. saying about this? Is it commenting on it?</p><p>ROTH: They're saying they're shocked and sad. And the secretary- general through his spokesman said how disturbed he was. And even the man who now has the job the alleged corrupt John Ash has, the president of the General Assembly, someone from Denmark said that if proven, this is an attack at the very heart of the integrity of the U.N.</p><p>He had just learned of it like all the U.N. officials this morning, Isa.</p><p>SOARES: Richard Roth there for us in New York. Thanks very much, Richard.</p><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" the world's biggest tech companies are looking to space as they race to bring internet access to the entire globe. That's next.</p><p>SOARES: Facebook has just announced its first project to deliver the internet from space - you heard it right. It is the latest move in a new technology race that's gripping many of the world's biggest tech companies.</p><p>The race really is to connect billions of people who don't have - yet have - access to the Web. Our Claire Sebastian reports on the challenges as well as the opportunities of this new frontier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER: This is the AMOS-6, Facebook's latest salvo in the race to bring the internet to the entire world.</p><p>Facebook has partnered with French telecoms company Eutelsat to share all the broadband of the AMOS-6 satellite.</p><p>[16:50:04] You can see here the bits of dark orange are exactly where this particular satellite covers. Now take a look at the exact same map, this shows internet usage in Africa, the darker colors are the higher number of users.</p><p>So you can see just how sparse it is. Put all that together and the need for this technology is very clear.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We believe that connectivity is a human right.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The AMOS-6 is the latest feature of a broader Facebook-led initiative called internet.org, a project that connects the 4 billion people globally who still have no internet access.</p><p>Behind the altruistic campaign is a clear business message.</p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, EURASIA GROUP: If you're telling me that you're going to connect a billion people into Facebook that potentially didn't have it before, it's great that those people will have that access, but this isn't like water, right?</p><p>I mean, this is something that you're absolutely going to be able to monetize and I suspect that the people that are holding Facebook shares that want to be optimistic about Facebook will be looking at this very carefully.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The challenge of connecting remote areas like Africa has galvanized Silicon Valley into action. Google is building more than 1,000 kilometers of fiber for broadband in Uganda and Ghana, an initiative known as Project Link.</p><p>And Microsoft is exploiting a new technology - the gaps between TV channels, unused spectrum known as white space.</p><p>BREMMER: We think TV white space is the type of technology that can help to get that last few billion people in the world connected.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Still, in the quest to provide internet access to that last few billion, space is emerging as a leading candidate.</p><p>Elan Musk's SpaceX will be launching the AMOS-6 and that's alongside Musk's own plan to launch a network of 4,000 broadband satellites within five years.</p><p>In June Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic also announced it was funding SpaceX rival OneWeb to create a similar network.</p><p>BREMMER: In the internet space, we've moved very, very fast over the course of the past years. I expect that's only going to speed up and right now this is the big shiny object we should be talking about it.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Facebook's big shiny object is still under construction, set to launch next year - a small step towards a new frontier for the Worldwide Web.</p><p>Claire Sebastian, CNNNew York.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Now to the world this world (ph) idea. Now the British businessman Ashish Thakkar is among those lobbying for internet access for all.</p><p>He's the author of \"The Lion Awakes\" and told Richard that the African economy is stirring from its slumber.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ASHISH THAKKAR, AUTHOR, \"THE LION AWAKES\" AND FOUNDER, MARA GROUP: We do have real opportunities and they are waiting to be tapped.</p><p>I mean, there's a lot of - I mean, our businesses are kind of growing extremely well across the continent. So it just proves that there are things happening.</p><p>Yes, there are challenges, but that increases the entry level barrier and therefore the opportunities' even that much more.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW: I suggest to you that what happens is people become so subsumed and rosy and misty-eyed about the opportunities, but they don't deal with issues like corruption, transparency, the rule of law, anti-gay laws.</p><p>All these things that are to some extent prevalent or present in different countries in Africa. They don't deal with these because everybody's so busy thinking about the latest bank or the latest telecoms.</p><p>THAKKAR: I disagree. I think these issues are being addressed. I advise a few heads of state - I'm on the Global Agenda Council for Africa for the World Economic Forum - I am seeing it firsthand.</p><p>Every single day that the continent is transforming, there's more governance, there's more transparency coming into the system.</p><p>Again, I can't generally - generalize - it positively the way we can't generalize it negatively. There are parts of the continent which are truly being transformed.</p><p>QUEST: Why am I more pessimistic than you?</p><p>THAKKAR: Because you haven't spent enough time there. I think seeing it is believing it. Actually seeing the opportunities -</p><p>QUEST: Seeing what?</p><p>THAKKAR: The continent's opportunities, the countries meeting the government officials and seeing what kind of passion they have about transforming their country.</p><p>President Ka -</p><p>QUEST: Seeing a variety of countries that couldn't deal with an Ebola crisis - that let it get completely out of control.</p><p>THAKKAR: But that was three countries out of the 54 countries which have been affected by Ebola.</p><p>QUEST: You see, that's the problem with this - with your argument. It's always 'that was this country,' 'that was Nigeria,' 'that was this' -</p><p>THAKKAR: No, but Nigeria fought Ebola and cleared it but it's never been celebrated because they did fight it and clear it. Like Nigeria had peaceful free and fair democratic elections. Why isn't it talked about? Because they were peaceful, free and fair.</p><p>That's the issue.</p><p>QUEST: They were talked about.</p><p>THAKKAR: Not enough, not enough. And everybody expected the result to be different, yet the it was a peaceful, free and fair and we're going to have an amazing transformation in the country.</p><p>But no one talks about that. And that's the issue we have.</p><p>QUEST: South Africa's economy is in a terrible state. Have you looked at the electricity, the provision of supply and energy - it's appalling.</p><p>THAKKAR: South Africa's growth is a lot slower than the rest of the continent - I agree. And that's why our group is -</p><p>QUEST: But isn't that a classic example of mismanagement of an economy that used - that was in very good stead?</p><p>THAKKAR: But that is a classic example of again being generalized. That one county has that issue - and I agree. There's a few countries like that. But we are a continent, Richard, and that's where it keeps on going wrong.</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST: With respect, you seem to only what to generalize when it's positive in your book. You don't want to generalize the moment it becomes something more critical.</p><p>THAKKAR: No, because it's a one-sided story right now. And this is why I'm trying to give you a real story of what I have been living every day.</p><p>QUEST: So what does Africa need if it's going to reach its potential?</p><p>THAKKAR: In my opinion, I think we've had enough. We don't need the pity, we don't need people to feel sorry for us. What we need is investment, we need partners and we need to do trade. We don't need aid.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Very heated discussion there. If you're an African, let us know your thoughts. Why don't you tweet Richard rather than me I should say. @richardquest is his Twitter account.</p><p>Still to come right here on \"Quest Means Business,\" he's scored more goals than any other player in history. Next, Pele tells me that modern- day footballers have a very different goal in mind. What that is, just ahead.</p><p>SOARES: We told you earlier how money's affecting fantasy sports and it's no secret how it affects the real game as well.</p><p>Pele says modern-day players are only concerned with getting paid.

The proposals follow an EC-commissioned report last month, by its High-Level Expert Group, which recommended more transparency from online platforms to help combat the spread of false information online \u2014 and also called for urgent investment in media and information literacy education, and strategies to empower journalists and foster a diverse and sustainable news media ecosystem. Bots, fake accounts, political ads, filter bubbles In an announcement on Friday the Commission said it wants platforms to establish \u201cclear marking systems and rules for bots\u201d in order to ensure \u201ctheir activities cannot be confused with human interactions\u201d. It does not go into a greater level of detail on how that might be achieved. Clearly it\u2019s intending platforms to have to come up with relevant methodologies. Identifying bots is not an exact science \u2014 as academics conducting research into how information spreads online could tell you. </p><p>The current tools that exist for trying to spot bots typically involve rating accounts across a range of criteria to give a score of how likely an account is to be algorithmically controlled vs human controlled. But platforms do at least have a perfect view into their own systems, whereas academics have had to rely on the variable level of access platforms are willing to give them. Another factor here is that given the sophisticated nature of some online disinformation campaigns \u2014 the state-sponsored and heavily resourced efforts by Kremlin backed entities such as Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, for example \u2014 if the focus ends up being algorithmically controlled bots vs IDing bots that might have human agents helping or controlling them, plenty of more insidious disinformation agents could easily slip through the cracks. That said, other measures in the EC\u2019s proposals for platforms include stepping up their existing efforts to shutter fake accounts and being able to demonstrate the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of such efforts \u2014 so greater transparency around how fake accounts are identified and the proportion being removed (which could help surface more sophisticated human-controlled bot activity on platforms too). Another measure from the package: The EC says it wants to see \u201csignificantly\u201d improved scrutiny of ad placements \u2014 with a focus on trying to reduce revenue opportunities for disinformation purveyors. Restricting targeting options for political advertising is another component. \u201cEnsure transparency about sponsored content relating to electoral and policy-making processes,\u201d is one of the listed objectives on its fact sheet \u2014 and ad transparency is something Facebook has said it\u2019s prioritizing since revelations about the extent of Kremlin disinformation on its platform during the 2016 US presidential election, with expanded tools due this summer. The Commission also says generally that it wants platforms to provide \u201cgreater clarity about the functioning of algorithms\u201d and enable third-party verification \u2014 though there\u2019s no greater level of detail being provided at this point to indicate how much algorithmic accountability it\u2019s after from platforms. We\u2019ve asked for more on its thinking here and will update this story with any response. It looks to be seeking to test the water to see how much of the workings of platforms\u2019 algorithmic blackboxes can be coaxed from them voluntarily \u2014 such as via measures targeting bots and fake accounts \u2014 in an attempt to stave off formal and more fulsome regulations down the line. Filter bubbles also appear to be informing the Commission\u2019s thinking, as it says it wants platforms to make it easier for users to \u201cdiscover and access different news sources representing alternative viewpoints\u201d \u2014 via tools that let users customize and interact with the online experience to \u201cfacilitate content discovery and access to different news sources\u201d. Though another stated objective is for platforms to \u201cimprove access to trustworthy information\u201d \u2014 so there are questions about how those two aims can be balanced, i.e. without efforts towards one undermining the other. On trustworthiness, the EC says it wants platforms to help users assess whether content is reliable using \u201cindicators of the trustworthiness of content sources\u201d, as well as by providing \u201ceasily accessible tools to report disinformation\u201d. In one of several steps Facebook has taken since 2016 to try to tackle the problem of fake content being spread on its platform the company experimented with putting \u2018disputed\u2019 labels or red flags on potentially untrustworthy information. However the company discontinued this in December after research suggested negative labels could entrench deeply held beliefs, rather than helping to debunk fake stories. Instead it started showing related stories \u2014 containing content it had verified as coming from news outlets its network of fact checkers considered reputable \u2014 as an alternative way to debunk potential fakes. The Commission\u2019s approach looks to be aligning with Facebook\u2019s rethought approach \u2014 with the subjective question of how to make judgements on what is (and therefore what isn\u2019t) a trustworthy source likely being handed off to third parties, given that another strand of the code is focused on \u201cenabling fact-checkers, researchers and public authorities to continuously monitor online disinformation\u201d. Since 2016 Facebook has been leaning heavily on a network of local third party \u2018partner\u2019 fact-checkers to help identify and mitigate the spread of fakes in different markets \u2014 including checkers for written content and also photos and videos, the latter in an effort to combat fake memes before they have a chance to go viral and skew perceptions. In parallel Google has also been working with external fact checkers, such as on initiatives such as highlighting fact-checked articles in Google News and search. The Commission clearly approves of the companies reaching out to a wider network of third party experts. But it is also encouraging work on innovative tech-powered fixes to the complex problem of disinformation \u2014 describing AI (\u201csubject to appropriate human oversight\u201d) as set to play a \u201ccrucial\u201d role for \u201cverifying, identifying and tagging disinformation\u201d, and pointing to blockchain as having promise for content validation. Specifically it reckons blockchain technology could play a role by, for instance, being combined with the use of \u201ctrustworthy electronic identification, authentication and verified pseudonyms\u201d to preserve the integrity of content and validate \u201cinformation and/or its sources, enable transparency and traceability, and promote trust in news displayed on the Internet\u201d. It\u2019s one of a handful of nascent technologies the executive flags as potentially useful for fighting fake news, and whose development it says it intends to support via an existing EU research funding vehicle: The Horizon 2020 Work Program. It says it will use this program to support research activities on \u201ctools and technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain that can contribute to a better online space, increasing cybersecurity and trust in online services\u201d. It also flags \u201ccognitive algorithms that handle contextually-relevant information, including the accuracy and the quality of data sources\u201d as a promising tech to \u201cimprove the relevance and reliability of search results\u201d. The Commission is giving platforms until July to develop and apply the Code of Practice \u2014 and is using the possibility that it could still draw up new laws if it feels the voluntary measures fail as a mechanism to encourage companies to put the sweat in. It is also proposing a range of other measures to tackle the online disinformation issue \u2014 including:  An independent European network of fact-checkers: The Commission says this will establish \u201ccommon working methods, exchange best practices, and work to achieve the broadest possible coverage of factual corrections across the EU\u201d; and says they will be selected from the EU members of the International Fact Checking Network which it notes follows \u201ca strict International Fact Checking NetworkCode of Principles\u201d  A secure European online platform on disinformation to support the network of fact-checkers and relevant academic researchers with \u201ccross-border data collection and analysis\u201d, as well as benefitting from access to EU-wide data  Enhancing media literacy: On this it says a higher level of media literacy will \u201chelp Europeans to identify online disinformation and approach online content with a critical eye\u201d. So it says it will encourage fact-checkers and civil society organisations to provide educational material to schools and educators, and organise a European Week of Media Literacy  Support for Member States in ensuring the resilience of elections against what it dubs \u201cincreasingly complex cyber threats\u201d including online disinformation and cyber attacks. Stated measures here include encouraging national authorities to identify best practices for the identification, mitigation and management of risks in time for the 2019 European Parliament elections. It also notes work by a Cooperation Group, saying \u201cMember States have started to map existing European initiatives on cybersecurity of network and information systems used for electoral processes, with the aim of developing voluntary guidance\u201d by the end of the year. It also says it will also organise a high-level conference with Member States on cyber-enabled threats to elections in late 2018  Promotion of voluntary online identification systems with the stated aim of improving the \u201ctraceability and identification of suppliers of information\u201d and promoting \u201cmore trust and reliability in online interactions and in information and its sources\u201d. This includes support for related research activities in technologies such as blockchain, as noted above. The Commission also says it will \u201cexplore the feasibility of setting up voluntary systems to allow greater accountability based on electronic identification and authentication scheme\u201d \u2014 as a measure to tackle fake accounts. \u201cTogether with others actions aimed at improving traceability online (improving the functioning, availability and accuracy of information on IP and domain names in the WHOIS system and promoting the uptake of the IPv6 protocol), this would also contribute to limiting cyberattacks,\u201d it adds  Support for quality and diversified information: The Commission is calling on Member States to scale up their support of quality journalism to ensure a pluralistic, diverse and sustainable media environment. The Commission says it will launch a call for proposals in 2018 for \u201cthe production and dissemination of quality news content on EU affairs through data-driven news media\u201d It says it will aim to co-ordinate its strategic comms policy to try to counter \u201cfalse narratives about Europe\u201d \u2014 which makes you wonder whether debunking the output of certain UK tabloid newspapers might fall under that new EC strategy \u2014 and also more broadly to tackle disinformation \u201cwithin and outside the EU\u201d. Commenting on the proposals in a statement, the Commission\u2019s VP for the Digital Single Market, Andrus Ansip, said: \u201cDisinformation is not new as an instrument of political influence. New technologies, especially digital, have expanded its reach via the online environment to undermine our democracy and society. Since online trust is easy to break but difficult to rebuild, industry needs to work together with us on this issue. Online platforms have an important role to play in fighting disinformation campaigns organised by individuals and countries who aim to threaten our democracy.\u201d The EC\u2019s next steps now will be bringing the relevant parties together \u2014 including platforms, the ad industry and \u201cmajor advertisers\u201d \u2014 in a forum to work on greasing cooperation and getting them to apply themselves to what are still, at this stage, voluntary measures. \u201cThe forum\u2019s first output should be an EU\u2013wide Code of Practice on Disinformation to be published by July 2018, with a view to having a measurable impact by October 2018,\u201d says the Commission. The first progress report will be published in December 2018. \u201cThe report will also examine the need for further action to ensure the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the outlined actions,\u201d it warns. And if self-regulation fails133; In a fact sheet further fleshing out its plans, the Commission states: \u201cShould the self-regulatory approach fail, the Commission may propose further actions, including regulatory ones targeted at a few platforms.\u201d And for \u201ca few\u201d read: Mainstream social platforms \u2014 so likely the big tech players in the social digital arena: Facebook, Google, Twitter. For potential regulatory actions tech giants only need look to Germany, where a 2017 social media hate speech law has introduced fines of up to \u20ac50M for platforms that fail to comply with valid takedown requests within 24 hours for simple cases, for an example of the kind of scary EU-wide law that could come rushing down the pipe at them if the Commission and EU states decide its necessary to legislate. Though justice and consumer affairs commissioner, Vera Jourova, signaled in January that her preference on hate speech at least was to continue pursuing the voluntary approach \u2014 though she also said some Member State\u2019s ministers are open to a new EU-level law should the voluntary approach fail. In Germany the so-called NetzDG law has faced criticism for pushing platforms towards risk aversion-based censorship of online content. And the Commission is clearly keen to avoid such charges being leveled at its proposals, stressing that if regulation were to be deemed necessary \u201csuch [regulatory] actions should in any case strictly respect freedom of expression\u201d. Commenting on the Code of Practice proposals, a Facebook spokesperson told us: \u201cPeople want accurate information on Facebook \u2013 and that\u2019s what we want too. We have invested in heavily in fighting false news on Facebook by disrupting the economic incentives for the spread of false news, building new products and working with third-party fact checkers.\u201d A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on the Commission\u2019s proposals but flagged contributions he said the company is already making to support media literacy \u2014 including an event last week at its EMEA HQ. At the time of writing Google had not responded to a request for comment. Last month the Commission did further tighten the screw on platforms over terrorist content specifically \u2014 saying it wants them to get this taken down within an hour of a report as a general rule. Though it still hasn\u2019t taken the step to cement that hour \u2018rule\u2019 into legislation, also preferring to see how much action it can voluntarily squeeze out of platforms via a self-regulation route. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN783794320180502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7D-TB01-J9XT-P0HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2521\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 2, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The rapid pace of technological change - including artificial intelligence and facial recognition - is mingling ever more with national security concerns that European leaders have been slow to grasp and respond to, analysts say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As global technology shapes up into a battleground between China and the United States, Europe is finding it harder to set the rules of the road while others in Beijing and Washington are in the driver's seat.</p><p>\"Europe needs to get its act together,\" said Marietje Schaake, international policy director at the Cyber Policy Center of Stanford University and a former member of the European Parliament. \"I worry the tempo is too slow for the pace at which changes are forthcoming.\"</p><p>The most recent example is TikTok, the wildly popular Chinese short video app, which the Trump administration has challenged by using many of the same national security arguments it employed against Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and its bid to become the globe's dominant 5G provider.</p><p>Time and again, such disputes have left European leaders, regulators and industries squeezed between Beijing and Washington, risking retaliation against carmakers, financial services firms or agriculture companies if they choose one side over the other.</p><p>In response, European leaders have belatedly embarked on a generational project toward \"digital sovereignty,\" mixing tougher rules against foreign tech companies with efforts to boost local innovation.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission vice president in charge of digital issues, has called it a \"new phase\" for technology policy in the region.</p><p>But those policies will take years to shift the balance meaningfully in Europe's favor, analysts say, and many question whether they are really enough to close the technology gap with the United States and China.</p><p>One reason Brussels risks falling behind is that security remains the responsibility of individual member nations, not one ceded to the European Union, Ms. Schaake said.</p><p>\"TikTok confronts Europe with the weaknesses of its digital and national security policies,\" she said. \"Europe is na\u00efve about certain of the technologies coming from China and the United States, and just says that anyone doing business in Europe has to respect our rights and regulations.\"</p><p>After months of debate, some European leaders are coming around to views closer to those held in Washington, where President Trump has moved to try to force the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to an American company, charging that the company's Chinese ties present a national security threat.</p><p>It has used the same argument against Huawei, the telecommunications giant, though both companies deny any explicit link to the Chinese government.</p><p>In Europe, the American point of view on Huawei, backed by the threat of secondary sanctions, has gained ground, most recently in Britain, where a ban was adopted in July.</p><p>But most Europeans mostly still see TikTok not as a security threat, but as a risk to privacy. Even if the White House-orchestrated TikTok sale goes through, the European operations will remain under the ownership of the Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p><p>TikTok uses both facial recognition and artificial intelligence, important technologies that are not regulated by the United States or the European Union. \"With the combination of competition, artificial intelligence and security, it makes sense why some policymakers are concerned,\" said Andreas Aktoudianakis, a digital policy analyst with the European Policy Center, a research institution in Brussels.</p><p>\"Europe wants to regulate artificial intelligence and other technologies, but it's slow and there's no real timeline,\" he added. \"We're late to catch the train.\"</p><p>Gerard de Graaf, director for the digital single market for the European Commission, said that the European Union needed \"a lot more cooperation among member states on the issue of security.\"</p><p>Europe has no major social media platforms, he conceded in a seminar at Bruegel, a Brussels research institution, but is doing well in financial technology, robotics and 5G. \"It's not that the E.U. is way behind everyone else,\" he said, \"but we have challenges.\"</p><p>But Francesca Bria, chair of the Italian National Innovation Fund, argued that Europe risked being squashed between the Chinese state model - which is represented by Huawei, WeChat, Alibaba, Tencent and TikTok, with their state subsidies - and the \"big company, big tech surveillance\" of the American giants.</p><p>\"If we fail to regain digital sovereignty,\" she said, \"we risk becoming a colony caught between the U.S. and China,\" with risks to democracy.</p><p>American tech shares alone are more valuable than the whole European stock market, Ms. Bria said. \"Europe needs to remain relevant as a global economic power, not just a regulatory power,\" she said.</p><p>The weaknesses are stark. The world's most popular smartphones are made in China, South Korea and the United States. The biggest social media and online shopping platforms come from American and Chinese companies, as do the largest providers of cloud computing and artificial intelligence services.</p><p>Europe has been missing from the list of the world's most influential technology companies since the fall of Nokia about a decade ago. For reasons including lack of venture capital, language barriers and a cultural aversion to risk, European companies have struggled to match the entrepreneurial pace in a technology industry now dominated by mobile devices, internet services and online communication tools.</p><p>Europe has attempted to influence the digital economy through regulation, adopting tough data protection rules and aggressively enforcing antitrust laws.</p><p>But European leaders are realizing the limits of those efforts, particularly as its citizens depend on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in the absence of European alternatives. The biggest European technology company is Germany's SAP, a business software provider that competes with American companies like Microsoft and Oracle.</p><p>Along with privacy and security issues, TikTok also raises questions about disinformation and about censorship exercised by the company on issues of sensitivity to China. The European Data Protection Board said in June that it would set up a task force to assess TikTok's activities across the bloc.</p><p>But it is not clear what European agency would take the lead, especially since TikTok in July shifted data protection functions to Dublin. That might give the Irish Data Protection Commission oversight of the company when it comes to privacy issues. But the agency has faced criticism in the past for not being more aggressive.</p><p>Noah Barkin, a senior visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said Europe's lack of influence ultimately stemmed from its dearth of influential tech businesses. Europe will face these difficulties for years as China and the United States battle for tech supremacy.</p><p>\"Europe hasn't developed its own global digital companies to compete with the big U.S. and Chinese firms, and ultimately that's what digital sovereignty is all about,\" Mr. Barkin said. \"It can't just be a regulator.\"</p><p>Europe's plans for \"digital sovereignty\" are still vague, said Rebecca Arcesati, an analyst with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.</p><p>\"This is a talking point, but it is a long way before Europe can develop its own digital champions,\" she said. \"It may be too late.\"</p><p>Fabrice Pothier, chief strategy officer at the Rasmussen Global consulting firm in Brussels, said American pressure was forcing Europe to recalibrate its relationship with China, particularly on technology matters.</p><p>\"It's a wake-up call to Europe,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as a benign technology and network operator from China.\"</p><p>On this matter, the Trump administration is \"not necessarily wrong,\" he said. \"Europe is generally behind the curve.\"</p><p>Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Adam Satariano from London.

The rapid pace of technological change \u2014 including artificial intelligence and facial recognition \u2014 is mingling ever more with national security concerns that European leaders have been slow to grasp and respond to, analysts say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As global technology shapes up into a battleground between <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">China and the United States</url>, Europe is finding it harder to set the rules of the road while others in Beijing and Washington are in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cEurope needs to get its act together,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, international policy director at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">Cyber Policy Center</url> of Stanford University and a former member of the European Parliament. \u201cI worry the tempo is too slow for the pace at which changes are forthcoming.\u201d</p><p>The most recent example is TikTok, the wildly popular Chinese short video app, which the Trump administration has challenged by using many of the same national security arguments it employed against Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and its bid to become the globe\u2019s dominant 5G provider.</p><p>Time and again, such disputes have left European leaders, regulators and industries squeezed between Beijing and Washington, risking retaliation against carmakers, financial services firms or agriculture companies if they choose one side over the other.</p><p>In response, European leaders have belatedly embarked on a generational project toward \u201cdigital sovereignty,\u201d mixing tougher rules against foreign tech companies with efforts to boost local innovation.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission vice president in charge of digital issues, has called it a \u201cnew phase\u201d for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">technology policy</url> in the region.</p><p>But those policies will take years to shift the balance meaningfully in Europe\u2019s favor, analysts say, and many question whether they are really enough to close the technology gap with the United States and China.</p><p>One reason Brussels risks falling behind is that security remains the responsibility of individual member nations, not one ceded to the European Union, Ms. Schaake said.</p><p>\u201cTikTok confronts Europe with the weaknesses of its digital and national security policies,\u201d she said. \u201cEurope is na\u00efve about certain of the technologies coming from China and the United States, and just says that anyone doing business in Europe has to respect our rights and regulations.\u201d</p><p>After months of debate, some European leaders are coming around to views closer to those held in Washington, where President Trump has moved to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">try to force the sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations</url> to an American company, charging that the company\u2019s Chinese ties present a national security threat.</p><p>It has used the same argument against <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">Huawei, the telecommunications giant</url>, though both companies deny any explicit link to the Chinese government.</p><p>In Europe, the American point of view on Huawei, backed by the threat of secondary sanctions, has gained ground, most recently in Britain, where <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">a ban was adopted in July</url>.</p><p>But most Europeans mostly still see TikTok not as a security threat, but as a risk to privacy. Even if the White House-orchestrated TikTok sale goes through, the European operations will remain under the ownership of the Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p><p>TikTok uses both facial recognition and artificial intelligence, important technologies that are not regulated by the United States or the European Union. \u201cWith the combination of competition, artificial intelligence and security, it makes sense why some policymakers are concerned,\u201d said Andreas Aktoudianakis, a digital policy analyst with the European Policy Center, a research institution in Brussels.</p><p>\u201cEurope wants to regulate artificial intelligence and other technologies, but it\u2019s slow and there\u2019s no real timeline,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re late to catch the train.\u201d</p><p>Gerard de Graaf, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">director for the digital single market</url> for the European Commission, said that the European Union needed \u201ca lot more cooperation among member states on the issue of security.\u201d</p><p>Europe has no major social media platforms, he conceded in a seminar at Bruegel, a Brussels research institution, but is doing well in financial technology, robotics and 5G. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the E.U. is way behind everyone else,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have challenges.\u201d</p><p>But Francesca Bria, chair of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">Italian National Innovation Fund</url>, argued that Europe risked being squashed between the Chinese state model \u2014 which is represented by Huawei, WeChat, Alibaba, Tencent and TikTok, with their state subsidies \u2014 and the \u201cbig company, big tech surveillance\u201d of the American giants.</p><p>\u201cIf we fail to regain digital sovereignty,\u201d she said, \u201cwe risk becoming a colony caught between the U.S. and China,\u201d with risks to democracy.</p><p>American tech shares alone are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">more valuable</url> than the whole European stock market, Ms. Bria said. \u201cEurope needs to remain relevant as a global economic power, not just a regulatory power,\u201d she said.</p><p>The weaknesses are stark. The world\u2019s most popular smartphones are made in China, South Korea and the United States. The biggest social media and online shopping platforms come from American and Chinese companies, as do the largest providers of cloud computing and artificial intelligence services.</p><p>Europe has been missing from the list of the world\u2019s most influential technology companies since <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">the fall of Nokia</url> about a decade ago. For reasons including lack of venture capital, language barriers and a cultural aversion to risk, European companies have struggled to match the entrepreneurial pace in a technology industry now dominated by mobile devices, internet services and online communication tools.</p><p>Europe has attempted to influence the digital economy through regulation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">adopting tough data protection rules</url> and aggressively enforcing antitrust laws.</p><p>But European leaders are realizing the limits of those efforts, particularly as its citizens depend on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in the absence of European alternatives. The biggest European technology company is Germany\u2019s SAP, a business software provider that competes with American companies like Microsoft and Oracle.</p><p>Along with privacy and security issues, TikTok also raises questions about disinformation and about censorship exercised by the company on issues of sensitivity to China. The European Data Protection Board said in June that it would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/world/asia/branstad-ambassador-china.html\">set up a task force</url> to assess TikTok\u2019s activities across the bloc.</p><p>But it is not clear what European agency would take the lead, especially since TikTok in July shifted data protection functions to Dublin. That might give the Irish Data Protection Commission oversight of the company when it comes to privacy issues. But the agency has faced criticism in the past for not being more aggressive.</p><p>Noah Barkin, a senior visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said Europe\u2019s lack of influence ultimately stemmed from its dearth of influential tech businesses. Europe will face these difficulties for years as China and the United States battle for tech supremacy.</p><p>\u201cEurope hasn\u2019t developed its own global digital companies to compete with the big U.S. and Chinese firms, and ultimately that\u2019s what digital sovereignty is all about,\u201d Mr. Barkin said. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be a regulator.\u201d</p><p>Europe\u2019s plans for \u201cdigital sovereignty\u201d are still vague, said Rebecca Arcesati, an analyst with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.</p><p>\u201cThis is a talking point, but it is a long way before Europe can develop its own digital champions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be too late.\u201d</p><p>Fabrice Pothier, chief strategy officer at the Rasmussen Global consulting firm in Brussels, said American pressure was forcing Europe to recalibrate its relationship with China, particularly on technology matters.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call to Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no such thing as a benign technology and network operator from China.\u201d</p><p>On this matter, the Trump administration is \u201cnot necessarily wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope is generally behind the curve.\u201d</p><p>Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Adam Satariano from London. Monika Pronczuk contributed research from Brussels.</p><p>PHOTOS: Some European leaders are coming around to views closer to those held by the White House, which has moved to try to force the sale of TikTok U.S. operations to an American company.

And it comes at a time when big tech companies around the world are facing increasing regulatory pressure and fierce political attacks over privacy violations, online misinformation, hate speech and other abuses.<br/><br/> Still, the latest penalty isn't likely to have much effect on Google's business. It involves practices the company says it already ended, and the sum is just a fraction of the $31 billion in profit that its parent, Alphabet, made last year.<br/><br/> Alphabet stock rose 2 percent on Wall Street on Wednesday.<br/><br/> The EU ruling applies to a narrow portion of Google's ad business: when Google sells ads next to Google search results on third-party websites.<br/><br/> Investigators found that Google inserted exclusivity clauses in its contracts that barred these websites from running similarly placed ads sold by Google's rivals.<br/><br/> As a result, advertisers and website owners \"had less choice and likely faced higher prices that would be passed on to consumers,\" said the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager.<br/><br/> Anyone who suffered from Google's behavior can seek compensation through national courts, she said.<br/><br/> EU regulators opened their investigation in 2016 - seven years after Microsoft filed a complaint - though by that time, Google had already made some changes to give customers more freedom to show competing ads. For that reason, regulators did not require a specific remedy to restore competition.<br/><br/> But Vestager said it appeared rivals haven't been able to catch up, and some are \"quite small.\" By contrast, the EU said, Google has more than 70 percent of the European market for selling ads that run alongside search results on third-party websites.<br/><br/>Google did not say whether it would appeal.<br/><br/> \"We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission's concerns,\" Google's senior vice president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said in a statement. \"Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe.\"<br/><br/> E-marketing analyst Bill Fisher noted a \"growing wave of sentiment\" toward curbing the influence of Big Tech and said that even if the EU's rulings apply only to Google's European operations, Google should \"begin to open up, become more transparent and possibly look to alter some of its business practices\" worldwide.<br/><br/> Earlier this month, a British expert panel recommended the government curb the dominance of giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google. In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up the biggest American tech companies, accusing them of wielding too much power.<br/><br/> This week, as part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists, Facebook agreed to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.<br/><br/> The EU has led the way in promoting tougher regulation of big tech companies. Besides cracking down on antitrust breaches by Microsoft and Intel, it has enforced stricter data privacy rules that affect Facebook and other social media companies.<br/><br/> U.S. regulators haven't been as tough, though the Federal Trade Commission recently created a task force focused on anti-competitive behavior in the industry.<br/><br/> Last year, Vestager fined Google a record 4.34 billion euros ($5 billion at the time) for forcing cellphone makers using the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.<br/><br/> In 2017, she penalized Google 2.42 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for manipulating online shopping search results and directing visitors to its comparison-shopping service, Google Shopping, at the expense of its rivals.<br/><br/>Google, which is appealing those two earlier fines, has said it has since made adjustments to its shopping results and will start asking European users of Android phones if they want to use other search or browser apps.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHISUN-158605</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHISUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP8-R0V1-JCW9-X046-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11064</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sun-Times Media, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Sun-Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And it comes at a time when big tech companies around the world are facing increasing regulatory pressure and fierce political attacks over privacy violations, online misinformation, hate speech and other abuses.</p><p>Still, the latest penalty isn't likely to have much effect on Google's business. It involves practices the company says it already ended, and the sum is just a fraction of the $31 billion in profit that its parent, Alphabet, made last year.</p><p>Alphabet stock rose 2 percent on Wall Street on Wednesday.</p><p>The EU ruling applies to a narrow portion of Google's ad business: when Google sells ads next to Google search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Investigators found that Google inserted exclusivity clauses in its contracts that barred these websites from running similarly placed ads sold by Google's rivals.</p><p>As a result, advertisers and website owners \"had less choice and likely faced higher prices that would be passed on to consumers,\" said the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>Anyone who suffered from Google's behavior can seek compensation through national courts, she said.</p><p>EU regulators opened their investigation in 2016 - seven years after Microsoft filed a complaint - though by that time, Google had already made some changes to give customers more freedom to show competing ads. For that reason, regulators did not require a specific remedy to restore competition.</p><p>But Vestager said it appeared rivals haven't been able to catch up, and some are \"quite small.\" By contrast, the EU said, Google has more than 70 percent of the European market for selling ads that run alongside search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Google did not say whether it would appeal.</p><p>\"We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission's concerns,\" Google's senior vice president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said in a statement. \"Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe.\"</p><p>E-marketing analyst Bill Fisher noted a \"growing wave of sentiment\" toward curbing the influence of Big Tech and said that even if the EU's rulings apply only to Google's European operations, Google should \"begin to open up, become more transparent and possibly look to alter some of its business practices\" worldwide.</p><p>Earlier this month, a British expert panel recommended the government curb the dominance of giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google. In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up the biggest American tech companies, accusing them of wielding too much power.</p><p>This week, as part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists, Facebook agreed to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p>The EU has led the way in promoting tougher regulation of big tech companies. Besides cracking down on antitrust breaches by Microsoft and Intel, it has enforced stricter data privacy rules that affect Facebook and other social media companies.</p><p>U.S. regulators haven't been as tough, though the Federal Trade Commission recently created a task force focused on anti-competitive behavior in the industry.</p><p>Last year, Vestager fined Google a record 4.34 billion euros ($5 billion at the time) for forcing cellphone makers using the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.</p><p>In 2017, she penalized Google 2.42 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for manipulating online shopping search results and directing visitors to its comparison-shopping service, Google Shopping, at the expense of its rivals.</p><p>Google, which is appealing those two earlier fines, has said it has since made adjustments to its shopping results and will start asking European users of Android phones if they want to use other search or browser apps.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow the AP's coverage of technology at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/apf-technology\">https://apnews.com/apf-technology</url> and of social platforms at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms\">https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms</url></p><p>___</p><p>Chan reported from London.

And it comes at a time when big tech companies around the world are facing increasing regulatory pressure and fierce political attacks over privacy violations, online misinformation, hate speech and other abuses.</p><p>Still, the latest penalty isn't likely to have much effect on Google's business. It involves practices the company says it already ended, and the sum is just a fraction of the $31 billion in profit that its parent, Alphabet, made last year.</p><p>Alphabet stock rose 2 percent on Wall Street on Wednesday.</p><p>The EU ruling applies to a narrow portion of Google's ad business: when Google sells ads next to Google search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Investigators found that Google inserted exclusivity clauses in its contracts that barred these websites from running similarly placed ads sold by Google's rivals.</p><p>As a result, advertisers and website owners \"had less choice and likely faced higher prices that would be passed on to consumers,\" said the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>Anyone who suffered from Google's behavior can seek compensation through national courts, she said.</p><p>EU regulators opened their investigation in 2016 - seven years after Microsoft filed a complaint - though by that time, Google had already made some changes to give customers more freedom to show competing ads. For that reason, regulators did not require a specific remedy to restore competition.</p><p>But Vestager said it appeared rivals haven't been able to catch up, and some are \"quite small.\" By contrast, the EU said, Google has more than 70 percent of the European market for selling ads that run alongside search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Google did not say whether it would appeal.</p><p>\"We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission's concerns,\" Google's senior vice president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said in a statement. \"Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe.\"</p><p>E-marketing analyst Bill Fisher noted a \"growing wave of sentiment\" toward curbing the influence of Big Tech and said that even if the EU's rulings apply only to Google's European operations, Google should \"begin to open up, become more transparent and possibly look to alter some of its business practices\" worldwide.</p><p>Earlier this month, a British expert panel recommended the government curb the dominance of giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google. In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up the biggest American tech companies, accusing them of wielding too much power.</p><p>This week, as part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists, Facebook agreed to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p>The EU has led the way in promoting tougher regulation of big tech companies. Besides cracking down on antitrust breaches by Microsoft and Intel, it has enforced stricter data privacy rules that affect Facebook and other social media companies.</p><p>U.S. regulators haven't been as tough, though the Federal Trade Commission recently created a task force focused on anti-competitive behavior in the industry.</p><p>Last year, Vestager fined Google a record 4.34 billion euros ($5 billion at the time) for forcing cellphone makers using the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.</p><p>In 2017, she penalized Google 2.42 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for manipulating online shopping search results and directing visitors to its comparison-shopping service, Google Shopping, at the expense of its rivals.</p><p>Google, which is appealing those two earlier fines, has said it has since made adjustments to its shopping results and will start asking European users of Android phones if they want to use other search or browser apps.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow the AP's coverage of technology at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/apf-technology\">https://apnews.com/apf-technology</url> and of social platforms at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms\">https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms</url></p><p>___</p><p>Chan reported from London.

And it comes at a time when big tech companies around the world are facing increasing regulatory pressure and fierce political attacks over privacy violations, online misinformation, hate speech and other abuses.</p><p>Still, the latest penalty isn't likely to have much effect on Google's business. It involves practices the company says it already ended, and the sum is just a fraction of the $31 billion in profit that its parent, Alphabet, made last year.</p><p>Alphabet stock rose 2 percent on Wall Street on Wednesday.</p><p>The EU ruling applies to a narrow portion of Google's ad business: when Google sells ads next to Google search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Investigators found that Google inserted exclusivity clauses in its contracts that barred these websites from running similarly placed ads sold by Google's rivals.</p><p>As a result, advertisers and website owners \"had less choice and likely faced higher prices that would be passed on to consumers,\" said the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>Anyone who suffered from Google's behavior can seek compensation through national courts, she said.</p><p>EU regulators opened their investigation in 2016 - seven years after Microsoft filed a complaint - though by that time, Google had already made some changes to give customers more freedom to show competing ads. For that reason, regulators did not require a specific remedy to restore competition.</p><p>But Vestager said it appeared rivals haven't been able to catch up, and some are \"quite small.\" By contrast, the EU said, Google has more than 70 percent of the European market for selling ads that run alongside search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Google did not say whether it would appeal.</p><p>\"We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission's concerns,\" Google's senior vice president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said in a statement. \"Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe.\"</p><p>E-marketing analyst Bill Fisher noted a \"growing wave of sentiment\" toward curbing the influence of Big Tech and said that even if the EU's rulings apply only to Google's European operations, Google should \"begin to open up, become more transparent and possibly look to alter some of its business practices\" worldwide.</p><p>Earlier this month, a British expert panel recommended the government curb the dominance of giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google. In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up the biggest American tech companies, accusing them of wielding too much power.</p><p>This week, as part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists, Facebook agreed to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p>The EU has led the way in promoting tougher regulation of big tech companies. Besides cracking down on antitrust breaches by Microsoft and Intel, it has enforced stricter data privacy rules that affect Facebook and other social media companies.</p><p>U.S. regulators haven't been as tough, though the Federal Trade Commission recently created a task force focused on anti-competitive behavior in the industry.</p><p>Last year, Vestager fined Google a record 4.34 billion euros ($5 billion at the time) for forcing cellphone makers using the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.</p><p>In 2017, she penalized Google 2.42 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for manipulating online shopping search results and directing visitors to its comparison-shopping service, Google Shopping, at the expense of its rivals.</p><p>Google, which is appealing those two earlier fines, has said it has since made adjustments to its shopping results and will start asking European users of Android phones if they want to use other search or browser apps.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow the AP's coverage of technology at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/apf-technology\">https://apnews.com/apf-technology</url> and of social platforms at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms\">https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms</url></p><p>___</p><p>Chan reported from London.

And it comes at a time when big tech companies around the world are facing increasing regulatory pressure and fierce political attacks over privacy violations, online misinformation, hate speech and other abuses.</p><p>Still, the latest penalty isn't likely to have much effect on Google's business. It involves practices the company says it already ended, and the sum is just a fraction of the $31 billion in profit that its parent, Alphabet, made last year.</p><p>Alphabet stock rose 2 percent on Wall Street on Wednesday.</p><p>The EU ruling applies to a narrow portion of Google's ad business: when Google sells ads next to Google search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Investigators found that Google inserted exclusivity clauses in its contracts that barred these websites from running similarly placed ads sold by Google's rivals.</p><p>As a result, advertisers and website owners \"had less choice and likely faced higher prices that would be passed on to consumers,\" said the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>Anyone who suffered from Google's behavior can seek compensation through national courts, she said.</p><p>EU regulators opened their investigation in 2016 - seven years after Microsoft filed a complaint - though by that time, Google had already made some changes to give customers more freedom to show competing ads. For that reason, regulators did not require a specific remedy to restore competition.</p><p>But Vestager said it appeared rivals haven't been able to catch up, and some are \"quite small.\" By contrast, the EU said, Google has more than 70 percent of the European market for selling ads that run alongside search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Google did not say whether it would appeal.</p><p>\"We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission's concerns,\" Google's senior vice president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said in a statement. \"Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe.\"</p><p>E-marketing analyst Bill Fisher noted a \"growing wave of sentiment\" toward curbing the influence of Big Tech and said that even if the EU's rulings apply only to Google's European operations, Google should \"begin to open up, become more transparent and possibly look to alter some of its business practices\" worldwide.</p><p>Earlier this month, a British expert panel recommended the government curb the dominance of giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google. In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up the biggest American tech companies, accusing them of wielding too much power.</p><p>This week, as part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists, Facebook agreed to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p>The EU has led the way in promoting tougher regulation of big tech companies. Besides cracking down on antitrust breaches by Microsoft and Intel, it has enforced stricter data privacy rules that affect Facebook and other social media companies.</p><p>U.S. regulators haven't been as tough, though the Federal Trade Commission recently created a task force focused on anti-competitive behavior in the industry.</p><p>Last year, Vestager fined Google a record 4.34 billion euros ($5 billion at the time) for forcing cellphone makers using the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.</p><p>In 2017, she penalized Google 2.42 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for manipulating online shopping search results and directing visitors to its comparison-shopping service, Google Shopping, at the expense of its rivals.</p><p>Google, which is appealing those two earlier fines, has said it has since made adjustments to its shopping results and will start asking European users of Android phones if they want to use other search or browser apps.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow the AP's coverage of technology at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/apf-technology\">https://apnews.com/apf-technology</url> and of social platforms at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms\">https://apnews.com/Socialplatforms</url></p><p>___</p><p>Chan reported from London.

The ruling brings to nearly $10 billion the fines imposed against Google by the European Union. And it comes at a time when big tech companies around the world are facing increasing regulatory pressure and fierce political attacks over privacy violations, online misinformation, hate speech and other abuses.</p><p>Still, the latest penalty isn't likely to have much effect on Google's business. It involves practices the company says it already ended, and the sum is just a fraction of the $31 billion in profit that its parent. Alphabet, made last year.</p><p>Alphabet stock rose 2 percent on Wall Street on Wednesday.</p><p>The EU ruling applies to a narrow portion of Google's ad business: when Google sells ads next to Google search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Investigators found that Google inserted exclusivity clauses in its contracts that barred these websites from running similarly placed ads sold by Google's rivals.</p><p>As a result, advertisers and website owners \"had less choice and likely faced higher prices that would be passed on to consumers,\" said the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>Anyone who suffered from Google's behavior can seek compensation through national courts, she said.</p><p>EU regulators opened their investigation in 2016 - seven years after Microsoft filed a complaint - though by that time, Google had already made some changes to give customers more freedom to show competing ads. For that reason, regulators did not require a specific remedy to restore competition.</p><p>But Vestager said it appeared rivals haven't been able to catch up, and some are \"quite small.\" By contrast, the EU said, Google has more than 70 percent of the European market for selling ads that run alongside search results on third-party websites.</p><p>Google did not say whether it would appeal.</p><p>\"We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the commission's concerns,\" Google's senior vice president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said in a statement. \"Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe.\"</p><p>E-marketing analyst Bill Fisher noted a \"growing wave of sentiment\" toward curbing the influence of Big Tech and said that even if the EU's rulings apply only to Google's European operations, Google should \"begin to open up, become more transparent and possibly look to alter some of its business practices\" worldwide.</p><p>Earlier this month, a British expert panel recommended the government curb the dominance of giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google. In the U.S., Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up the biggest American tech companies, accusing them of wielding too much power.</p><p>This week, as part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists, Facebook agreed to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKVT-032119B03art1xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28961A86BF6765 NWBKVT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPB-H791-DXVP-V3PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409761</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"531\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New England Newspapers, Inc., Bennington Banner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The ruling brings to nearly $10 billion the fines imposed against Google by the European Union. And it comes at a time when big tech companies around the world are facing increasing regulatory pressure and fierce political attacks over privacy violations, online misinformation, hate speech and other abuses. </p><p>Still, the latest penalty isn't likely to have much effect on Google's business. It involves practices the company says it already ended, and the sum is just a fraction of the $31 billion in profit that its parent, Alphabet, made last year. The EU ruling applies to a narrow portion of Google's ad business: when Google sells ads next to Google search results on third-party websites. Starbucks to test recyclable cups, redesign stores SEATTLE \u2014 Starbucks says it plans to test both recyclable and compostable cups over the next year. Customers in New York, San Francisco, Seattle, London and Vancouver, British Colombia, will help test the cups, which use fiber, paper and other materials in place of plastic liners. The company also said it plans to redesign its stores as it adapts to increasing mobile pick-up and delivery orders. Changes will vary by location. For example, in a neighborhood with three Starbucks cafes, one might be changed to an express format while another offers delivery. Starbucks' U.S. mobile orders more than doubled between 2016 and 2018, to 12 percent of orders. But there have been complaints about congestion in stores. Judge: Tootsie pops packaging too similar to Dum Dums' TOLEDO, Ohio \u2014 A federal judge is siding with the makers of Dum Dums lollipops in its lawsuit against a rival candy maker. Ohio-based Spangler Candy Co. is suing Tootsie Roll Industries because it says the Chicago-based company's new Charms Mini Pops packaging too closely resembles the Dum Dums packaging. A preliminary injunction handed down in Ohio says Tootsie Roll must at least temporarily stop using its packaging for Mini Pops. Tootsie Roll has disputed Spangler's claims. A message seeking comment was left Wednesday with Tootsie Roll. The judge said in a decision issued last week that the Tootsie Roll is using packaging nearly identical to the Dum Dums packaging, right down to a red bag with white lettering.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001041670</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPB-1CS1-DY6F-J15G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"419\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>ML2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002RXQ</classCode><className>SPANGLER CANDY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002S0D</classCode><className>TOOTSIE ROLL INDUSTRIES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
