Despite a weakening economy, many household names reached prices well above anyone's expectations. Fortescue, Wesfarmers, CSL, Qantas, and JB Hi-Fi all ended the year in uncharted territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The investment director at Bennelong Australian Equity Partners, Julian Beaumont, says the past twelve months held a lot of surprises.</p><p>\"Fair to say that 2019 was a better year than most would have ever expected. If you were able to predict the uncertainty hanging over markets from the trade-war, Brexit, Hong Kong riots, weaker than expected global and domestic growth, and poor corporate earnings, then you wouldn't probably have predicted a strong market.</p><p>\"And it really just goes to show that whatever is happening politically, socially, and on a macro front, aren't necessarily the drivers of stock market returns. Ultimately the biggest driver of returns this year was interest rates and their precipitous fall.\"</p><p>The lower interest rate environment boosts other asset prices. So while stock prices might be more expensive than ever before, this is not because companies are performing better than ever before.</p><p>\"Over-valuation has to be put in context.

They've got an enormous amount of debt so they've got very little strategic flexibility to generate growth,'' he said.</p><p>Unusually, advanced markets have more geopolitical risk than emerging markets currently, he says, which makes it very tough for investors.</p><p>\"You put all these things together and I honestly think it's the toughest environment we've seen since 1982. I don't envy the job of chief investment officers trying to allocate, whether they're going to go to Australia or not, hedge or not hedge, cash and fixed interest or listed equities.\"</p><p>So what were the best, worst, and most interesting performances of 2019?</p><p>Winners</p><p>Fortescue, up <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">184 per cent to $10.91</emphasis></p><p>The iron-ore pure play had the biggest gains of the S&amp;P/ASX200 during 2019, rising from $3.80 to $10.91. The company has been surfing a boom in iron ore prices driven by extremely strong demand from Chinese steel mills and global supply constraints after a fatal dam collapse at an iron ore mine in Brazil. Iron ore prices hit $US120 per tonne early in 2019, delivering a windfall to Australia's big miners and in particular Fortescue. Shareholders were also keen on the company's record annual dividend of $1.14, which included a special dividend of 11??. However, the extraordinary run experienced by Fortescue is less likely to be repeated in 2020 as iron ore prices experienced the steepest monthly decline in more than eight years in September as US-China trade wars and a slow-down in growth weighs on Chinese steel-making demand. And as global supply returns to normal as Vale resumes production in Brazil.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Xero, up 94 per cent to $83.23</emphasis></p><p>Shares in accounting platform Xero almost doubled in value over the course of 2019 starting the year at $42.02 and ending at $83.23. Led by chief executive Steve Vamos, the company capitalised on the move of many small business owners to its cloud-based accounting platforms. It booked a 32 per cent increase in half-yearly revenue at $338.7 million in November. Xero made a modest profit after tax of $1.3 million but Mr Vamos said Xero's focus was on \"reinvesting for growth\". The Kiwi-founded company's dominance is expected to continue, as Xero hit the two-million subscriber mark late in 2019. Investor John Hempton described the company as \"growing like a weed\" as it focused on expansion in the United Kingdom and United States. Xero ended the year with a change of chairman with former Telstra chief executive David Thodey set to take over from Graham Smith who is set to step down due to family health issues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Afterpay, up 135 per cent to $29.20</emphasis></p><p>Afterpay's eventful 2019 saw its share price rocket upwards despite uncertainty over an Austrac-directed audit of its anti-money laundering compliance. The buy-now, pay-later darling rounded the year out with good news: the audit found no solid evidence the millennial-focused payments platform was being used for money laundering. The company told investors in December it had hit $1 billion in monthly sales and has reported solid growth in the US and UK markets. However, there are still some voices urging caution: UBS has taken the most bearish view of the stock so far, after it initiated coverage of the stock in October with a sell recommendation and a target price of $17.60.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Appen, up 82 per cent to $23.37</emphasis></p><p>This artificial intelligence (AI) company got as high as $31.42 this year, thereby cementing itself as a key Australian export with \"crowdsource\" contractors feeding big tech platforms information to improve machine-based learning functionality. This member of the tech-group known as 'WAAAX' posted strong numbers throughout the year including a number of profit upgrades, but it lost share price momentum in August when half year results raised questions over whether it overpaid when buying San Francisco AI startup Figure Eight. Appen rounded out the year with renewed share price traction after analysts at Bell Potter upgraded the stock to a buy, saying it was \"puzzling\" that the share price hadn't recovered since the middle of the year and adding a target price of $27.50</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JB Hi-Fi, up 80 per cent to $39.82</emphasis></p><p>Electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi was the first retailer to report full-year results against a backdrop of negative sentiment that had some investors bracing for the worst. But yet again, chief executive Richard Murray proved he and his team know how to retail, posting a 6.5 per cent increase in earnings. While Murray has remained confident on his business' ability to execute on the \"basics of retail\" amid a difficult market, his outlook for the rest of the financial year is one of cautious optimism, believing consumers still aren't raring to spend. Nevertheless, the company remains on the front foot, looking at new small-format stores to tap into retail locations such as airports, and continuing to expand its product offering in key categories. The amount of JB Hi-Fi shares held in a short position has fallen from 17.9 per cent at the start of 2019 down to 11.7 per cent. The one dark spot on the business' record is its Good Guys home appliances business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aristocrat Leisure up 59 per cent to $34.63</emphasis></p><p>Slot machine giant Aristocrat Leisure delivered a jackpot for investors this year as its pokies business in the United States delivered earnings growth and the online computer game division became a revenue powerhouse. The group grew normalised full-year profit by 22 per cent to $752 million - about 3 per cent higher expected. Revenue from Aristocrat's North American pokies business grew 23 per cent to $1.9 billion, while profit jumped 25 per cent to $1 billion. Aristocrat's portfolio of online video games including War of Clans and RAID: Shadow League brought in almost as much revenue ($1.7 billion, up 33 per cent), but less profit ($529 million). However the company says the games division will become more profitable as new titles reach a critical mass of players and it can trim a hefty marketing bill. A strengthening balance sheet has investors hopeful of buybacks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CSL, up 52 per cent to $282.29</emphasis></p><p>Investors can thank a global shortage of immunoglobulin for pushing Melbourne-headquartered biotech CSL's shares to record highs this year. The group's market value soared to $129 billion - making it the second largest company on the ASX, behind Commonwealth Bank. Immunoglobulin (or IG) is one of the proteins the company extracts from donors' blood plasma that can be used to treat rare and deadly immunodeficiency and auto-immune diseases. Demand for IG has been growing and CSL is already the world's largest producer. The stock is trading on a high price-to-earnings multiple, but true believers say that's justified by its earnings growth - up 55 per cent over the past five years to $2.7 billion. All eyes will be on a heart-attack prevention human trial in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goodman Group, up 29 per cent to $13.71</emphasis></p><p>Industrial giant Goodman has topped its real estate investment trust peers as one of the best performers for the 2019 year, thanks to the booming e-commerce sector. While warehouses were once the ugly duckling of the corporate real estate sector, they are now sought-after fulfilment centres, and Goodman Group is purely focused on industrial real estate. As a result Goodman topped the annual BDO REIT survey based on an overall return of 55.8 per cent - more than double the return on the previous year. BDO's national leader for Real Estate and Construction, Sebastian Stevens, said the performance of the Industrial REITs was driven by the value of high-quality assets in urban corridors which command strong rents.\"Online shopping continues to fuel demand for fulfilment centres for retailers. They want well located distribution centres to efficiently service their shops and customers. This has been good news for REITs such as Goodman and is resulting in a surge in speculative industrial development,\" Mr Stevens said. CEO Greg Goodman has forecast a strong 2020 and earnings per security are expected to be 56.3 cents in 2019-20, up 9 per cent on FY19.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Woolies and Coles, up 33 per cent to $37.37 and $15.25 respectively</emphasis></p><p>The 33 per cent rise in Australia's major supermarkets' share price can be in part attributed to small brightly-coloured plastic things. In 2019, Coles and Woolworths both realised collectables were a surefire way to boost sales and foster loyalty. It helped both stores post strong like-for-like sales in each quarter, with Woolworths' growing a record 6.6 per cent for the first quarter of 2020 and Coles' staying positive despite broad expectations of a drop. But the supermarkets' success stretches beyond gimmicky marketing tools. As one of Australia's largest retailers, Woolworths attracted investors as a safe bet in an unpredictable landscape. Similarly, investors interest in Coles was piqued after its successful de-merger from Wesfarmers last year, with the $15 stock under half the price of its competitor and chief executive Steven Cain on a $1 billion cost-cutting warpath. With price wars at a ceasefire (for now), both supermarkets are looking towards online and service as ways to bolster market share. However, as German hypermarket Kaufland is set to arrive next year, they could find themselves under a new wave of pressure in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qantas, up 26 pc to $7.33</emphasis></p><p>The flying kangaroo ended the year near all-time highs as investors gained confidence the airline can generate stable earnings in a slowing economy. Qantas' domestic network, the backbone of the company's earnings, faces only tepid competition from Virgin Australia, which is pulling back capacity and focusing more on leisure travel in an effort to stem its losses. Qantas' international arm has been helped by foreign carriers facing higher oil prices and pulling capacity out of Australia for the first time in close to a decade. Meanwhile, earnings continue to grow in the group's loyalty business, which now offers everything from health insurance to credit cards, acting as a buffer to the perpetually volatile airline business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Domino's Pizza, up 33 per cent to $54.10</emphasis></p><p>Just like a fresh pizza pie, Domino's shares have risen throughout 2019, regardless of the company's falling local profit and franchisee concerns over its ???fortressing' strategy. But shareholder enthusiasm for the discount pizza slinger isn't based on its 825 Australian stores, with the lion's share of revenue and profit growth coming from its nascent Japanese and European network. Earnings for those regions were up 32.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, with chief executive Don Meij imploring investors to look abroad at its full-year results in August. \"If you're an investor in our business, north of 80 per cent of profit growth will come from international markets,\" he said. However, its controversial ???fortressing' strategy - where the company adjusts the delivery boundaries of existing Domino's stores to allow for new stores - has gotten off to a slow start. Total sales for the first quarter of 2020 actually fell compared to last year, though same-store sales increased. Domino's still maintains guidance of 3-6 per cent same-store growth and a 7-9 per cent increase in store footprint over the next 3-5 years.</p><p>Losers</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Costa Group, down 61 per cent to $2.53</emphasis></p><p>2019 was a tough year for Costa Group, which describes itself as \"Australia's largest grower, packer and marketer of fresh fruit and vegetables\". While Costa ends the year an industry heavyweight, its stock price is far lighter than 12 months ago. What happened is that the year started off bad for Costa, with a January announcement of a profit downgrade, and then got worse. Events culminated with a $176 million capital raising announced in late October to pay down debt, as the company cited the impact of drought, high water prices, and smaller harvests from key crops on its financial performance. All up, the company has issued four profit warnings in calendar 2019. For Costa, the challenges over the past 12-15 months have been many. It has had to contend with \"crumbly\" raspberries which reduced yields from its raspberry crops and led to a substantial replanting program, low prices for mushrooms, and extreme dry conditions that affected the size and yield of major crops like avocados, blueberries, and the late-season citrus crop.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pilbara Minerals, down 64 per cent to 26??</emphasis></p><p>Pilbara Minerals is one of Australia's biggest producers of lithium and its share price was at $1.18 in early 2018. When 2019 started lithium was still highly popular, having tripled in price since 2010, as it is a key ingredient in the rechargeable batteries that power electric vehicles, computers, mobile phones, and energy storage. However, the rush to mine lithium saw too many producers bring too much volume too quickly, and the Chinese uptake of electric vehicles has been slower than many predicted. All this undermined demand, sending the price of lithium derived from Australian hard-rock plunging 40 per cent. Pilbara Minerals' stock price plunged to a three-year low by December. It has now delayed expanding it Pilgangoora lithium-tantalum project citing market conditions. While few dispute the long-term prospects for lithium alongside the electric vehicle revolution, this year has been a tough one for producers with one mine being placed into the hands of administrators and other operators, including Pilbara Minerals, scaling back production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blackmores, down 29 per cent to $86.45</emphasis></p><p>\"We're too fat, we're too bureaucratic, we're too complex and we don't make decisions quick enough. And we have to address those things,\" Marcus Blackmore told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald back in May. It was refreshing candour from a business leader dealing with a challenging year for the vitamins maker. At the time Mr Blackmore was the interim chief executive of the company founded by his father Maurice, following the resignation in February of former chief executive Richard Henfrey. Blackmores was one of the first stocks on the ASX to surpass $200, back in late 2015, and started 2019 above $120. But investors have since watched the stock fall as low as $63.64 in August, as the market absorbed a series of announcements. This included the CEO's sudden departure in February, a long-running search for its next CEO, the resignation of the boss of its Australian and New Zealand operations in May, and a 24 per cent fall in full year net profit to $53 million. Changes in Chinese e-commerce laws reduced China sales by 15 per cent. Some bright news emerged in July, when Blackmores announced the appointment of Alastair Symington as its next CEO. Blackmores shares ended the year at $86.45, which was 29 per cent lower than 2018, but above the depths plumbed in August.</p><p>Big four banks,</p><p>The big four banks have generally lagged the wider market in 2019, against a backdrop of slow credit growth, costly customer refunds, and low interest rates. However, some have performed better than others. The country's largest bank Commonwealth Bank has been the standout of the majors, avoiding the falls of rivals Westpac, ANZ Bank and National Australia Bank in the latest quarter. This slump happened as Westpac, NAB and ANZ each reported soft profits in the year to September. Their outlook for the year ahead was not much better, even as the property market improves. The weakness was compounded in November by the explosive money-laundering lawsuit lodged against Westpac, which sparked a dramatic resignation from former CEO Brian Hartzer, and a pledge by chairman Lindsay Maxsted to step down early. Further weighing on the share price, Westpac had cut its dividend and raised capital earlier that month. There are fears NAB has its own money laundering compliance problems lurking, and it has acknowledged it is talking with the financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC. ANZ has said it has no material issues with AUSTRAC, but its chairman David Gonski has also said he can't promise there won't be any surprises.</p><p>Chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, Hugh Dive, points out that CBA settled its lawsuit from AUSTRAC last year with a $700 million penalty, and its September quarter profit was well-received by the market.</p><p>\"CBA had a relatively good quarter. They've already had their AUSTRAC fine,\" Mr Dive said.</p><p>While the profits of banks have been soft, however, the sector's share prices did receive a boost this year from the royal commission's final report in February being less tough than feared, and the re-election of the Morrison government.</p><p>Outside the big four, a particularly weak performer has been Bank of Queensland, whose shares have fallen 22 per cent since the start of the year. The regional bank has had a tough year, posting disappointing profits, cutting its dividend, and warning of a weaker bottom line result next year. The bank's new chief executive, former Westpac banker George Frazis, also tapped shareholders for another $275 million in equity capital.</p><p>All share prices are until December 24. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contributors: Charlotte Grieve, Dominic Powell, Cara Waters, Emma Koehn, Darren Gray, Nick Toscano, Patrick Hatch, Carolyn Cummins, and Clancy Yeates.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520219350</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV7-F581-DY19-C055-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3237\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

G\u00e9n\u00e9ration de rupture, la 5G va permettre un saut de performance, en termes de d\u00e9bit, de d\u00e9lai de transmission, et de fiabilit\u00e9 de la communication. Ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s nouvelles vont permettre la ville intelligente, l'industrie connect\u00e9e, l'agriculture connect\u00e9e, les v\u00e9hicules autonomes... et probablement d'autres usages encore \u00e0 inventer. Mais le lancement de la 5G en 2020 suscite aussi des questions. La 5G ne va-t-elle pas nous pousser \u00e0 une surconsommation num\u00e9rique, accroissant l'exposition aux \u00e9crans, la surveillance et d\u00e9gradant la plan\u00e8te\u00a0? Ces questions nous interpellent, et elles nous obligent\u00a0: la mission de l'Arcep est que la 5G se d\u00e9veloppe comme un bien commun. La technologie n'est pas bonne ou mauvaise en soi, c'est aux d\u00e9cideurs publics de la mettre au service des citoyens et du pays. Les travaux de l'Arcep en 2020 y veilleront\u00a0: connectivit\u00e9 du territoire, et non des seuls grands centres urbains, concurrence et libert\u00e9 de choix des utilisateurs, comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 du pays, mais aussi impact environnemental des r\u00e9seaux.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wansquare.trias.fr/wansquare/images/bibli/3a0704a4ddbbeaa8b9a34c2ac3148.jpg\">Lien vers l\u00b4image</url>                    S\u00e9bastien Soriano / Le Figaro (S\u00e9bastien Soriano)  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>S\u00e9bastien Soriano - Arcep</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WANSQR-28473</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WANSQR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV2-NK41-F17T-C4TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463128</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"374\"/><timeReceived>03:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Wansquare tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Wansquare</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"63167\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>jeudi 26 d\u00e9cembre 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>French</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

One was the quiet end of my work at The Parallax[1] after the sole sponsor of that information-security site, the security-software vendor Avast, ended this relationship in January[2]. I knew that was a risk factor going in-as I admitted in last December's year-in-review post[3]-but I also thought The Parallax would find new sponsors quickly enough. Unfortunately, that has yet to happen. The other was the shrinking of my role at Yahoo Finance[4]. Starting in the spring, I went from regularly writing six or more posts a month to just two or one the most recent being in October. </p><p>Why that's happened isn't totally clear to me, but I know that the folks at Yahoo Finance have increasingly emphasized live video coverage from their NYC studios while leaning more on such other Verizon Media properties as Engadget for tech coverage[5]. Meanwhile, my own story pitches this year didn't feature any topics quite as captivating as self-driving Cadillacs[6] or giant rocket launches[7]. Whatever the causes, seeing a high-paying gig expire and a high-profile gig diminish-after USA Today cut my column back to a twice-monthly frequency[8]-made this my first year of full-time freelancing without real anchor clients. Meaning, I've started most months of the year without being able to count on the same set of companies for the majority of my income. And then I took too long to work the problem[9] instead of hoping that my batting average at Yahoo would improve. In that context, it ranks as a minor miracle that my income for 2019 only fell by about 15 percent compared to 2018. I made up the difference by writing for a batch of new places-the Columbia Journalism Review[10], Fast Company[11], TechCrunch[12], The Atlantic[13], and Tom's Guide[14]-and becoming more of a regular at some of these new clients as well as some older ones, in particular Fast Company[15] and the trade publication FierceVideo[16]. Among all those stories that ran in all of those places, these stand out months later: I observed the made-up holiday of 'Data Privacy Day' in the Washington Post by suggesting ways that tech firms could demonstrate actual concern about our privacy[17]. Eleven months later, they don't seem to have taken my advice. I wrote an explainer for FierceVideo of PBS's digital strategy[18]-read, why you couldn't get local PBS stations on any streaming services-that led to me getting a heads-up about that overdue online debut that I wrote up at USA Today[19]. This is why it's good to write for trade pubs: They can help you build sources for later on. A year after the Federal Communications Commission's 2015 net-neutrality rules officially vanished, I looked in vain[20] at telecom investment trends and some of the small Internet providers named earlier as net-neutrality victims for proof that deleting these regulations had boosted broadband buildout. In my debut at TechCrunch, I documented how long each of the four nationwide wireless carriers keeps records of your location[21] as determined by cell-site records-as well as the lack of a business rationale for retaining this data for as long as five years. This TC post is paywalled, but I later revisited some of this reporting for a December USA Today column on location privacy[22]. My experience loaning my iPad to my kid without a real kid's mode to limit her access led me to write an overdue rant for Yahoo Finance about Apple's unhelpfulness to parents[23] who don't want to buy a new tablet for every member of their family. I revisited a staple of my tech-policy coverage from five years ago, transparency reports[24] that inventory how tech firms respond to government demands for data, to unpack the tech industry's partial retreat from this concept[25]. This ran at The Atlantic, a place where I've long wanted to get a byline, after a prolonged round of rejections from other places. Lesson re-learned: Stubbornness helps. Of all the debunking of 5G hype I did this year, I may have most enjoyed poking holes in the announcement by AT...nd the Washington Post[26] about a vaporous 5G-for-journalism venture. I also launched a Patreon page[27] that's contributed a modest amount of income and might do more were I less apathetic about promoting it. And I had more of my travel this year covered by conference organizers in return for my moderating panels at their events; see after the jump for a map of where I flew for work in 2019. The series of sponsored (read: well-compensated) feature-length explainers about 5G that I did for Ars Technica in December have me ending 2019 in better shape than I'd thought possible a few months earlier. I can also feel a grim sort of pride at remaining in this profession at all after a brutal decade for the journalism industry. But I know what I need to do in 2020: Find more ways to make money that don't rest on the brittle business of online programmatic advertising.I created the map below at theGreat Circle Mapper[28]site, following the advice ofTiffany Funk atthe One Mile At A Time blog[29]. Blue lines represent flights booked through United (which include segments on Air China, ANA, Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and Swiss), with one in a slightly darker blue on Porter Airlines. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=Color:%231f369b,IAD-IAH-LAS,LAS-IAD,IAD-BRU-BCN,BCN-EWR-DCA,IAD-IAH-AUS,AUS-IAH-IAD,IAD-BRU-SVQ,SVQ-FRA-IAD,DCA-EWR-SFO,SFO-IAD,IAD-DEN,+DEN-TPA-IAD,+color:%23003d66,+IAD-YTZ,+Color:%231f369b,+YYZ-IAD,DCA-IAH-SAT,+SAT-IAH-DCA,+DCA-ORD-SFO,+SFO-LAS,+LAS-SFO,+STS-SFO-DCA,IAD-MUC-TXL,+TXL-EWR-DCA,+DCA-EWR-MSY,+MSY-IAD,IAD-PVD,+BOS-EWR-DCA,IAD-LGA,IAD-SFO-PVG-FUK-HND,+NRT-IAD,+IAD-GVA-LIS,+LIS-EWR-DCA\">http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=Color:%231f369b,IAD-IAH-LAS,LAS-IAD,IAD-BRU-BCN,BCN-EWR-DCA,IAD-IAH-AUS,AUS-IAH-IAD,IAD-BRU-SVQ,SVQ-FRA-IAD,DCA-EWR-SFO,SFO-IAD,IAD-DEN,+DEN-TPA-IAD,+color:%23003d66,+IAD-YTZ,+Color:%231f369b,+YYZ-IAD,DCA-IAH-SAT,+SAT-IAH-DCA,+DCA-ORD-SFO,+SFO-LAS,+LAS-SFO,+STS-SFO-DCA,IAD-MUC-TXL,+TXL-EWR-DCA,+DCA-EWR-MSY,+MSY-IAD,IAD-PVD,+BOS-EWR-DCA,IAD-LGA,IAD-SFO-PVG-FUK-HND,+NRT-IAD,+IAD-GVA-LIS,+LIS-EWR-DCA</url> Maps generated by theGreat Circle Mapper[30]- copyright Karl L.

This follows unilateral policies announced by the U.K., France and Germany.</p><p>Policymakers recently widened the scope of the tax, which they hope to approve by April 2019, to target international streaming giants such as Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Following the changes, the digital service tax would apply to all suppliers of online content, including video, audio, games, or text on a digital platform, regardless of whether they own the content or have acquired the rights to distribute it. Politicians also voted to lower the minimum threshold for EU revenues liable for taxation from  50 million to  40 million.</p><p>The policy will, however, remain a temporary framework until a global solution is agreed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, and the United Nation's G-20. That agreement is not expected until 2020.</p><p>In another move that impacts multinational tech companies, the European Commission set a Feb. 28, 2019, deadline for the U.S. government to nominate a key official to address complaints about access to personal data by American authorities for compliance with the Privacy Shield, a set of laws governing transatlantic data transfers between the U.S. and EU. Companies like Facebook, Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Twitter Inc. could face legal costs and operational challenges if the agreement were to unravel.</p><p>Media companies face new content rules</p><p>The Council of EU ministers will review amendments to media laws in 2019, including a new requirement for Netflix and other video-on-demand platforms to include a minimum of 30% of European content in their catalogs. The proposed law would apply to both broadcasters and online platforms such as Alphabet's YouTube and Facebook.</p><p>As part of the new measures, regulators plan to impose stricter rules on any content inciting violence, hatred and terrorism, as well as pornographic material and proposals to restrict children's exposure to content showing unhealthy food and beverages, tobacco, electronic cigarettes and alcohol. The legislation would also limit advertising content for broadcasters between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.</p><p>Should the EU ministers agree to the revisions, member states will be given 21 months to adopt the new rules.</p><p>Also coming in early 2019 are negotiations over copyright reform across the EU's 28 member states. If the measure known as the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market receives approval, it will take two years to take effect, a parliamentary spokesperson said. The law's most contentious issue has been Article 13, which places an obligation on internet platforms and websites to police user-posted content for copyright infringements, making the site owners liable for content posted without the correct licenses. Article 11, another highly contested part of the directive, would require online platforms to compensate news organizations before linking to their articles.</p><p>The legislation has received strong support from the music industry, which struggles with illegally uploaded content on online platforms with user-generated content such as Facebook and YouTube. Critics have said the law could have unintended consequences for creativity and freedom of expression.</p><p>Facebook faces further scrutiny</p><p>Facebook will continue to face scrutiny in 2019. The European parliament recently voted to launch a full audit of Facebook's privacy practices in the wake of various data breaches acknowledged by the social media company in 2018. While Facebook's Cambridge Analytica LLC privacy scandal   in which Facebook acknowledged that 87 million global users had their personal data improperly shared with third parties   occurred before the enactment of GDPR, a more recent breach could trigger a GDPR penalty. The latter incident, discovered on Sept. 25, impacted up to 5 million European users and could result in a fine as high as $1.63 billion, or 4% of Facebook's $40.7 billion global revenue for the prior financial year, under GDPR rules.</p><p>Facebook is also facing potential sanctions for failing to comply with EU consumer rules and could be penalized by as much as 4% of annual turnover under new proposals being discussed by the European Parliament and the Council.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-48997778</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V1Y-9321-JDVW-N2KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"995\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

And although 2019 got rolling with an advantage - coming off the worst December performance in ages - the rally doesn't look terribly strained just yet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even more surprising are some of the names leading the charge. High-profile stocks, such as the FANG tech companies, have enjoyed solid gains. But some of the biggest winners are names that have fallen off many investors' radars, or were never on them to begin with.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What's more heartening is that many of these new uptrends seem built to last for all the right reasons - they're either regaining relevancy, growing the bottom line or both.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a look at 10 of the markets most surprising large- and mid-cap stock winners so far in 2019. Their underlying stories are taking a turn for the better, at least in investors' eyes, and all of them merit a closer look, if only for a mental note to reference at a later date.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s002-19-best-stocks-to-buy-for-2019/index.html\">19 Best Stocks to Buy for 2019 (And 5 to Sell)</url></p><p>Roku</p><p>Market value: $5.7 billion</p><p>2019 performance-to-date: 64%</p><p>Most stocks lost at least a little ground during the fourth quarter of 2018. Roku (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=roku&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">ROKU</url>, $50.20), however, took on far more than its fair share of water, falling from October's peak of more than $77 per share to December's low near $26. Investors clearly feared the streaming platform company's best days were in the rear-view mirror.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>Roku released its preliminary fourth-quarter numbers in early January, including a total of 27 million actively used devices. That was the fourth consecutive quarter the company saw at least 40% year-over-year growth in its active customer base. That matters so much more than raw sales figures of its devices.</p><p>Unit sales initially were the metric of most investor interest, but Roku has shifted its focus to advertising revenue, selling ad space on the splash screens and other menu-based pages viewed via its set-top receivers and licensed televisions. During the third quarter, not only did ad and services revenue eclipse the $100 million mark for the first time ever, but it was the third consecutive quarter that ad sales were greater than hardware revenue - a disparity that continues to widen. Better yet, gross margins for its platform business finally appear to be stabilizing around 70%.</p><p>It's a savvy business move, in the same vein as the one Apple (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=aapl&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">AAPL</url>) is making to depend less on devices like the iPhone and lean more on the digital products consumed via that hardware. Digital products and advertisements can drive recurring revenue, whereas the market for devices is limited, and now saturated.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t018-s001-101-best-dividend-stocks-to-buy-2019-and-beyond/index.html\">101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond</url></p><p>Xerox</p><p>Market value: $6.9 billion</p><p>2019 performance-to-date: 52%</p><p>Yes, the company with a name that was once synonymous with photocopying is still around.</p><p>But Xerox (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=xrx&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">XRX</url>, $30.00) isn't just photocopiers any longer. In fact, copy machines and printing are the least important growth engine for the company these days. The old company has found new life by offering software - document-management software in particular. It also recently closed on a deal that will bolster its budding 3D printing business.</p><p>The stronger focus on software in an environment where traditional document printing is a fading business is a step in the right direction. So far it hasn't helped enough, though, with revenue steadily sinking since 2010.</p><p>But this year could be a turning point.</p><p>\" XRX had a big resurgence in January and it's based on three things: stabilizing revenue, new management installed by Icahn, and sustained free cash flow,\" says Tim Parker, a partner with New Jersey-based Regency Wealth Management. Parker adds, \"(Carl) Icahn saw the free cash flow and the potential for new management to come in to change up the culture and rationalize some of the business. Investors had largely given up on XRX, but now that things look like they are turning around, they are jumping back in.\"</p><p>That free cash flow should cumulatively total more than $3 billion between now and the end of 2021, according to the company's recently unveiled three-year plan.</p><p>The same efficiency improvements and innovations could drive \" at least $4.00 of adjusted EPS in 2020,\" though Xerox already is moving toward that goal. Analysts had been calling for a 2019 bottom line of $3.53 per share, up from 2018's $3.46. But Xerox offered full-year profit guidance of between $3.70 and $3.80, suggesting the pros may improve their outlooks in the foreseeable future.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t038-s001-the-5-best-investments-you-can-make-in-2019/index.html\">The 5 Best Investments You Can Make in 2019</url></p><p>Coupa Software</p><p>Market value: $5.7 billion</p><p>2019 performance-to-date: 51%</p><p>To be fair, Coupa Software (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=coup&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">COUP</url>, $94.72) wasn't a surprise to everyone - Kiplinger's Personal Finance columnist James K. Glassman had this mid-cap stock as one of his       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/t052-c016-s002-james-k-glassman-s-top-10-stock-picks-for-2019.html\">top stock picks for 2019</url>.</p><p>Coupa is anything but a household name. Aside from a relatively small market cap of $5 billion keeping it off most investors' radars, its target market is enterprise-level entities - not individual consumers. It's also not profitable, disqualifying it as a potential investment for a few would-be buyers that might stumble across it.</p><p>It still merits a closer look, especially because a swing to a respectable profit is on the radar.</p><p>Analysts expect revenue growth of 36% this year followed by 24% top-line growth in 2020. That's expected to bring Coupa from a per-share loss of 21 cents last year to a 13-cent profit in 2019, followed by 20 cents per share of earnings in fiscal 2020.</p><p>The key to that margin-widening revenue growth is a superior product that business customers are only beginning to appreciate. Coupa offers a robust business spend management (or BSM) platform that lets large organizations streamline time-consuming activities like expense reimbursement, invoicing and purchasing. Forrester Research recently called Coupa a leading company within the contract lifecycle management (CLM) segment of the BSM market.</p><p>The kicker: A huge degree of Coupa's business is recurring, subscription-based revenue. In its most recently reported quarter, $55.4 million of its $61.7 million in sales came from subscriptions, up 39% year-over-year.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t058-s001-the-12-best-tech-stocks-for-a-2019-recovery/index.html\">The 12 Best Tech Stocks for a 2019 Recovery</url></p><p>General Electric</p><p>Market value: $86.9 billion</p><p>2019 performance-to-date: 37%</p><p>General Electric (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=ge&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">GE</url>, $10.37) executed what arguably was the most notable fall from grace of the modern era. Once the poster child of American industrialism, GE has been reduced to a mere fraction of its former self. Too many years of poor management and a failure to innovate have left the company saddled with debilitating debt. Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch believes, in a worst-case scenario,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/analyst-what-remains-of-ge-after-spinoffs-could-be-worth-2-a-share.html\">General Electric could literally be worthless</url>.</p><p>Something clearly has inspired investors over the course of the past few weeks, however. Shares are up 37% since the end of last year, and higher to the tune of 55% from their multiyear lows in mid-December.</p><p>The catalyst has been hope for a legitimate turnaround, bolstered by an increasing recognition that investors were a little too harsh on the stock in 2018. They may be onto something, according to CFRA analyst Jim Corridore's thoughts on General Electric's fourth quarter report. He wrote:</p><p>\" GE is making some progress in generating cash and restructuring operations, though it still has a long way to go. ... Revenues were stronger than we expected and GE has made progress on asset sales, and repositioning of assets. We were pleased to see GE reach a settlement with DOJ on its mortgage lender WMC for what it had already reserved for, as well as by fewer one-time charges. We expect a GE fix to take time, but today's results show some much needed progress.\"</p><p>The time that General Electric needs to solidify a turnaround, however, also gives investors time to second-guess their recent buy-in.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/retirement/t047-s001-15-reasons-you-ll-go-broke-in-retirement/index.html\">15 Reasons You'll Go Broke in Retirement</url></p><p>New York Times Co.</p><p>Market value: $5.3 billion</p><p>2019 performance-to-date: 43%</p><p>The newspaper business may be dying in the age of the internet, but at least one newspaper has capitalized on a unique time in American politics.</p><p>New York Times Co. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=nyt&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">NYT</url>, $31.37) shares are up 43% year-to-date \" despite being labeled 'The Failing New York Times' by President Trump. Or, more likely, because of being labeled 'The Failing New York Times' by POTUS,\" says Robert R. Johnson, CEO of asset management firm Economic Index Associates. Johnson, who also co-authored Invest With the Fed, goes on to explain, \" The election of Trump was the best 'news' for NYT shareholders, as the stock has more than doubled since election day in 2016.

Last quarter's revenue grew 10% year-over-year, driven higher by a 5% improvement in subscription sales and ad sales growth of 11%.

Operating income turned the corner around the same time.</p><p>New York Times Co's growth still isn't the being driven by a rekindled print business, however. Digital subscribers are doing most of the heavy lifting, with another 265,000 of them signing up during the fourth quarter - the biggest growth spurt since the post-election surge - to bring the newspaper's digital subscriber headcount to 3.4 million. Given the current pace, the company's goal of 10 million digital subscribers by 2025 doesn't seem out of reach - particularly if Trump is re-elected.</p><p>And credit where credit is due: Glassman also had NYT on his 10 buys for 2019.</p><p>SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-10-value-stocks-to-buy-for-2019-and-beyond/index.html\">10 Value Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond</url></p><p>Mirati Therapeutics</p><p>Market value: $2.3 billion</p><p>2019 performance-to-date: 70%</p><p>If you're not familiar with Mirati Therapeutics (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=mrtx&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">MRTX</url>, $72.19), don't sweat it.

Although SAGE-2017 would be administered daily for two weeks while Zulresso would only need to be dosed once, intravenously, for 60 continuous hours, it's an either/or matter.

Why would the telecom sector do that? They know their successful lobbying assault on net neutrality rules rests on shaky ground. Next month's court battle could easily reverse the FCC repeal, highlighting how the agency engaged in all manner of dubious behavior[2] to kowtow to the telecom sector. They also know that thanks to the shifting winds in Congress and rising public anger, there could soon be growing support for a net neutrality law. </p><p>Therefore, they want to pass their own, shitty, loophole-filled law to pre-empt tougher, better, state or federal protections. The same thing is happening on the privacy front. Like the successful lobbyist attack on net neutrality, the cross-industry assault on the FCC's fairly modest broadband privacy rules[3] back in 2017 pissed off those who were actually paying attention to it. Especially because those rules could have helped mitigate the growing roster of location data scandals[4] by giving consumers greater control over how their location data is collected and sold. As a result, we're starting to see a flood of cross-industry-backed legislation that pretends to fix the nation's lack of meaningful privacy guard rails, but whose real goal is to pre-empt any real state or federal efforts on that front. Case in point: the Google, Facebook, and Amazon-backed Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) has been circulating a proposal[5] it has been calling a \"grand bargain.\" Said bargain proposes some fairly basic guidelines, but again the main goal appears to be to pre-empt some of the tougher laws already on the state and federal books, something COPPA backers like Senator Ed Markey aren't particularly impressed by[6]:\"As Congress works to provide the American people with a comprehensive federal privacy law, we should build upon\u2014not dismantle\u2014existing safeguards,' Markey said, responding to ITIF's proposal. 'Getting rid of COPPA is literally like throwing the baby out with the bath water.\"To be clear, COPPA (the country's only real federal privacy guidelines largely governing children) is certainly a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's been the source of some of the only punishment the telecom sector has seen[7] for its longstanding mistreatment of consumer privacy. On the other hand, we've long noted that the law has plenty of problems[8] including inconsistent FTC enforcement, and terrible language that often creates idiotic hurdles[9] websites have to overcome. That said, you're not really fixing the problem if the industry's preferred legislation is just as bad. State-level solutions to both net neutrality and privacy have similarly been a mixed bag. California's proposed net neutrality solution[10], for example, largely does things right, copying the FCC's discarded net neutrality rules and even adding some useful things (like rules governing the anti-competitive abuse of usage caps). California's state-level privacy law, however, has been widely mocked[11] for being a ham-fisted, rushed solution that fails to remotely understand the problem at hand. But while groups like the ITIF (also backed by telecom companies, some of the worst offenders on privacy violations[12]) complain that the rise of multiple, discordant state-level privacy protections could create a confusing, fractured landscape of oversight, they brush over the fact that it was their clients that helped create that environment by lobbying to kill what really were some fairly modest FCC privacy and net neutrality rules. As such, maybe they're not the folks we should be leaning on to create new, pre-emptive federal guidelines on either front. Enter Marco Rubio, who has also started pushing industry backed[13] backed privacy legislation. But again, it's pretty clear that the focus is more on pre-empting tougher state and federal laws than trying to actually build some truly meaningful federal guidelines:\"But the bill would also require any new rules to preempt stronger state laws, like California's landmark consumer privacy act that was approved last year and is anticipated to go into effect in 2020. Industry groups have been calling for a preemption clause in any federal legislation, saying that one federal law would be easier for companies to navigate rather than being faced with a 'patchwork' of state and federal rules. \"It is critical that we do not create a regulatory environment that entrenches big tech corporations,' Rubio said in a statement to Axios. 'Congress must act, but it is even more important that Congress act responsibly to create a transparent, digital environment that maximizes consumer welfare over corporate welfare.\"While it's true that we need to be careful to avoid shitty federal privacy legislation, that last bit in particular is pretty disingenuous. These bills are being pushed by (and more than likely directly written by) the corporations Rubio is pretending to stand up to. Corporations that know full well that real oversight and informed, educated consumers with the right to opt out of mindless data collection and sales is going to cost the industry billions. They can pretend they're cool with that all they'd like, but it's pretty clear that's a future they'd like to avoid, preferably by getting their own legislation passed first with an eye on formally legalizing many of these companies worst (and most profitable) ambitions. Again, if we're going to finally build some meaningful legislative privacy guidelines, the foundation should be the result of a collective conversation among academics, legal experts, industry, consumer groups, and government. Given the high potential for a shitty law due to Congressional dysfunction, that's not going to be a pretty process, but if you've watched the percussive[14] series of total privacy failures[15] in recent years, it's fairly obvious it's a conversation we need to have. While industry giants obviously have a large role to play in this looming conversation, the entire foundation of any proposed solution should not be built by giant companies with comically-terrible track records on this subject, whose primary motivation is making those protections as flimsy and loophole-filled as possible.Permalink[16] | Comments[17] | Email This Story[18] [ 1]: <url

Virginia Senator Mark Warner's 15-point framework[2] is likely to be the basis for starting talks about policy for tech regulation. Based on his early proposal, we see three main regulatory introductions as most likely: 1. A US-version of GDPR. </p><p>Europe set the standard in consumer data protection with GDPR, and it would be surprising if the US didn't follow suit if not innovate. At a minimum, we would expect the US to adopt the most important points of GDPR, which are: Consent \u2014 clear consent of what users are allowing service providers to do with their data. Right to be informed \u2014 know who is using your data, for what, for how long, and who it will be shared with. Right to erasure \u2014 users can request to have data permanently deleted. Right to access \u2014 users can request to have access to their personal data. Right to data portability \u2014 users can request a file of their personal data that can be transported to another service. Data protection by design and default \u2014 data must be anonymized, and only necessary data must be processed. GDPR also comes with steep penalties \u2014 up to 4% of worldwide revenue for the prior year for breaching elements related to consent, individual rights, and data protection. A US version of GDPR seems the most likely policy to be enacted in 2019.2. Additional disclosure on political advertising. Russian tampering with the 2016 US Presidential election has been of great interest to the media and politicians, if not the public. Aside from the US-version of GDPR, additional disclosure around who is buying political ads is the other most likely regulatory outcome for 2019. As is so often the case with bad actors and those trying to stop them, the bad actors are likely to move on to another creative method of manipulation that we haven't thought of yet. Therefore, to make this policy effective, regulators will have to be thoughtful about how they define political advertisements so that they can try to stay one step ahead of bad actors that will certainly keep innovating. 3. Public interest and academic data access. Allowing public institutions and researchers access to anonymized datasets from tech's biggest platforms would seem to be an obvious net positive outcome that big tech should embrace as a sign of good faith. There are likely countless studies that could be performed on multi-billion user datasets about human behavior, economic influence, criminal activity, health, and more. While Warner's proposal suggests that qualified startups also have some level of access to big tech's datasets, we would expect big tech to lobby hard against this given data is a powerful moat for these companies. We'd expect that language to miss the final cut. Aside from the three elements above that we're most confident would be in a data protection bill, Senator Warner's proposal also includes suggestions around identifying fake accounts, determining the origin of posts/accounts, making platforms liable for content shared, and media literacy. While we don't object to these ideas in concept, the problem is that many of them touch on free speech, even if ever so lightly, and delve into the realm of subjectivity. For example, an inauthentic account doesn't necessarily mean it's an evil account \u2014 it could very well be someone using a pseudonym that allows them greater comfort to discuss difficult topics in a constructive way; even 'constructive' in that sense would be subjective. Given these sensitive issues, we don't expect legislation around fake accounts and content to be a part of 2019 policy introduction. One thing not included in Senator Warner's proposal that we'd like to see considered is introduced is greater user controls around what content these platforms show them. We've previously outlined a suggestion[3] for Facebook to allow users to block political content either from non-verified sources or altogether. Putting more control in the hands of users may avoid some of the pitfalls around free speech outlined in the prior section. Using GDPR as a proxy, we don't expect increased regulation as outlined above will have a meaningful negative long-term impact on the tech giants. One report[4] even suggests Google has benefitted from GDPR, and we shouldn't ignore that greater data management hurdles will impact how already resource-limited startups do business. However, the cloud of new regulation is likely to create near-term headline risk for Google and Facebook in particular. While we're interested in the impact on the tech world, these policies are really about protecting users. It became clear in 2018 that the tech giants could do a much better job with how they collect, manage, and monetize our data. Whatever the outcome for tech companies, the outcome for users should be good. 24/7 Wall St. Bull/Bear Outlook for 2019: How All 30 Dow Stocks Could Take the Market Up to28,000 <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/investing/2019/01/02/bull-bear-outlook-for-2019-how-all-30-dow-stocks-could-take-the-market-up-to-28000/\">https://247wallst.com/investing/2019/01/02/bull-bear-outlook-for-2019-how-all-30-dow-stocks-could-take-the-market-up-to-28000/</url> Disclaimer: We actively write about the themes in which we invest or may invest: virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

Logan Breed, antitrust partner at Hogan Lovells, moderated the discussion as six thought leaders in media, technology, and competition law grappled with business and legal issues related to industry convergence. Panelists included Jeffrey Eisenach from NERA Economic Consulting, Richard Greenfield from BTIG, Gabrielle Kohlmeier from Verizon, Joshua Wexler from Pure Imagination Studios, and Hogan Lovells partners Falk Schoening (Brussels) and Sheri Jeffrey (Los Angeles).Recent Industry Trends and DevelopmentsTechnology, media, and telecommunications[1] ('TMT') industries have undergone seismic shifts in recent years as they respond to evolving market realities. Netflix, Amazon, and others have capitalized on the democratization of media distribution, bypassing traditional pathways and upending consumer expectations. Major mergers like AT...ime Warner and Disney-Fox highlight the consolidation underway for legacy media incumbents. Technology companies and media incumbents are increasingly at odds as the lines continue to blur between the two industries. Meanwhile, the pace of technological development continues to create new markets for media consumption. Compared with radical new experiences that marry media and tech, over-the-top video services like Netflix and Amazon are beginning to look as staid and commonplace as their cable counterparts. Immersive virtual reality or augmented reality experiences promise to change the way we interact with our entertainment. The development of 5G networks will also unleash new potential as innovators leverage the speed, capacity, and latency of this next-generation network. As Joshua Wexler observed, we are witnessing the rise of a new form of entertainment as innovators leverage technological advances to blur the line between the physical and digital world. One thing is clear\u2014the landscape for content creation, delivery, and consumption is vastly different today than even a few years ago.Convergence and CompetitionPanelists identified two major trends driving the evolution of media and technology industries in both the U.S. and across the globe. As Rich Greenfield highlighted, tech companies (e.g., Netflix, Amazon) are investing large sums in order to disrupt traditional media companies. Meanwhile, telecommunications and media companies are consolidating as part of what Mr. Greenfield described as a survival strategy (e.g., AT... acquisition of Time Warner[2]). Sheri Jeffrey also noted that when consolidation or convergence fail, traditional media and new technology companies can still find common ground through strategic relationships and investments.How Should Regulators RespondThe panel agreed that U.S. regulatory regimes have been slow to adjust to changing market realities. Logan Breed noted that in some cases regulatory divergence adds another layer of complication. Traditionally regulated media companies are now competing with unregulated new tech entrants and certain regulatory agencies' powers are too narrow to address these cross-industry concerns (e.g., the FCC). Breed queried how regulators should approach this imbalance and whether we should regulate companies in this space at all. Jeffrey Eisenach believed that addressing this imbalance may require 'regulating up' (i.e., imposing traditional regulations on new entrants) or 'regulating down' (i.e., removing traditional regulations on incumbents). In his view, the United States has traditionally engaged in the latter, but the law (and especially antitrust policy) 'need[s] to keep adjusting' to address the fact that all of these companies now compete against one another. Greenfield agreed, specifically referencing the FCC broadcast ownership rules as an example where traditional regulation has prevented media companies from consolidating in order to compete with companies like Netflix. In Gabrielle Kohlmeier's view, rather than focusing narrowly on whether to regulate up or down, it may make more sense for regulators to take a step back to determine what the appropriate regulations are for the current landscape - which could mean replacing current regulations with entirely new ones.Recent Regulatory DevelopmentsSome panelists suggested that slow action, however, should not be confused with a lack of action. As Kohlmeier noted, the Federal Trade Commission recently created a Technology Task Force[3], which could signal[4] an increased willingness on the part of federal regulators to pursue antitrust enforcement in the tech space. At the state level, various Attorneys General have expressed concern[5] about Silicon Valley's consolidation of market power. The Department of Justice ('DOJ') also unsuccessfully sued AT...] in order to stop AT... merger with Time Warner. (Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim offered his perspective on DOJ antitrust activity during the Winnik Forum Fireside Chat[7].) As these actions suggest, in the U.S., antitrust law may be the legal tool best-suited to address issues created by convergence.Rethinking Market Definition?Nevertheless, the panel also agreed that antitrust law is struggling to address the complex issues raised by convergence. The problem is foundational: How does one define the relevant product market? Kohlmeier explained that, from an antitrust perspective, it is not enough to simply say that a company is engaging in anticompetitive conduct generally. Rather, the complaint must specifically identify the harm caused and in which market it is occurring. Breed added that this has become increasingly difficult as convergence has prompted a 'totally different way of thinking about traditional markets in the sense that we've always talked about them in the media and tech space.' Citing the DOJ's successful lawsuit against Microsoft[8] for packaging its operating system and Internet browser, Breed mentioned that the problem of defining the relevant product market in these industries is not entirely new. Eisenach agreed, noting that antitrust policy has 'a long way to go' to liberalize the way it defines TMT markets. Kohlmeier noted that antitrust issues related to TMT convergence and changing business models are not just showing up in the merger context. To better understand how market power is being exercised, she suggested that regulators also consider how convergence is affecting business incentives and how such incentives manifest (e.g., contract provisions).Convergence and GlobalizationCompanies operating in the TMT space must also consider the international regulatory landscape. TMT markets are increasingly global, and antitrust regulators outside the U.S. are, in some cases, more active and have stricter enforcement regimes. Kohlmeier identified two issues for international regulators: (1) how will these regulations affect businesses in the U.S. that are outside the law's extraterritorial reach, and (2) how will international regulations affect U.S. policy, such as how the EU's General Data Protection Regulation[9] ('GDPR') prompted the California Consumer Privacy Act[10]? Falk Schoening suggested that there may be political dynamics at play for international regulation. He noted that although the TMT sector is increasingly global, some worry that convergence activity is dominated by the U.S. and China. EU politicians may thus have political incentives to support increased regulation in the TMT sector. He added that because other forms of regulation have thus far not been successful at constraining TMT companies in the way EU regulators would hope, the European Commission and many European member states are actively looking to deploy antitrust tools that are perceived to be better suited to confine the Silicon Valley tech giants. In this environment, Schoening cautioned that we should expect to see more antitrust enforcement in the EU and in other international jurisdictions as well. Due to antitrust law's case-by-case analysis, international regulations may also lead to conflicting decisions by different antitrust regulators in jurisdictions all over the world. Such inconsistency makes it difficult for businesses to define a global strategy. Schoening provided some practical advice to address this concern. Because European regulators are viewed as having the strictest enforcement approach, global firms should use European laws as a compliance marker. If a business's activities pass muster in Europe, then there should be less risk of violating antitrust laws in more lax jurisdictions. In fact, in a multijurisdictional investigation, other jurisdictions may be likely to follow the European Commission's lead.Looking ForwardMedia and technology convergence issues are coming to a head as government authorities across the globe adapt regulatory frameworks to respond to this evolving landscape. Formerly distinct products now compete and act as substitutes in many cases, throwing a wrench into traditional antitrust analysis. Consumer wariness also continues to grow as a small group of companies holds outsized control over media content. Regulators across the globe are actively exploring how to address this new reality using both existing regulatory tools and new regimes. Whatever the ultimate framework, the lessons drawn from the adaption of competition law will be crucial as convergence continues to transform global markets.

Until last week, market indices from Sweden to Shenzhen posted positive year-to-date performance in spite of COVID-19. While the outperformance has baffled pundits and institutional investors alike, low interest rates for the foreseeable future and public investor appetite are fueling an interesting boom. A class of permanent capital vehicle, Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), are back, providing private companies and their investors with much-needed liquidity.    What Is A SPAC?    SPACs are not new, but the fervor surrounding the asset class crescendoed last week with Chamath Palihapitiya\u2019s play on Opendoor and plans for three additional SPACs valued around $2 billion . According to SPACInsider , there have been 104 SPAC IPO transactions this year yielding $40.4 billion in gross proceeds, trebling 2019\u2019s production ($13.6 billion) and topping deal count by 45 with three and a half months remaining in the year. For comparison, from 2004 to 2018, approximately $49.1 billion was raised across 332 SPAC IPOs in the United States.           SPACs, along with MLPs, REITs and BDCs, open an avenue to what some consider the Holy Grail in private investments\u2014 permanent capital. By trading some benefits of private ownership, PE groups are able to tap an \u201cevergreen\u201d structure that allows them to quickly access liquidity at a presumably lower cost. For many asset managers, the regulatory tradeoff is worth the price to play. Like other permanent capital vehicles, SPACs provide investors with equity ownership and additional upside. For SPAC investors, this typically comes in the form of warrants and, in some cases, rights.    Why Now?    Prior to 2020, private equity had an impressive five year run that pushed asset valuations and created fierce deal competition. Bain &amp; Company\u2019s 2020 Private Equity Report , however, cited that 2019 marked the first time that 10-year returns in public markets matched those in private equity, perhaps giving private investors pause for thought on whether the illiquidity give was worth the marketed premium.    To date, the public markets continue to pull off confounding performance in the face of a second black swan in less than 15 years. While academics and pundits debate what set the table at which investors now feast, we should call to mind two of Marty Zweig\u2019s investment tenets, \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed, and \u201cDon\u2019t fight the tape.\u201d    In the dark days following the global shutdown in March, the S&amp;P 500 was down 34% from the previous all-time high, achieved in February. Central Banks around the world enacted monetary policies to resurrect the markets and prevent the loss of liquidity that exacerbated market action in 2008. In the months that have passed, Fed policy has been squarely aimed at helping US consumers and businesses manage the impact COVID-19 has had on their finances.     While programs like the Paycheck Protection Program and Main Street Lending Program received mixed reception ( 99.8% of the Cash in Main Street Lending Program remains untapped ), the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has almost doubled to over $7 trillion with purchases in everything from Money Market Mutual Funds, Municipal Bonds, Commercial Paper, Corporate Bonds and Bond ETFs, in addition to its \u201cplain vanilla\u201d US Treasury and MBS holdings. The Fed\u2019s support of the markets has also included high-yield bonds, issued by companies with ratings less than BBB- (S&amp;P) or Baa3 (Moody\u2019s  MCO  ) that are considered speculative, driving yields to all-time lows (as prices increase, bond yields decrease). In August, Ball Corp.  BLL  raised $1.3 billion via a 10-year bond with a record-breaking 2.875% coupon.    Simultaneously, the outlook for \u201criskier\u201d assets\u2014 i.e. private investment in early-stage startups\u2014 was less sanguine. As happens in times of economic uncertainty, the appetite for risk diminished. What poses an even greater challenge in private markets is the lack of transparency in valuation that public markets can provide. While not a guarantee of liquidity, investors often equate valuations (marks) with a semblance of price certainty around their investments. While GPs require opacity and long-term lock-ups to create deals that generate above market returns, private investors seek transparency in times of distress.    The Rising Tide Lifts All Boats         Equities have flourished with the Fed\u2019s focus on asset valuations. Taking lessons from 2008, swift and decisive action has been taken to ensure the stability of financial markets.    From a capital structure perspective, the subsequent market action makes sense. For those companies that can avail of the markets, debt is cheaper to raise, lowering the overall cost of capital, which should increase the value of shareholder equity.    Fundamentals aside, market dynamics and technical factors have also driven the boom. Perhaps the most peculiar has been the rise of the \u201cRobinhood Investors.\u201d According to a recent WSJ article , individual investors made up roughly 20% of market activity (compared to 10% in 2019). Enabled by automated trading apps, fractional share plans and social media \u201cadvice\u201d and bravado (see TikTok and DDTG Global), novice investors have become aspiring Wall Street titans in their own right.    The conditions are ripe to raise permanent capital. For private equity, the markets are providing a viable path to liquidity. Whether facilitating an exit or raising fresh capital, it gives GPs options (the most valuable of assets). For retail investors, it provides access to an asset class that has been closed to most except Accredited Investors. For operating companies (large and small), SPACs present tremendous potential. At the very least, it provides shareholders a liquidity event and a tradeable currency that they can value immediately.    Strategically, SPACs enable the growth of core businesses. Armed with fresh currency, SPACs can enable the consolidation in key industries. Given the boom in \u201cBig Tech\u201d valuations, it\u2019s no surprise that an overwhelming number of listed and prospective offerings concentrate in the space.    Where Are The FinTech SPACs?    As investor appetite in SPACs continues, it can be concluded number of FinTech-focused SPACs will emerge. According to CBInsights, there were 67 privately-held FinTech unicorns valued at  $252.6 billion at the end of Q1 . While large deals like Visa\u2019s  V  $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid and Intuit\u2019s  INTU  $7.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma closed during the pandemic, they could be the anomaly. Last Thursday, Affirm announced it closed a $500 million funding round, casting doubt on their previous plans to IPO with a $10 billion valuation .         Continued SPAC funding activity could provide private investors liquidity in a crowded space. Given the number of FinTech startups in the early-stage and growth pipeline, SPACs could provide the impetus for a wave of consolidation that helps investors exit certain positions and strengthen others. Of the technology sectors, FinTech would seem one of the most logical to utilize the vehicle, providing startups the solid footing needed to weather a potential long-term funding drought.    Notable FinTech SPAC transactions to date include Fusion Acquisition Corporation\u2019s $350 million IPO to concentrate on Wealth Management, FinTech Acquisition Corporation\u2019s $250 million SPAC that plans to take Paya, valuing the company at $1.3 billion and Hong Kong-based Diginex\u2019 reverse merger agreement with 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp, which gives it a Nasdaq  NDAQ  listing.    Caveat Emptor         Investors would be wise to view funding vehicles, like SPACs, in the same light as they do their asset allocations. The fervor in SPACs may be driven more by market dynamics than the underlying value proposition, a phenomenon seen countless times before. Like the boom in MLPs, REITs, BDCs and Private Equity we have seen over the past decade, the above-market returns can be fleeting. For asset originators (In the case of SPACs, Private Equity and Venture Capital), the time is right to seize upon a market that values the importance of the Manager as well as the asset.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But city-wide bans in Oakland[2], San Francisco[3] and Cambridge[4] proved that legislation was possible. Indiana, New Jersey, South Carolina and Washington state are proposing restrictions on law enforcement's use of facial recognition \u2014 when employed on its own or with body cameras. </p><p>(The CEO of Axon[5], the largest supplier of body cameras to police in the U.S., expects the company to use facial recognition in 3-5 years.)New Hampshire is calling for a total ban, while Michigan wants to ban \"real-time\" use \u2014recognizing and capturing faces in public, in real time.Vermont is concerned with notifying shoppers when facial recognition is used in stores, and Maryland proposes telling defendants if they were identified with the tech. What's next for privacy advocates: Jameson Spivack, policy associate at Georgetown's privacy center, expects the bipartisan issue to \"move beyond wealthy liberal bastions.\" Maryland lawmakers are working on another bill to limit external agency access to the state's facial recognition system, which includes mugshot and driver's license photos, one Georgetown researcher said.A New York bill banning biometric identification in school systems[6] is expected to be reintroduced this year, the ACLU's Chad Marlow said. \"I think if we had 72 more hours we would have passed it,\" he added. Background: Big Tech companies selling facial recognition systems \u2014 like IBM[7], Microsoft[8] and Amazon[9] \u2014have asked federal policymakers to judge how government agencies and law enforcement use the tech, and a few bipartisan[10] measures[11] have responded. A recent federal study[12]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/law-enforcements-rising-problem-b5e5628e-be13-4ab8-9c1f-ccaf37b5426e.html\">https://www.axios.com/law-enforcements-rising-problem-b5e5628e-be13-4ab8-9c1f-ccaf37b5426e.html</url> found that facial recognition systems offered by those companies largely failed to identify people of color, predominately Asians and African Americans. Amazon did not submit its algorithm to the study, per the Post[13].IBM, Face ++ and Microsoft reduced accuracy issues[14] for identifying darker-skinned women within 7 months of a 2018 MIT Media Lab study[15] measuring those errors. MIT found that Amazon's system was the worst at identifying darker-skinned women, which the company has disputed[16].

And as big pharma seeks bolt-on acquisitions to build out strategies, deals to acquire biotechs valued at between $5bn and $10bn will be the sweet spot for this activity. A few deals valued between $20bn and $30bn also could occur to further sector leadership strategies.</p><p>Speaking on a deals panel at the BIO CEO &amp; Investor conference in New York on February 10, financial advisor Eric Tokat of Centerview Partners, which advised Spark Therapeutics in its merger with <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198600362\">Roche</url> last year, also predicted more small or mid-size deals as big pharma settles down. \"Historically, large pharma mergers were driven by efficiency, cost-cutting, cash flow, diversification. In this era, the drivers are a bit different than we have seen in the past,\" he said. The science-driven nature of deal-making today should continue the momentum behind smaller bolt-on deals in 2020, he predicted. \"I do anticipate more of the $1bn-$5bn or $1bn-$10bn deals.\" </p><p>PwC's report also suggests that increased activity by private equity investors will drive business development this year.</p><p>The growing presence of private equity investors is also cited by Morrison &amp; Foerster in its Key M&amp;A Trends For 2020 report, as a factor that will shape M&amp;A activity this year in the life sciences and the larger economy. The Morrison &amp; Foerster report, which looks at deal-making across all sectors of the economy, concludes that increased shareholder activism and increased antitrust oversight of large mergers will influence the deal-making climate.</p><p>\"The calls for more stringent standards and aggressive [antitrust] enforcement have focused particularly on 'big tech' and 'big pharma' companies, as well as firms in other industries, where patent-protected innovations, platform-based business models, and data-driven insights provide significant competitive advantages or may generate 'winner-take-all' network effects,\" M&amp;F's report states.</p><p>The biopharma industry has braced for increased regulatory scrutiny, which was a factor in multiple large deals in 2019. The US Federal Trade Commission's review of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601245\">Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</url> $74bn acquisition of\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601148\">Celgene Corp.</url> meant that a deal announced in January did not close until November, and required the divestiture of Celgene's autoimmune blockbuster Otezla (apremilast) to Amgen Inc. for $14.3bn. FTC oversight also caused the $4.8bn Roche/Spark merger to need roughly 10 months to close as the FTC did an \"exhaustive\" review of the competitive dynamics in hemophilia A. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//IV124448//\">\"Biopharma MA Lessons From 2019 Trends For 2020\" \"In Vivo\"</url>)</p><p>Pharma deal value in 2019 was stable compared to 2018, even though volume was down, with the two mega-mergers combining BMS/Celgene and\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/201300001\">AbbVie Inc.</url>\u00a0and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601285\">Allergan PLC</url> keeping deal valuation up. PwC's US Pharma and Life Sciences deals leader Glenn Hunzinger thinks the industry's appetite for mega-mergers is satisfied for now, due to a variety of factors including the integration process following major deals of recent years and companies being more confident in their current strategies. This confidence, in turn, means they are more likely to look to smaller, targeted deals to build out on their strategies.</p><p>Why No More Mega-Mergers?</p><p>\"Where we sit now - we kind of felt it at J.P. Morgan this year - was there was a little more calmness at the meeting, everybody was operating under a strategic agenda, they felt like they had a good plan, they were focused, they didn't necessarily need or feel the pressure to announce a few things at JPM,\" Hunzinger said in an interview. </p><p>\"Companies spent an enormous amount of time in 2019 really pushing the envelope ... that's why I think in biotech, just given the nature of oncology and cell and gene therapy companies being a little more fragmented, I think we'll see a lot of what we call mid-sized deals in that $2bn-$10bn range,\" Hunzinger added. This activity will be driven by more targeted pursuits of \"great science,\" he explained, such as companies looking \"to fill gaps in specific oncology portfolios - if they have lung, they want to have ovarian, they want to do combinations.\"</p><p>The M&amp;F report notes that health care M&amp;A outpaced overall M&amp;A deal-making last year, with aggregate value of health care M&amp;A up 26% compared to 2018. Across all economic sectors, M&amp;A litigation will hinder acquisition activity in 2020, the report predicts, but shareholder activism will remain a driver for both M&amp;A and divestment transactions. An estimated 47% of activist investor campaigns focused on M&amp;A in 2019, up from about 35% in previous years, M&amp;F said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the need for large-scale acquisitions is less prevalent as new corporate strategies have had some time to take shape, Hunzinger said. \"I think so much happened last year. When I look across the large pharma companies, they all have gone through some level of transformational event in some shape or form,\" he explained. \"I combine that with the fact that across the industry, the organic growth has never been better in 10 years. People feel good about their portfolios, they feel good about their strategies and we've heard from a lot of different companies their views on building block-type acquisitions versus taking big bets. ... It's really a matter of incrementalism versus making a big mega-deal.\"</p><p>KPMG also sees more targeted activity in the coming year, with continued focus on next-generation therapies, such as cell and gene therapies, and personalized medicine that are driving forces in the current business development environment. In its 2020\u00a0Opportunities and Challenges In An Evolving Market\u00a0report, KPMG says drug makers \"are diversifying across multiple platform types and pursuing different strategies.\"\u00a0The report notes that \"some companies are investing in vertically integrated capabilities, which allow them to capture market segments before second-movers emerge and to position themselves as the best partners for emerging biotechs.\"</p><p>\"Other companies are taking a more conservative approach by following large capital investments with multiple partnerships across different innovative platforms, which gives them time to determine which will eventually show the most potential,\" KPMG added.</p><p>But everyone focusing on the same area has an impact. Numerous players seeking oncology and cell and gene therapy acquisitions can lead to asset scarcity and make it challenging to remain within reasonable valuations, Hunzinger said.</p><p>\"Last year, I think we saw a lot of that, where companies needed to make certain moves to at least start to add to their building blocks or their foundation in their therapeutic category,\" he said. \"This is part of what the industry always has to address, how do you balance risk as well as staying disciplined. A lot of the corporate development people I've come across do a tremendous job trying to balance that risk. The risk is always there, the value discussion is always there, I see people excited about technology and about certain companies and drugs, but they just can't get there on the valuations. I think that while they know there's a scarcity factor, people know that they have to have discipline.\"</p><p>Making Room For Bolt-On Deals</p><p>In tandem with continuing focus on with corporate strategies and a reduced appetite for larger M&amp;A, Hunzinger expects a continuation of the divestment trend seen in the biopharma sector. In recent years, this has taken the form of sell-off of assets and business units, as well as spinouts and initial public offerings, he explained. He thinks companies will do more spinouts in 2020 both to divest non-core assets and to help pay down debt.</p><p>\"You have companies with wide portfolios; what comes with wide portfolios is operational complexity, trying to be everything to everybody in terms of geography, therapeutic categories, manufacturing,\" Hunzinger said. \"There are people looking at their business models and saying 'I need to figure out how to transform my business operationally, I want to be able to invest in the growth areas,' and they know in some of these therapeutic areas scale is super important. If they are not the category leader and do not have scale, then they know that maybe certain therapeutic areas or products are better off in someone else's hands.\"</p><p>Cell And Gene Spotlight</p><p>EY's business development group anticipates efforts by biopharma companies to optimize their portfolios could drive as much as $300bn in deal-making this year centered on five therapeutic areas: oncology; cardiovascular and metabolic disease; immunology, infectious disease; and central nervous system disorders. </p><p>EY also expects 2020 deal-making to be dominated by cell and gene therapy, as well as immuno-oncology, according to a report released in conjunction with the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conferencein January 2020.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601242\">Gilead Sciences Inc.</url>\u00a0and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198700137\">Novo Nordisk AS</url>\u00a0are\u00a0viewed as motivated buyers in the cell and gene space, but the early track record of some of the products that have reached market caused investor anxiety during the second half of 2019.

J.P. Morgan vice chair Philip Ross speculated that more uncertainty could come later in the year when the Democratic nominee is selected, and that uncertainty could also impact the financing and IPO environment. The consensus at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference and Biotech Showcase meetings at the start of the year was that activity will slow in the second half due to the impending election. </p><p>In its report, KPMG notes that deal-making was robust in 2019, up 40% from 2018 as of the end of November. In its survey, 35% said overall health care investment is bolstered by strong underlying fundamentals, although only 28% say that of the life sciences sector.</p><p>Innovation, particularly in the areas of rare diseases and cancer, is motivating deal-making, the KPMG report says, as 85% of its sample said a willingness to pay for innovation will drive transactions. It pointed to 58 deals last year in cell and gene therapy, including 17 full acquisitions, and predicted such deals will increase in 2020.</p><p>\"In addition to small molecule drugs and antibodies, there are a number of new drug types for rare diseases,\" KPMG states, noting 34 of the 59 new molecular entities approved by the FDA in 2018 were to treat diseases with 200,000 patients or fewer in the US.</p><p>\"Next-generation nucleic acid-based therapeutics target rare diseases at the genetic level and prevent the manifestation of disease-causing proteins,\" the report continues. \"Viral vector-based therapies - modified viruses that can penetrate cells and tissues to cure disease - are emerging as treatments for cancer, infectious diseases and rare disease genetic disorders.\" KPMG estimates there are nearly 500 viral vector-based therapies in the global R&amp;D pipeline.</p><p>Potential Impact Of External Factors On Deal-Making</p><p>KPMG queried its 66 respondents from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology product and services sector on how the possibility of drug pricing legislation or related policy changes could affect their investment activities, including deal-making, in 2020. Fifty-eight percent said that if drug pricing control legislation advances in the US, that could have a negative impact on investment. The respondents also are wary of the impact of the 2020 election, with nearly half saying it could cause decreased investment - 37% predicted some decrease, while 12% expect a significance decline in investment.\u00a0(<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//PS141437//\">\"US Drug Pricing Legislation Efforts Headed Toward Spring Renewal A Look Ahead\" \"Pink Sheet\"</url>)</p><p>While the KPMG survey indicates apprehension about drug pricing legislation, however, it also shows a positive view toward other mechanisms to affect prices and patient access (see Exhibit 1). Fifty-six percent said \"shift to value\" mechanisms such as alternative payment mechanisms in which drug companies share risks with payers will increase investment. New ways to pay for innovation, such as the annuity model being used to spread out the cost of Novartis's gene therapy Zolgensma, are viewed positively, with 70% in the survey saying new payment methods might lead to increase investment. </p><p>Early returns on Novartis's annuity model do not appear promising, however. At the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January, David Lennon, president of Novartis subsidiary AveXis, noted that no payer had signed on for the extended payment plan at that point. </p><p>KPMG's survey found that expansion into new geographies or product/service areas is expected to be the main driver of M&amp;A activity in 2020, followed by deals to shore up new operational models or deals to bolster existing business.</p><p>The picture the survey paints is pretty good. More than half of the respondents said asset prices in their subsector are fair or undervalued, and 68% expected deal volume to rise in the coming year. But political risk remains the biggest concern: the only potential disruptor seen as having a negative impact is the US election, and 53% of the respondents cited ongoing efforts to control drug prices as a factor holding down deal-making.</p><p>By <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:Joseph.Haas@informa.com\">Joseph Haas</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVIVO-IV124450</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVIVO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7S-36F1-F0JS-Y3DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436900</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2661\"/><timeReceived>7:42 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Informa All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>In Vivo</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48259\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000DHIN</classCode><className>SPARK THERAPEUTICS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001TAT</classCode><className>MORRISON &amp;

Elizabeth Warren's proposals to break up Big Tech, saying he would be in favor of forcing divestitures in some cases --- but that simply creating new, smaller competitors won't be enough to address the industry's underlying problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth-best navigation app,\" he said. \"There is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft, it's true.\"</p><p>Yang also argued Americans should \"share in the gains\" enjoyed by tech companies because \"our data is our property.</p><p>Warren fired back with a line she's used before: That the enormous power companies such as Amazon hold in some markets, combined with their ability to use data to squeeze independent competitors, is a clear violation of antitrust law.</p><p>\"You get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time,\" she said. \"We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating --- Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Oil, all of them.\"</p><p>Sen. Kamala Harris generally steered clear of the breakup question, other than to call \"ridiculous\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's claims that splitting up large tech platforms will only hamper efforts to combat online disinformation. Instead, she spent much of her time calling on her fellow candidates to support a ban on President Trump's Twitter account.</p><p>Harris called out what she said was a \"grave injustice\" in Twitter's policies, which grant greater leeway to newsmakers and world leaders than to average users.</p><p>It is an injustice, she said, \"when rules apply to some but not equally to all, and in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful.\" </p><p>Harris' remarks came hours after Twitter clarified its policies in an attempt to explain what could lead the company to take action against a world leader's tweet. Twitter said in a blog post that a world leader who sends a tweet that Twitter would otherwise take action on will get a pass if that tweet involves \"fellow public figures,\" \"political issues of the day\" or \"foreign policy saber-rattling.\"</p><p>Harris sought to draw a contrast between herself and other candidates who have not called for Twitter to act against Trump's account, singling out Warren for not publicly backing her call. Warren ultimately acknowledged she does want Trump pushed off of Twitter, but added that a bigger goal is to push him out of the White House. \"That's our job.\" Warren then raised questions about her fellow candidates' sources of financial support. </p><p>\"If we're going to talk seriously about breaking up Big Tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the Big Tech executives,\" she said. \"If we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives.\"</p><p>Warren earlier in the day vowed not to take contributions of $200 or more from executives in the tech, banking or finance industries. </p><p>Rep. Beto O'Rourke set his sights on Facebook and its decision to allow candidates to lie in advertisements on its platform. He called for imposing \"very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road\" for social media platforms and compared them explicitly to traditional publishers. </p><p>\"We would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad,\" referring to an ad by Trump's campaign containing unfounded allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden. \"Treat them like the publisher they are. That's what I will do as president.\" O'Rourke's remark is part of a wider debate among critics of Silicon Valley over whether laws and rules designed for and by traditional media can or should apply to the tech industry. Last week, amid a spat with Warren, Facebook compared itself to broadcast TV stations that ran the Trump ad in compliance with federal law and regulations.</p><p>Sen. Cory Booker stopped short of committing to breaking up the tech industry. But he said that as president, he would appoint regulators who would take a stronger position on enforcing antitrust laws.</p><p>\"We need regulation and reform,\" he said, citing the tech companies' involvement in the 2016 elections as an unwitting vector for foreign disinformation and election interference campaigns. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Pushing the $640 billion measure through even a Democratic-controlled Congress would be a punishing task, but the presidential hopeful had secured a big Capitol Hill backer in Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, a power broker in a key early-primary state and the third-ranking Democrat in the House.</p><p><br/>Earlier this month, however, Warren effectively cut Clyburn, and the rest of Congress, out of her debt-relief plan. On the eve of the most recent Democratic primary debate, she announced that on her first day as president, she would order the cancellation of the student debt herself, using a broad interpretation of existing laws. Lawmakers could sit back and watch. \"We can't afford to wait for Congress to act,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/student-loan-debt-day-one\">she wrote</url>.<br/>Most Democratic presidential candidates,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/elizabeth-warren-we-can-end-our-endless-wars/605497/?utm_source=feed\">including Warren</url>, have vowed to show more deference to Congress in seeking authorization for the use of military force, and they've condemned President Donald Trump for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/national-emergency-trump.html\">shirking</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/05/politics/trump-war-tweet-iran/index.html\">checks</url> on his executive authority.<br/>But as they confront the possibility that their grand progressive plans could stall out on Capitol Hill, several of the party's past and present White House contenders have signaled that they share Trump's expansive view of presidential authority and his impatience with-if not his outright disregard for-the legislative branch. And that has caused alarm among Democrats who don't want their party to mimic a man who famously declared, \"I alone can fix it.\"<br/>Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/30/document-shows-bernie-sanders-team-preparing-dozens-potential-executive-orders/\">is reportedly considering</url> dozens of executive orders he could sign to go around Congress, and he's already promised to implement major parts of his immigration plan unilaterally if it stalls on Capitol Hill. Before dropping out of the race late last year, Senator Kamala Harris of California vowed to enact her gun-control agenda herself if Congress didn't act within 100 days of her inauguration. Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who has campaigned as a legislative consensus-builder and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joe-biden-criticizes-primary-rivals-for-relying-on-executive-orders-for-policy-positions\">has been dismissive</url> of his rivals' plans to circumvent Congress, has proposed an aggressive use of executive orders.<br/>This embrace of executive authority has disappointed, but not surprised, advocates who want to reverse a decades-long shift in power from a largely dysfunctional legislative branch to an ever more muscular executive.<br/>\"Executive-branch circumvention of Congress is what everyone expects by now,\" says Philip Wallach, a senior fellow in governance at R Street, a libertarian think tank. It has been a decade since Congress last enacted a major new policy program, aside from a few big tax cuts and spending bills, he notes.<br/>Read: [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/?utm_source=feed\">The alarming scope of the president's emergency powers</url>]<br/>The past three presidents have tried to push the bounds of executive authority. In the years after 9/11, civil libertarians and some Democrats criticized the George W. Bush administration for its expansive interpretation of the president's power to act in the name of national security. Republicans took President Barack Obama to court over his move to grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants after Congress refused to pass a comprehensive bill providing a path to citizenship. (The Obama administration       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324581504578238113719321432\">rejected an even wilder idea</url> of minting a trillion-dollar coin to obviate the need for Republican votes to raise the debt ceiling.)<br/>Congress is at fault too. Over the years, lawmakers have written overly broad laws that have given executive agencies wide latitude to interpret and implement them as they see fit, argues Elizabeth Goitein, the director of the liberty-and-national-security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning think tank. Many disputes over such laws end up in the courts, leading to years of litigation, as has been the case with the Affordable Care Act, for example. \"Congress has essentially abdicated the job of lawmaking and has left that to the president,\" Goitein told me. \"Presidents have also taken to stretching the bounds of those delegations and going beyond what Congress has authorized.\"<br/>Warren's advisers told me she views Congress as a partner, noting her support for repealing the authorizations of military force that were passed in 2001 and 2003 and that presidents have used to justify military actions across the globe in the decades since. But Warren is also a candidate who conceived of and built from scratch an entire federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that was designed to be insulated from congressional sabotage and oversight. For years, she has pushed the executive branch to be more aggressive about using its vast power to improve people's lives. \"She has really thought deeply about how you can use all the tools of government to actually deliver for people,\" Bharat Ramamurti, the campaign's deputy director for economic policy, told me.<br/>Still, none of the candidates' domestic proposals for executive action would have near the fiscal impact of Warren's cancellation plan for student debt, which would rival the $700 billion bank bailout Congress approved under duress in 2008. Her pledge to act unilaterally annoyed Democrats like Representative Scott Peters of California, a leader of the moderate New Democrat Coalition, who warned his party's contenders against trying to match Trump's contempt for the balance of powers. \"We do not need another wannabe monarch,\" he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/scottpeterssd/status/1217147750854414336?s=21\">tweeted</url> after Warren unveiled her plan.<br/>Experts at Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending, in a seven-page letter released by the Warren campaign, argued that legal authority to cancel student debt without congressional action exists under the Higher Education Act. The law, they wrote, grants the secretary of education \"unrestricted authority to create and to cancel or modify debt owed under federal student loan programs.\" On day one of her presidency, Warren said, she would direct her education secretary to use that authority to wipe out up to $50,000 in debt for borrowers on a sliding income scale. That a president could erase $640 billion worth of unpaid loans with barely more than the stroke of a pen was news to Clyburn and other co-sponsors of the debt-relief legislation in Congress. \"She didn't indicate that to me at all,\" Clyburn told me.<br/>In all likelihood, conservatives would immediately challenge such a move in court, leading to a lengthy legal fight. But whether the law is ultimately on Warren's side is beside the point, Representative Peters told me. \"Certainly something that big has to come to the Congress,\" he said. Peters, who noted that Obama acted on immigration only after he had made an extensive effort to pass a bill on Capitol Hill, found it particularly galling that Warren planned to cancel such a large amount of student debt before even trying to build legislative support as president. \"Whatever happened to the first 100 days?\" he asked. \"Enough of the dictators, whether they're left or right. That's not what this country is about.\"<br/>Representative Ro Khanna of California, a Sanders supporter who co-sponsored Warren's bill in the House, told me it was his \"strong preference\" that a new president first try to enact student-debt relief legislatively. \"If there are actions that she could take to provide some relief that she's convinced will be upheld as constitutional in the courts, then I'd support that,\" he said. \"But I think what could be a blow is if we tried something and then it's held as unconstitutional and we don't have a legislative strategy.\"<br/>Khanna noted that although the laws Obama passed through Congress have largely survived, Trump has reversed much of the progressive policy his predecessor enacted through executive action and by chipping away at regulations. \"If you want the policy to stand the test of time, it usually means the legislative branch,\" he said. \"I don't think we should compromise our respect for the congressional branches, and we should recognize the dangers of executive overreach.\"<br/>Warren's advisers told me her plan to act \"on day one\" did not mean she was giving up on the legislation she introduced with Clyburn. \"Her student-debt legislation is complementary to the executive action, and she will continue to fight with Representative Clyburn to pass it,\" said Julie Morgan, the campaign's deputy director of domestic policy. \"Just like she wants legislation to break up Big Tech while also having regulators use existing authority to unwind anticompetitive mergers. It's not an either/or.\"<br/>As for Clyburn, the 28-year veteran of the House may have been taken aback by Warren's abrupt announcement that she could enact their student-debt plan all by herself if she wins the presidency. But he wasn't offended by the idea, nor was he necessarily opposed to it. \"I would remind you that slavery was ended by executive order,\" Clyburn replied when I asked him whether he was worried about executive overreach. \"The armed forces were integrated by executive order.

One of the reasons the Democrats, especially, are eager to be here: A recent poll of Texas voters found that President Trump is essentially tied with a hypothetical Democratic opponent in 2020.\"</p><p>In an interview with the New York Times (3/9, Astor, 17.76M) at SXSW, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) spoke about \"health care, technology, foreign policy and other issues.\" Klobuchar \"expressed support for several policies to lower drug prices,\" and \"criticized the relatively short sentence given to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in his financial fraud case this week, citing her experience prosecuting white-collar crime.\" She also \"denounced President Trump for his attacks on the news media,\" and \"said she disagreed with\" Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-MN) \"recent comments about American politicians' support for Israel, 'because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia' - but condemned Mr. Trump for emboldening intolerance, including anti-Semitism, and noted Ms. Omar's own background as a refugee.\"</p><p>Politico (3/9, Siders, 3.61M) reported that ex-Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) \"took his 2020 campaign tease to South by Southwest on Saturday - and even by this city's eccentric standards, the act was getting weird.\" Politico added that while \"he once again refused to discuss his 2020 plans,\" what is \"unusual is not that O'Rourke hasn't said yet if he is running,\" but instead that he \"confirmed more than a week ago that he made his decision. He just won't say what it is.\" Politico added that O'Rourke, \"who sowed his entire persona on a thread of authenticity - crisscrossing Texas while eschewing pollsters and political consultants in his Senate run last year - is now manufacturing suspense.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, The Hill (3/9, Frazin, 3.58M) reported that ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, \"who is mulling launching a 2020 independent presidential bid, went after members of both parties Saturday during a talk at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Texas.\" Schultz said, \"We're living in a society right now where you can send a tweet about anything...and all of a sudden you're an iconic celebrity. ... But that's not going to solve the issues that we're facing.\" The Hill said Schultz \"sought to leverage his decades of experience in business and years running a global corporation to make the case that he could successfully lead the country if elected.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRNTRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRNTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMC-1X01-JBSJ-94C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160011</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bulletin News Network, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>The Frontrunner</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Welcome to Sunday. I'm Christi Paul.</p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Martin Savidge, sitting in for Victor Blackwell.</p><p>It is the first major test for the 2020 Democratic candidates and the results are in. The new CNN/\"Des Moines Register\" poll has former Vice President Joe Biden leading the field as the top choice of likely participants in the first in the nation Iowa Democratic caucuses. But he is ahead by a smaller margin than in other recent national polling. Should his campaign be worried?</p><p>PAUL: Also, President Trump touts maybe an old deal? A day after this unprecedented deal to over tariffs, \"The New York Times\" reporting this morning that Mexico agreed to take border actions months before President Trump announced the tariff agreement.</p><p>We are going to talk about that but we want to get background for you here on this new CNN, Des Moines, Iowa, poll, but this is not an ordinary poll. This is the gold standard for Iowa polling and this is why it matters. In the last four presidential elections, when there is no Democratic candidate running, whoever won the Iowa Democratic caucus went on to become the Democratic nominee.</p><p>SAVIDGE: With more than 20 men and women vying for the White House, the poll results point to who Democratic Iowa voters like right now, and what they like in their candidates and how they feel about impeaching the president. PAUL: Also for the first time, the Iowa poll accounts for in new rules proposed this year by the Iowa Democratic Party that will allow Iowans participate in a, quote, virtual caucus that happens online or over the phone.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And the results of those caucuses will account for 10 percent of the final delegate equivalence, regardless of how many people participate.</p><p>PAUL: CNN political director David Chalian breaks down the numbers for us.</p><p>Good morning, David.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: The Iowa caucuses may be just less than eight months away, but, today, is a big day in that first in the nation contest. Nineteen of the 23 Democrats running for the nomination to take on Donald Trump will be convening at a big Iowa Democratic Party fund-raising and organizing event in Cedar Rapids. They will each get to address the crowd of faithful and try to break through.</p><p>And breaking through doesn't seem to be the easiest task. Take a look at our brand-new CNN/\"Des Moines Register\" poll, and you will see that only five candidates actually crack 5 percent in this poll. Joe Biden, the former vice president, continues to lead the pack at 24 percent, 16 percent for Sanders, 15 percent for Elizabeth Warren, 14 percent for Pete Buttigieg and 7 percent for Kamala Harris.</p><p>What you see here is Joe Biden in the lead but in a closer contest than we have seen in recently national polls and Bernie Sanders in Iowa does not have second place for himself. He is there virtually tied with Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. So there is a real contest forming here in Iowa.</p><p>We also asked folks in addition to the first choice for your preference in the Iowa Democratic caucuses, who would be your second choice? Who else in this group are you actively considering?</p><p>Take a look at these numbers: 61 percent are preferring Biden or use their second choice. Same for Warren. Sanders at 56 percent. Buttigieg at 52 percent, Harris at 52, and then you see Booker and O'Rourke round out there.</p><p>But a majority of the Iowa Democratic likely caucus-goers are still shopping around here among the top five group of candidates here. That is a key factor in this poll.</p><p>We also look at the enthusiasm issue and this may be a potential warning sign for Joe Biden. Among his supporters, 29 percent of them say they are extremely enthusiastic about that choice, compared to 39 percent who support everyone else, who say they are enthusiastic about their choice. So Joe Biden, one warning sign in what is a pretty good poll for him is this potential enthusiasm gap. Of course, we also want to know what is driving voters' choices and what are they looking for in these candidates? Sixty-five percent of Iowa Democratic caucus-goers tell us in this poll they want someone with a strong chance to win. Only 31 percent say that they want someone who shares their positions. Clearly, defeating Donald Trump is issue number one for Iowa Democrats.</p><p>Take a look at these candidate qualities we also tested -- issues, integrity, intelligence, leadership.</p><p>[07:05:03] These are the top qualities that Iowa Democrats are looking for in their candidate.</p><p>And, finally, I just want to share this information on impeachment because Nancy Pelosi, back in Washington, has been taking some heat from the left wing of her party. Take a look at this. She seems to be holding the right position, even within the Democratic Party, at least here in Iowa.</p><p>Forty-two percent of Iowa Democrats, likely caucus going Democrats tell us impeachment should begin right now or House Democrats are shirking their responsibility, 48 percent, the plurality, say, no, keep on with the investigation but don't begin impeachment proceedings now. That is where Nancy Pelosi is. So, taking a pulse in the activist party here, it's just not easy equation for her.</p><p>But when it comes to that main horse race taking the temperature nearly eight months out from caucus day, Joe Biden is in the driver's seat here. He won't be with the 19 Democrats today in Cedar Rapids. Joe Biden will be in Iowa on Tuesday, he'll be sharing the state with President Donald Trump that day.</p><p>Christi, Martin, back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE: All right. There are a few of the Democratic candidates who are already reacting to the results of the poll and here's what they had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: A lot of the polls have me and Joe Biden defeating Trump pretty handily.</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, there is a lot of time before the Iowa caucus. We have never been guided by a poll before.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I don't even view us as having opponents as much as competitors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL: The CNN White House reporter Sarah Westwood he is White House this morning. And, Sarah, good morning to you.</p><p>We know President Trump is going to be in Iowa in a couple of days. What's the plan?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Christi and Martin.</p><p>And this will be President Trump's first visit to Iowa of 2019. He'll be visiting an ethanol plant in Council Bluffs and a fund-raiser in Des Moines. And incidentally, former Vice President Joe Biden will be in Iowa on Tuesday, the same day as President Trump, but this is all happening against the backdrop of President Trump's new immigration deal with Mexico, the one he announced on Friday night.</p><p>President Trump agreed to drop his threat to impose a 5 percent imports from Mexico and what he says is a concession from Mexican officials when it comes to immigration enforcement. President Trump is taking a victory lap over this deal, \"The New York Times\" is reporting that some of the key components of the agreement may have existed well before the president started this latest threat to slap these tariffs on Mexican goods.</p><p>Here is part of what \"The New York Times\" wrote. The centerpiece of Mr. Trump's deal was an expansion of a program to allow asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their legal cases proceed. But that arrangement was reached in December, in a pair of painstakingly negotiated diplomatic notes that the two countries. Ms. Nielsen, that's former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, announced the migrant protection protocols during a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee five days before Christmas.</p><p>Now, this administration has released no details on how that so-called Mexico policy would be expanded under terms of this new deal. Mexico also rejected the administration's request to implement a safe third country policy which would force migrants to first seek asylum in Mexico before they can move on and seek asylum in the U.S. Again, Mexico negotiates were able to hold off on that question from the administration.</p><p>And another key component of the president's new deal, the deployment of 6,000 Mexican national guard troops throughout Mexico, that was also already under discussion. \"The Times\" regard to that Nielsen and Mexican official discussed that in March in Miami and unclear how the size of that deployment grew under the new negotiations.</p><p>And meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is in Japan negotiating with other financial regulators at the G20, and he is taking a similarly aggressive line when it comes to China trade.</p><p>Here is what \"The New York times\" reported that Mnuchin said: If they, the Chinese, want to come back to the table and complete the deal on the terms that we were continuing to negotiate, that would be great.</p><p>And then according to this report, he said: If not, as the president said, we'll move on with tariffs. Now, there have, of course, been fears about the economic consequences of these -- this China trade war that has been ongoing for weeks now. Negotiations hit a snag earlier this year but Mnuchin said that he had what he described as candid discussions with Chinese economic leaders. He took to Twitter to write: Had the constructive meeting with the People's Bank of China governor during which we had a candid discussion on trade issues.</p><p>President Trump has been ratcheting up his tariffs against the Chinese, but he is set to sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 in Japan at the end of the month. So, perhaps, we could see some breakthrough on these sticking points when it comes to China trade later on the month -- Christi and Martin.</p><p>PAUL: All righty. Sarah Westwood, appreciate it so much.</p><p>[07:10:02] Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN: Let's go back to the polling in Iowa. Joining us now is CNN political analyst April Ryan, and the chief political reporter for \"The Des Moines register\", Brianne Pfannenstiel.</p><p>Good morning to both of you.</p><p>APRIL RYAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>MARTIN: Brianne, let me start with you since you were the one that covers Iowa politics day in and day out. What did you think of the results of this poll?</p><p>BRIANNE PFANNENSTIEL, CHIEF POLITICAL REPORTER, DES MOINES REGISTER: This poll was interesting when you look at kind of this top tier we are seeing developed among these presidential candidates. You know, with 24 people running, it's really tough for Iowa Democrats to make sense of this massive field of candidates so we are seeing them kind of separate out.</p><p>Joe Biden is still in the lead but these three candidates who are kind of vying for second place are really kind of capturing the attention of people. We see Elizabeth warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg vying for the second-place spot. And so, today, when we go to Cedar Rapids hall of fame dinner that the Iowa Democratic Party is hosting, it will be fascinating to see how the three interact and how the crowd reacts to them because they are each about a percentage point apart. Bernie Sanders is at 16 percent and Elizabeth warren at 15 percent and Mayor Pete at 14 percent.</p><p>So this is all kind of within the polls margin of error. So to see them all kind of clustered together at the top, it will be really fascinating to see if any of them can stand out today on the ground in Iowa.</p><p>PAUL: So, April, Biden and Sanders led not only these polls but they led the polls in December, they led the polls in March that were done. They were Iowa polls. Do we make of anything of that consistency just yet or is it too early to tell? RYAN: Well, we are way early. It's very early. But this is a great telltale sign. Remember, Iowa is the clencher. Once you get it, you know, there's a strong possibility you could be the nominee.</p><p>I mean, look at what happened with Barack Obama. Many people thought that, hey, he wasn't really viable and then Iowa put him on top and he became president of the United States. What will I say is we have got a lot of time to go, though. And anything can happen between now and then.</p><p>Joe Biden, right now, is the lead. But that lead is kind of small compared to other national polls. And Joe Biden is going to have widened that lead. You never know. Kamala Harris could come back from fifth place in those Iowa polls and jump in there to compete against Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren and also Bernie Sanders.</p><p>But the bottom line is Joe Biden is the one to beat at this moment. And he even has to worry, even though he has this number one spot, he has to widen that margin. It's too close.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Brianne, the polling suggests that elect ability is key here. Sixty-five percent, I think it was, said they want someone who's going to basically defeat President Trump. So, in other words, not so much heavily focused on issues or proposals, it's just want somebody to win, right?</p><p>PFANNENSTIEL: I think when you talk to Iowa Democrats on the ground, that's the key thing for them. We want to win. We want to beat Donald Trump.</p><p>When you talk to people, they might tell you, you know, Mayor Pete is my first choice for president but I'm really worried he can't be Donald Trump. You have a lot of these people kind of trying to game through what the rest of this election might look like, what a general election might look like and so, I don't think it will surprised a lot of people to hear the poll shows among the group of Iowa Democratic caucus-goers who say that Joe Biden is their first choice, winning is more important to them than it is among the general population of this.</p><p>PAUL: I want to real quickly ask about this virtual caucus. This is new material. How does that going to work? And how does change the dynamics of what we've known Iowa to be until now?.</p><p>PFANNENSTIEL: This is a massive shift for the Iowa Democratic Party. What they are allowing basically is people who want to participate in the caucuses which, for a long time, have been in-person exercise. They're going to allow people to participate online or over their phones, and this is an effort to expand access to people who can't get there in person, and who have other time obligations, who physically are unable to go out and to participate.</p><p>But it's really -- it's a massive shift and I can't under score that enough because we have no idea how many people plan to participate, what kinds of people plan to participate, the campaigns themselves don't know this so they are starting try to figure out how they can organize around these caucuses. The big question mark is their participation is capped at 10 percent of the overall delegate allot many so it's kind of cap in this way that could throw the results.</p><p>SAVIDGE: April, real quick, before we run out of time. I want ask you one question regarding \"The New York Times\" reporting on this tariff deal which the president has been touting with Mexico.</p><p>RYAN: Yes.</p><p>[07:15:00] SAVIDGE: And yet, it appears that a lot of these sort of things that were agreed upon were agreed upon months ago, in other words, a deal that already done and he is saying, look at my brand-new deal!</p><p>RYAN: Yes, martin like what is old is new, right? So, basically, when this deal was done before, it was done with the then homeland security head, Kirstjen Nielsen, and you know, the president has a problem with Kirstjen Nielsen, she is no longer in the White House. So, he wanted to make it look like in a fresh face, it was new.</p><p>But it's something but it's nothing new. Nothing new. He wanted to repackage to make it look like he is doing it. This is a kind of thing that they do, there's a lot of smoke in mirrors around the White House to repackage or rebrand, what have you, but it was already on the table.</p><p>Bottom line it's about the fact it was done by Kirstjen Nielsen. Anything she did or the person she was close to even General John Kelly. Anything both of them did is along the wayside and they are making it new.</p><p>If they like the idea they try to rebrand it as theirs. So, this is about the disdain for people and trying to say this is mine versus there. It's unfortunate but that is the way it is.</p><p>PAUL: All right. April Ryan, Brianne Pfannenstiel, we appreciate you both being here. Thank you, ladies.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Meanwhile, the runner-up from the 2016 end of the top end in 2020? We are talking about the election. Today on \"STATE OF THE UNION\" with Jake Tapper, a live exclusive interview with Senator Bernie Sanders. That is \"STATE OF THE UNION\" with Jake Tapper, 9:00 a.m. Eastern , of course, only here on CNN.</p><p>PAUL: Well, the Coast Guard and other rescue crews are searching by air, by sea right now to find a police chief who fell out of his fishing boat off the coast of Texas. We have the latest for you.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Plus, the family of an army vet is asking for answers after the 41-year-old died in police custody. Coming up, what authorities are saying about his death.</p><p>[08:20:01] SAVIDGE: It has been more than a year since an army veteran died while in police custody and his family is still trying to determine what happened to their loved one.</p><p>PAUL: Yes, in April of last year, Everitt Palmer Jr. drove to Pennsylvania to resolve an outstanding DUI warrant. Two days later, the 41-year-old father of two was dead and when his body was returned to the family, it was missing several organs.</p><p>Here is CNN's Polo Sandoval.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: All we know is what the family of Everett Palmer Jr. says authorities have told him and that is that their loved one died while in police custody in York County, Pennsylvania, last April. According to the family, an initial autopsy by the York County coroner's office stated that Palmer died after an incident involving an excited state where he started to hit his head against the inside of his cell door and, at the time, was restrained by authorities. But the report also showing that he had traces of methamphetamine in his system and concluded the cause of death is undetermined.</p><p>The family says that, though, he did have a history of drug use but this kind of behavior not like him, so they hired their own pathologist long after the death. That pathologist discovered that the heart, the brain, the throat were missing from Palmer's body. The York County coroner Pamela Gay says an explanation for that. The organs, according to her, were retained for further study and will not be released until the investigation is complete and said that was to determine if was there any asphyxiation.</p><p>The way Gay describes it is they have a process investigating these kind of questionable deaths and that process is being followed and they also say that they have been in contact with the family who says through their attorney that they still want more transparency and want more answers, according to them. They are still calling on authorities to release potentially any surveillance video that captured the interior of that holding cell the day that this happened. They say they have been told what happened to their loved one but they want to see it with their own eyes.</p><p>Finally, we did reach out to the York County district attorney to comment. They will not comment on this case as this investigation is still ongoing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE: Understandable, they want answers. Polo Sandoval, thank you.</p><p>PAUL: There's a memorial in place for a Texas girl who police say was killed by her mother's former fiance. We're talking, of course, about Maleah Davis and her remains were found in Fulton, Arkansas, about five hours from Houston where she was reported missing.</p><p>Last night, there were dozens of people who attended a vigil in that Arkansas community to honor her. Authorities say the 4-year-old's body was discovered in a trash bag along the highway there. The cause and manner of her death are still pending.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Coming up, a massive search effort under way right now off the coast of Texas for a police chief who fell out of his fishing boat. We are talking live with one of the search crews after the break.</p><p>PAUL: Look at that. It was a celebration but turned to panic after reports of gunfire sent crowds running. This was in Washington, D.C., at the pride parade. What police are saying about that incident this morning.</p><p>[07:26:54] PAUL: There is a massive search going on right now for a police chief who fell out of a boat off the coast of Texas. His name is Chris reed. He and his wife were fishing when their boat was hit from a wake from a large err passing vessel. Now, as we understand it, he fell out of the boat we understand he was not wearing a life jacket.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Reed is also a retired paratrooper and serves on a local school board. He has a wife and three children.</p><p>Joining us now is Tim Miller. He's founder and director of the Texas Equisearch and Recovery.</p><p>PAUL: Yes. So, I know, Tim, you're on one of those search boats currently. We will get to that status in a minute.</p><p>But can you help us understand if he was in the bay and he fell out of the boat and he couldn't back in? Was he knocked unconscious? What do you know?</p><p>TIM MILLER, FOUNDER &amp; DIRECTOR, TEXAS EQUISEARCH (via telephone): Well, from my understanding, of course, this is not the first time we have searched out here, but when the ships go by they put out a huge wake. Apparently, just wasn't prepared when the wake hit. And it threw him out of the boat.</p><p>And from what I understand, his wife, you know, did see him out there, tried to throw a rope to him and couldn't get it to him. Unfortunately, (INAUDIBLE) not able to reel him in (INAUDIBLE) I actually knew Chris Reed.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Tim, so update us on where things stand. Obviously, crews have been searching all night and as daylight returns the effort becomes renewed. What is the status of things now in the water?</p><p>MILLER: Right now, we are just beginning to start to begin this morning and, you know, we have got different tides that come in and come out, but -- and different currents and then, again, you know, the wakes that come from all of the ships and a tremendous amount of ships go through that also effects the under tows. So, you know, we searched until 4:00 in the morning and night before last and got back up at 5:30 and was out there until dark yesterday and we think -- was kind of surprised as warm as the water is that he's not floated. But got only knows, you know, with all of the elements of the currents and the ships and stuff where he could end up. So we will have a massive search again this morning and praying that we can bring some type of close tour today.</p><p>PAUL: Tim, I'm so sorry. I heard you say you knew him. I think what is surprising he was an army paratrooper. He was the police of chief. I know they said he fell out of the boat without a life jacket but it sounds like he is a pretty tough guy. Tell me about him.</p><p>MILLER: Yes. No, he is a tough guy. He is a tough guy. Now whether he hit his head, whether, you know, got only knows what the conditions (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>PAUL: I'm sorry. I think losing a little bit of Tim.</p><p>Tim, please, if you can hear us, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us and we are thinking all of you there and best of luck in the search today.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Hopefully, is there a miracle still to be found.</p><p>PAUL: No doubt, no doubt.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Meanwhile, crowds in Washington were forced to run for cover after hearing what they thought was gunfire. Coming up, what we are learning about the disturbance at Washington's pride parade.</p><p>PAUL: And the Trump administration has rejected requests from embassies around the world to fly the rainbow flag from their main flag poles. How some embassies are -- they are getting creative to celebrate pride month.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Tonight on \"THE REDEMPTION PROJECT WITH VAN JONES\", Van Jones visits Joshua Gunner Johnson who was the victim of a shooting in 1994.

This stuff sucks and it's hard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: Watch \"THE REDEMPTION PROJECT WITH VAN JONES\" tonight a 9:00 Eastern, only on CNN.</p><p>[07:35:43] SAVIDGE: Washington's pride parade came to a very abrupt end with crowds running away what they thought was gunfire. Listen.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)</p><p>PAUL: There were several minutes of panic before police were able to secure the area. One man was arrested for possession of a handgun but police say there is no evidence any shots were fired. Seven parade- goers were injured while they were running away and after the chaos, police cancelled the rest of the parade. Other pride activities went on as planned.</p><p>And, of course, this month, several U.S. embassies around the world are flying the rainbow flags in honor of LGBTQ pride month, despite apparently the Trump administration rejecting their request to fly them from the main flag pole.</p><p>SAVIDGE: For some embassies their routine to fly the flag has been something they do every year. But the State Department has to give those embassies permission to fly anything other than the American flag for the main flag pole.</p><p>So, joining us is CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter.</p><p>And, Brian, pretty fascinating the way some of these embassies tried to work this.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yes. According to \"The Washington Post\" this morning, some of the embassies have found ways around these rules and this is a great example of the power of leaks and the power of journalism to show what the government is doing or not doing in the name of its citizens.</p><p>Obviously, for decades, the U.S. has made great progress with regards to gay rights. We've seen during the Obama administration even more steps to make the State Department more inclusive and to encourage LGBTQ rights all around the world. It's been an initiative of the government to be promoting this all around the world, and that's why the embassies in past years, American embassies in past years, have had the gay pride flag up during pride month.</p><p>What is notable now in the third year of the Trump administration with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo running the State Department is that apparently the requests from the embassies to put up the flag on the main flag pole have been denied by the State Department. This is a new thing this year. It was first report by NBC News.</p><p>So, clearly, there is some disappointed or frustrated or angry embassy staffers who have been leaking to news outlets about this problem. As I mentioned, \"The Washington Post\" confirmed this over the weekend and provided more information and some of the pictures we see here, some ways that the embassies are getting around this strange situation.</p><p>By the way, the idea that if you're working in a embassy halfway around the world and you got to get permission to fly a flag on the flag pole from D.C. kind of seems like big government bureaucracy to me, but in any case, it's good that these issues are being publicized through these leaks to these news outlets.</p><p>PAUL: I guess you can understand a little bit if it's your embassy some sort of connection there.</p><p>STELTER: To State Department headquarters.</p><p>PAUL: Yes. However what I think was interesting. President Trump released a statement, I think just within the last couple of weeks, affirming LGBTQ rights, yes?</p><p>STELTER: Right, that's right.</p><p>PAUL: He invited other nations to get involved in this world campaign.</p><p>STELTER: That's right.</p><p>PAUL: So almost as if the president is saying one thing. Where does the State Department mandate come from?</p><p>STELTER: Right. Makes you wonder if this is part of a broader effort within the State Department to be pushing certain religious values and downplaying can inclusiveness but seeing from the U.S. government in the past couple of decades, especially in the past few years.</p><p>You're right. Trump put out a statement supporting pride month. Some of these embassies have been republished that statement one of their own ways of making a statement about this strange flag situation.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Well, it's good to see the good wins out. Brian Stelter, thanks very much for that.</p><p>PAUL: Thanks, Brian.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Make sure, later, you watch Brian's show \"RELIABLE SOURCES.\" Congressman David Cicilline joins Brian to discuss his antitrust probe of big tech companies. That will be RELIABLE SOURCES today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern, only on CNN.</p><p>PAUL: There is a severe risk of fires in Arizona this weekend. Firefighters there, you can see why. I mean, look what they are dealing with. They are trying to get control of this wildfire that's already burned more than 7,000 acres.</p><p>[07:40:04] What officials say is behind the flames now.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Plus, in one of the most remote areas in the world, sea ice is not facing a threat above the water but also from below. CNN heads out with a team of scientists to the far corners of the Arctic Circle to find out what is behind the rapidly melting ice.</p><p>SAVIDGE: A large wildfire burning out of control in Arizona this morning. The so-called Mountain Fire has burned through 7,000 acres in the Tonto National Forest, northeast of Phoenix.</p><p>PAUL: You know, this is a popular recreation starts and part of the campground there have been closed and the fire they know was now human caused.</p><p>Meteorologist Allison Chinchar with the latest on the fires and severe weather threat today.</p><p>There is a severe weather threat but as I understand they might get a little bit of a break today in Arizona?</p><p>[07:45:04] ALLISON CHINCHAR, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes. So, the main concern really for the fires is going to be short term. The long term we see the winds die down on the flip side the temperatures start to go up. So, you've got to pick and choose here.</p><p>The low humidities that we expect across areas of California today, we are talking in the afternoon at the best maybe 15 percent. But some parts of the day even lower than that. Then you also have to factor in the gusty winds. We are talking up to 50 miles per hour. Keep in mind 20, 30 miles per hour is enough to spread a fire. Fifty miles per hour can spread them much farther and very, very quickly.</p><p>In addition to that, we talked about that heat. It's not just for California. We are talking Nevada, Arizona, even Oregon looking at these excessive heat alerts that we have here.</p><p>Look at reading, for example. The average high 88. We are 97 today, 108 on Tuesday. Las Vegas topping out at 105 on Tuesday, and Palm Springs, 114.</p><p>So, again, incredible heat. And it's not the only place. Texas looking at a heat advisory and even an excessive heat warning for extreme southern portions of the state.</p><p>Look at Brownsville. Now, here is the thing. In Texas, it's not just the temperature but also the humidity. The feels like temperature in Brownsville today is going to be 116. Houston, 105. Dallas right around 100.</p><p>But it's not just the heat. Remember, we also have the potential to severe storms across portions of Texas and Oklahoma. The main threats will be damaging winds and potential for large hail and even some tornadoes. And again, Christi and Martin, the main time line here for those storms is going to be late this afternoon and carrying into the evening hours as well.</p><p>PAUL: Allison Chinchar, thank you.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Well, for the longest time the story of ice melt is about rising air temperatures but what is happening under the sea ice? What a team of scientists is learning in the remote areas of the world, that's next.</p><p>[07:50:46] PAUL: Well, on the front line of climate change, a team of scientists is collecting data to better understand the reasons behind the rapid ice melt in one of the world's most remote areas.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And CNN's Arwa Damon joined them out in the far reaches of the Arctic where the ice is not just facing a threat from above the water, but also from below.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's spring in the arctic, nature is waking up as the sea ice melt, warmed by 24 hours of sunlight. This year saw a record loss of sea ice in April across the Arctic, and this is where that ice comes to die. But the story of ice loss is more than just warming air.</p><p>TILL WAGNER, POLAR PHYSICIST, UNC WILMINGTON: I would lean towards trying to keep going a little further in.</p><p>MATTIAS CAPE, BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHER, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON: OK.</p><p>DAMON: We're in the Fram Strait, far north in the Arctic Circle.</p><p>CAPE: So we're choosing this area, because this is an area where we have this warm water meeting the ice edge.</p><p>DAMON: Biological oceanographer, Mattias Cape, is one of a small group of scientists headed by polar physicist, Till Wagner. The warm water they're talking about is the fast-moving Gulf Stream, originating in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>WAGNER: It's actually this warm water is at the surface as it comes up and then it drops under the ice as it goes into the Arctic Ocean. And that layer that's under the ice, that has been coming up closer to the surface and melting the ice from underneath.</p><p>DAMON: We know the oceans are taking the brunt of global warming we have caused. But the team wants to understand how the way the ice and water are interacting affects our changing world.</p><p>WAGNER: What we're trying to do is find ice that's representative of the area.</p><p>DAMON: And ice that doesn't risk breaking apart under our feet. With a polar bear guard on watch, the team works on the ice flows day after day.</p><p>(on camera): There are so many challenges when it comes to really understanding our planet's changing climate. It's a bit like trying to put together a puzzle whose pieces are constantly changing. Changing faster than the science and the studies can keep up with.</p><p>(voice-over): The team drove through the ice to measure thickness.</p><p>WAGNER: So we're starting to get a fairly good idea and it has definitely thinned in this -- in this area, as well. It's basically thinned everywhere.</p><p>DAMON: Extracting ice cores that hold frozen clues.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, wow, look at this. Beautiful. We've got about a meter of ice core right here. And inside this piece of ice, actually, is a little microscopic forest.</p><p>DAMON: Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise is converted into a floating lab.</p><p>CAPE: All right. I can grab the first one.</p><p>DAMON: Melted ice-core samples come to life under the microscope. A kaleidoscope of algae and phytoplankton.</p><p>CAPE: So these sea-ice algae and phytoplankton, in general, are tremendously important for carbon drawdown. These -- they photosynthesize, takes in carbon dioxide.</p><p>DAMON: Phytoplankton don't just store carbon dioxide, they jumpstart the cycle of life. Feeding on the phytoplankton under the ice are zoo plankton which, in turn, feed small fish, feeding the bigger fish all the way up the food chain, including us.</p><p>WAGNER: Ooh, exciting, yes. Yes, there's a lot there, and this is very different than what we've seen so far, actually, in terms of just the diversity of things that are in there.</p><p>DAMON: Initial data from hundreds of samples confirmed the team's expectations. Plankton, that critical source of ocean food, concentrates where the freshly-melted ice is.</p><p>WAGNER: This is crazy. How strong. This is 14 milligrams per liter. Really strong bloom.</p><p>CAPE: Yes. Located right at the ice edge. I mean, we did have sea ice around at that station, right?</p><p>WAGNER: Yes. This is like the hot devil water that sits at the bottom. It's just waiting to come up.</p><p>DAMON: Increasing ice melt is wearing down the cycle of life here and undermining nature's carbon storage system.</p><p>[07:55:06] And that's bad news for all of us.</p><p>(on camera): These waters in this region is among the most productive when it comes to the building blocks of ocean life.</p><p>WAGNER: There it is.</p><p>DAMON: There it is. Polar bear tracks.</p><p>(voice-over): Increased melting of glacial and land ice from above and from below have recently led to doubling previous projections of sea level rise, to two meters around the world by the end of the century. That, coupled with the loss of sea ice, is not only going to deprive us of magical moments like this. Beluga whales which rely on the food under the ice to survive.</p><p>It will also deprive us of the riches the ocean now holds, riches we all depend on.</p><p>Arwa Damon, CNN, the Arctic.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAUL: That is something else.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Yes, majestic, isn't it?</p><p>PAUL: It is, yes. Thank you to Arwa Damon there.</p><p>We hope you make good memories today. Thank you starting your day with us.</p><p>SAVIDGE: \"INSIDE POLITICS\" with John King is up right after the break.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.), another contender, has raised concerns about the growth of tech giants.</p><p>It's too early to tell how prominent these issues will be in the 2020 race, but the rhetoric from Democratic lawmakers represents a stark shift from the coziness that marked the relationship between their party and the tech industry as recently as 2016.</p><p>\"Increasingly, the party is moving away from that,\" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, told The Hill. \"I think it's heading toward a breakup.\"</p><p>In 2016, the industry was cold to President Trump's campaign, seeing in Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a champion for their priorities. Tech companies and their workers, who have long skewed to the left, donated heavily to Clinton.</p><p>The shift was gradual, beginning after it was revealed that a Russian \"troll farm\" with suspected ties to the Kremlin had used social media platforms to push a disinformation campaign designed to spread unrest among U.S. voters.</p><p>Later, Facebook was engulfed in controversy last year when it was reported that Cambridge Analytica, a right-wing political consulting firm with ties to Trump and other GOP figures, had improperly obtained data on millions of users without their knowledge.</p><p>The scandal, along with a string of high-profile data breaches, prompted lawmakers of both parties to start paying more attention to how major internet companies collect data on users in order to deliver targeted advertisements.</p><p>The concern about data practices has pushed Congress to work on a potential bipartisan federal privacy law that would regulate the amount of transparency and control users are offered online.</p><p>And it's turned Big Tech into a political punching bag, with lawmakers hammering them on competition and privacy concerns.</p><p>\"We need to put some digital rules of the road into law when it comes to privacy,\" Klobuchar said Sunday at her campaign launch in Minneapolis.</p><p>\"For too long the big tech companies have been telling you, 'Don't worry, we've got your back' while your identities in fact are being stolen and your data is being mined,\" she added. \"Our laws need to be as sophisticated as the people who are breaking them.\"</p><p>Klobuchar has teamed up with another outspoken tech critic, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), to float a bill that would require websites to be more transparent about their data practices and give users the option to opt out of having their information collected.</p><p>Warren, meanwhile, has criticized large tech companies over their effects on competition and the lack of regulation around the industry.</p><p>She has argued that companies, like Amazon and Google, that have accumulated vast amounts of consumer data can use that information to beat competitors that don't have access to it, hurting small businesses and concentrating economic power into fewer companies.</p><p>\"We have to wrestle with this question about these companies that aggregate and monetize data in ways that do not create viable markets, and that have no accountability to the people whose data has actually just been taken,\" she said at a New York Times business conference in September.</p><p>The industry has also found little relief from Trump, who has hammered social media companies over allegations of bias against conservatives and who has floated antitrust investigations into giants like Amazon and Google.</p><p>The industry has pushed back against the criticism it is seeing from political leaders of all stripes.</p><p>\"America enjoys immense benefits \u00af and a sizable economic advantage over the rest of the world \u00af thanks of our internet sector,\" Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, which represents Facebook, Google and Amazon, said in a statement to The Hill.</p><p>\"Small businesses and nonprofits in every community use the internet to grow and achieve their goals,\" he continued. \"We look forward to working with policymakers on fostering an environment that allows for our continued global digital leadership.\"</p><p>But the new political conversation around internet giants' impact on society has been a major win for tech critics who have called on policymakers to confront the industry's growing influence.</p><p>Stoller, the fellow at the Open Markets Institute, said he'd like to see candidates push even harder on companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p>\"Either they run us, or the democracy runs them,\" Stoller said.</p><p>With the 2020 election still 21 months away, the prospect of candidates hitting away at the tech industry is one that worries its leaders and heartens its critics.</p><p>\"I just want candidates to talk about it,\" Stoller added. \"They just need to say, 'Break them up, they're too powerful.' \"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-406P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) will emerge as a big theme across progressive health systems as they seek to proactively engage patients and improve health outcomes that would help healthcare organizations meet quality standards.</p><p>This decade will bring significant changes and disruptions when it comes to digital-service-enabled health. Health and care delivery, as well as prevention in the 2020s, will become more consumer-centric, with AI-powered tools and virtual interactions between patients and care providers becoming the new normal in many situations. Data-driven interoperability and personalized diagnostics will accelerate the delivery of predictive-analysis-driven precision care. This will pave the way for better and efficient decision making for the patient and the provider and further drive partnerships between big tech companies that design care delivery models and healthcare organizations.</p><p>This follows the new vision for healthcare for 2020 and beyond, focusing not only on access, quality, and affordability but also on predictive, preventive, and outcome-based care models that promote social and financial inclusion. In 2020, consumer-driven models of healthcare will gain more market traction, as they stand to better bridge the gap of what consumers want and what healthcare can deliver.</p><p>Central and Eastern Europe is highly fragmented and is emerging as quite an attraction to healthcare investors. Screening services are facilitating better diagnosis of chronic conditions. The rise in disposable income and in healthcare spending is because of the presence of a rapidly aging population and their demand for better healthcare. Economic factors are also at play, with rising wages and disposable incomes freeing up personal money for healthcare-related spending. With the recent rise in minimum wages in Hungary and other recent reforms in various parts of Central and Eastern Europe, the economy in CEE and a parallel drop in unemployment rates are ideal for market participants.</p><p>Key Topics Covered:</p><p>1.

Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) will emerge as a big theme across progressive health systems as they seek to proactively engage patients and improve health outcomes that would help healthcare organizations meet quality standards.</p><p>This decade will bring significant changes and disruptions when it comes to digital-service-enabled health. Health and care delivery, as well as prevention in the 2020s, will become more consumer-centric, with AI-powered tools and virtual interactions between patients and care providers becoming the new normal in many situations. Data-driven interoperability and personalized diagnostics will accelerate the delivery of predictive-analysis-driven precision care. This will pave the way for better and efficient decision making for the patient and the provider and further drive partnerships between big tech companies that design care delivery models and healthcare organizations.</p><p>This follows the new vision for healthcare for 2020 and beyond, focusing not only on access, quality, and affordability but also on predictive, preventive, and outcome-based care models that promote social and financial inclusion. In 2020, consumer-driven models of healthcare will gain more market traction, as they stand to better bridge the gap of what consumers want and what healthcare can deliver.</p><p>Central and Eastern Europe is highly fragmented and is emerging as quite an attraction to healthcare investors. Screening services are facilitating better diagnosis of chronic conditions. The rise in disposable income and in healthcare spending is because of the presence of a rapidly aging population and their demand for better healthcare. Economic factors are also at play, with rising wages and disposable incomes freeing up personal money for healthcare-related spending. With the recent rise in minimum wages in Hungary and other recent reforms in various parts of Central and Eastern Europe, the economy in CEE and a parallel drop in unemployment rates are ideal for market participants.</p><p>Key Topics Covered:</p><p>1.

Tulsi Gabbard, the long-shot presidential candidate from Hawaii, said in a federal lawsuit that Google infringed on her free speech when it briefly suspended her campaign's advertising account after the first Democratic debate in June.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lawsuit, filed Thursday in a federal court in Los Angeles, is believed to be the first time a presidential candidate has sued a major technology firm.</p><p> In a twist that reflects Gabbard's unorthodox political views, the claim that her speech was stifled by Google is similar to complaints made over the last year in Republican circles. Few Democrats have raised similar concerns.</p><p> Big tech companies like Google are getting increasing scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators around the world for a wide variety of issues, including their influence on political debate, their handling of consumer data and the aggressive way they compete with smaller companies.</p><p> A day before the Gabbard lawsuit was filed, Facebook said the Federal Trade Commission had opened a formal antitrust investigation into its business practices. Earlier in the day, the FTC announced that Facebook was fined a record $5 billion for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal data.</p><p> Tulsi Now Inc., the campaign committee for Gabbard, said Google suspended the campaign's advertising account for six hours on June 27-28, obstructing its ability to raise money and spread her message to potential voters.</p><p> After the first Democratic debate, Gabbard was briefly the most searched-for candidate on Google. Her campaign wanted to capitalize on the attention she was receiving by buying ads that would have placed its website at the top of search results for her name.</p><p> The lawsuit also said the Gabbard campaign believed its emails were being placed in spam folders on Gmail at \"a disproportionately high rate\" when compared with emails from other Democratic candidates.</p><p> \"Google's arbitrary and capricious treatment of Gabbard's campaign should raise concerns for policymakers everywhere about the company's ability to use its dominance to impact political discourse, in a way that interferes with the upcoming 2020 presidential election,\" the lawsuit said.</p><p> Gabbard and her campaign are seeking an injunction against Google from further meddling in the election and damages of at least $50 million.</p><p>Google has automated systems that flag unusual activity on advertiser accounts - including large spending changes - to prevent fraud, said Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for the company.</p><p> \"In this case, our system triggered a suspension and the account was reinstated shortly thereafter,\" he said. \"We are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters, and we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology.\"</p><p> No other campaigns have publicly claimed that Google has suspended their advertising accounts.</p><p> Interest in Gabbard, who has served four terms in the House and is an Army National Guard veteran, spiked after the debate. She entered the presidential race as a relative unknown and is still polling at less than 1%, according to New York Times polling averages.</p><p> But her appeal has crossed traditional party lines. She has drawn support from both the right and the left because of a staunch anti-war message. She has also received favorable coverage from influential conservative news media like Drudge Report, Fox News and Breitbart.</p><p> Gabbard's campaign is historic even in a race with many potential firsts. She was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21, becoming the youngest woman to join a U.S. state legislature. When she was elected as representative for Hawaii in 2012, she was the first Samoan American and first Hindu member of Congress.</p><p> Her political views are unusual among Democratic candidates. She has a history of making anti-gay statements and worked for an anti-gay advocacy group run by her father. She has since apologized and said her past views were wrong.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKHI-8839429</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899058A9546F3 NWBKHI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-P0C1-DXVP-V1SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409134</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 West Hawaii Today.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Many tech executives view the banking world as ripe for technological disruption and are targeting it as the next big opportunity for future growth. </p><p>                     The next big policy debate for Big Tech will be over location data                   </p><p>Growing public awareness of how<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/21/uk-tech-confounding-brexit-uncertainty-attract-record-investment/\">their location data</url>gleaned from their smartphones can be used to build a staggeringly accurate portrait of their lives is starting to become a political issue. 2020 could be the year it enters mainstream debate and faces mounting opposition from privacy campaigners.</p><p>Regulators around the world are already scrutinising ways to rein in the power of big tech. This could be the next emerging front on which that war is fought.</p><p>                     Cashlessness will become increasingly problematic                   </p><p>Britain is rapidly hurtling towards becoming<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/21/uk-tech-confounding-brexit-uncertainty-attract-record-investment/\">a cashless society.</url></p><p>While there are obvious benefits to this - lower levels of crime because of a lack of tangible cash to pinch and greater difficulty laundering the proceeds of criminal activity - the challenges are likely to become increasingly clear over the next 12 months.</p><p>Above all, it is the poorest members of society and those without bank accounts who will have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/21/uk-tech-confounding-brexit-uncertainty-attract-record-investment/\">increasing difficulty making and receiving payments</url>. That in turn risks creating an underclass of people who may struggle to access basic services - or be charged extra for the privilege of doing so using cash. </p><p>Of course, electronic payments also mean the ability to trace every purchase that you make, representing a further blow to privacy.</p><p>                     Electric vehicles will become more affordable                   </p><p>Advances in electric vehicle technology and growing competition between the worlds top manufacturers mean consumers will start getting a better deal in 2020.</p><p>Battery manufacturing is getting cheaper while energy density is improving.</p><p>The launch of a plethora of new models from different manufacturers is also likely to drive costs down, narrowing the affordability gap between<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/21/uk-tech-confounding-brexit-uncertainty-attract-record-investment/\">electric and conventional cars.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-59070687</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWB-2P31-JCJY-G4GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"822\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Silicon Valley's ongoing privacy failures and inability to address misinformation, dotted by lackluster products, only ramped up in 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By now, the public - and state and federal lawmakers - have gotten an eyeful of the tech sector's privacy failures, while struggling to square it with those companies' insatiable appetite for more data. All this and more feeds into a general distrust of <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/2020s-fashion-predictions-synthetic-stylists-stilettos-drone-chanel-ar-glasses-1203413932/\">technology</url>. And that leaves retail in a somewhat awkward place, because data seems all but assured to continue driving the consumer experience in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, the experts have been advising stores and brands en masse to put data at the heart of their growth strategies. That's only going to accelerate this year, especially for merchandisers.</p><p>According to Graham Cooke, chief executive officer and cofounder of marketing personalization firm Qubit, they'll become more \"data-empowered,\" serving as a lynchpin for marketing, optimization, IT and the customer.</p><p>This year will bring more individualized, real-time personalization, he added. When brands analyze and take action on large amounts of data in milliseconds, \"customer-centricity will be fully realized because machine learning models will actually understand each customer individually,\" Cooke said.</p><p>The prospect is exciting for brands, but it may be the stuff of nightmares for privacy wonks, not to mention increasingly sophisticated tech users. Cooke acknowledged as much: \"We're at a crossroads on consumer data and its ownership,\" he added. \"Right now, brands such as Google, Facebook and Amazon are still on the winning end of customer data ownership, but I predict this will begin to change in 2020.\"</p><p>Of course, winning is relative. Especially when it comes to big tech.</p><p>Facebook and Google's advertising models have been facing intense scrutiny and, some believe, an inevitable march toward regulation. Facebook's incoherence in addressing misinformation has become legendary. Meanwhile, Google's $2.1 billion Fitbit acquisition and Ascension hospital partnership, which puts tens of millions of patient records at stake, raised eyebrows in 2019.</p><p>They're not alone. Amazon's efforts to connect the home triggered surveillance concerns last year, while Apple drew criticism for its perceived cooperation with the Chinese government, failure to deliver its anticipated AirPower wireless charger and what looks like Apple Card's algorithmic bias against women in setting credit limits.</p><p>The public can shake its head at companies pushing mantras like \"don't be evil\" while watching them engage priorities that their own employees find distasteful. But historically, people have allowed those feelings to live in a bubble, apart from the rest of their lives.</p><p>That may be shifting. Already the privacy failures have prompted some users to close their Facebook accounts or choose camera-equipped smart home products with physical shutter or microphone on/off buttons.</p><p>How the sentiment translates to <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/5-takeaways-for-retail-from-ces-1203417645/\">retail</url> will matter a lot this year. None of the experts believe that 2020 will bring a mass tech exodus - far from it - but it will bring changes in consumer behavior.</p><p>\"People will spend even more time using technology in 2020 than they did in 2019. It's inevitable,\" said Michael J. Wolf, chief executive officer of management consulting and strategy firm Activate. \"They will be more discerning, however, about the applications and devices they use, moving to ones that they feel they can trust with their private information.\"</p><p>Governments want to give consumers more rights, including the ability to delete their data. \"Retail brands really need to pay attention to new legislation, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, or they could suffer the consequences,\" Cooke continued. He sees the rise of applications that let shoppers port their data into environments they can control, and that could shift the \"power dynamic\" between marketers and consumers.</p><p>Regardless, it won't stifle tech's momentum in retail this year. There's simply too much on the brink of mass adoption to ignore.</p><p>\"When people in the future talk about 2020, they'll remember it as the year of significant technological advancement,\" said chief product officer Omar Khan of Magic Leap, a tech firm that works with brands like H&amp;M, Wayfair and others to deliver new types of experiential retail. \"[It's] the start of a decade that will completely change the way we live, work and are entertained in the decades that follow.\" The reason: greater processing speeds and new computing models.</p><p>In particular, Web 3.0, artificial intelligence, faster 5G connectivity and the so-called Internet of Things -\u00a0which allow devices to work together directly, with little to no human intervention -\u00a0will \"unlock possibilities that were previously restricted to science fiction,\" Khan added. Imagine, he said, things like connected smart mirrors that can project digital clothes onto consumers.</p><p>As for big tech, Activate's Wolf believes retail tech platforms like Shopify could give indie, digital native brands such as Allbirds and Kylie Cosmetics a way to sidestep forced marriages with major players like Amazon.</p><p>Other indies will find success in \"recommerce\" or secondhand apparel online, he added. \"From online renting to resale, recommerce is becoming a mainstream behavior for 18- to 34-year-olds,\" said Wolf, explaining that younger consumers don't want to wear the same outfit in multiple social media posts. That, plus a rising sense of eco-consciousness, has ignited the sector. \"Over 50 percent have bought and/or sold a used item online in the past year alone, and nearly 20 percent have rented clothes or accessories online,\" he added.</p><p>Other trends -\u00a0from social commerce to physical stores adopting a growing load of digital systems, AI, sensors and other tools -\u00a0put a finer point on tech's influence on the retail business. Against this backdrop, it looks like neither consumers nor retailers are ready to break up with it.</p><p>But they may be willing to acknowledge that the starry-eyed infatuation stage is over.</p><p>More from WWD</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/5-takeaways-for-retail-from-ces-1203417645/\">5 Takeaways for Retail From CES 2020</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/legal/customs-amazon-fakes-online-1203417589/\">Customs Teams With Amazon, eBay to Target Fakes Bought Online</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/2020s-fashion-predictions-synthetic-stylists-stilettos-drone-chanel-ar-glasses-1203413932/\">Moore From L.A.: 2020s Fashion Predictions: Synthetic Stylists, Stilettos by Drone, Chanel AR Glasses</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WOWEDA-1203409703</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WOWEDA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY6-S3H1-DYJW-X2R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434863</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1057\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>WWD</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 10, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I cover Congress.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 And I'm Domenico Montanaro, political editor.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And we're here to talk about the opening arguments from the 2020 candidates. Yesterday, we heard from <person><nameText>Kamala Harris, </nameText></person>Cory Booker and <person><nameText>Pete Buttigieg. </nameText></person>Today, we are going to talk through interviews that Morning Edition did with <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>and Amy Klobuchar. They are all senators. And each of them sat down with Morning Edition, and we have gone through these interviews and brought our favorite moments. Scott, you focused on <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>who was in conversation with Rachel Martin.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. And let's just start out with the very beginning of the interview because Rachel got to the heart of the question we had about <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>and his run this time.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 You lost the Democratic primary in 2016...             </p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS</nameText></person>:                 So I heard.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 ...News you are no doubt aware of.             </p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS</nameText></person>:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 But you have won a different kind of victory in that the ideas that you championed during that campaign, they're now part of the mainstream conversation on the left, in particular health care.             </p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS</nameText></person>:                 Not on the left. They have mainstreamed for the American people. Virtually, all of the ideas that we campaigned on are now supported by a majority of the American people and an overwhelming majority of Democrats and independents.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 So if we take the Democratic presidential field, you've got candidates now who sound like <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders. </nameText></person>So why do you need to run?             </p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS</nameText></person>:                 (Laughter) Well, maybe the more appropriate question is why do they need to run?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah, and that's true. We've talked at length about how a lot of these issues a bulk of the field agrees with Sanders. I think that question has been answered in the opening weeks of his campaign so far and that <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>is off to a very strong start. He's getting big crowds. He's getting a lot of attention. He's raising a lot of money. And there's a lot of people who say even with the <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>menu from a lot of other candidates, they're still interested in <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders.     </nameText></person></p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Much like people like McDonald's or they like their favorite restaurant - no, maybe I shouldn't go that way.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 He's from Vermont. I think he would be upset with that description of that kind of food that he...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Get that corporate food out of...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 But they like <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders.     </nameText></person></p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 It is not just about what he stands for. The people who support him, his most ardent supporters, also like the person who is delivering the message.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Anyone who wanted to dismiss <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>as an also ran from 2016 who lost and doesn't have a chance this time is sorely mistaken, especially given the level of money that <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>is able to raise - some $10 million in that first week - and the level of support that he continues to get. Now, there are some people who don't like <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>because he's still not a Democrat. He ran against Hillary Clinton, and a lot of the Clinton fans don't like him. There's - all that is mixed in there. But he is still a top contender.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So second point - <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>is an unapologetic democratic socialist. And we have seen, and we have talked about the fact that one of the main attack lines against the Democratic field from President Trump and Republicans is this idea of a socialist takeover of the Democratic Party. Rachel asked about that, and speaking about \"Medicare for All\" and some of his other proposals and the concern does that open you up to attacks, here's how <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>framed that.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS</nameText></person>:                 Well, it reminds me of - some of my colleagues tell me about meetings they went to when they have irate conservatives standing up and says, get the government off of my Medicare, get the government off of my Social Security. In fact, some of the most popular programs in this country are, quote-unquote, \"big government.\" They are Social Security. Try messing with Social Security. People will not be responsive. Try messing with Medicare. Try messing with the Veterans Administration. Veterans feel very positive about that. That's all big government.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Does private insurance go away?             </p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS</nameText></person>:                 Yes, it does because you're not going to have a need for private insurance when, like other countries, comprehensive health care through a Medicare for All program covers all of your basic needs. Now, having said that...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 He was so matter of fact about, yep, private insurance, it's gone.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. And in terms of the political argument he was making, we saw a little bit of this in real time in the past decade of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare - very unpopular, a big liability for Democrats. Once it was established and threatened, suddenly a lot of voters were very pro Obamacare.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Let's put a marker on that. That is a radical idea - getting rid of private insurance in the United States when so many people have their insurance through the employer-based system. And people tend to like their insurance when you poll them. They like the insurance that they get. This is a huge sort of groundbreaking foundational idea, visionary kind of idea, that when you look at the progressive young Democratic base, this is why so many of them were attracted to <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>in 2016 because he wasn't going to be a, quote-unquote, \"incrementalist.\" He was somebody who said let's change American society, and here's how we do it.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And the last thing - one of the things that I covered a lot over the last couple years as <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>was clearly thinking about running for president again - one of the things that I paid attention to was how is he positioning himself differently? And I wrote a couple stories on the fact that he was clearly going out of his way to develop a <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>foreign policy, something that he totally ignored in 2016 to the point of, you know, regularly changing the subject when the issue came up. But he's given several speeches. He's put forward several proposals. And he tries to kind of walk the line between the isolationism that President Trump tends to veer towards and the, you know - and the nation-building type approach of American foreign policy at its most robust. So two moments - here's the first one.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS</nameText></person>:                 I want to see us not engaged in never-ending wars. I want to see us work with our allies all over the world in fighting terrorism, in fighting authoritarianism, in fighting the fight against fossil fuels and the real dangers of climate change. That's the kind of internationalism I want to see.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Then Rachel pushed him a little more into some of the specific areas where the U.S. is right now.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 We're currently in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, as you mentioned, Yemen, Niger, Somalia, Libya. Are any of those a good idea? I mean, would a <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>administration pull America back from that role as the world's police (ph)?             </p><p><person><nameText>BERNIE SANDERS</nameText></person>:                 I am not a great fan of - I think if you look at the concept of nation building, the unintended consequences have been horrific, whether you think about the tragedy of Vietnam, which I opposed as a young man, or the war in Iraq where the Bush administration lied to us. And I was one of the leaders in the House in opposition to that war. So I think we have to be very, very careful in terms of nation building and our involvement in other countries' internal issues. But, you know, obviously, you're going to have to look at every country in a case-by-case basis.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 You know, in some ways, that sounds like some of the things that candidate Trump said.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 It sure does, doesn't it? It sounds a little bit - there is a tremendous overlap of a Venn diagram between Sanders and Trump in some areas of economic and foreign policy.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 It's not the pulling away from NATO or pulling away from sort of global institutions...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah, I don't...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...But it is the anti-interventionism that obviously as president, although President Trump wants to pull out of Syria, wants to pull out of Afghanistan, he hasn't actually done it. And he also sort of flirts with the idea of going into Venezuela.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I think I would disagree because, well, Sanders wants to take a more narrow view. He's also pro all these coalitions that Trump has pulled back from, pro aggressively addressing climate change and a lot of things like that.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 And I would also point out that, you know, not - being opposed to nation building isn't the same as also taking some interventions in places. And Sanders said in that interview that, you know, countries have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. I don't think that means putting up, you know, a giant wall around the country to not, you know, intervene ever in other countries.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 All right. We are going to take a quick break. And when we get back, we're going to walk through the interviews that <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>and Amy Klobuchar did with Morning Edition. Their opening arguments after the break.             </p><p>                And we're back. And let's talk now about <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren. </nameText></person>I dove into her interview with Steve Inskeep, and I wants to start with I think something that sets the tone for the whole interview.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 In your mind, are you tweaking and better regulating the economy we have or fundamentally reshaping the economy if you're president of the United States?             </p><p><person><nameText>ELIZABETH WARREN</nameText></person>:                 No, this is a big structural change. It's big structural change in politics, big structural change in the economy and big structural change in Washington.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Big structural change - we are not talking about small ball here. And in fact, she has a lot of plans. She's not just sort of talking about it. She is talking about it with specifics.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah. I mean, look; big structural change is a big deal, but it's also not the kind of structural change that, say, <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>is talking about with, like, going into socialism versus staying within capitalism. She has a very aggressive approach when you're talking about regulations.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Which isn't to say that she's, like, an incrementalist or anything like that. But, you know, she wants to use the tools of the U.S. government in an aggressive way and in a way that we've seen when both parties have been in charge, that it hasn't been fully applied - talking about scrutiny on banks, talking about regulation of Wall Street, things like that.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah. I mean, I guess it's like the difference between burn the house down and gut it and rebuild from the inside.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. She's not repainting rooms, but, yeah, she wants to do a lot of work.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah. She's knocking walls down. And, yeah, I mean, that's a - yeah - and expanding and all that. Yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So to get to that, I mean, she has plans for a lot of things. This is not abstract for her when she talks about big structural change. She is proposing big structural change. And in one of the ways she's doing that in this interview with Steve Inskeep, she was talking about wanting to potentially break up some of the big tech companies. The example she uses is Amazon.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p><person><nameText>ELIZABETH WARREN</nameText></person>:                 So my proposal is just to say, look; this is kind of like baseball. You can run the platform. That is, you can be the umpire. Or you can have a team in the game. That is, you can be pet pillows or Amazon pet pillows, but you don't get to do both at the same time because that's not a level playing field for anyone else. So what I propose is platform will still be there. You can come, and you can still buy 27 coffee makers or whatever you want to look at online. But the competitors will all be competing straight up. Amazon doesn't get that special advantage from having all of this extraordinary amount of information about buyers and sellers that it is not sharing with the rest of the world.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Meaning Amazon will have to sell off part of itself. Is that...             </p><p><person><nameText>ELIZABETH WARREN</nameText></person>:                 That's right.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 ...The way you receive it?             </p><p><person><nameText>ELIZABETH WARREN</nameText></person>:                 It breaks it apart.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 And that's true with Google and...             </p><p><person><nameText>ELIZABETH WARREN</nameText></person>:                 Yup.             </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 ...Quite a few other firms.             </p><p><person><nameText>ELIZABETH WARREN</nameText></person>:                 That's exactly right. But, again, with Google, you can still look up the capital of North Dakota. But Google can't advance its businesses over other businesses that are trying to compete in that Google space.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So, Scott, she is talking about enforcing antitrust laws.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah, and, really, updating them to deal with - which doesn't, maybe, seem like a radical idea when you say it out loud - to deal with the way that our economy has been driven for the last decade or so and, really, address the fact that so many people buy things, find information. The economy is really driven through just a small handful of enormous web companies. And this isn't the only issue. There are so many different areas - paid family leave, several other things - where <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>is staking a claim and forcing the conversation of the primary field.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I am just so struck by how calmly she talks about all of these potential restructurings. You get the sense that she has thought about these plans for a very, very long time and is waiting to implement them.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And this is another good contrast because, I think, while a lot of the candidates have the same broad goals, like you said, Domenico, it's like, OK. And here's my 75-page paper on this that I could've given you three years ago if you asked for it.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Or maybe 15 years ago.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah, yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Like this - some of this is in her area of expertise from back when she was a professor...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 She was a regulator.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...And an advocate...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah, and she...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...And a regulator.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 And, you know, when she ran the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, right? I mean, this is what she knows.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So here's a line from this interview that really stood out to me. She says, I'm tired of freeloading billionaires.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Sounds like someone.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 I mean, it does have a very <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders</nameText></person>-ish sound to it. And - but she's not just tired of freeloading billionaires. She has a plan for relieving them of some of their wealth.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 How to make them not so billionaire anymore.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p><person><nameText>ELIZABETH WARREN</nameText></person>:                 And I say, look. You can have a lot of money. I don't have any problem with that. But I'd like to see you pay a wealth tax that's 2 percent of everything that you own above $50 million. Pay that every year back into the kitty.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And she, in this case, is talking about Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:                 Which, in his case, would be billions of dollars per year.             </p><p><person><nameText>ELIZABETH WARREN</nameText></person>:                 That's exactly right. In fact, it would hit - this wealth tax - only the 75,000 richest families in this country. And yet do you know how much money it would produce? Two percent, 2 percent - 3 percent on fortunes over a billion. It would produce $2.75 trillion over the space of 10 years. And here's how I look at this. Jeff Bezos, you had a great idea. You got out there. You worked hard. And the other 75,000 families, you worked hard. You had a great idea or you inherited very well.             </p><p>                But however it is that it happened, you have this great fortune. But remember. You built this fortune here in America. You used workers that all of us help pay to educate. You got your goods to market on roads and bridges that all of us helped pay to build. You were protected by firefighters and police officers that all of us helped to pay for. And we're glad to do that. But what we're saying is when you make it really, really, really big, put a little back in the kitty so that the next kid gets a chance and the kid after that and the kid after that.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 This is a very familiar argument for those of us who covered the 2012 presidential campaign. This is the Barack Obama you didn't build that argument that became the centerpiece of Republican attacks on him, which, of course, I guess, didn't work.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 And the case she makes is that the problems of income inequality are not related to Donald Trump. You don't really hear her talk about him except to maybe dismiss him, right? She's saying that these are endemic and systemic problems that have gone on for a generation or more and that she has all these plans to fix it.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 OK. Let us go to the last candidate. This is Amy Klobuchar. She was interviewed by NPR's Rachel Martin. Domenico, you listened through to that interview.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I did. Let's be really clear. When we're talking about <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>they're two of the most progressive candidates in this race and people who believe in radical change. They have a vision for the country that they want to enact. This is not the case with Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. The senator is very much a legislator. And let's just get to this point of how pragmatic she is, where Rachel Martin, who interviewed her, asks, do you wonder if that'll help or hurt you in this race?             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 I would hope that it helps me because when you look at my record, I have stood up on so many progressive issues, whether it is choice, whether it is the environment, whether it is standing up for immigrants and against racial injustice. But there are moments where we can find common ground. Areas where I've done a lot of work in the middle are agriculture policy, things like public safety, working on issues like the drug shortage that we had in this country when, sadly, kids with cancer weren't getting their drugs. So I worked out and worked with Susan Collins on that or I worked with Senator Hatch to get a billion dollars for school safety after the tragedy in Parkland. But that doesn't mean that I don't stand my ground.             </p><p>                So while I was the lead Democrat on the school safety money, which passed overwhelmingly, I also was standing my ground against the president when it comes to universal background checks and an assault weapon ban. I sat directly across from him at that meeting, listened to him say nine times he wanted to get universal background checks done and then saw him bow to the NRA the next day. That's just wrong.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 So you see there she's somebody who is trying to find this balance - right? - between what she says is finding common ground on things like school safety, agriculture, human trafficking she says later in the interview, versus standing her ground when it comes to some more progressive things, when it comes to gun control, climate change, things like that, when she feels like these big things might not be things that you can work with Republicans or the president on.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 As you say, there is a very senatorial approach to all of this. How many senators were just name-checked? And if we go longer, I bet she could name-check a few more.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And that makes me wonder how this argument fares as soon as Joe Biden enters the race, who this is, like, the mission - this is the message behind his likely candidacy as well. I have been there for decades. I know everyone who gets things done. I can meet with Mitch McConnell and cut a deal. I mean, I think, historically, there's a big appeal of that, but I think both Republicans and Democrats, their base voters in recent years have not really loved the idea of somebody who's up there to cut a deal and get 65 percent of what you want. You know, it's not the - it's not in vogue at the moment it seems, even though there's a lot of people out there like Amy Klobuchar who say that's walking away from any sort of responsible governing strategy.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 You know, one other place where she's trying to strike this balance is on climate change. She talked about the Green New Deal, which she's called aspirational, but also noted that she is a co-sponsor. Listen to some of that.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 I think most people agree, including some of the primary sponsors, that we won't be able to get all this done in 10 years. But if we don't start and we don't capture the energy of young people that want to move on this issue, we're going to go nowhere because, so far, we've gone nowhere.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 And, again, she's, you see there, trying to make the case that, yes, we have to move in this direction that's a very progressive direction on climate and what to do about it but not exactly 100 percent sold on all of its tenets.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah. And I guess there is a question of whether that is good enough for Democratic voters, base Democratic voters, especially younger Democratic voters who care passionately about climate change and support the Green New Deal or something like it.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah. And the top issue in the 2018 election and, you know, frankly, over the last decade when we're talking about big things has been health care. And, you know, let's listen to some of what she says will be her approach on health care because it's a very pragmatic approach that, well, some people might call incremental.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR:                 What's the fastest way we can expand health care more? Immediately, I would do cost sharing and reinsurance. That's a bill that's out there right now to help with premiums. That's just immediate, like, put a Band-Aid on answer. And that's a bill that's out there right now - it's Patty Murray, Lamar Alexander - that we could get done. Then the public option in the first year. We should pass legislation for a public option that could be done with Medicaid or with Medicare. You could expand Medicare, you could expand Medicaid but have a public option, which is the original idea that President Obama conceived. Why? Because then you would have a less expensive option for people to go to. That could result in a lot of people leaving other private plans to go to that public option. And Medicaid's an interesting way to do it. This is a bill that's Senator Schatz. I was original co-sponsor, and I think Senator Sanders was actually originally on this bill as well in the last Congress.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So many senators.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 (Laughter) If we drank every time she said senator's name...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I mean, I think especially hearing her after we heard Sanders and Warren just highlights how different her approach is, right? And what this reminds me of is, you know, again, sounding like a broken record, the split between governing and campaigning. This reminds me a lot of the arguments that Hillary Clinton and <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>had in 2016. Like, <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders </nameText></person>says I want to do a $15 minimum wage, and then Hillary Clinton says what about a $12 minimum wage with a step up to that $15? We're all trying to get to the same goal, but my plan can pass faster.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And she even cited a Patty Murray bill.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yes. And a lot of voters didn't want to hear it. They just wanted somebody to say I want a $15 minimum wage. And especially in a field with so many candidates, taking whatever the $15 minimum wage version of any policy is, like, I wonder what the space is for this and how you get that message through.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Right.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 You know, one thing that I think tells us how far the Democratic Party has moved is that she is talking about a public option as a very sort of matter-of-fact idea as almost like an incremental step.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Right.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And in 2009, a public option was a bridge too far.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 It was a government takeover of health care as far as Republicans were concerned.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And was not politically plausible even though Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 But I think the party might have just changed since then. I think there's a lot of younger voters especially who don't care and think that the party needs to aim higher.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 All right. That is a wrap for today. All the interviews with 2020 candidates you heard here came from NPR's Morning Edition, which is a radio show that also puts out a daily news podcast called Up First, which we are frequently on as guests. Now, we should say that these two episodes of the NPR POLITICS PODCAST, the one from yesterday and today, included interviews with <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren, </nameText></person>Amy Klobuchar, <person><nameText>Kamala Harris, </nameText></person>Cory Booker and <person><nameText>Pete Buttigieg. </nameText></person>Of course, there are many other candidates. And if and when NPR interviews those candidates, we will walk through what they have to say as well. And to listen to more of those interviews, you can head to npr.org. I'm Tamara Keith.

Of that total, more than $67 million has been spent on Facebook while $32 million went to Google.Twitter, which recently announced[1] it will stop allowing political ads as of Nov. 15, was always the least popular platform of the big three. Presidential candidates spent less than $5.2 million on Twitter and the biggest online advertiser, President Donald Trump[2], never ran an ad on the platform.Digital ads are a crucial tool for campaigns to build their lists[3] of potential donors and try to attract small-dollar contributions. </p><p>Campaigns often look to capitalize on current events, such as the impeachment inquiry[4], to rake in campaign cash.OpenSecrets' presidential profile pages[5] now display how much money candidates and their allied outside groups are spending on Google ads. The new feature, which integrates data from Google's political ad database[6], will enable users to filter through thousands of ads and ad track spending by week going into the 2020 election.Trump is the top spender on Google ads, shelling out $12 million with more than $1 million of that spent in a single week of September after House Democrats announced the impeachment inquiry.Trump is by far the top 2020 spender on digital ads overall, too. Billionaire investor Tom Steyer[7] is a distant second with $13.4 million and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg[8] comes in third at $9.3 million. After spending big on digital ads[9] to kick-start his campaign, former Vice President Joe Biden[10] has fallen behind his Democratic primary opponents in the digital ad race. 2020[11] Infogram[12] Ad campaigns that were once reserved for television are making their way onto social media platforms. Sens. Elizabeth Warren[13] (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders[14] (I-Vt.) are both running television-style video ads[15] on Google to appeal to voters in early primary states. Sen. Kamala Harris[16] (D-Calif.) is reportedly planning a digital ad blitz[17] to reach Iowa voters in an attempt to revitalize her struggling campaign.Outside groups are big digital ad spenders, too. Democratic super PAC Priorities USA[18] has spent millions of dollars on Facebook[19] to hit Trump on trade and the economy, and the group recently announced a new digital effort[20] to woo Latinx voters in battleground states. Meanwhile, pro-Trump 'dark money' group American Action Network[21] launched a $2 million digital issue ad campaign[22] to target swing district Democrats over impeachment. Facebook and Google are still the platforms of choice for candidates and outside groups, and those platforms may see a slight uptick in spending when Twitter's political ad ban goes into effect. Twitter's political ad ban prompted questions[23] about what ads it will consider to be 'political.' The platform is expected to still allow groups to run ads related to issues of national significance, but not ads that advocate for a candidate or bill, Buzzfeed News reported[24]. Twitter will reveal its new policy Nov. 15.Facebook, which has come under fire for not doing more to regulate political ads, is reportedly considering[25] restricting politicians' ability to narrowly target specific users with ads. Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub argued in a recent opinion piece[26] that platforms should abolish microtargeting rather than ban political ads.Digital advertising has become more transparent in recent years, with four major social media platforms, including Snapchat, disclosing information about political advertising.Platforms such as Hulu, Pandora, Reddit and Spotify currently allow political advertising but have not publicly released data on those ads or implemented any public disclosure policies.Amazon, Bing, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitch and TikTok's policies include significant restrictions or complete bans on political advertising. But even those platforms haven't completely stopped candidates and groups from exploiting loopholes[27] to promote political messages.Less than eight weeks after Snap Inc. launched its ad database[28], spending on political ads targeting the U.S. more than quadrupled \u2014 ballooning from roughly $600,000 to nearly $2.8 million, according to an OpenSecrets analysis.Candidates in the 2020 presidential election have spent just $232,825 on Snapchat ads. Although that number is dwarfed by other platforms, political ad spending on Snapchat has continued to grow rapidly.Buttiegeig is the first candidate to spend more than six figures on Snapchat, ramping up his Snap spending from $6,750 when the ad database launched to more than $119,000. Trump nearly doubled his Snapchat ad spending to roughly $80,000 in that time. Harris and Warren continued spending moderately on Snapchat while Biden's campaign made its inaugural Snapchat ad buys totaling $1,175.

Of that total, more than $67 million has been spent on Facebook while $32 million went to Google.Twitter, which recently announced[1] it will stop allowing political ads as of Nov. 15, was always the least popular platform of the big three. Presidential candidates spent less than $5.2 million on Twitter and the biggest online advertiser, President Donald Trump[2], never ran an ad on the platform.Digital ads are a crucial tool for campaigns to build their lists[3] of potential donors and try to attract small-dollar contributions. </p><p>Campaigns often look to capitalize on current events, such as the impeachment inquiry[4], to rake in campaign cash.OpenSecrets' presidential profile pages[5] now display how much money candidates and their allied outside groups are spending on Google ads. The new feature, which integrates data from Google's political ad database[6], will enable users to filter through thousands of ads and ad track spending by week going into the 2020 election.Trump is the top spender on Google ads, shelling out $12 million with more than $1 million of that spent in a single week of September after House Democrats announced the impeachment inquiry.Trump is by far the top 2020 spender on digital ads overall, too. Billionaire investor Tom Steyer[7] is a distant second with $13.4 million and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg[8] comes in third at $9.3 million. After spending big on digital ads[9] to kick-start his campaign, former Vice President Joe Biden[10] has fallen behind his Democratic primary opponents in the digital ad race. 2020[11] Infogram[12] Ad campaigns that were once reserved for television are making their way onto social media platforms. Sens. Elizabeth Warren[13] (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders[14] (I-Vt.) are both running television-style video ads[15] on Google to appeal to voters in early primary states. Sen. Kamala Harris[16] (D-Calif.) is reportedly planning a digital ad blitz[17] to reach Iowa voters in an attempt to revitalize her struggling campaign.Outside groups are big digital ad spenders, too. Democratic super PAC Priorities USA[18] has spent millions of dollars on Facebook[19] to hit Trump on trade and the economy, and the group recently announced a new digital effort[20] to woo Latinx voters in battleground states. Meanwhile, pro-Trump 'dark money' group American Action Network[21] launched a $2 million digital issue ad campaign[22] to target swing district Democrats over impeachment. Facebook and Google are still the platforms of choice for candidates and outside groups, and those platforms may see a slight uptick in spending when Twitter's political ad ban goes into effect. Twitter's political ad ban prompted questions[23] about what ads it will consider to be 'political.' The platform is expected to still allow groups to run ads related to issues of national significance, but not ads that advocate for a candidate or bill, Buzzfeed News reported[24]. Twitter will reveal its new policy Nov. 15.Facebook, which has come under fire for not doing more to regulate political ads, is reportedly considering[25] restricting politicians' ability to narrowly target specific users with ads. Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub argued in a recent opinion piece[26] that platforms should abolish microtargeting rather than ban political ads.Digital advertising has become more transparent in recent years, with four major social media platforms, including Snapchat, disclosing information about political advertising.Platforms such as Hulu, Pandora, Reddit and Spotify currently allow political advertising but have not publicly released data on those ads or implemented any public disclosure policies.Amazon, Bing, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitch and TikTok's policies include significant restrictions or complete bans on political advertising. But even those platforms haven't completely stopped candidates and groups from exploiting loopholes[27] to promote political messages.Less than eight weeks after Snap Inc. launched its ad database[28], spending on political ads targeting the U.S. more than quadrupled   ballooning from roughly $600,000 to nearly $2.8 million, according to an OpenSecrets analysis.Candidates in the 2020 presidential election have spent just $232,825 on Snapchat ads. Although that number is dwarfed by other platforms, political ad spending on Snapchat has continued to grow rapidly.Buttiegeig is the first candidate to spend more than six figures on Snapchat, ramping up his Snap spending from $6,750 when the ad database launched to more than $119,000. Trump nearly doubled his Snapchat ad spending to roughly $80,000 in that time. Harris and Warren continued spending moderately on Snapchat while Biden's campaign made its inaugural Snapchat ad buys totaling $1,175.

Of that total, more than $67 million has been spent on Facebook while $32 million went to Google.</p><p>Twitter, which recently announced it will stop allowing political ads as of Nov. 15, was always the least popular platform of the big three. Presidential candidates spent less than $5.2 million on Twitter and the biggest online advertiser, President Donald Trump, never ran an ad on the platform.</p><p>Digital ads are a crucial tool for campaigns to build their lists of potential donors and try to attract small-dollar contributions. Campaigns often look to capitalize on current events, such as the impeachment inquiry, to rake in campaign cash.</p><p>OpenSecrets' presidential profile pages now display how much money candidates and their allied outside groups are spending on Google ads. The new feature, which integrates data from Google's political ad database, will enable users to filter through thousands of ads and ad track spending by week going into the 2020 election.</p><p>Trump is the top spender on Google ads, shelling out $12 million with more than $1 million of that spent in a single week of September after House Democrats announced the impeachment inquiry.</p><p>Trump is by far the top 2020 spender on digital ads overall, too. Billionaire investor Tom Steyer is a distant second with $13.4 million and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg comes in third at $9.3 million. After spending big on digital ads to kick-start his campaign, former Vice President Joe Biden has fallen behind his Democratic primary opponents in the digital ad race.</p><p>2020</p><p>Infogram</p><p>Ad campaigns that were once reserved for television are making their way onto social media platforms. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are both running television-style video ads on Google to appeal to voters in early primary states. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is reportedly planning a digital ad blitz to reach Iowa voters in an attempt to revitalize her struggling campaign.</p><p>Outside groups are big digital ad spenders, too. Democratic super PAC Priorities USA has spent millions of dollars on Facebook to hit Trump on trade and the economy, and the group recently announced a new digital effort to woo Latinx voters in battleground states. Meanwhile, pro-Trump \"dark money\" group American Action Network launched a $2 million digital issue ad campaign to target swing district Democrats over impeachment.</p><p>Help us count cash and make change by making a donation today.</p><p>Help us keep government accountable by making a donation today.</p><p>Facebook and Google are still the platforms of choice for candidates and outside groups, and those platforms may see a slight uptick in spending when Twitter's political ad ban goes into effect.</p><p>Twitter's political ad ban prompted questions about what ads it will consider to be \"political.\" The platform is expected to still allow groups to run ads related to issues of national significance, but not ads that advocate for a candidate or bill, Buzzfeed News reported. Twitter will reveal its new policy Nov. 15.</p><p>Facebook, which has come under fire for not doing more to regulate political ads, is reportedly considering restricting politicians' ability to narrowly target specific users with ads. Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub argued in a recent opinion piece that platforms should abolish microtargeting rather than ban political ads.</p><p>Digital advertising has become more transparent in recent years, with four major social media platforms, including Snapchat, disclosing information about political advertising.</p><p>Platforms such as Hulu, Pandora, Reddit and Spotify currently allow political advertising but have not publicly released data on those ads or implemented any public disclosure policies.</p><p>Amazon, Bing, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitch and TikTok's policies include significant restrictions or complete bans on political advertising. But even those platforms haven't completely stopped candidates and groups from exploiting loopholes to promote political messages.</p><p>Less than eight weeks after Snap Inc. launched its ad database, spending on political ads targeting the U.S. more than quadrupled ballooning from roughly $600,000 to nearly $2.8 million, according to an OpenSecrets analysis.</p><p>Candidates in the 2020 presidential election have spent just $232,825 on Snapchat ads. Although that number is dwarfed by other platforms, political ad spending on Snapchat has continued to grow rapidly.</p><p>Buttiegeig is the first candidate to spend more than six figures on Snapchat, ramping up his Snap spending from $6,750 when the ad database launched to more than $119,000. Trump nearly doubled his Snapchat ad spending to roughly $80,000 in that time. Harris and Warren continued spending moderately on Snapchat while Biden's campaign made its inaugural Snapchat ad buys totaling $1,175.</p><p>Feel free to distribute or cite this material, but please credit the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>For permission to reprint for commercial uses, such as textbooks, contact the Center: [email protected]</p><p>Support Accountability Journalism</p><p>At OpenSecrets.org we offer in-depth, money-in-politics stories in the public interest.

We've gone away from paper savings accounts to robo-advisors. Here are the top investment banking trends to watch out for. Borrowing from Bob Dylan, the times are a-changin' The current crop of technologies \u2014 cloud computing, social media, AI, machine learning, e-commerce, big data \u2014 all these are redefining this century and beyond. </p><p>Tech innovation in every industry[2] has become an inseparable cocktail, and it's especially true for financial institutions. Nowhere has this combination been as powerful as in the investment banking industry. Holding companies, today, are looking for an intersection with technology. Navi Technologies, formerly known as BAC Acquisitions, an investment holding company, is scouting for investment opportunities in technologies to augment financial services. What do these developments bode for investment banking professionals and the markets of the future? Here we look at the critical juicy investment industry trends you need to keep up with.Significant 2020 Trends to watch out for, that are changing the Investment Industry landscape. Mid-Sized Companies become the spicy target.Goldman Sachs recently announced its plans to boost investment in mid-sized corporate clients. Though the investment banking industry behemoth has been serving mid-sized companies, it was done on an ad-hoc basis in the past. It plans to go full-scale with a cross-market group (CMG) that is set to deliver investment banking products to mid-sized companies. David Solomon, the chairman, and CEO of the US bank says, There are many enterprises valued at $500 million to $3 billion. That's the real expansion opportunity for the firm.  As a result of this focus on emerging private companies, the number of investment bankers[3] and M...eal-makers hired for the operations will witness a rise, along with a spike in the number of regional units. Other than Goldman, there are many other banks eyeing this segment, including JP Morgan, Wells Farago, Citigroup, among others.Rise of Initial Coin Offering (ICO). It's a new way to raise funds. Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency equivalent to Initial Public Offering (IPO) in investment banking. It offers the means for cryptocurrency-based corporations to raise funds for their new application, service, or a new digital coin. Investors buy in these offerings and receive a cryptocurrency token by the offering company in the hopes that successful projects will lead token's values to spike. The Economist, a popular finance publication says this about ICO, They are digital coupons that can be readily traded, although unlike shares, they don't confer ownership rights.  Among the successful coin offerings, Bancor's story is worth noting. Bancor is a blockchain-based prediction market that was a substantial hit due to its unique offerings. Bancor generates liquid tokes that allow for their conversion into other tokens. For instance, a user can purchase a Bancor token that may be a 50% combination of Ether and 50% Litecoin. It drew attention, and eventually, a buy-in from a venture capital firm 'Blockchain Capital' and one of the earliest internet investor Tim Draper. Storj is another blockchain-based cloud storage company[4] that successfully exploited ICO.To engage in ICO, you will need to develop a basic understanding of cryptocurrency[5] wallets and engage in digital currencies. Assets of 'Robo-Advisors' will hit the US $2 trillion in 2020.Many investment banking advisors, stockbrokers, and other financial professionals[6] have lost a portion of their business to robo-advisors. An example of this trend is Betterment. Robo-advisors are algorithm-driven advisors that work with little to no human intervention. A company's hallmark is the ease of online access provided to the clients. It is especially becoming popular among young investors[7] and the digitally savvy new generation consumers. A typical robo-advisor collects client information about their financial health and future goals. The robo-advisor then uses that data to advise clients and automatically invest their assets.  Some of the best robo-advisors can set up accounts with ease, robustly plan goals, provide account services, manage portfolios, and offer security features at a very low fee.  First, robo-advisor at Betterment was launched way back in 2008. After a decade, the robo-advisor's at Betterment have today become capable of handling complex tasks like investment selection, retirement planning, tax-loss harvesting, and much more. The growth of robo-advisors hit (in terms of client assets managed by them) US $60 billion in 2015, and the industry is projected to rise to the US $2 trillion in 2020, and an estimated US $7 trillion by 2025.5G and BFSI (banking, financial services, and insurance). The age of hyper-connectivity with 5G will also change the dynamics of finance, insurance, and investment banking industry. As the devices become smarter and faster, the services offered will too. The years upon us now may be the time of the 'Intelligence of things' where updated smart finance applications will use 5G. A vast network of devices and over 20 billion items, from dryers and cars, to bank accounts and investment portfolios, will become interconnected in this 5G revolution. The enormous data generated in the process[8] is poised to make investment decisions better and smarter.Making 'Perfectly efficient markets' with AI.Talking about the future of stock exchanges, Adena Friedman, the CEO of NASDAQ, says we will get closer to perfectly efficient markets. The continued march toward AI can enable the investment banking industry[9] to make better decisions through the barrage of data generated. Friedman says, as the data gets piled over the 10 to 20 years, quantum computing will lend the investment industry the ability to look at thousands of outcomes within seconds and draw right conclusions - about price, buying and selling, and much more. AI tools can root out bad behavior - insider trading, market manipulation, and all that makes markets unfair.  In the AI space, NASDAQ plans to provide technology tools underpinning capital market data and insights to other exchanges, regulators, and broker-dealers. The hope is to power the investors across capital markets with AI.Equity Crowdfunding is a reliable mode of alternative investment. Equity Crowdfunding is about the online offering of private company securities like debt, shares, convertible notes, etc. to a group of people. The reliable mode of Crowdfunding has become a popular method of raising funds for private companies and startups. Small business owners provide information about their funding needs and business on these websites and solicit financial pledges from people. Many investment banking professionals have proceeded to launch their equity crowdfunding platforms. Indiegogo and Kickstarter are among the most popular crowdfunding arenas. Kickstarter is the best fit platform for creative professionals looking to raise funding for their projects. Indiegogo, on the other hand, help technology firms to get their products off the ground. Equity crowdfunding, unlike traditional product crowdfunding, offers real equity in companies to the investors.  GoSun, GOffee, and Miso Robotics recently launched their equity crowdfunding campaigns. This mode of funding gives better flexibility to the company owners than the traditional venture capital route.Need for Coding skills.Investment banking professionals will be required to understand and know the technology behind algorithms, as more operations shift toward that. Banking[10], Finance, and Insurance industry has already begun to ramp up their hiring of IT professionals in the bid to have an in-house IT and data team. Whether you be in banking, portfolio management, risk management, or other field of finance, you will be expected to be able to program at least in one programing language.  Stock picking used to be a coveted skill[11], but now investors are no more focusing on it. Passive funds run on autopilot are automating the process of stock picking.Cybersecurity and Investment Banking. The past year and coming years will be significant for the confluence of cyberspace, and investment banking from a cybersecurity[12] standpoint. Other than corporate ventures of the likes of Google and Cisco, financial services companies like JPMorgan Chase are ramping up their investment in security startups. In 2019, investments in cybersecurity[13] were worth over US$23 billion, and the spending in this industry is expected to reach US$151.2 billion by 2023. These are the key trends for the banking and finance[14] industry for 2020, and an overview of what the investment industry is taking ahead from previous years and decades.

I'm in for Maria Bartiromo today. And it is Friday December 27.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Santa Claus rally, it is on once again. Futures are poised to unwrap another day of record highs. The Dow is up 86 in the premarket. The S&amp;P up seven and three-quarters. Nasdaq up 31.5.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow, the Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500 all closing at fresh, new highs yesterday. The Nasdaq -- this was something -- it broke through the 9,000 mark for the first time ever in its history. It is now top performing index since President Trump took office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taking a look at global action this morning, it is really green across the screen for Europe. They were closed as markets were yesterday for Boxing Day. But right now, the FTSE, the CAC 40 and the DAX are all solidly higher.</p><p>And then markets in Asia were mixed overnight despite a violent day of protests on Christmas. Hong Kong is really the story. The Hong Kong market, the Hang Seng actually surged 1.3 percent on the first day of trading since that two-day holiday break that that market took.</p><p>And in China , November industrial profits up 5.4 percent year-over-year but the move enough for the Shanghai composite to actually close in the green. So mixed bag for Asia.</p><p>Back in this country Amazon delivering. The retailer scored best holiday sales ever and that news propelled the stock to its best day in nearly 11 months yesterday the stock is again higher in premarket today at more than half a percent, and then he drives big tech the crosshairs. Regulation is in focus for 2020. We are going to find out how it would impact some of biggest companies in the world.</p><p>Plus Secret Santa -- what is it like to have Bill Gates send you an 81- pound package full of gifts?</p><p>And here with me to break it all it down this morning: Fox News contributor and columnist for \"The Hill\" Liz Peek is on set this morning; the Brewer Group CEO, former investment banker and former NFL player Jack Brewer is with us; and the \"Wall Street Journal\" senior writer Jon Hilsenrath. Good morning -- guys.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER. \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Great to be here.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>CASONE: I feel like Bill Gates could -- can leave me as many presents as he wants bit this market is a present. The market is a big present.</p><p>PEEK: No questions. For an awful lot of people, by the way --</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: -- it's not just, you know, the 1 percent who's benefiting from all this. The entire country is benefiting.</p><p>CASONE: Do you think that the average American really understands what's happened in the last three years under the president. I mean these markets are definitely a culmination of less regulation which he has championed, more pro-business policy. I'm not sure that that is really connecting though.</p><p>PEEK: Look, 74 percent I think in the latest poll on this topic, said that the economy was working well for them. And I think the majority of those people credit President Trump with some of those gainers. Obviously people, like President Obama, said he got the ball rolling. And in fact he did.</p><p>But the truth is, to keep this recovery going as energetically as it has required exactly the move that President Trump made. So yes, I think that it is up.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And in terms of the credit that he is getting, the base of the president's support is in blue collar America so it is ironic because you know we have a market rally that is really benefiting a lot of wealthy people but because the unemployment rate is so low you have blue collar flyover country for a lot of you know urban elitists who -- where you know, the president is getting a lot of credit. And frankly, I think this market is primed for another big year in 2020.</p><p>You've got the Fed cutting interest rates not only the Fed but central banks in Europe, and Japan, and elsewhere cutting interest rates. You have the federal government, when no one was watching lastly week, pumping more spending into this economy.</p><p>CASONE: Yes -- that could be good and bad -- I just want to make that --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well I mean it's priming the market and economy for a good 2020 well, you know we could talk about '21 and what comes down the road but there is a lot that is being pumped into this economy to make 2020 a strong year.</p><p>PELOSI: Jack.</p><p>JACK BREWER, THE BREWER GROUP: Yes. I got to say, the president has done an incredible job of marketing I mean he's educating America even if you weren't paying attention to the market, he talks about it so much that I think a lot of folks when you go to middle America that normally don't watch the stock market, when you see record after record after record and you have the president of the United States, taking that podium telling you, about your 401-k's going up -- that matters.</p><p>And I think that is starting to resonate with Americans.</p><p>CASONE: The year to date number is -- we are going to move on but the year-to-date numbers just astound me: 22 percent higher for the Dow year- to-date; 29 percent for the S&amp;P; 35 percent for the Nasdaq. If that -- if you just invested in those indexes based on those averages that would be your return, folks. I mean that is pretty incredible.</p><p>PEEK: And by the way, a lot of people did invest in the indices because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: The really big thing that happened was at the end of the year the White House started backing off on its confrontations with the Chinese, the Chinese started backing off -- they moved toward a truce. You know, the USMCA deal finally got traction in Congress. So all this trade uncertainty which was really holding the market back all year --</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- went away and we see the -- you know, this market is like a thoroughbred that was being reined-in and now when you have -- you take the trade stuff off the table the horse is running.</p><p>CASONE: Look, the markets are doing incredible despite the impeachment standoff that we're dealing with in Washington. And Congress right now, obviously is in recess but Democrats are wasting time their time. They're defending their push for witnesses in an impeachment trial in the Senate.</p><p>Let's bring in Pennsylvania Congressman, House Judiciary Committee member, and House Armed Services Committee member, Guy Reschenthaler. Congressman, good morning.</p><p>REP. GUY RESCHENTHALER (R-PA): Cheryl, merry Christmas and thanks for having me on.</p><p>CASONE: I have to ask you this -- you sit back and you look at the markets -- and we're discussing the markets this morning -- in the middle of what has consumed Washington, which is the battle over impeachment -- impeaching President Trump.</p><p>Your reaction to that?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well just (ph) a few things. We have to remember that the impeachment fiasco has, in part, been a distraction from two things. One, the longer that we're talking about impeachment, it means we're not talking about the red hot Trump economy. So it is a distraction.</p><p>And also, the more we're talking about impeachment, we're not talking about the Democrats' agenda, which has gone far left. We're not talking about the Green New Deal, which is absolutely ludicrous. We're not talking about giving taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal immigrants. We're not talking about their far left radical agenda. We're not talking about the red hot Trump economy. We are talking about impeachment.</p><p>CASONE: Well -- but I do want to ask you about the criticism against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, because it's pretty widespread right now. You know, obviously, he has pledged to work closely with White House on the impeachment trial, maybe not though (ph) call witnesses at all, which is interesting.</p><p>You had Senator Murkowski saying that she was disturbed by that idea. I want to get your reaction to Senator Murkowski's comments which she made to an Alaska TV station.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Sure. Just one thing. With the senator from Alaska, she also blasted speaker Pelosi. She said that Nancy Pelosi rushed this process through, that she had a political timeline trying to get this to the Senate before Christmas, but the mainstream media is only picking up her criticism of McConnell. So that's number one.</p><p>Number two, this has been a political hit job from the beginning. And if you want to talk about unfairness, just go back a few months. Why was President Trump not afforded an attorney? Why was he not given the ability to present exculpatory evidence? Why were we, as Republicans, shut down by Adam Schiff when we were trying to ask questions in those closed-door hearings that literally a took place in the basement?</p><p>So this has been political from the start. And if you want to talk about fairness, think about this -- over 70 Democrats voted to impeach the president before the July phone call, which was the impetus for the articles of impeachment. Seventeen of the Judiciary Committee members -- the Democrat Judiciary Committee members had already voted to impeach before that phone call.</p><p>So this has been slanted, it's been unfair. It's been biased. And the only bipartisan votes had been to stop the impeachment inquiry and has been against impeaching the president.</p><p>So again, this is a political process. Mitch McConnell can work with the president. And if you think that that's unfair, just look at what Adam Schiff did, Chairman Nadler, and Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>PEEK: So Congressman -- oh sorry.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Congressman, do you think the public at this point deserves to hear from Mick Mulvaney and from Ambassador Bolton about what really happened? I mean that is at the heart of the disagreement with the Senate right now. Do you want to hear what those two people know about this whole incident or does it not interest you?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, there is a whole process for doing that. And the process is just what was used in the fast and furious scandal. And that's this -- subpoenas are issued, the Executive Branch falls back on executive privilege, and that's hashed out in the courts.</p><p>That was started, but because it didn't fit in with the Democrats' political timeline, they jumped to impeachment. So as a lawyer, I would say this issue is not right -- meaning it's not ready to be litigated. It's not ready for a court to decide.</p><p>And so this process has been skewered from the start, because the Democrats have not allowed the three branches of government to work this out amongst themselves.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But do you want to hear from them? Are those two people you want to hear from on this case?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: I have the transcript of the phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky, so I don't need somebody's thoughts and feelings and assumptions on that phone call. I have read the actual transcript --</p><p>PEEK: Yes. As we all have.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: -- and remember (ph) the transcript shows no quid pro quo. Right. So if we have the primary source document, the transcript, why do we need all these other individuals to talk about their perception of the call? We have the transcript of the call.</p><p>PEEK: Congressman, I congratulate Republicans and yourself for actually sticking together on a message about the unfairness of what went on in the House. I think that the Senate -- I mean that Nancy Pelosi, basically with Schumer, want to kind of convey that same -- or take that same mantle in dealing with the Senate.</p><p>Are you sensing amongst your Democrat colleagues in the House any resistance to this idea that Pelosi is holding back the articles of impeachment? Is there any sort of grumbling about that? Because it seems to me that people are really at their wits' end. They think this is an extremely radical thing that she has done.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well Cheryl (sic), how would you like to be one of those Democrats that's in a battleground district?</p><p>PEEK: Sure.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: -- meaning that they're Democrats, but President Trump won that district, and they walked the plank for Nancy Pelosi and voted for impeachment -- and then Nancy Pelosi doesn't send the articles to the Senate. So walking the plank for them all for naught.</p><p>And then they're going to turn around and answer for that in the 2020 election, when they're just going to get pummeled over their votes to impeach a president -- the president when the president won their district.</p><p>So yes, they should be resentful. But you have to remember, Nancy Pelosi is really not the one in charge of the Democrat Party. The people in charge are the far left radical freshman AOC, Tlaib, Omar. They're the ones that are in charge.</p><p>So those moderate freshmen should be more upset -- or those Democrats in battleground districts should be more upset with their far left radical wing.</p><p>And I always say, if you want to know what Nancy Pelosi is going to do tomorrow, just read AOC's tweets today.</p><p>CASONE: Well -- we'll have to see about that, I don't know.</p><p>Congressman Guy Reschenthaler -- got a lot (ph) to go through with you this morning. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Thanks for having me on.</p><p>CASONE: Before we go to break though -- Jack, I mean you teach, by the way, here in New York -- we should add that. Are they talking about impeachment? Do your students fully connect to the story at all?</p><p>BREWER: You know what, we have a group. So I communicate with my class a lot. And we have a group talk, like a think tank. And we talk about some of these issues. And you know, I'm more conservative probably than everyone in my group.</p><p>But I think, you know, the media is playing such a role in this. And if you watch some of the other stations, you don't see the other side. And what I wanted to ask the Congressman was, you know, will America get the answers on why the FBI was so corrupt and really what has been happening? Will America get the answers on did -- what happened with the Bidens? I mean --</p><p>CASONE: My question to you is, are they actually following? Are they getting so into weeds with this? And I think that --</p><p>BREWER: They're not.</p><p>CASONE: I think that the impeachment battle has become noise. I think for so many Americans. I mean think of it.</p><p>BREWER: I think -- I agree with you but I think a lot of Americans are really listening to the rhetoric from the CNN and the MSNBC that are telling them the president is impeached. He's a crook. He's done something wrong. And putting that evil narrative out there without even addressing the other side.</p><p>I mean -- because we always say in my class, our model was there's two sides to every trade. And all that, you know, a lot of people want to see is both sides.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Cheryl -- I think there is three groups. There's people who have made up their mind on the left that the president is bad and they want to get him out.</p><p>And there's people who've made up their minds on the right that the president is great and saving the country.</p><p>And then there are a bunch of other people who think it is all noise.</p><p>CASONE: It's just wild what is happening in this country right now.</p><p>All right. We're going to have a lot more coming up, folks.</p><p>The gift that keeps on giving. The husband from Peloton (INAUDIBLE) -- it's in the holiday ads. He is now giving that exact bike as a gift but this time it's in his real life.</p><p>Plus hitting the jackpot -- one lucky Reddit user getting the ultimate Secret Santa gift from billionaire Bill Gates.</p><p>CASONE: An investigation is underway after a deadly plane crash that happened in Kazakhstan.</p><p>Tracee Carrasco's got that story -- Tracee.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right -- Cheryl.</p><p>Twelve people are dead, up to 50 others injured. Kazakh officials say the plane was traveling to Nur-Sultan when it crashed into a building, 20 seconds after take off. 98 people were believed to be onboard.</p><p>Meantime, the Coast Guard is searching for a missing tour helicopter off the coast of Hawaii. Crews focusing on the island of Kauai. Seven people were onboard the chopper including two children.</p><p>Well, electric scooters and bikes won't be legal in New York, at least not for now. Governor Andrew Cuomo yesterday vetoed legislation that would have made it possible. Cuomo cited safety concerns including the lack of a helmet requirement. Several reports say political differences are really to blame for the bill not passing. Lawmakers could override the veto.</p><p>And finally Bill Gates playing Santa. One Michigan woman lucky enough to get him as her secret gifter through Reddit's gift exchange. The present weighing 81 pounds including a copy of \"The Great Gatsby\" signed by Gates, toys for her cat, Harry Potter memorabilia and most importantly a donation to the American Heart Association in the name of the woman's mother who died earlier this year. Gates has participated in the online random gift- giving exchange since 2013. Pretty cool.</p><p>CASONE: -- that he gave the heart association the donation.</p><p>CARRASCO: Very nice.</p><p>CASONE: Obviously he is very much into charity.</p><p>CARRASCO: And the cat toys.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Yes and the cat toys.</p><p>Thank you -- Tracee for bringing that up.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- some Microsoft stock for those cat toys.</p><p>PEEK: You know that must boost the participation in that Reddit thing like immensely. Because I'm thinking, why don't I put -- you know, what the heck, you could end up with somebody like Bill Gates.</p><p>CASONE: Jon -- to your point, I don't know. I kind of got some really great cat toys for gifts this year and was pretty excited about it.</p><p>I'll get my own Microsoft stock.</p><p>All right. We've got a lot more coming up, folks.</p><p>Survey says yes -- one couple's proposal is going viral, and there is no family feud here. We're going to show you the viral video coming up.</p><p>Plus, the gift that keeps on giving, the husband from Peloton's holiday ad, he is giving the exercise bike as a gift but this time he is giving it in real life.</p><p>CASONE: The countdown to 2020 is on. Of course, this is a live look, folks. It is Times Square, just a block from here. New Year's eve preparations under way. The New Year's ball getting a face lift before the big drop. More than 2600 new Waterford crystals are going to be installed today actually. Waterford has been making crystals for the 12,000 pound sphere since 2000.</p><p>And the new numbers arrived earlier this month, more than a million people expected to ring in the New Year in Times Square. And actually, folks, if you're coming to New York, the weather actually may not abuse you this New Year's Eve. So there's the good news there.</p><p>Amazon folks poised to open higher after pushing the Nasdaq past 9000. We've got Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with all the details. Good morning -- Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning -- Cheryl.</p><p>That is right. Amazon set, as you said, to open higher. Yesterday they said they had the best Christmas ever. They enrolled five million people in their prime membership and they said they literally sent billions -- billions with a b -- of packages for the holidays. Think about that -- a huge number -- doing very well indeed powering the Nasdaq through 9000.</p><p>Another stock power that helped power the Nasdaq through 9000 -- Apple, that stock on track for its best year in a decade. Wedbush (ph) upgrading that top -- raising its price target to $350. Stock has been on fire, having a great year.</p><p>And if you'll remember last year this time, lots of negative statements about Apple. Oh they'll never get their services business together. Oh, nobody will buy the iPhone 11. Wrong. The stock is on fire.</p><p>And I want to talk finally about Peloton, that stock poised to open flat. The shorts are out for this thing. They are down 10 percent on the week, 23 percent on month.</p><p>Here is what the actor who portrayed the husband in the Peloton ad said on Twitter. He bought a Peloton for his girlfriend -- that is right. \"Here is hoping this goes over better the second time around,\" he said, \"Merry Christmas to my actual girlfriend.\" And in parenthesis, \"Please don't leave me.\"</p><p>This poor guy, Sean Hunter, really abused on social media for his role in that ad. But he's looking pretty happy here with his girlfriend -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Gerry -- we're all talking some (ph) about the fact -- did he really pay for the Peloton? That's the big question. Do you think the company --</p><p>WILLIS: I think -- yes. Could have happened, could have happened. Just saying.</p><p>Maybe he pays some monthly membership.</p><p>CASONE: Exactly. Yes, there you go. That is true. All right.</p><p>She obviously looks like she's going to enjoy that bike. Gerri -- thank you.</p><p>Coming up, the New Year for technology. What to watch for in the sector especially the threat of regulation. Everything you need to know -- straight ahead.</p><p>CASONE: And welcome back.</p><p>I'm Cheryl Casone. I'm in for Maria Bartiromo today.</p><p>It is Friday, December 27th.</p><p>Here's a look at how the markets are performing an hour before the opening bell. And look at this.</p><p>The Santa Claus rally, folks, it is on. The gifts just keep on giving for investors. Right now, the Dow is up 84. The S&amp;P is up 8. The Nasdaq is up 35.</p><p>The Dow, the Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500 all looking to open at fresh, new intraday highs following that round of record closes that we got last night in particular with the Nasdaq. Unbelievable day for your markets. And this is the -- this three trading sessions set to go, folks.</p><p>Checking on the global action. It's green across the board in Europe following the Christmas break.</p><p>And markets were mixed in Asia overnight despite violent day of protests on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged actually 1.3 percent on its first day of trading since those holidays. In China, November industrial profits up 5.4 percent year-over-year but that move not enough for the Shanghai to close in the green. So a mixed bag in your Asian markets.</p><p>But again, all eyes on Wall Street. Again, three trading sessions left for 2019 and for the decade.</p><p>Our top story this half hour: 2020 and regulating technology. It's been quite the year for the sector with lawsuits and debates over antitrust and privacy swirling around the biggest names that include Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet. What is in store for 2020 when it comes to regulation?</p><p>Let's bring in the Herbold Group managing director and former Microsoft Corporation Chief Operating Officer, Bob Herbold. Sir, good morning.</p><p>BOB HERBOLD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, THE HERBOLD GROUP, LLC: Hi, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: So, regulation seems to be the big story. And I'm sure you know this from your days at Microsoft. But it's not just U.S. regulators. It's in particular, it's really European regulators. They're going after big technology. Now, the French want this digital tax on these companies? Is that kind of a speed bump, do you think for the group and 2020?</p><p>HERBOLD: Well, I think they're in for very heavy weather, Cheryl. The consumer is fed up with not having protection of their data. So privacy concerns are paramount, not only in this country but throughout the world and European Union is very aggressive, historically, and they will be this time and regard to this issue. But it's more than just privacy. The -- there's concerns about competition in terms of buying up small companies that potentially could be threats.</p><p>There is a concern about fake advertising, a concern about inflammatory information getting out on the web from terrorist groups hate groups, so they have a basket full of problems in that sector. And the amazing thing is they really haven't done anything to try and get ahead of these issues.</p><p>CASONE: Well, I'm glad you brought up and I trust obviously, because that's going to be the big issue, whether or not it's technology companies or even a lot of the social media companies like Facebook and Twitter and specifically, but you know, we also of course, watch these IPOs and in 2019, there was some disappointments here. You had Uber, that was an underwhelming initial public offering.</p><p>You had we work, that was a botched, IPO. Whether or not, Bob, you say that we work as a real estate company or technology company. I'll let you decide. But do you think that the IPO market In technology might recover in 2020?</p><p>HERBOLD: Oh, it'll recover. Good ideas will be rewarded. But one thing that I think the big financial investors have learned is that you have to be aware of suppose a tech gurus who are attempting to disrupt a very established industries with products that are nothing more than a phone app, basically, in many cases. So, folks like Uber, they have a lot of problems in regard to drivers. So what's the contract with the driver?</p><p>What about benefits, it keeps coming back up, it won't go away. In regard to we work, that was just a disaster in terms of the retail, you know, commercial property. Wizard saw exactly what the model was. And the sad part of both of those stories is that neither one of them can explain how in the world are ever going to make any profit.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Bob, I want to come back to the whole issue of antitrust. You know, in the past decade, we've had these big tech companies like Facebook going up and buying successful startups like Instagram. Now, I think one of the big questions for the next year or two ahead is, should any of the big tech companies be broken up? And if so, which ones and how do you force Facebook to spin off Instagram?</p><p>What kind of breakups do you see are possible if something like that is forced -- is forced on the big tech companies?</p><p>HERBOLD: Well, if you look at Google and Facebook, they control about 60, 65 percent of all online advertising. So, the way to get higher rates on advertising is to do a better job of targeting. The way to do a better job of targeting is to have richer and richer data on users. And so the more companies you can gobble up that potentially give you information on consumer usage, the better off you are in terms of selling advertising.</p><p>So, yes. I think there'll be a lot of discussion in regard to breaking up. How they do that is not clear. But the fact is, this looks like it's getting out of hand.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. We're going to be watching that obviously in 2020. But another thing that we're going to be watching is A.I., Artificial Intelligence. Maria has done a lot of reporting on that. You've got Intel that just acquired an Artificial Intelligence startup. A lot of the other tech companies spending money on A.I. investments, even though there's worries about privacy concerns, and I think the average investor now is wondering, how can they invest in A.I. but more importantly, what is A.I. going to mean to us and to our lives? How important do you think Artificial Intelligence is going to be?</p><p>HERBOLD: Well, I think it's going to come on a lot slower than many of the reporters out there who -- some cases they're science fiction reporters. If you look at what's happened with autonomous driving, people thought there would be self-driving cars all over the place. The fact is even the CEO of Ford is now saying they massively overestimated when these things would be arriving in the marketplace.</p><p>So, the head of Google's original effort in self-driving cars has commented recently that this could take as much as 30 years before we see eventually, confidence to the point where insurers are willing to come up to the bar in terms of ensuring self-driving cars. So, there's a lot of A.I. that gets hyped too much. But there's an awful lot of it that does some incredible things. And once you get the big databases and its data that is in fact, put in a format that can be recognized by A.I. tools, then you've really got something and a lot of standard kind of clerical tasks are going by the wayside.</p><p>And even more now, so the systems are getting smarter and smarter that will be that -- you know, that will be continuing. And so this is a very hot area for technology companies.</p><p>CASONE: Well, we'll see what the next decade brings us anyway. Bob Herbold, Bob, thank you very much for being here this morning.</p><p>HERBOLD: Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Uh-hmm. Well, Christmas is coming on but you can still get deals especially for electronics and it is the best day of the year to do just that. Jeff Flock has that story. Jeff, good morning. You are at the probably the largest single store electronics retailer in all the country?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: It is Abt Electronics, family famous in Chicago land and maybe around the country. It is a massive store. And there are all kinds of deals all around the country at stores like this in the U.S. today. Why? Adobe Analytics says says this is the best day to buy electronics. And why? Sometimes they buy too many of something and they get -- well, I won't say stuck with them but they reduce the prices. Look at this. This is an apple What is this Carl?</p><p>CARL PROUTY, DIGITAL CONTENT STRATEGIST, ABT ELECTRONICS: These are the Apple air pods and this is the one with the wireless charging case. We have them for a $166 right now and they're normally 200 and that's the lowest price in the country.</p><p>FLOCK: Lowest price in the country right now. You've got all sorts of things, people love T.V.s, a lot of people wait until after Christmas to buy the T.V. You got pretty much everything.</p><p>PROUTY: We've got any major brand that you can think of. We got Sony and Samsung.</p><p>FLOCK: Best deal -- best deal in the store, give me the best deal on the store.</p><p>PROUTY: Well, we've got this L.G. OLED over here right now. This one normally retail --</p><p>FLOCK: OLED. What's that mean?</p><p>PROUTY: That's organic light emitting diode for any nerds out there.</p><p>FLOCK: Which means nice picture, really nice --</p><p>PROUTY: Great picture. Yes.</p><p>FLOCK: What is this one?</p><p>PROUTY: This particular one is the LG B9. And normally this is a 65-inch, it's normally $2400, it's on sale for $1800.</p><p>FLOCK: 1800. $600 savings. Now, I don't have that much to spend. I want some lower price, but I want the same size. What's this?</p><p>PROUTY: Yes, this is a Samsung. Now this is an LED. So it's a slightly different technology. Still a great picture still 4K. So you're getting a great resolution on this one. This one's on sale for 600. And it's normally 900.</p><p>FLOCK: How big is this? Again? It's at?</p><p>PROUTY: 65 inches.</p><p>FLOCK: For $600, $600.</p><p>PROUTY: $600.</p><p>FLOCK: Incredible. Now even bigger sales today because sometimes people get something for Christmas, then they return it to you. Then what do you do? You put it on an even bigger sale than it was when they got it on sale to start with?</p><p>PROUTY: Exactly. So these are -- this is kind of our floor model section. So if somebody's looking for an open box item to really get the best savings possible. This is the spot to look.</p><p>FLOCK: So this is a Samsung, also that's even bigger than we just saw, right?</p><p>PROUTY: Absolutely. This is 75 inches. Now this one normally retails for 1100 which is already a really great deal for a T.V. that size. But now because it's been opened its marked down to 650.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FLOCK: People buy too many, sometimes their returns. This becomes according to Adobe Analytics, the best day to buy electronics. We'll be here at Apt all day, Carl Prouty, appreciate the time by the way. And you can get pretty much anything if you've saved your money at Christmas. This is a good time to buy.</p><p>CASONE: Jeff, you're going to be buying that 75-inch television?</p><p>FLOCK: I work on televisions, not with television.</p><p>CASONE: Good answer, good answer, Jeff Flock, thank you very much. We were -- we were just talking about this in the commercial break about the earbuds.</p><p>PEEK: Where is he? I want to -- wait. Where was that store? It was kicking themselves or, you know, they want to take everything back that they bought and start over.</p><p>CASONE: If you're in the Chicago area.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And why did I just sped all that money --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: Yes, exactly. And I thought the earbuds were out. I can't -- I just can't believe it.</p><p>CASONE: Not the hottest thing right now.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, totally, sold out.</p><p>CASONE: All right. We've got a lot more coming up, folks. Amplifying -- I know. Amplifying ticket prices while your concert tickets may be more expensive than ever. And survey says yes, one couples' proposal has gone viral.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How would you finish this? Will you marry me?</p><p>CASONE: No feud there. We're going to show you the whole video. Coming up next.</p><p>CASONE: More fallout from Boeing's 737 Max crisis. Tracee Carrasco has got that story. Trace?</p><p>CARRASCO: Yes. That's right, Cheryl. Michael Luttig. The company's senior advisor to former CEO Dennis Muilenburg will retire next week. Luttig help lead Boeing's legal defense following two 737 Max crashes. Muilenburg was fired this week in an effort to restore confidence in the company. The 737 Max remains grounded as Boeing works with the Federal Aviation Administration to return the plane to service. Boeing shares are edging higher ahead of the open.</p><p>And concert ticket prices soaring nine of the highest 10 grossing concert tours had an average ticket price over $100 according to a new report. This as artists are trying to fill the revenue gap from declining record sales in the digital music error. Ticket technology also squeezing out ticket scalpers and age knows no limit. The Rolling Stones had the highest grossing tour this year, taking in $177.8 million with individual tickets averaging $226.</p><p>And finally survey says yes, check out this proposal during a Home Edition of Family Feud.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Name of a day always dreams of.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Her wedding day.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you marry me?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will make it official, right?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARRASCO: She wasn't quite sure what was going on there but the North Carolina couple are high school sweethearts dating for eight years. Congratulations to them. Very sweet.</p><p>CASONE: I love how she's like wait, what? What's happening?</p><p>PEEK: Yes. Love that.</p><p>CASONE: I'm still stuck on the fact the Rolling Stones are still touring.</p><p>PEEK: I can't believe that. Biggest grossing -- I can't believe it, concert of the year?</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: That's staggering</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREWER: -- seven million.</p><p>CARRASCO: But you know what, the only --</p><p>HILSENRATH: I remember in 2019, we had a clip of Mick Jagger after his heart attack out there dancing, then he's out there gross in the 175 million.</p><p>CASONE: I hope I'm just still walking at his age. I mean, dancing, come on.</p><p>PEEK: I -- you know what, the only explanation for it is, everybody of every age wants to go see them. I mean, I mean, I don't think there are a lot of bands where you can say that or a lot of acts where you can say that. But that's just really pretty remarkable.</p><p>CASONE: It is the top story of the Journal though this morning. It's actually appropriate story about the concerts and how they really -- I mean, Madonna $500, really?</p><p>PEEK: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We've written a lot about how millennials as consumers want to have like real life authentic experiences, as, you know, as opposed to buying stuff. They want to have experiences and I think you see this in the concert arena. People --</p><p>CASONE: How much you paid for?</p><p>BREWER: Me? Oh, man, right now, Kanye.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BREWER: I paid for Kanye.</p><p>CASONE: OK.</p><p>BREWER: But he's about -- he's about the only one that I'll pay for. I mean, think about it. I mean, ticket prices are outpacing inflation by like, three, four times and that's crazy.</p><p>CASONE: But people are paying it.</p><p>BREWER: Yes, they're paying.</p><p>CASONE: That's what's fascinating about the story. Anyway, it's a really good piece of the Journal today. All right, we've got a lot more coming up. Cheers to the New Year. We have got the top wines of the year. They're all right here on set. Plus what you should be drinking to ring in 2020. If you can afford it, that's next.</p><p>CASONE: And cheers. Wine Spectator is out with its top wines of 2019, and the contenders were graded on quality, value, availability and the Wine Spectator X factor, which is the story behind the flavor and this year's winner is a classic Bordeaux. It's always French, isn't it? Let's bring in Wine Spectator associate editor, Gillian Sciaretta. And this is of course, the French one again, this ever get old for you?</p><p>GILLIAN SCIARETTA, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, WINE SPECTATOR: Oh, no, not at all. But we have a very exciting lineup here.</p><p>CASONE: Let's talk about number one since I already kind of threw it out there and the top one of the year is a Bordeaux.</p><p>SCIARETTA: It is. It is a Bordeaux. So this is the Chateau Leoville Barton 2016.</p><p>CASONE: OK.</p><p>SCIARETTA: It's scored 97 points on the Wine Spectator 100-point scale and retails for $98.00.</p><p>CASONE: Wow.</p><p>SCIARETTA: So just to put that in perspective, the average price of a 97- point wine that we rated this year was $450. So this is a great value in that regard. But what we love about this wine is that it's been family owned since the 1820s by the Barton family, and in fact, there are three generations working at the Chateau today.</p><p>CASONE: Is that the X factor then?</p><p>SCIARETTA: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: Is the story behind the wine, the family where it's low --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCIARETTA: Exactly. And so it's a Cabernet Sauvignon base wine, 86 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 14 percent more low. It's a wine that's meant for aging. So you can put this away for 10,15, 20 years and it will still be beautiful.</p><p>CASONE: But, you know, we were talking about this in the break, the tariffs that are in place are actually right. So we're paying more with European wines. Which I think would be good for American winemakers.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Yes. There is a domestic wines and wines from the southern hemisphere could benefit from the 25 percent tariffs that are currently on France, Spain, Germany and the U.K. So --</p><p>CASONE: That's big, especially the French -- the French issue.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Yes, yes.</p><p>CASONE: And if we put 100 percent tariffs on fresh wine --</p><p>SCIARETTA: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: You'll see a revolt I think in this country. I do want to -- so, May -- is it Mayacamas.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Mayacamas.</p><p>CASONE: This one's from Napa, so we do have an American name at number two.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Oh, yes. So this is the Mayacamas Cabernet Sauvignon Mount Veeder 2015. This scored 96 points and retails for about $125. You know, it is from the Napa area. So they tend to be in the hundreds of dollars range, but this is one of the most storied wineries in Napa. It's been around since the 1880s. It's located at a higher elevation compared to the valley floor, so you get a beautiful refreshing acidity with this Cabernet.</p><p>Again this is another wine that's meant for aging. You could enjoy it now. But patience you will be rewarded if you put away for five, 10, 15 years.</p><p>CASONE: Five, 10 or 15, that's actually a long time to hold on to a bottle of wine.</p><p>SCIARETTA: It is.</p><p>CASONE: But for most people I would say.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Right. Absolutely.</p><p>CASONE: And then obviously an Italian, the Tuscany Italy, This is a Chianti, that's number three.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: Four is a -- is Groth from Napa again. But I want to move on to the Roederer which is a --</p><p>SCIARETTA: Right.</p><p>CASONE: Because it's actually a sparkling wine or sparkling white which is rare for you to rank this so high on your list.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Exactly. This is the third sparkling wine to ever make our top 10 and it's also the first California sparkling wine. So it scored 95 points retails for $48.00. A perfect wine for New Year's which is just around the corner. In fact on our top 100 list we have five sparkling wines total coming from. We have a Cava from Spain, a Franciacorta from Italy. All fantastic options for, you know, New Year's coming up.</p><p>CASONE: Well, I was going to say for New Year's Eve, you know, maybe a lot of our viewers don't know but you've got Cava which is obviously Spanish, you got Italian Prosecco and then if you are going to get a champagne it has to be from that specific region in France.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Correct. Correct. And yes, so champagne has to come from the Champagne region in France, but actually all of the sparkling wines that are on our top 100 this year which you can find at WineSpectator.com are made using the champagne method, which is, you know, creates a little bit more of a higher end experience.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. One thing I noticed too is that -- it's -- at least for the sparkling, that was kind of $25.00 to $50.00 but this is a wide range especially the top, a pretty expensive wine.</p><p>SCIARETTA: It is.</p><p>CASONE: It -- yes. Well, you know it, with these classic wines, you know, and going on our 100- point scale, all of these wines are 95 points or higher. And as a result, you kind of, you know, with their aged more you see some oak influence. So that kind of pumps up the price a little bit but our Italian one, the Chianti Classico, it scored 95 points, retails for $36.00. And actually the medium -- median pricing for our top 100 this year is $35.00.</p><p>So we try to make sure that we have the full range of, you know, with pricing and good availability as well.</p><p>CASONE: Well again, I love that you got a sparkly wine on the top five. I love it. So like I've been planning and studying this segment for years.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Right.</p><p>CASONE: It's great to have you here.</p><p>SCIARETTA: Oh, thank you for having me.</p><p>CASONE: All right. Gillian Sciaretta, Happy New Year to you. And folks, we're going to have a lot more coming up. We've got stock market madness of our hands something to celebrate. Features on track for another day at records as the year-end rally is rolling on but is this going to run in the 2020? Our outlook is coming up next.</p><p>CASONE: And that Wall Street Santa Claus rally still going strong this morning. Features pointing to another day of gains. Right now the Dow putting up by 63. Jon, it's going to last.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes. I think the markets getting primed for a strong 2020. Interest rate slow, economies going on employment low, everyone in Washington is trying to prime the system for a stronger economy in an election year.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. All right. How you feeling about the markets, Jack? It's pretty good.</p><p>BREWER: I feel good. Happy Holidays, everybody. Remember go out and serve. This country is doing awesome but we have neighborhoods in America that need our help, need our support. Get out your bubble sometimes and go help some people.</p><p>CASONE: I think maybe people could take all their stock market games and donate to charity.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: Oh. Animal charities would be my --</p><p>CASONE: Choice list, Peek?</p><p>PEEK: You know what, at the end of the day and sometimes I wonder if this is an all we need to know, don't fight the Fed.</p><p>CASONE: Don't fight --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: That's been working pretty well.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Jon, you mentioned that earlier what the Fed is going to do next year.

People will spend money, eat food, watch (and play) sports, use phone apps and play video games, and countries around the world will engage in diplomacy - and conflict. The details of all those things, as always, will be what make the year interesting. To get a jump on the future, we asked Washington Post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big stories, themes and questions that we'll look back on this time next December. Here is Outlook's fourth Year in Preview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The last few months of 2019 were filled with streaming news. Buckets of it. From the nonstop marketing of Jennifer Aniston in Apple TV Plus's \"The Morning Show\" to that ubiquitous Baby Yoda from Disney Plus's \"The Mandalorian,\" it seemed like the spigot might never turn off.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it won't, not anytime soon. This will be a year of new digital programming - and new services to deliver it.</p><p>Just two weeks into 2020, Comcast will unveil more details about Peacock, its new service with content from across NBC Universal properties, set to launch several months later. The spring will also bring HBO Max, the prestige-branded service with all manner of TV shows and movies from the WarnerMedia empire. Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, both of which launched in November, will add more content throughout the year, too - as will Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).</p><p>Viewers will have an ever-wider choice of fresh programming. Want new seasons of fan favorites \"Search Party\" and \"The Boondocks\"? They'll be on HBO Max. It's the final episodes of \"BoJack Horseman\" you crave? Where else but Netflix. Looking for \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" to give you a fix between Marvel movies? Disney Plus has you covered.</p><p>Finding out when new episodes premiere, let alone whether they're worth watching, will be a task far more complicated than your Twitter feed can keep up with.</p><p>All these services know they need to offer some reliable hits to complement the new stuff. That means many popular sitcoms are migrating from Netflix. \"The Office\" is headed to Peacock; \"Friends\" to HBO Max.</p><p>And it will all be expensive. Turns out spending sacks of cash on new shows and movies - Netflix alone is expected to shell out in excess of $15 billion in 2020 - isn't easy without ad revenue. Services have to charge, whether that's the $5 a month for Apple TV Plus or the $15 for HBO Max. For consumers, that means piling on to a monthly entertainment bill or making tough choices about what to forgo.</p><p>But don't get too despondent. If some of the recent sitcoms you seek are too unwieldy or costly to find on streaming services, there's a suddenly appealing option: traditional television. Many shows, after all, will continue to air in syndication.</p><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh off an election victory, has vowed to \"get Brexit done.\" Brexit will probably not be \"done\" in 2020, but it will - finally - get started.</p><p>In January, 3 1/2 years after voting narrowly in favor of Brexit, Britain will officially split from the European Union. Expect a big party and fireworks, but don't expect a big rupture in relations between London and Brussels. The status quo will largely continue as the country enters an 11-month transition period, during which Britain will attempt to negotiate a trade deal with the E.U., its largest trading partner, as well as come to agreements on issues including security and law enforcement. Analysts think this is a crazy tight timetable, especially if Johnson wants to diverge substantially from E.U. rules. If a deal isn't completed by the end of the year, it's possible Johnson could break his pledge and seek to extend the transition period. Alternatively, Britain could crash out of the E.U. without a trade pact, reviving anxieties about an abrupt, chaotic and economically damaging \"no-deal\" Brexit.</p><p>One reason it's tricky to predict how Johnson will tack in the upcoming negotiations - Does Britain stay closely aligned with the E.U.? Or does it tilt toward less regulation, in the spirit of Margaret Thatcher? - is that the prime minister is hard to pin down politically.</p><p>But he could be tempted to keep Britain more in lockstep with the E.U., not least because his whopping majority means he won't be beholden to Euroskeptics in his party anymore. Plus, closer alignment could help with his political problems in Scotland and Northern Ireland: As the reality of Brexit sinks in, nationalist movements could gain momentum outside England, and a closer relationship with the E.U. could help head off those threats.</p><p>Plant-based meat was so 2019. Big Beef st(e)aked out territory, demanding legislation that put this interloper on the defensive, mostly in anticipation of what will surely be the food world's biggest game changer in the year to come: Cell-cultured meat, poultry and seafood products derived from muscle tissue grown in a lab with cells harvested from a living animal.</p><p>It is unclear which U.S. company will be first to market - chicken and duck from Memphis Meats in Berkeley, Calif., with investors such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Tyson Foods; Wagyu beef or chicken nuggets from Just (formerly Hampton Creek), whose investors include Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund; or bluefin tuna from Finless Foods - but Barclays analysts say \"alt meat\" could in the next decade capture 10 percent of the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.</p><p>Much of it hinges on rates of adoption. The numbers of vegans and vegetarians aren't growing much. These new products are geared toward omnivores and \"flexitarians,\" but as with genetically modified organisms more than a decade ago, some consumers distrust food that has been tinkered with in a laboratory.</p><p>As it happens, that will also be an issue with another trend this coming year: grocery store foods that are gene-edited with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Romaine and white potatoes that don't brown or bruise, and a gene-edited farmed tilapia that grows quickly, are among the foods improved via tiny DNA snips, essentially accelerating the selection of desirable traits that Gregor Mendel achieved via crossbreeding his peas. Whether consumers will embrace these new foods is unknown. For now, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed overseeing gene-edited animals as drugs, something the meat industry thinks will disadvantage American producers.</p><p>If Russian President Vladimir Putin suspects that President Trump has been irretrievably weakened or distracted - and especially if he thinks Trump will be replaced by a more mainstream alternative - expect him to redouble his efforts to secure a deeper Russian role in the Middle East while he still has a chance.</p><p>Russia has been on a roll in the region, with a winning military intervention in Syria; a strengthening of diplomatic and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel; a mercenary involvement in Libya; and a toe in the waters of the western Mediterranean through joint naval exercises with Algeria. But Moscow's gains have come through craft, stealth and a large measure of luck, rather than through major-power prowess, and the challenge will be to sustain and build on those achievements.</p><p>Potential pitfalls abound. Putin has forged a generally useful working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he may have to start fresh in a post-Netanyahu era, depending on Israel's third round of elections in March. Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been receptive to Russian dealmaking, but neither is a client state of Moscow by any measure. And the real key to Russia's Middle Eastern success almost certainly depends on its longtime ally Iran, now shaken by violent protests.</p><p>In Syria, the Russian military effort has come with little cost and less pain. The real fighting on the ground on behalf of the government of Bashar al-Assad has been carried out by Iran and its Hezbollah allies. But anti-Hezbollah unrest in Lebanon, anti-Iran unrest in Iraq and upheaval on the streets of Iran itself could significantly alter the calculation.</p><p>If Iran stumbles, would Putin be forced to bail out Assad, at the risk of getting ensnared in Syria and sparking disquiet at home? Could he continue to avoid a confrontation with Turkey? Would the Saudis be as friendly with Moscow if they thought Iran was distracted by its own troubles? Will the mood shift unpredictably in Washington?</p><p>In 2019, Russia demonstrated its agility in the Middle East. The real test may still lie ahead.</p><p>Very few things unite President Trump and the Democrats vying to take his place in the White House, but both are readying for battle against Big Tech.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook, Google and their Silicon Valley peers could face the first major consequences in the coming year from investigations by state and federal regulators into whether they undermine privacy, mishandle sensitive online content, damage elections or quash competition.</p><p>Amazon is in the crosshairs for the tactics it's used to dominate e-commerce, Facebook for the way it gobbles up users' data (and its corporate rivals) and Google for its dominance of the online ad business. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Attorney General William P. Barr has said the Justice Department plans to wrap up its wide-ranging look at search, social media and online shopping in 2020. That could result in calls for new regulations and potentially punishments - the most extreme being an attempt to break up one or more companies.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee spent 2019 demanding internal documents from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. In 2020, it's expected to issue a report on whether the industry has, in effect, subverted federal antitrust protections. And if Trump loses the White House, the pressure will mount: Democratic contenders, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have promised to unwind some of the mergers that helped the giants become so big in the first place, such as Facebook's purchases of the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging platform WhatsApp.</p><p>Internet companies spent $55 million over the first nine months of this year to lobby Washington, and they'll throw more political weight around as the threat grows. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg hinted about a fierce counteroffensive in a talk with employees last summer. \"At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,\" he said. That fight is about to intensify.</p><p>Whatever awaits the rest of the country, not to mention \"official Washington,\" in 2020, our little sports town occupies a fundamentally different space than it did just 20 months ago. Then, the default setting was dread. The expectation was not just for a loss, but a loss that would come in the most excruciating manner imaginable. How will I be kicked in the stomach today?</p><p>Now? This is new territory, with pain replaced by possibility. Think about how the following sentences would have sounded in, say, December 2017: \"The Capitals are good. Really good. They might be the best team in hockey. They could definitely win the Stanley Cup.\" \"The Nationals should be good. Really good. One more offseason move, and they could be favored for a division championship. If things break right, maybe they could win the World Series.\"</p><p>Two years ago, that would have seemed outlandish and preposterous. Now, it sounds reasonable. Because it actually happened.</p><p>While basketball's Wizards might not be where hockey's Capitals and baseball's Nationals are at the moment - expecting to contend - the environment is such that their rebuilding project seems less laborious and more fun. A slow simmer of anger about another losing season is replaced by the joy of finding hope for the future. Plus, the Mystics won the WNBA title in 2019. We know winning basketball here!</p><p>It must be noted that the football team exists in a different reality, separate from the rest. It's as if the expectations for Washington sports have been turned around - with the football team left behind. What awaits that outfit in 2020 - a new coach, for sure, and perhaps even new leadership above him - will be monitored closely. But the fans who have fled the football team have other places to land.</p><p>There's no way to tell what will happen with Washington sports in the year ahead. What we know, though, is that the reality has finally met the expectations, and that completely alters what we believe is possible.</p><p>Although risks remain, the U.S. economy appears unlikely to fall into a recession in 2020. Another year of decent growth will probably make it easier for even more Americans to find jobs - and boost President Trump's chances of reelection. And the trade wars that dominated economic discussion in 2019 seem to be over, at least for now.</p><p>Growth is expected to be 1.8 percent next year, according to a closely watched survey of economists. That's far from the boom that Trump promised and slower than this year's pace of about 2.2 percent and last year's rate of 2.9 percent - but the president and the Federal Reserve may have it in their power to nudge the figure upward.</p><p>Trump just reached trade agreements with China, Canada and Mexico. The deals are more modest than what he vowed he could achieve, but they signal that he is hitting pause on his trade battles, a welcome relief for Wall Street investors and many business leaders. Although consumers continue to spend at a healthy clip, companies had dramatically scaled back purchases this year because of the trade uncertainty. If Trump keeps the peace on trade, business spending could resume.</p><p>Economists and investors also expect the Fed to lower rates at least once more in 2020, providing another boost. Three rate cuts by the Fed in 2019 were a major reason the stock market hit record highs and recession fears abated.</p><p>Although unemployment is at a 50-year low, the position of the middle class remains precarious. Jobs that pay middle-income wages are increasingly going away, replaced by positions paying over $100,000 or under $30,000. That socially destabilizing phenomenon will be a focus of the presidential race.</p><p>Economists, meanwhile, are also keeping a vigilant eye on robots - because firms typically accelerate the automation of jobs done by temporary and low-skilled workers in the months leading up to a significant downturn.</p><p>But the general expectation is that the longest expansion in U.S. history, which began in mid-2009, will last at least one more year.</p><p>We've had a full year of hand-wringing over \"cancel culture,\" particularly as it relates to comedians. Shane Gillis, for example, hired and then fired by \"Saturday Night Live\" for racist language on podcasts, was denounced on social media by celebrities - and also defended by famous comedians.</p><p>But 2020 may be the year when we learn that no one is canceled forever.</p><p>The controversies will continue, yes. The society-wide reckoning with sexual harassment and assault won't abate. There will be more denounced jokes; comedy, more than most art forms, ages terribly. Norms and tastes rapidly evolve. More performers will come under fire for past or recent statements, jokes, offstage behavior or allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>\"Getting canceled,\" though, means suffering professional and personal consequences, not being permanently silenced.</p><p>Look at Aziz Ansari, who was embroiled in controversy in 2018 after Babe.net published an anonymous accusation of sexual impropriety (Ansari said that the interaction \"by all indications was completely consensual\"). He retreated from the limelight for a while, but then he returned to stand-up, doing small shows to work out material before hitting the road to perform in packed theaters. He even addressed the allegation in an acclaimed Netflix special.</p><p>Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct after the New York Times published allegations from five women, lost his manager, publicist and all of the cultural cachet he had built up in his career. But he had a massive email list pre-scandal, and he can still promote himself to his diehard fans, the ones most likely to have remained as subscribers. C.K. is still performing, and as he announced to his list, he has several club and theater gigs in the United States and abroad in 2020.</p><p>Even Bill Cosby, convicted of assault, has found an audience - albeit behind bars - eager to listen to him opine.</p><p>Corporate entities putting together TV shows and movies will remain skittish about backing performers accused of problematic behavior, or ones criticized for offensive material. But there will still be audiences willing to watch.</p><p>The motives of the millions who took to the streets in Santiago, La Paz, Algiers and Basra were as varied as their geography. But the demonstrators were united in what has become an epochal display of global discontent, an explosion of popular unrest that capped a decade of angst and anger. When they weren't clamoring for greater freedoms and democracy, protesters were marching against corruption, inequality and state brutality. In their wake, presidents fled, prime ministers resigned and governments fell.</p><p>And the movements that flared in 2019 aren't about to peter out.</p><p>             Across Latin America, a creaking social contract seems on the verge of collapse: In Chile, widely viewed as one of South America's most stable societies, weeks of protests against austerity measures compelled the center-right president to shuffle his cabinet and announce reforms. But protesters remain on the streets, demanding a wholesale remaking of the socioeconomic order. Demonstrators in Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina and Haiti echoed the call for economic justice. An uprising in Bolivia chased out a long-ruling leftist president, while autocrats in Venezuela and Nicaragua cling to power despite popular challenges. More polarization, paralysis and violence may follow.</p><p>That's all the more on view in the Arab world, where a stunning wave of protests unseated leaders in Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon and Iraq. But an entrenched and often corrupt old guard is desperately trying to stay in control. In Iraq, security forces and pro-Iran militias have killed about 500 people and are preparing for a deeper crackdown.</p><p>Iran hasn't been spared, either. In November, authorities cut off Internet access and killed potentially hundreds to quash protests that erupted after a rise in fuel prices. As Iran's theocratic regime enters its fifth decade, a tanking economy and widespread public anger over political elites' mismanagement and corruption only add to the sense of a brewing existential crisis.</p><p>In Hong Kong, a sustained pro-democracy movement remains grimly determined, defying the authoritarian leadership in Beijing and its local proxies. China has no intention of acceding to protesters' demands, though, and 2020 could mark a bloody tipping point for Asia's financial capital.</p><p>President Trump, known more for his coziness with autocrats than commitment to democracy struggles abroad, has been conspicuously silent about most of these displays of people power. But only in a few instances - Hong Kong's American-flag-waving youth come to mind - are any of these movements explicitly calling for U.S. support. The immediacy of social media still allows us to bear witness and hold repressive governments to account. There will be plenty to watch in the year to come.</p><p>President Trump has begun admitting what polls have shown for three years: Many, many people hate him. And he's okay with that.</p><p>\"You don't like me. You have no choice but to vote for me,\" he told Wall Street bankers last month. \"You're ... not nice people at all, but you have to vote for me,\" he said to a room of Jewish supporters in December. \"You have no choice ... you're not going to vote for the wealth tax!\"</p><p>It is a rare admission from a politician. But it's key to a campaign strategy built around an awareness that Trump's favorability - even before he was impeached by the House - is near record lows and that he won't stop tweeting, offering bombast and insults, saying things that aren't true, or making polarizing decisions. So Trump's advisers are leaning in.</p><p>\"He's no Mr. Nice Guy,\" said the narrator in a $1 million-plus ad that ran during the World Series, highlighting some of the president's accomplishments while admitting that voters might not like him. \"But sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.\"</p><p>The idea is to talk more about his record and less about his personality - while slashing and burning Democratic opponents. At a briefing with reporters in mid-December, campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Jared Kushner showed data from 2016 indicating that people who said they disapproved of Trump still voted for him. They said many people don't want to publicly admit that they back Trump, but they ultimately will. Their targets are primarily suburban women and independents.</p><p>Essentially, Trump's bet is: If your paycheck is better, and we can make you hate the other candidate, you will vote for the president, even if you find him detestable.</p><p>The campaign expects to send surrogates who are less bombastic, such as Ivanka Trump, into areas where suburban women might be persuaded to vote for him.</p><p>Officials point to statistics that cut in the president's favor. For example, a recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 57 percent of voters nationally say they are better off than before Trump's presidency. He regularly scores high marks on the economy, which has continued to improve.</p><p>That same poll, though, found Trump losing to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. And his approval ratings are mired below 50 percent.</p><p>But to Trump's team, that's no reason for panic: On Election Day in 2016, 61 percent of the country rated Trump unfavorably. Now he's running for a second term.</p><p>With $152 billion in revenue expected in 2019, gaming has become the dominant entertainment medium of the past decade. And if gaming is this century's rock-and-roll, its biggest personalities are becoming a new class of rock stars.</p><p>These celebrities are much closer to the irreverence of rock and rap icons than any of the Hollywood guard: They're younger, have little interest in social filters and are mostly unimpressed by the lingering sheen of 20th-century stardom. But they're still causing \"utter              destruction\" in hotel rooms across the world, like the famous troublemakers who came before them.</p><p>Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, the most visible such star recently, has been at the forefront, with an unprecedented exclusive contract with Microsoft's Mixer streaming platform. Others have followed suit, signing lucrative (and secretive) contracts. PewDiePie, arguably the most powerful person on the Internet, hit two milestones in 2019: becoming the first YouTuber to accumulate 100 million subscribers and marrying his longtime girlfriend, Marzia, in a royal wedding for the meme generation. And Dr. Disrespect, who brings the pomp and panache of pro wrestling to Twitch, just signed a TV deal, another first for a pro gamer.</p><p>Besides building careers as gamers, they also share brushes with controversy - which may have been inevitable, given the challenges of communicating to an always-online, always-posting, always-angry audience. Celebrities have had to watch what they say for generations. But gamers grew up with social media, which often rewards the loudest in the room, no matter what.</p><p>All signs point to a messy integration between the populist media darlings of Gen Z and the existing power structure for politically correct pop. Ready or not, this clash of cultures is looming - and Player One is determined to win the game at any cost.</p><p>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist added the famous Gilbert-and-Sullivan-inspired gold stripes to his black robe long before he wielded the gavel at President Bill Clinton's Senate impeachment trial in 1999.</p><p>But he did borrow from the operetta \"Iolanthe\" in describing his role at the trial: \"I did nothing in particular, and I did it very well,\" he told a television interviewer two years later.</p><p>Now on deck: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. The man who made judge-as-umpire his credo during his confirmation hearing would be only the third chief justice to preside at a presidential impeachment trial. It would also be the first trial of any kind where the lawyer turned appellate judge has been in charge.</p><p>Roberts was a law clerk to Rehnquist and shares with his predecessor the goal - perhaps only aspirational, probably unobtainable - of convincing the public that he and his fellow justices are impartial to outcomes and immune to partisan influence and bias.</p><p>Although the Supreme Court itself has no formal role in President Trump's impeachment, Trump has, perhaps wishfully, imagined that it might. He tweeted this month: \"Shouldn't even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?\" Trump has also asked the court to protect his financial records from prosecutors and members of Congress, separate from impeachment; the justices will review that question in the spring.</p><p>But it is the chief justice, usually just one of nine, who by constitutional design plays the lone judicial role in presidential impeachment.</p><p>Like Rehnquist, Roberts is a student of history and the Constitution. Rehnquist wrote a book on impeachment; those who've studied the Clinton trial say he was reluctant to make broad rulings that could be overruled by a simple majority of senators. He left it to lawmakers to work out details over motions and witnesses. Roberts, who has chided Trump for suggesting that judges' views are more political bias than studied reasoning, will be looking to preserve his own reputation in a process that by design is more political than legal.</p><p>Call it influence inflation: Back when Bill Clinton was president, $100,000 was enough to get a political donor invited to sleep over in the Lincoln Bedroom. These days, top political benefactors dole out $100 million or more to elect favored candidates. The amount of money spent on presidential campaigns by independent groups rose from almost $129 million in 2008 to nearly $670 million in 2016, according to the Campaign Finance Institute. And essential functions like collecting and analyzing voter data, voter registration drives and spending on political ads are increasingly funded by America's 607 billionaires, outside the direct control of politicians or parties. (One of the richest, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, and in the 2018 cycle, donated $10.1 million to a super PAC supporting military veterans running for office, as well as $52,400 to five other federal PACs and campaigns, according to public records.)</p><p>Next year will set new records, reaffirming the second coming of a gilded age for political money. What Brookings Institution scholar Darrell West calls the \"wealthification\" of American politics is changing the players as well as the game. Two Democratic billionaires, Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, are self-funding presidential campaigns to dethrone the billionaire president, Donald Trump (and to replace his Cabinet, the wealthiest in modern history, including billionaire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos). A co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Thomas Hicks Jr., is the son of one of the country's wealthiest families, as is the party's finance chairman, Todd Ricketts, while Linda McMahon, a former head of the Small Business Administration whose husband is a billionaire, chairs the top pro-Trump super PAC.</p><p>Polls have shown for years that strong majorities of voters think there is too much money in politics. But that hasn't changed the bottom line: The exceedingly wealthy increasingly fund the political world. You just vote in it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-0ff595af08144f16866ae188683939f1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YG3-6W71-JB4M-V49P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4653\"/><timeReceived>11:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Welches sind wichtige Einflussfaktoren? Ein Blick auf die Beitrge der Woche aus der internationalen Finanzszene gibt Aufschluss \u00fcber einige Trends. Internationale Top News und Trends rund ums Banking und Finanzdienstleistungen.Wir erleben derzeit nur bei wenigen Banken eine digitale Transformation, die \u00fcber Mobile-Banking und bescheidene nderungen der Back-Office-Technologien hinausgeht und zu vollkommen neuen Geschftsmodellen f\u00fchrt. </p><p>Doch \u201eweiter so wie bisher' kann angesichts der schwachen Ertrge und neuer Wettbewerber weder kurz- noch langfristig eine Alternative sein. Banking 2020 und dar\u00fcber hinaus Im heutigen Wochenr\u00fcckblick auf die spannenden Themen aus der internationalen Finanzszene geht es schwerpunktmig um das neue Jahr und die dazu geh\u00f6renden Prognosen rund um einige Kernthemen im Banking. Retail Banking 2020 Das Retail Banking hat in den letzten Jahren bedeutende Vernderungen durchlaufen, die vom technologischen Fortschritt und regulatorischen Entwicklungen wie PSD2 getrieben wurden. Diese Krfte werden auch im Jahr 2020 von Bedeutung sein, wenn Privatkundenbanken \u00fcber ihre Zukunft nachdenken.Mehr dazu hier: 2020 predictions for retail banking[1] China als Vorbild? Whrend eine Mehrheit der Banken versucht, ihre Geschftsmodelle an ein strker digitales kosystem anzupassen, sind die groen Player in China, wie Alibaba, Tencent und andere schon weiter. Sie haben Big Data, fortschrittliche Analysen, moderne digitale Technologien und eine Innovationskultur zusammengebracht und bieten auergew\u00f6hnliche Kundenerlebnisse.Mehr dazu hier: The Future of Banking Has Arrived[2] Es gibt kein \u201ebesseres' Banking Kann es besseres Banking geben oder sprechen wir am Ende nur \u00fcber die ber\u00fchmten schnelleren Pferde von Henry Ford?

Allerdings ist noch viel Arbeit erforderlich, da Unternehmen \u00fcber die Technologieimplementierung hinausgehen m\u00fcssen, um die Organisationskultur rund um das digitale Banking zu verndern. Dies wird Initiativen \u00fcber die IT hinaus verlagern und die funktions\u00fcbergreifende Zusammenarbeit umfassen, die f\u00fcr den Wettbewerb mit FinTech- und Big-Tech-Angeboten erforderlich ist.Mehr dazu hier: The State of Digital Banking Transformation[4] Es kommt auf die Kundenorientierung an Es gibt zwei verschiedene Anstze, um geschftlichen Erfolg zu erzielen.

He would be so sick (laughter). Hey there, it's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. This morning, <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>gave a big speech in a roomful of people holding signs that said, run, Joe, run. And over the weekend, the South by Southwest Conference became a major presidential forum as candidates got tough on big tech companies. I'm Tamara Keith. I cover the White House.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I'm Scott Detrow. I cover Congress.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And I'm Mara Liasson, national political correspondent.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And both of you were at the Biden event this morning. Mara, you got there very, very early.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Yes. I don't know why, but I did. And I thought it was a really interesting event. You could see it as a dress rehearsal for an announcement speech, which everyone seems to think is going to come in the next couple of weeks. There was the run, Joe, run yellow-and-black signs on everyone's seat. The firefighters, of course, have been longtime supporters of his. There's the run, Joe, run chants.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE:                 (Chanting) Run, Joe, run.

Thank you.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And then there was Biden telling them, gee, save that enthusiasm. I might need it in a few weeks.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p><person><nameText>JOE BIDEN</nameText></person>:                 I appreciate the energy you showed when I got up here. Save it a little longer. I may need in a few weeks.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And then it had all the elements of a stump speech.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p><person><nameText>JOE BIDEN</nameText></person>:                 That's what defines us - that in America, everybody gets a shot. That's what the next president of the United States needs to understand and that's what I don't think this current president understands at all.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I was there, too. I was not yet awake when Mara got there because I slept through my alarm.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Didn't have time for coffee, but I sat next to Mara, so I was good on that front. And, Mara, we were talking before the event just how it's this weird kind of split-screen world in 2020 right now. On one hand, the Democratic Party, its candidates in terms of message, tone, so many things, are moving away from Biden. But on the other hand, everyone's waiting for Biden. He's leading the polls. He's really dominating the conversation. And into that, he gives this pseudo stump speech and, you know, how would you define what the core message was?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 First of all, I thought the audience was a proxy for Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the kind of white working-class voters - in this case, it was a mostly male audience.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So you're saying there were a lot of white guys there.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Yes, yes.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 A lot of beefy white guys.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Beefy.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 But more important, they represented a demographic that the - in those key states that the Democrats have to win back as they also simultaneously energize their younger, diverse base. It is not an either/or, but they have to get back one or more of those key states. And Biden gave the kind of speech that is making Democrats say he's a guy who can go to those states, his home state of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and talk to that audience. He talked about the middle class and unions built the middle class.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p><person><nameText>JOE BIDEN</nameText></person>:                 Because when I look around this room, I see the people who built this nation. The country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and hedge fund managers. They're not necessarily bad. They didn't build this country. It was built by the great American middle class, and unions built the middle class.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 I disagree with Scott a little bit. I don't - when you say the Democratic Party is moving away from Biden, I don't think Biden's problems in the nominating battle are going to be ideological. I don't think it's that he's a centrist. I think maybe that he's older. He's been around a long time. And then there are much bigger, more fundamental questions about him that I hear from Democrats. Can he perform? Is he a good candidate? He's great on paper, has a tremendous amount of experience, and can he raise the money?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 This sounds, by your telling, to be sort of vintage <person><nameText>Joe Biden, </nameText></person>which is super passionate and kind of all over the place.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 He was either - Mara and I were saying that he was either speaking at a two or a 12 the whole time. It was either very whispered and then yelling and then whispering again. Again, very - that's how he's carried himself for decades and decades. That's who he is. I would say the - again, throughout this 40-minute or so speech, the little pockets of stump speech, he was talking about the middle class. He was contrasting last year's tax cuts with this budget proposal that came out of the White House this week, saying this is - you know, they're having the middle class pay for rich people's tax cuts - that's one message - also the importance of America's place in the world. That's something a lot of candidates have been talking about.             </p><p>                And he also made this other third pitch that I've been hearing from Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and a lot of other candidates, you know, the idea that this is not who America is. President Trump's approach to politics does not reflect American values.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Right. He talked about the petty meanness of our politics and how it's a sin to say anything nice about a Republican.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 But did he talk specifically about policy? Did - you know, like, many of the Democratic candidates who are already running for president are talking about \"Medicare for All.\" They're talking about a $15 minimum wage. They're talking about child care for all. Was there any, like, I'm <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>and if I will be your presidential candidate, this is what I would propose?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 No, but I don't think that was his intention today. I think you will hear all of those things from Biden when he announces. And I think that you will find nuances of differences between him and the other Democrats, not big ideological differences. Of course, he's going to be for a $15 dollar wage. He's not going to be for getting rid of Obamacare and replacing it with Medicare for All that gets rid of the private health insurance industry in one fell swoop the way Bernie wants to.             </p><p>                But, yes, I would expect him to be for some kind of public option Medicare buy in. And he will have a vigorous climate change agenda. <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>will have a robust policy agenda. I think the big question for Democrats, because their first, second and third priority is defeating Donald Trump, who's the best candidate that can do that? Who's the candidate that can fire up the base and get back some of those key Rust Belt states? Can Biden do this? Can he perform? It's not so much his numeric age. It's his energy level. And that's where I am finding from talking to Democrats that there are a lot of questions.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah, I think so. I think there's a lot of uncertainty about one key issue. Every poll that comes out - now, polls this early, take them with enormous, you know, granite boulders of salt.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 It's just name ID.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 There's a Twitter account that - I'll retweet it so people can find it - that compares polls out this many days advance of the last three presidential elections that I think is pretty helpful, but...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 They're not predictive.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. That being said, he is on top of all of them by a lot. A big poll came out in Iowa over the weekend, The Des Moines Register's poll, which is pretty good, pretty on point. It has <person><nameText>Joe Biden, </nameText></person>27 percent, Bernie Sanders, 25 percent, everybody else in single digits. The thing that I saw in that poll that made me think, yeah, this is probably just about name ID is that people's second choice, all the Bernie people, a big chunk of them said they'd be for Biden if Bernie wasn't in - same with Biden for Bernie. I don't think there's a lot of ideological Bernie to Biden crossover, so that made me think maybe this is just name ID. But that's the question. We don't know. And if Biden gets in the race and is running against other candidates, other candidates are campaigning against him, that kind of soft idea of, oh, what if <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>ran in the race - a popularity that 2015 Hillary Clinton is very familiar with - does that go away and get hardened or does that stay?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 We know that Bernie Sanders, when he comes in second in that poll, some share of those Bernie Sanders people are like ride-or-die Bernie Sanders supporters. Like, they will be Bernie people forever and always. Does Biden have people like that?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Yes. I think there are a lot of people who feel he is the best shot to defeat Donald Trump. And the difference this year, of course, is that Bernie Sanders doesn't need as many votes as he got last time to get the nomination because the field is much bigger. We see that he has this 25 to 27 percent support. Is that his ceiling or his floor? We're not quite sure. But Biden, I think, is broadly acceptable to the Democratic Party.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And that was one of the big questions that we had about Bernie Sanders before he officially launched his campaign. It's similar to the question that we currently have about <person><nameText>Joe Biden. </nameText></person>You know, Asma Khalid and I, we were talking to so many voters in early states, and a lot of them were saying, you know, I supported Bernie Sanders last time, but this time, I'm supporting somebody else. And we were thinking, OK, well, who's left for Bernie Sanders if he gets in? And the answer so far seems to be a whole lot of people. He has raised tens of millions of dollars in opening hours alone of his campaign. He has had big rallies. He has had the biggest rallies that - he and Kamala Harris are the two people with massive rallies.             </p><p>                He certainly seems in the opening weeks of his campaign to be validating that front-runner status that we were looking at Bernie Sanders having in 2020, which is, of course, the, you know, polar opposite of the early days of his 2016 campaign before he really caught fire.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And he is running his campaign like he is a front-runner. This is a very different Bernie Sanders approach. You don't think so?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well, how do you think that - I think he's trying to correct some problems. I wouldn't say he's running as a front-runner. He's trying to reach out to black voters. He's trying to reach out to African-American voters. He's trying to correct some impressions. Like, yes, he is actually a Democrat. Yes, he will support the eventual nominee. He talks about his own personal...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 He's acting like somebody who wants to win.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah, that's exactly it, yeah.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Yeah, but I don't think he's acting like a front-runner. He talks about his growing up in Brooklyn, his marching for civil rights. So he's correcting some problems. I wouldn't say he's running as a front-runner because he's still calling for a political revolution. He hasn't changed his message since 1971.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Though, he has a pretty powerful argument that he's been making that if you look at what he ran on in 2016 when he was an outlier in the Democratic Party, you know, a big chunk of the field this time around is running on that exact same platform.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Which could be good or bad. That could also work against him because Bernie Sanders is right. A lot of the things that he's been for have been adopted across the board by the Democratic Party. But he could be a victim of his own success because if you want a $15 minimum wage or Medicare for All, Bernie Sanders is not your only choice.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 OK. We are going to take a quick break. And when we come back - a look at Biden's potential competitors and their take on big tech companies.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And we're back. And let's talk tech because all the big names - Warren, Klobuchar, O'Rourke - they all showed up at South by Southwest this past weekend. This is a conference where tech is king. And they were there to say that tech has a problem.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yes. And this has been such a cosmic shift over a long period of time with a lot of different reasons where Democrats especially but both parties for years were all about Silicon Valley, hyping it up, talking about how great it was, showing off the products they had. This is the future. This is democracy in action. That is not the case right now. And you really knew it for sure when just before this conference, Elizabeth Warren came out with a massive plan that would regulate big tech, that would treat them as utilities just like the gas and the electric company and would also put a plan in place that, if they get too big, would break them up, like Standard Oil, like the railroads.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Right. And there are two parts to that critique. One, as Scott just described, the incredible 360, or 180 that we've done about before, the Internet was the road to democracy. Now the Internet is a tool of corporate and state surveillance.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And Russia interference.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And Russian interference. But there's another economic argument that bigness is one of the reasons we have a slow-growing unequal economy. In other words, when there's too much monopoly power, there's not enough innovation. And that means there's not enough growth. That's going to be the - one of the big economic debates of our time.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So a lot of the candidates were at South by Southwest. And a lot of them talked about their own plans to break up big tech. A lot of these plans existed before. Amy Klobuchar talked about something I believe she's talked about before of putting more taxes on - when big tech companies sell your data. But I think this was another example of Elizabeth Warren coming out with a big, bold plan and setting the philosophical agenda for the day. She has done that with big, you know, family leave, child care, family care plan. She has done that with saying I'm not even going to meet with donors. You know, a lot of different things Elizabeth Warren has come out and said I'm doing X and other candidates have had to respond or follow suit.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And ironically, it doesn't seem to be helping her in terms of her position in the polls, but she is setting the agenda.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 You know, they are talking about cracking down on these big tech companies, as you talked about before. Democrats and tech companies were closely allied, and tech company employees and executives have been major donors to Democrats. Does this get awkward or problematic, or is it, like, just not worth it to worry about for these candidates?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 I think tech companies have ties to the Democratic Party that are based on things other than antitrust policy; in other words, their views on social issues. I think there are a lot of tech companies who say that they have a responsibility to deal with privacy and surveillance. And I don't see the tech companies, you know, en masse deserting the Democratic Party and going to the Republicans. But I do think this is a really important debate. And, you know, I agree. The romance is gone, but the romance is gone in general, you know, to say that Facebook and Google and Twitter are going to solve all our problems.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. I think especially if you look at the year that Facebook in particular has had, if you look at the reputation that Twitter now has compared to five, 10 years ago, I mean, I think that the overall mindset has turned. And, you know, I wonder if this could be a powerful argument for Democrats because if you look throughout American history, populist messaging and anti-big companies, trust-busting, it worked pretty well for both Roosevelts, among other candidates. And certainly the big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, are the, you know, the Standard Oils of our time. You can really make that argument.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And Democrats have an opportunity to poach, to eat off the other guy's plate. The Republicans have usually been the party of small business. Democrats could take some of that back.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And this is the part of the podcast where I mention that Amazon and Facebook are among NPR's many financial supporters. OK. One other thing that happened at South by Southwest, as we heard from Ryan in our timestamp at the very top of the show, there were a bunch of events with presidential candidates, many of them CNN sponsored and televised town halls. What did we learn from these?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 I would say that <person><nameText>Pete Buttigieg, </nameText></person>the mayor - Democratic mayor of South Bend, Ind. - gay, married, veteran - did himself the most good. He was very good in the Q&amp;A format, really crisp, really down to Earth. And I think it's very, very hard for a mayor to get the nomination, but he did raise a lot of money after that town hall. And I think that he impressed a lot of people, so I think he used that format and that forum better than any of the other ones so far.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Of the candidates who you would never heard of before this contest, I think he has so far in the first two months or so gotten the most low-level buzz and a lot of people saying, well, that's an interesting guy.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And he'll probably, because of that, get himself onto the debate stage because there are certain criteria thresholds you have to cross - certain number of donors, certain points in the polls. He'll probably make it.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And circling back to <person><nameText>Joe Biden </nameText></person>and his age - one of the things that Buttigieg talks about that has seemed to be picking up steam is the idea of - he calls it, like, generational justice, talking specifically to millennial voters.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 OK. I think we are going to leave this conversation here. For all I know, by the time we get back next time, there could be another person running for president.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Tune in for next week's weekly 2020 chat.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 (Laughter) All right.

Now it's Napa Valley, and the best.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You've got to admit the economy's doing well,\" replies Romko. \"Robust growth, low interest rates, and the Dow is up. Even we Ukes have come up in the world. Globalization is our friend.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's not floating all boats,\" counters Danko. \"Look at those miners and steel-workers in the Rust Belt. They're not even looking for jobs. That's why they don't show up in the statistics. They're getting addicted to opioids, getting divorced and killing themselves. There's a lot of descendants of our old immigrants there... And guess who they'll vote for next year.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"And for good reason. But you and I must be living in different universes. Because in reality, those workers have been doing better these past three years. Employment is up, wages are up... Now that we're playing tough with China and putting up tariffs, deregulating our industries, limiting immigration, our workers have a chance. We needed a little creative destruction.\"</p><p>\"It's destruction all right, but I wouldn't call it creative,\" interjects Irka, drifting in from Shchur's dim library. The federal government isn't just a bunch of bean-counting bureaucrats. Decades of hard work have been thrown to the winds. Environmental protection, health and safety regulations...\"</p><p>\"Besides, immigrants aren't taking away those jobs,\" adds Danko. \"Immigrants have been doing the hard, dirty work that no one else wanted to do since the Irish potato famine. The guys who mow our lawns and wash our windows didn't take those jobs away from industrial workers in the Rust Belt.\"</p><p>\"As if either party cared,\" muses Irka. \"There's no dignified work for Americans with a high-school education, and you can't just re-train them for high-tech jobs. Wall Street and Big Tech love globalization, because it means they can abandon entire communities if there's cheaper labor in Asia. And Wall Street and Big Tech fund both parties. The Republicans are fixated on economic growth and investors' bottom line. The Democrats, who used to support labor, are fixated on the oppressed minority du jour. No one cares about fat middle-aged white men who don't fit into the new econo-m y .\"</p><p>\"So, who would you vote for?\" asks Danko.</p><p>\"No one from the big parties,\" answers Irka. \"You know how elections work. They pick the candidate and the program that's most likely to win the election. Then they forget the program and start delivering on the promises they made to their donors. I'll just vote for the best local candidates. Democracy can only be local. Jefferson knew that. The Zaporozhian Sich knew that!\"</p><p>\"Well, you know the litmus test for a presidential candidate. Is he good for Ukraine?\"</p><p>\"Or she,\" Irka reminds him. \"Or they. But who's good for Ukraine? Not someone who doesn't think it's a real country.\"</p><p>\"Or someone who thinks socialism is still a workable idea,\" points out Romko. \"But we'll see how the impeachment trial goes. If you can call it a trial.\"</p><p>\"Unfortunately, you can't. But how can you not impeach someone who's playing Russia's game? Or at least put him out of the running in November?\"</p><p>\"But impeachment is part of Russia's game too,\" argues Romko. \"It makes us look weak and stupid. Just watch-next year, while we're fixated on impeachment, Putin will pull another fast one. Maybe in Ukraine.\"</p><p>\"Professor Schmetterling thinks Putin won't last,\" remarks Irka.</p><p>\"He said that ages ago.\"</p><p>\"And it's still true.\"</p><p>\"It's not just Putin,\" sighs Danko. \"Russia won't stop until they've taken over Ukraine.\"</p><p>\"I think they'd rather just control it, subverting its government, fomenting chaos,\" observes Romko. \"And keeping it out of NATO. Let's face it, NATO is an appendage of America. The Russians want to be a big player. They want to cut us down to size. And whatever happened to the multi-polar world? Our liberals used to criticize America being the world's policeman. When we tried to stop communism in Vietnam, they said you can't spread democracy from the barrel of a gun. Now we've had troops in Afghanistan and Iraq for how many years, and what have we accomplished?\"</p><p>\"I don't think America can spread democracy in the Middle East or Africa,\" admits Danko. \"But it should defend democracy where it already exists.\"</p><p>\"That idea's past its prime,\" says Romko bitterly. \"We can't be the only superpower. We've got to share power with Europe, India, even undemocratic regimes like China...\"</p><p>\"And Russia?\" snaps Danko. \"That's not good news for Ukraine.\"</p><p>\"Ukraine doesn't have to be an American proxy,\" comments Romko. \"Our politicians think they can tell Ukrainians whom to investigate or not investigate, whom to fire, whom to elect. It's shameful. Ukraine needs to stand on her own feet. And she belongs in Europe.\"</p><p>\"But Ukraine can't trust the Europeans,\" Danko points out. \"They don't care about Ukrainians. They're certainly not going to stick their necks out for them simply because they have better 'European values' than Europe itself.\"</p><p>\"Remember,\" Romko adds, \"Europe isn't even a nation. And the EU is coming apart. It's lost its focus. It's an unelected bureaucracy that tells national electorates what to do. And no one benefits but the global elite. Your Polish coalminer in Silesia resents them for the same reasons his cousin in Pennsylvania resents people like us.\"</p><p>\"And Putin exploits that,\" mutters Irka. \"He wanted Brexit, and he got it.\"</p><p>\"We scream about populism,\" remarks Romko, \"but one man's populism is another man's democracy. People want to run their own affairs, without Brussels telling them how many centimeters long they have to grow their cucumbers. The problem isn't illiberalism. The problem is ill liberals.\"</p><p>It is nearing midnight. A grinning Shchur approaches with a tray of shot glasses of clear, cold horilka. And they toast a new year filled with dissension and doubt.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2350102653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">25859ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5V-P9Y1-DYR7-80CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"992\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Ukrainian National Association All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Ukrainian Weekly</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 02739348</issn><volume>Vol. 88</volume><issueNumber>No. 2</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 12, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>North Atlantic Treaty Organization--NATO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vietnam</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iraq</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Afghanistan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pennsylvania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Napa Valley</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ukraine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Modesto California</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Globalization</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democracy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Employment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Populism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 928120</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000688</classCode><className>FACTORY WORKERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000887</classCode><className>IMMIGRATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

But online orders can be extraordinarily expensive to fulfil, especially in grocery. And the bricks-and-mortar model allows you to showcase your products in a way that's particularly successful. </p><p><br/>So the big tech giants have realised the importance of a bricks-and-mortar presence. There were apocalyptic predictions over how their expertise - particularly in data - would make it impossible for traditional retailers to compete. But the reality is that hasn't really happened. Because retail is pretty hard.  <br/>Online players don't have the expertise of building a functional retail model. So it won't be a case of either bricks-and-mortar or online operations winning. We expect to see them working together - that means more strategic partnerships and acquisitions.  <br/>Prediction for the next decade: Supermarkets will merge with digital takeaway businesses <br/>The combination of a supermarket and takeaway business would be hugely more than the sum of their parts. Customers will continue to look for the most convenient option that gives them the time to do what they want. So wouldn't it be nice if the takeaway driver not only dropped off your pizza, but also the milk for tomorrow morning? <br/>You can imagine having a digital service that had all the information about your shopping and eating habits. The core things you eat could be ordered through this digital housekeeper - so the ingredients for your spag bol on Wednesdays and your takeaway pizza on Fridays. I would be very surprised if the major grocers didn't start merging with takeaway businesses in the next decade.  <br/>'It's been the decade of plant-based. Get ready for targeted health' <br/>Stuart Machin <br/>MD, M&amp;S Food <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: The plant-based revolution <br/>One in four of our customers are choosing a more flexitarian diet and 86% of plant-based meals are eaten by non-vegans, according to Kantar. I can't see this slowing down any time soon. Last January, we launched our Plant Kitchen range, which has been phenomenally successful, selling over 16 million products and attracting 585,000 new shoppers to M&amp;S. We've launched over 100 new vegan products this month. <br/>Prediction for the next decade: Targeted health claims in food and drink <br/>We've seen a surge in customers looking to change their eating habits and increasing interest in foods specifically developed to improve energy, sleep or productivity. I expect nootropics, anti-inflammatories and ayurvedic to be buzzwords in food over the next 12 months. <br/>Bear in mind the health industry is huge business - in the next five years, the mobile health tracking market is expected to hit \u00a327bn. How this growth impacts the food retail industry remains to be seen, but it's an area to keep an eye on as there are sure to be huge developments to shake up the industry. <br/>'Market prices and food imports will define the next decade' <br/>Minette Batters <br/>President, NFU <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: Fines for fixing dairy prices  <br/>In 2011, eight supermarkets and dairies were fined nearly \u00a350m by the Office of Fair Trading. It was on the back of the foot and mouth crisis: the dairy industry was in meltdown, milk was a loss leader and there were enormous challenges in trying to keep the market going. So retailers tried to give more money back to farmers and stabilise the price. Then the OFT got involved.  <br/>It's very clear retailers aren't going to touch the supply chain again, so the only way we can support farmers is increasing safeguards. So we'd like to see the GSCOP being rolled out across other retailers and the Voluntary Codes of Practice being made mandatory. <br/>Prediction for the next decade: Food import quality will become a bigger issue <br/>I think there will be big debate around food imports. The government needs to ensure all imports are produced to the same legal standard as we have here. Failure to do that puts at risk all of the work we have done to maintain the UK as one of the safest food supply chains in the world. Of course, it all depends on how our trade discussions go. The government needs to put together a commission to look at what we would want in a future trade deal and to scrutinise deals on the table.  <br/>'The inexorable rise of online will start to slow' <br/>Ian Wright <br/>CEO, FDF <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: The UK vote to the leave the EU<br/>The Brexit vote has had a massive impact and it's become a defining issue of our society. The debate on how we exit the EU has undoubtedly impacted the industry in terms of delayed investment, uncertainty and extra costs. There are a lot of costs involved. Businesses have had to stockpile, bring forward production, buy up ingredients, and there have been extra logistical and warehouse costs. So these are all incremental costs - not massive, but still serious. There was uncertainty about different deadlines for our exit, and now there's uncertainty about the nature of our relationship with the EU. We don't know what the regulatory regime will be and it's been a serious distraction. <br/>Prediction for the next decade: Environmental considerations will begin to impact the rise of online shopping  <br/>I can't help feeling that in 10 years' time we will be even more worried about climate change than now. Online operators will continue to take share over the next few years, but they will have to answer to consumer concerns. If you look at what's happened on plastic packaging, that revolution has been entirely consumer-led. They've just said 'we're not having it'. You could imagine a similar sort of emotion being directed towards online retailers. <br/>Online is very fleet of foot and companies may well come up with a number of environmental initiatives. But they will have to make sure they address the concerns of people worried about their environmental impact. <br/>'As the discounters keep growing, the big four will become the big three' <br/>Richard Harrow <br/>UK partner, IPLC <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: The rise of the discounters <br/>It was the financial crash in 2008 that really started to see consumers take note of the discounters. While we had always had a discount sector with players such as Kwiksave, these players brought cheap products and amazing value for money to the market.  <br/>Aldi also started to realise that just matching brands at cheaper prices was not the ideal strategy for a market where private label was so strong. In many categories, private label is the dominant \"brand\" so a focus on matching private label also started to shape its range.  <br/>It is hard to believe now, but in the early part of the 2000s, both discounters saw a downturn in trade over the Christmas period. Today both are strong competitors for the Christmas spend.  <br/>Prediction for the next decade: The big four becomes the big three <br/>I believe it is highly likely that the big four will become the big three as value and more importantly volume continue to drift into the discount sector. The big four will need to continually downsize their store estates and headcounts as sales decline. At a certain point, one or even two will find their financial position unsustainable. <br/>Kantar estimates that Aldi and Lidl could hit a combined market share of 24%. This would mean they will add a business the size of Morrisons to their combined market share. <br/>'Sustainability will increasingly guide business decisions' <br/>Bryan Roberts <br/>Global insight director, TCC Global <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: The Blue Planet effect <br/>On 29 October 2017, a sequel TV series began. Episode four included the scene where a whale tended to her dead calf, which the mother had unwittingly killed by feeding it milk poisoned by plastic. The final episode was a damning verdict on the horrific impact of humankind on the ocean and its inhabitants, with a particular focus on plastic. Blue Planet II was arguably one of the most impactful pieces of television ever created and its reverberations continue to impact the operations and strategies of the entire fmcg industry, especially here in the UK. <br/>Prediction for the next decade: An increasing focus on sustainability across the retail industry <br/>It's unlikely that we will see a similar one-off event in the next 10 years, but what is certain is that retailers will have to be hugely mindful about their stance on the environment and how they adjust their businesses accordingly. The next decade will see shoppers demand values alongside value, ushering in a new era where all brands will be expected to increasingly demonstrate their commitment to community and environment, as well as shareholders.  <br/>'You will have to opt in to eat meat' <br/>Clare Oxborrow <br/>Campaigner, Friends of the Earth <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: The debate around meat consumption and the environment <br/>Ten years ago, it was difficult to talk about the need to eat less meat without a backlash. <br/>Flexitarianism is now a trend that's here to stay. There's a huge interest in cooking and eating a more plant-based diet, for our health, the planet, and animal welfare.  <br/>Food businesses have responded to this shift, introducing a range of plant-based dishes. We've also seen a more widespread understanding from food companies of the devastating impacts of soy production on the Amazon and Cerrado in South America.  <br/>Prediction for the next decade: Meat-free will be the default <br/> Veggie or vegan dishes will become standard, and meat dishes will be the ones we have to 'opt in' for. More widely there will be increased effort to reduce the overall environmental impact of our food shop, from greenhouse gas emissions to land use.  <br/>The farming industry will start to respond more to the environmental agenda, following the lead of pioneering producers. More land will be freed up from intensive livestock production and there will be much more agroforestry to fight against climate breakdown.  <br/>'Big brands will regain dominance over craft' <br/>Akeel Sachak <br/>Global head of consumer advisory, Rothschild <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: The acquisition of Anheuser-Busch<br/>For me the standout corporate phenomenon in food and drink was the effective 3G acquisition of Anheuser-Busch via InBev. It actually occurred in 2009, but we've seen the effect in the past decade. The initial success of the zero-based budgeting, margin acceleration and cash generation strategy embraced by 3G here and subsequently with the likes of Burger King, Heinz and Kraft, and the adulation of the markets this attracted, led to countless other food and drink companies following a similar path. However, this was often at the expense of long-term investment in sustainable growth. This has come home to roost, as evidenced by the trajectory of the share prices of many who followed the model. <br/>Prediction for the next decade: Big brands rule the roost once again <br/>Over the past decade, craft brands have flourished as big brands have neglected to invest properly. However, the next decade will see all but a very few craft brands struggle to maintain relevance and momentum without the RTM advantage and marketing resources that big brand owners are finally again putting behind their core brands. <br/>We have already started to see this with the likes of Coke seeing topline growth that had eluded it for years. <br/>'There will be a growing divide in food quality' <br/>Ben Reynolds <br/>Deputy CEO, Sustain <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: The focus on children's health <br/>The past 10 years has seen the slow but sure acceptance of the need for the food industry and policymakers to act to improve children's health. With this, there has been a shift from solely focusing on individual responsibility to include a spotlight on the environment that many, particularly the poorest, live in.  <br/>The soft drinks levy has been the standout policy in this space and has worked much more effectively in highlighting the problems of overconsumption of sugar than any government information campaign. It has also led to much quicker and deeper reformulation than voluntary measures.  <br/>Prediction for the next decade: Overseas trade deals will create divide in food quality <br/>The trade deals we strike as we leave the EU are likely to lead to the biggest immediate changes. From corn syrup to chlorinated chicken, a new wave of imports may see diet-related disease soar and British farmers forced out of business. But where the UK may struggle to compete on price, we can compete on quality, and certified sustainable produce.  <br/>Products of designated origin and the like will hold their own to meet demand domestically and abroad. This will be reinforced by the new government's likely review of labelling and animal welfare standards, matched by increasing concerns from customers to know where their food has come from and how it has been produced. All in all, that means we are set to see a further entrenchment in the divide in our food culture between those who can afford quality, and those that have little choice but to make do with the leftovers. <br/>'Cash will become obsolete as contactless options grow' <br/>Jed Murphy <br/>Strategy &amp; innovation director, Cardlytics  <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: Mobile payment technology <br/>They say the most effective technology is often overestimated in the short term and underestimated in the long term. That's been the case with mobile payments. It was a major moment when Apple Pay was rolled out in the UK in July 2015, with Waitrose as one of the launch partners.  <br/>Prediction for the next decade: Cash comes to an end <br/>We will likely see the end of cash for grocers. It's expensive to handle for shops, and the clear trend among consumers is towards non-cash payments. As well as preparing for the future by beginning to accept higher-value contactless payments above the common \u00a330 thresholds, grocers are also looking to reduce the cost of processing these payments. Tesco has launched Pay+, while Auchan, Carrefour and Total merged their digital wallets to create Lyf Pay. Open Banking legislation means payments can be made by third parties, which is reducing costs to zero, and so expect grocers to move payments from the likes of MasterCard, Visa and Amex to cheaper options.  <br/>Combine this with entirely self-service initiatives like Amazon's Go store and you can start to see a much more frictionless - and cashless - customer experience. <br/>'The horsemeat scandal serves as a warning for the future' <br/>Eoghan Daly <br/>Director of forensic services, Crowe UK  <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: The horsemeat scandal <br/>The horsemeat contamination of the EU beef supply chain took everyone by surprise - industry and government - and fundamentally challenged assumptions about the integrity of food supply chains. It undermined consumer trust in the food industry that continues to this day, and called into question the effectiveness of the 'one up one down' model of supply chain traceability and the reliance on testing. <br/>Prediction for the next decade: New trade deals increase supply chain vulnerability <br/>The most seismic thing that could happen in the next decade is that the UK, once it is out of the EU, agrees a free trade agreement with the US that removes all tariffs on food and drink imports. That would lead to new supply chains for the import of food and drink, which could lower costs for consumers. However, it could also introduce new vulnerabilities into supply chains.  <br/>UK consumers have repeatedly expressed a desire to avoid certain products, such as GM crops, and are also supportive of the UK's high-welfare approach to animal production. A free trade agreement could make it harder for consumers to trust food businesses.  </p><p>'Checkout-free will evolve into AI' <br/>Michael Gabay <br/>CEO, Trigo  <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: Efforts to make in-store shopping frictionless <br/>Grocery shopping is a sensory experience most consumers would prefer not to leave to others. That's why, despite the rise of online, brick-and-mortar will prove resilient. It's also why the coming years will see more investment in technology to make the in-store experience a frictionless one. But finding the perfect solution has been a bumpy road. According to a Trigo analysis, 78% of checkout technology rollouts from 2018 to 2019 were scan-based solutions - and most of these rollouts were concentrated in 2018, with rollouts plunging 55% year on year as retailers and customers found these technologies wanting. <br/>Prediction for the next decade: A real evolution of in-store tech <br/>If the 2010s saw the gradual introduction of checkout-free technologies, the 2020s will be a decade of overcoming the growing pains of these solutions, as retailers shift from scan-based to more advanced technologies. Computer vision and AI-based systems will move to centre stage as retailers look for solutions that deliver both operational efficiency and greater cost-effectiveness.  </p><p>The insect revolution is on its way <br/>Karl Imiruaye <br/>Technical and product specialist, PI Food Projects <br/>Most seismic moment of the past decade: The rise of functional health ingredients <br/>Consumers are time-poor but increasingly knowledgeable. So they are hunting out easy ways to optimise their diets.  <br/>This has led to more and more foods being fortified with functional ingredients that claim to offer health benefits.  <br/>We've gone from simple yoghurts, for example, to products with added vitamins, calcium, and active ingredients like turmeric and matcha. Prebiotics and probiotics are also coming to the forefront more, as evidenced by the rise of foods like kefir and kimchi.  <br/>Prediction for the next decade: Insects finally have their moment <br/>There has been a great deal of talk about insects being the next big thing, largely to little avail. But that prediction could finally come to pass in the coming decade. <br/>That will be fuelled by environmental concerns. Over the past year, we've seen the effect of Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion. Millennial and gen Z consumers are very concerned about their carbon footprint, which is shaping their purchasing habits.  <br/>Insects are accepted as a sustainable source of protein in many other countries, and Europe will increasingly follow suit. Initially, products will contain hidden insects, but the need for that 'hidden' element will decrease as more businesses get on board. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEGRO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEGRO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY7-GXP1-JCP9-23T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">168088</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3084\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

Instead, advertisers have slashed spending, which has led to layoffs at ad agencies and media companies. Brands have also accelerated investments in areas that have grown during the past several months, like e-commerce and digital products. Transformers in media and advertising are developing new content breakthroughs for brands like Netflix, launching new direct-to-consumer brands, or organizing boycotts that hold the world's largest platforms accountable for misinformation. 100 People Transforming Business is an annual list and series highlighting people across industries who are changing the way the world does business. Check out the full list for 2020.[1]</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://businessinsider.com/tb/the-people-transforming-business-in-2020-9The\">https://businessinsider.com/tb/the-people-transforming-business-in-2020-9The</url> advertising and media worlds are on a crash course of innovation and disruption.For the second year, Business Insider is highlighting 10 people transforming the advertising and media industries as part of a list identifying 100 people transforming the business world in North America.We identified visionaries disrupting established businesses and pushing the industry in new directions. They're tasked with breaking new ground \u2014 whether it's developing the next big hit for Netflix and Spotify, building a new direct-to-consumer brand from scratch, or organizing boycotts that hold the world's largest platforms accountable for misinformation.These people are making sweeping decisions that influence how large companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google make money and how people get their news and entertainment. Industry disruption across every channel Long gone are the days of glossy print advertisements and the \"Mad Men\" agencies. More than a decade after Google acquired YouTube and DoubleClick to become the world's biggest online advertising juggernaut and Hulu launched to rival Netflix in the cord-cutting era, the advertising and media industries are grappling with monumental structural change on top of the economic downfall caused by the coronavirus.The $226 billion US advertising industry is facing disruption and change around every corner. Marketers are under growing pressure from their CEOs to prove that advertising actually drives sales, which is causing more advertisers to cut ties with their ad agencies and handle marketing internally. Agencies are racing to offer clients data-backed expertise to keep up with consulting firms and tech giants that are eating away at their business.Regulators and privacy-protection laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 have threatened marketers' ability to target people at exactly the right time and place. And advertisers are changing how they target their audience and giving so-called walled gardens like Facebook, Google, and Amazon more power.Activists and critics who are making more headway than ever before in holding big tech companies responsible for monitoring speech on their platforms are holding advertisers accountable, as evidenced by July's mass boycott of Facebook that got hundreds of big-name brands like Unilever and Starbucks on board.With the ongoing decline of traditional TV viewing \u2014 and the $70 billion in advertising it props up \u2014 Hollywood, media outlets, and tech companies like Disney, NBCUniversal, and Amazon are pivoting harder to streaming video as viewers and ad dollars flock there.Content creators and entrepreneurs are seizing on the rise of new platforms, changing how people shop and are entertained.Before the coronavirus, the ad industry was forecasting a blockbuster 2020 with the Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the US presidential election. Instead, the pandemic and associated economic downfall have led advertisers to slash spending, resulting in widespread layoffs at ad agencies and media companies. The pandemic has also caused brands to speed up investments in areas that have grown during the pandemic, like e-commerce and digital products.\"In the previous landscape, those things were very long-term initiatives, but they have taken on a new relevance,\" Jay Pattisall, an analyst at Forrester Research, said. \"[Advertisers] are taking displaced marketing budgets and funneling them into these projects.\" Holding media and tech brands accountable Ryan Mayward, sales director at Amazon Advertising, is helping challenge Google and Facebook's dominance of digital advertising. As Google phases out the cookies that advertisers have long relied on to zap ads at people, Justin Schuh, engineering director for Chrome at Google, is building privacy controls into the Chrome browser that in theory don't kill advertisers' ability to target and measure ads while maintaining users' privacy. His work is part of Privacy Sandbox, a Google initiative to develop privacy-friendly standards for online advertising.\"With Privacy Sandbox, we are working with the web community to develop new standards that build privacy into the core architecture of the web, while continuing to support free access to content,\" Schuh said.Rashad Robinson, executive director of civil-rights group Color of Change, helped organize a massive boycott that led brands like Unilever and Starbucks to pull campaigns from Facebook over concerns about how Facebook handles misinformation.Eight-year-old YouTuber Ryan Kaji is turning his social-media following into a full-blown business that includes selling branded products and TV show roles on Nickelodeon and Roku.Scott Stuber, Netflix's VP of original films, Hulu president Kelly Campbell, and director Jordan Peele are building new content and business models based on streaming. Spotify's Dawn Ostroff is positioning the music-streaming giant as a large podcasting player, signing high-profile deals with talent such as Michelle Obama and Joe Rogan.Others are changing the way we buy online and highlight the shift to e-commerce that was accelerated by the pandemic. Entrepreneur Moiz Ali sidestepped traditional distribution channels and built a direct-to-consumer deodorant brand through Facebook and YouTube before selling it to Procter &amp;#38; Gamble. And Instagram's VP of product Vishal Shah is changing e-commerce by building shopping features into the app.The full list of transformers reveals more about how these outsiders, upstarts, and entrepreneurs are changing the nature of shopping, advertising, and entertainment.

Some expect the agency and Chairman Ajit Pai to seek to avoid headline-grabbing rulemakings that create ammunition for President Donald Trump's opponents. Others expect Pai to push his agenda to get policies approved while Republican control of the agency is certain.</p><p>Former acting Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn said Pai has accomplished his most controversial goals and will aim for bipartisan policies: \"There isn't a chair on the planet who doesn't care about his legacy.\" Others said the election will have little effect on the pace of rulemaking. FCC policies are generally too technical and obscure to matter in a presidential race, said former Clyburn aide and current chairman of Business in the Public Interest Adonis Hoffman. \"Much of what the FCC does is mundane and arcane.\"</p><p>Congress is considered less likely to act on controversial matters in a presidential election, and the same caution can apply to federal agencies. The summer immediately before the election is considered a point after which the current FCC is unlikely to take much substantive action, said Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker. Approaching voting is a reason the agency is unlikely to make changes to the broadcast national ownership cap, Ryvicker said. One broadcaster said the slowdown wouldn't happen until the election is decided, as was the case with the \"pencil's down\" request from legislators to then-Chairman Tom Wheeler in 2016 (see 1611160020).</p><p>Some expect the agency to continue and even ramp up policymaking while its current leadership remains. Just before Pai moved up to chairman in 2017, the Media Bureau rejected an appeal from noncommercial educational stations of rules on FCC registration numbers over the then-commissioner's objections, Gray Miller broadcast attorney Todd Gray said (see 1701040069). Pai's FCC reversed the move soon after.</p><p>Since Pai's opportunities to get his agenda passed would be limited if there's a leadership change, it makes sense for him to strike while the iron is hot, one ex-official said.</p><p>Satellite lawyer Stephanie Roy of Perkins Coie said Pai isn't likely to moderate his major priorities heading into the 2020 election. She said the idea of waiting out the end of a term for a potential incoming administration \"is reflective of a bygone era.\" The FCC didn't comment.</p><p>Independent FCC</p><p>As an independent agency, the FCC is unlikely to actively seek to avoid controversy, and a lot of its work is nonpartisan in any case, said Satellite Industry Association President Tom Stroup. Without a particularly polarizing issue like net neutrality being teed up, there's no reason to anticipate a slowdown or acceleration tied to the election, he said.</p><p>Most of the FCC's items are unlikely to become stump speech talking points, most agree. Outside of big issues such as net neutrality and large deals, the agency rarely attracts wide attention, said Georgetown Law Institute for Public Representation staff attorney Lindsey Barrett. However, while the FCC used to labor in obscurity, that's becoming less true, said former Commissioner Gloria Tristani. \"When I was there, most of the issues were under the radar\" of the public, Tristani said. FCC matters are becoming more visible to most Americans, she said.</p><p>\"Self-styled 'consumer advocates' whose eyesight fails immediately outside the Beltway have been arguing for at least a decade that what the FCC does or doesn't do matters in elections,\" emailed Larry Downes, public policy project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy. \"But just saying so, and raising money on that basis, doesn't make it so. There isn't a shred of evidence that anything that happens at the agency has had any effect on outcomes, even if they register for some voters. That's the whole point of having independent regulatory agencies. Their decision-making is supposed to be based on the boring arcana of changing technical and business realities.\"</p><p>Taxpayers Protection Alliance President David Williams said Pai is unlikely to slow down as the election nears. \"Pai has been so aggressive since he has taken over the chairmanship -- look at net neutrality,\" he said: Pai \"was not shy about doing what he did.\"</p><p>Cable, Media</p><p>One thing the agency is deemed likely to avoid in the weeks before the election is media ownership rules because of the issue's potential volatility.</p><p>Former Commissioner Robert McDowell, now at Cooley, said there's still emphasis on avoiding contentious items that could fall along party lines in the run-up to elections and the agency in the second half of 2020 likely will work on items that are more unanimous or bipartisan. He said media ownership likely will be dealt with before mid-2020. Companies considering combining also should try to announce in plenty of time for the 180-day shot clock to expire before then, McDowell said. He said bipartisan issues such as spectrum allocations and auctions will be probable items for the agency to tackle in the second half. But ultimately, undecided voters in a presidential election aren't going to decide based on some FCC action, he said. \"Title II might be an exception.\"</p><p>Pay-TV issues aren't likely to be an issue in 2020 unless some huge media deal, perhaps involving a big tech company, emerges and is seen as a consumer-related issue that generates concerns about big media consolidation, said a lawyer with cable industry clients. One possible wild card is if the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act reauthorization has a rulemaking or report to Congress teed up in the summer or fall of 2020, he said.</p><p>As \"productive as the agency has been under ... Pai's leadership, it would be difficult to accelerate it,\" said Tech Knowledge Director Fred Campbell.</p><p>Broadband, 5G</p><p>Experts cited rural broadband as a likely focus of FCC action because it has support on both sides. Increasing rural broadband would be \"a feather in Trump's cap\" rather than creating negative attention, said retired broadcast attorney Frank Jazzo. If any new controversial policy emerges, Clyburn said, the pressure likely would come from the House, the Senate or the executive branch. \"We don't live in a vacuum.\" The commission isn't \"insulated from campaigns or elections,\" said Hoffman. \"Everyone understands that an election can change the balance and orientation of the commission.\"</p><p>Fifth-generation wireless also looms large. Campbell doesn't \"expect the pace on 5G matters to slow down.\"</p><p>Clyburn expects Pai to focus on more-neutral policy as the 2020 election approaches, and the more unanimous the decisions he can oversee, the better. Pai \"took on the big things early,\" so he has room to aim for more bipartisan items now, Clyburn said. Citing net neutrality and the Lifeline national verifier program (see 1907080009): \"The big partisan things have been taken off the table.\"</p><p>Clyburn predicted Pai will first finish what's undone on his own agenda: \"That's legacy building.\" Second, she said, he will address whatever his potential outside influencers put before him, whether from industry, the House, the Senate or the White House. Clyburn predicted Pai will make every effort to clean up the dockets important to him, especially if the election outcome appears close: \"You've got to look at the life cycle of a chair.\"</p><p>The FCC \"will keep up its high output through the election, but I doubt the agency's actions will make many headlines,\" said Brent Skorup of the Mercatus Center: The FCC's \"important work on things like speeding up broadband deployment, cleaning up legacy regulations, and freeing up spectrum aren't really partisan and therefore flies beneath voters' radar.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ8-2411-DYRJ-031V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1303\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 09, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Or, in this case, between unbridled economic markets and a new more-regulated framework for capitalism.</p><p>More than her rivals, Warren has been outspoken and detailed about the need to break up any number of big companies that she claims are monopolies. Her candidacy is a challenge to the economic system, known as neoliberalism, that bred many of the ills that beset us today. Neoliberalism is an economic model that lowers trade barriers, deregulates capital markets and allows money to flow wherever it will - usually to where labor is cheapest. Over the past generation, both parties have given neoliberalism their support.</p><p>In fact, the system has underpinned the past 40 years or so of globalization. To be fair, it has lifted billions of people out of poverty, particularly overseas, mainly by opening global trade. As emerging markets have joined in the free-market system, a new global middle class has been born, and at a global level, inequality has decreased.</p><p>But it's also allowed for huge inequalities within individual countries and created bigger and more damaging financial crises around the world. What happens in one economy affects what happens in another thousands of miles away. When capital can flow in and out of countries at will, financial speculation can imperil economies half a world away.</p><p>The two biggest beneficiaries of globalization since 2000 have been, research shows, China and big companies. China benefited from the inflow of global capital looking for cheap labor. This contributed to growth and rising wages there, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which suffered by comparison in many other countries. (As a state-run system, China could manage some of the downsides of globalization more easily, ring-fencing strategic sectors or limiting capital inflows when necessary.)</p><p>The other winners are big companies that, thanks to their global footprints, are able to fly miles over the problems - and the laws - of any particular nation. They can move jobs, capital and profits wherever they like, which allows them to leverage all the benefits of the current system, without dealing with the downsides - in the form of growing inequality, skill shortages or rising populism - with which nations themselves have to wrestle.</p><p>Tech companies have enjoyed this neoliberal benefit - only on steroids. If capital can flow more easily across borders than either labor or goods, data - which is Big Tech's real currency - is like quicksilver: It moves even more freely.  According to McKinsey Global Institute figures, about 80 percent of all corporate wealth is now living in 10 percent of companies, which are richest in data and intellectual property. Those assets can be located anywhere - which is why tech firms typically pay even less in taxes as a percentage of revenue than other types of multinational companies.</p><p>It's no surprise that public trust in the elites who run such firms is at record lows. The anti-elite sentiment was a powerful driver in producing the phenomenon of Trump and remains potent, in the United States and overseas. And yet the tech giants seem oblivious to this fact. That's partly because they came of age when the private sector was ascendant, when greed was good and when government showed little interest in regulation. Which might help explain why so many tech companies' PR is tin-eared: They simply don't remember a time when things were any different or have any idea of why they should be.</p><p>Warren is a logical tribune for this moment. She may have worked as a bankruptcy lawyer, but at heart, she's an economic nationalist. Her policies would empower the public sector to redistribute some of the wealth hoarded by multinational companies in recent years to a broader group of stakeholders - labor, yes, but also small and midsize businesses and local communities. A Warren administration would likely push to in-source some supply chains and connect the dots between educators and job creators with new vocational programs. Her health-care plan, which might be a step too far for many Americans, at least has the intellectual coherency of her convictions - it's a top-down, nationalized approach designed to give the entire population basic coverage.</p><p>Warren is not the only politician espousing a more-regulated capitalist system, one that would owe a lot, ironically, to what unfolded in the United States in the 1960s: a consciously regulated economy at the federal level. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has made similar-sounding suggestions, a sign that Republicans will try to go back to the future, too, whenever Trump departs the stage.</p><p>Over time, all manner of companies might be reined in - and in particularly the supranational tech firms that represent the apex of the old, neoliberal order.

How do customers feel about their world of convenience? By some measures, they're less happy than they were 20 years ago. Human beings are social animals driven to make decisions based on their need for affiliation and the wider impact of their choices.</p><p>Today's customers live in tumultuous times. Disinformation campaigns, social isolation, wealth inequality, climate change, and political unrest surround them. As a result, they want to align their purchases with their values. Consumers appreciate experiences that spark delight. They love experiences that spark hope. This is not a new phenomenon but a trend that has slowly climbed from niche to mainstream.</p><p>In 2017, 52% of consumers said they actively consider company values when making a purchase. That number continues to grow. While lower-income earners may not be able to buy in accordance with their values, the desire for values alignment is steady across income brackets.</p><p>In 2020, executives will attempt to give customers what they crave. The results will be mixed. Some companies will provoke ire by making surface-level commitments. Others will misjudge how to best express values. Companies that do succeed will co-create values-driven experiences with customers and employees. They'll pay careful attention to authenticity, both in the values they choose to express and how they express them.</p><p>CMOs rally around customer value : Major brands including Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson, Walmart, Netflix, and Kellogg's have eliminated the CMO role. But make no mistake: Marketing isn't going the way of the dinosaur. Its status quo has been fundamentally disrupted by the dynamics of the age of the customer. Customers are empowered. Brand has been atomized across numerous channels, many of which are beyond a company's scope of control. The result is a radical shift in how companies establish brand, build affinity, and generate loyalty.</p><p>In 2020, the top CMOs will be responsible for all that surrounds the customer. They'll recognize that the best mechanism to drive growth is a strategically planned ecosystem that delivers value to customers throughout their lifecycle. To establish a successful ecosystem, CMOs will thread the needle between employee experience, customer experience, brand purpose, creative, and technology, imbuing all these crucial areas with customer obsession.</p><p>Smart CMOs will begin pulling back on strategies that drive short-term gains at the expense of customer affinity, including dark patterns - design patterns that manipulate customers against their own interests. Meanwhile, spend will flow back into creative as the importance of differentiated branding becomes apparent in a world of digital sameness.</p><p>CIOs focus on people : 2020 will be the year of people management for CIOs. The uncertainty of the forthcoming year will frame CIOs' transformation agendas - but not only for the expected cost-cutting and efficiency angles. Leading CIOs will take this as an opportunity to step forward as business leaders, showcasing their tech-driven innovation, ecosystem-building skills, and people management.</p><p>The ongoing volatility and slowing growth in 2020 will still put pressure on CIOs to control costs and improve efficiency. CIOs will look within their own organization for those efficiency gains, automating 10% of their IT tasks that are highly standardized and repetitive. We do not expect layoffs, however, as Forrester Analytics data shows that IT staffing forecasts for 2020 will remain relatively flat. Instead, CIOs will train their teams for more complex tasks as part of agile DevOps teams.</p><p>Beyond the IT department, smart CIOs will become a trusted advisor and partner to employee experience and HR teams to help with changing workforce dynamics, including working with new emerging technologies or interacting with robots.</p><p>These CIOs will bring workforce analytics capabilities to help their firms better predict changes and rationalize the portfolio of HR technologies. And they will actively work to ready their firms for automation (and all of the technologies the term encapsulates) - using tools and frameworks such as Forrester's robotics quotient and automation framework - to minimize growing pains and truly unlock the power of their digital transformation.</p><p>Immersive, adaptive IT takes hold : Technology-driven innovation - the ability to deliver new business results through opportunities discovered by continuously experimenting with technology, both emerging and established - will soon be table stakes for leading organizations. Tech-driven innovation magnifies the importance of technology (and, thus, IT). But, it requires companies to operate and organize differently.</p><p>IT will follow the broader organizational future of matrixed, shape-shifting organizations that form and morph to changing priorities. This goes beyond DevOps. The boundaries between what is IT and what is the business are already fading to reveal a much more powerful and fluid IT capability. This more embedded, connected, and adaptive IT approach will gain momentum in 2020 - particularly as firms address the opportunity and challenges of emerging technologies.</p><p>One such challenge is islands of automation. Eighty percent of enterprises will recognize the threat of automation islands and determine that they are no longer sustainable. Firms already have multiple robotic process automation (RPA) tools, conversational intelligence platforms, and machine-learning projects. To address this, firms will set up automation strike teams that sit between traditional IT and domain experts and have unique roles such as robot architects and automation jump-starters.</p><p>CX continues to bifurcate : In 2020, customer experience professionals will either quantify their business impact and reach new levels of influence, or find themselves in a tenuous position. In response to market turmoil, CEOs will demand that CX initiatives move out of the experimental phase and prove their contributions to top- and/or bottom-line growth. Measurement, metrics, and analytics will become critical to the success of CX initiatives. The sheer complexity of CX has proved daunting, even as CX's importance grows increasingly apparent. Firms that have made the least headway will cut their programs in frustration.</p><p>Meanwhile, companies that have started realizing the benefits of CX will double down, simultaneously shoring up their fundamentals and innovating. As a result, a company's CX headcount will radically shift up or down. We predict that one in four CX professionals will lose their job. Paradoxically, the number of CX executives will grow by 25%.</p><p>The result will be extreme bifurcation of CX. Leaders will keep getting better, raising the bar not only in their industry but across the board as customers get a taste of what's possible. We expect innovative, customer-delighting experiences to come to market that combine technology, creativity, and deep customer understanding.</p><p>Companies that cut their programs will see a drop in experience quality, especially as remaining CX pros turn to desperate and ill-advised measures to drive short-term growth (such as manipulating customers with dark patterns). Instead of saving money, these cuts could yield unintended, detrimental consequences as customers bestow their loyalties elsewhere.</p><p>Data strategy unlocks transformations : While interest in big data has waned over the last couple years, enterprise data strategy continues to be a top initiative for executives. It's critical in unlocking a firm's digital transformation - and necessary to take advantage of AI and machine learning. 2020 will be a wake-up year for many firms, as the total cost of getting data wrong will become apparent.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, getting data right is a multifaceted exercise - from technology investments to talent recruitment and management, governance, and process re-engineering. In 2020, we'll see a top-down mandate to break down the data logjam, wherein the amount of time needed to prep data for AI and machine learning is so great that it's ultimately not worth the effort. Data literacy, too, will be a priority, with 40% of firms launching data literacy programs for everyone in the organization.</p><p>Firms will also attempt to access differentiating and external data, which may prove difficult as enterprises clamp down on data sharing due to privacy and ecosystem concerns.</p><p>Enterprises looking to push more into the cloud and exploit edge computing are also staring at a new reality where the transactional cost of data processing and movement will outstrip storage. Advanced firms will understand the benefits of getting all of this right and will double or triple their data strategy budget to soar past competitors.</p><p>Data and AI get weaponized : Today's innovations and technologies provide tremendous opportunities for enterprises, promising accelerated growth, entrance into adjacent markets, or the creation of new ones. But three troublesome dynamics are converging in 2020 and will persist beyond:</p><p>1. The importance of data and the power of being an insights-driven enterprise are increasing the damage factor of data breaches.</p><p>2. The adoption of emerging technologies like the internet of things is creating a larger attack surface that's often built with only a few security controls, exposing enterprises in never-before-seen ways.</p><p>3. The unfortunate reality will come to light that evil forces can adopt technologies such as AI and machine learning faster than security leaders can.</p><p>Simply put, there are more attackers with more sophisticated tools aimed at a larger attack surface. And those attackers want enterprises to pay.</p><p>In 2020, ransomware incidents will grow as attackers learn that holding data hostage is a quick path to monetization. Increasingly savvy, these attackers will target consumer devices (and consumers) to the detriment of device manufacturers - demanding ransom from the manufacturer after notifying its affected customers that it's up to the manufacturer to \"fix this issue.\"</p><p>But wait, that's not all! Attackers will use AI and machine learning to enhance existing attacks using the tremendous amounts of data now available to them. AI technologies like natural language generation and video AI will be used to generate fake audio and video designed to fool users; as a result, deepfakes alone will cost businesses over a quarter of a billion dollars.</p><p>Privacy concerns gain steam : 2020 will be a bad year for third-party data and a good year for marketers who take consumer privacy seriously. Consumers are deeply concerned with how their data is collected and used. A barrage of news about data breaches, government surveillance, and corporate misconduct has soured consumer sentiment on current data practices.</p><p>The backlash has begun, and more people are taking active measures to protect their privacy. Forrester predicts that privacy class-action lawsuits will increase by 300%. Big tech firms such as Apple and Mozilla are providing consumers with new tools that shut out data collection.</p><p>Anti-surveillance startups will receive funding. New regulations will be handed down. Regardless of whether it happens via tech, sentiment, lawsuit, or regulation, the result will be the same: Marketers will no longer be able to rely on aggregated third-party data to target consumers. In 2020, we predict that some marketers will get ahead of the curve by curbing their reliance on third-party data.</p><p>Marketers will move away from laborious, and often unwanted, personalization efforts. Instead, they'll seek to authentically connect with customers through targeted experiences. Organizations will shift 10% of their budget to influencer marketing. Values strategies will become more prevalent, and five Fortune 500 brands will seek B-Corp certification.</p><p>Automation reshapes the workforce : 2020 marks a significant year for the future of employment. Automation will change the composition of the job market and raise global economic issues of income distribution and wage stagnation. Automation will replace, on net, 1.06 million jobs from cubicle, coordinator, and function-specific knowledge worker personas in 2020. By contrast, work personas that require intuition, empathy, and physical and mental agility, including cross-domain knowledge workers, teachers/explainers, and digital elites, will add 331,500 net jobs in 2020.</p><p>Beyond the numbers, automation's impact on the workforce is both expected and unexpected. Take customer service - Forrester's Customer Experience Index (CX Index) reveals that customer service is the most important driver category of customer experience quality across most industries and markets. We repeat: Human channels still matter.</p><p>While contact centers will reduce their quality assurance staff by 40% due to automation, \"agent whisperer\" technologies will be leveraged to help customer service reps find task-critical information and enhance the customer experience. This will require an upleveling of skills. In the end, there will be fewer call center employees, but those who remain will have to be higher-skilled and higher-paid.</p><p>Folding automation into the enterprise will not be without backlash : Unsurprisingly, employees are wary of automation. Very few firms have invested in prepping employees for the future of work - what it means to be working with, alongside, and potentially for automation. We expect a major strike will cause a PR nightmare for at least one Fortune 500 company.</p><p>Regulation makes and breaks markets : If you thought that we've seen the aftermath of regulations such as GDPR and the CCPA, think again. Regulatory bodies will gain steam - impacting and shaping markets, in a very real way, in 2020. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has already issued a report stating that current real-time bidding (RTB) processes in programmatic advertising miss the mark on three major GDPR requirements: consent, transparency, and data leakage.</p><p>Layer on the CCPA - which requires that organizations protect personal data such as IP address and device data and share the data only with third parties with whom they've contracted - and the whole RTB process is effectively a data breach. Adtech vendors will be forced to use anonymized or aggregated data in their solutions, upending digital advertising as we know it today. Along the same lines, GDPR is forcing B2B enterprises to do a forensic examination of their supply chains and ecosystems.</p><p>Companies that use enterprise customer data to improve the experiences of B2B clients of their products and services will see organizations choosing to opt out of data sharing due to concerns about anonymization, privacy, and accidental disclosure. In fact, 20% of enterprise customers will prohibit the use of their data for AI in 2020. Regulators such as the UK's ICO and the Federal Trade Commission will also take action against firms using dark patterns. These dark patterns will earn several brands fines, remediation, and bad press.</p><p>The need for compliance will spur investment in regulatory tech (regtech). In the first three quarters of 2019, regtech scored $4.6 billion in funding at a year-over-year growth rate of 103% - with no signs of slowing down.</p><p>For VCs, profitability becomes the new unicorn: In 2020, venture capitalists (VCs) will increase their scrutiny of startups. Expect downward pressure on deal sizes as investors seek out the new hottest thing in Silicon Valley: profitability. It used to be every investor's dream to get in on the ground floor of a company poised to become a unicorn (i.e., a privately held company with a valuation in excess of $1 billion), so VCs flocked to companies with big dreams and charismatic leaders.</p><p>But now, VCs are feeling the pain from a tumultuous 2019 marked by high-profile scandals and disappointing IPOs. As a result, investors are growing weary of razzle-dazzle and disruptor lingo. This doesn't mean the bottom is falling out of the startup market - far from it. Instead, VC money will flow toward startups with pragmatic business plans and clearer paths to profitability. These companies are poised to become the new unicorns.</p><p>Overall VC funding will plateau, but not every market will fall flat . The blockchain bubble will burst, an early victim of the mindset shift in Silicon Valley. Despite high levels of investment, the world of blockchain (and especially cryptocurrency) remains highly speculative, with scalable business-ready solutions few and far between.</p><p>AI funding will start to cool as the market saturates and as exuberance gives way to a push for results. Meanwhile, the inherently pragmatic regulatory technology category will see its funding double yet again.</p><p>- Sharyn Leaver, SVP, Research, Forrester.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Data Quest.

People will spend money, eat food, watch (and play) sports, use phone apps and play video games, and countries around the world will engage in diplomacy - and conflict. The details of all those things, as always, will be what make the year interesting. To get a jump on the future, we asked Washington Post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big stories, themes and questions that we'll look back on in December. Here is the Year in Preview. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">tv by Steven Zeitchik</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New big streaming services will mean new big hits (and new big bills)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The last few months of 2019 were filled with streaming news. Buckets of it. From the nonstop marketing of Jennifer Aniston in Apple TV Plus's \"The Morning Show\" to that ubiquitous Baby Yoda from Disney Plus's \"The Mandalorian,\" it seemed like the spigot might never turn off.</p><p>And it won't, not anytime soon. This will be a year of new digital programming - and new services to deliver it.</p><p>Just two weeks into 2020, Comcast will unveil more details about Peacock, its new service with content from across NBC Universal properties, set to launch several months later. The spring will also bring HBO Max, the prestige-branded service with all manner of TV shows and movies from the WarnerMedia empire. Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, both of which launched in November, will add more content throughout the year, too - as will Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).</p><p>Viewers will have an ever-wider choice of fresh programming. Want new seasons of fan favorites \"Search Party\" and \"The Boondocks\"? They'll be on HBO Max. It's the final episodes of \"BoJack Horseman\" you crave? Where else but Netflix. Looking for \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" to give you a fix between Marvel movies? Disney Plus has you covered.</p><p>Finding out when new episodes premiere, let alone whether they are worth watching, will be a task far more complicated than your Twitter feed can keep up with.</p><p>All these services know they need to offer some reliable hits to complement the new stuff. That means many popular sitcoms are migrating from Netflix. \"The Office\" is headed to Peacock; \"Friends\" to HBO Max.</p><p>And it will all be expensive. Turns out spending sacks of cash on new shows and movies - Netflix alone is expected to shell out in excess of $15 billion in 2020 - isn't easy without ad revenue. Services have to charge, whether that's the $5 a month for Apple TV Plus or the $15 for HBO Max. For consumers, that means piling on to a monthly entertainment bill or making tough choices about what to forgo.</p><p>But don't get too despondent. If some of the recent sitcoms you seek are too unwieldy or costly to find on streaming services, there's a suddenly appealing option: traditional television. Many shows, after all, will continue to air in syndication. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">breXit by karla adam</emphasis></p><p>Britain will leave Europe. And then the negotiations will continue.</p><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh off an election victory, has vowed to \"get Brexit done.\" Brexit will probably not be \"done\" in 2020, but it will - finally - get started.</p><p>In January, 312 years after voting narrowly in favor of Brexit, Britain will officially split from the European Union. Expect a big party and fireworks, but don't expect a big rupture in relations between London and Brussels. The status quo will largely continue as the country enters an 11-month transition period, during which Britain will attempt to negotiate a trade deal with the E.U., its largest trading partner, as well as come to agreements on issues including security and law enforcement. Analysts think this is a crazy tight timetable, especially if Johnson wants to diverge substantially from E.U. rules. If a deal isn't completed by the end of the year, it's possible Johnson could break his pledge and seek to extend the transition period. Alternatively, Britain could crash out of the E.U. without a trade pact, reviving anxieties about an abrupt, chaotic and economically damaging \"no-deal\" Brexit.</p><p>One reason it's tricky to predict how Johnson will tack in the upcoming negotiations - does Britain stay closely aligned with the E.U.? Or does it tilt toward less regulation, in the spirit of Margaret Thatcher? - is that the prime minister is hard to pin down politically.</p><p>But he could be tempted to keep Britain more in lockstep with the E.U., not least because his whopping majority means he won't be beholden to Euroskeptics in his party anymore. Plus, closer alignment could help with his political problems in Scotland and Northern Ireland: As the reality of Brexit sinks in, nationalist movements could gain momentum outside England, and a closer relationship with the E.U. could help head off those threats.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOOd by laura reiley</emphasis></p><p>You will soon taste meat grown in a lab, not on a farm</p><p>Plant-based meat was so 2019. Big Beef st(e)aked out territory, demanding legislation that put this interloper on the defensive, mostly in anticipation of what will surely be the food world's biggest game changer in the year to come: Cell-cultured meat, poultry and seafood products derived from muscle tissue grown in a lab with cells harvested from a living animal.</p><p>It is unclear which U.S. company will be first to market - chicken and duck from Memphis Meats in Berkeley, Calif., with investors such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Tyson Foods; Wagyu beef or chicken nuggets from Just (formerly Hampton Creek), whose investors include Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund; or bluefin tuna from Finless Foods - but Barclays analysts say \"alt meat\" could in the next decade capture 10 percent of the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.</p><p>Much of it hinges on rates of adoption. The numbers of vegans and vegetarians aren't growing much. These new products are geared toward omnivores and \"flexitarians,\" but as with genetically modified organisms more than a decade ago, some consumers distrust food that has been tinkered with in a laboratory.</p><p>As it happens, that will also be an issue with another trend this coming year: grocery store foods that are gene-edited with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Romaine and white potatoes that don't brown or bruise, and a gene-edited farmed tilapia that grows quickly, are among the foods improved via tiny DNA snips, essentially accelerating the selection of desirable traits that Gregor Mendel achieved via crossbreeding his peas. Whether consumers will embrace these new foods is unknown. For now, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed overseeing gene-edited animals as drugs, something the meat industry thinks will disadvantage American producers. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ruSSia by Will englund</emphasis></p><p>Putin will press his advantage in the Middle East</p><p>If Russian President Vladimir Putin suspects that President Trump has been irretrievably weakened or distracted - and especially if he thinks Trump will be replaced by a more mainstream alternative - expect him to redouble his efforts to secure a deeper Russian role in the Middle East while he still has a chance.</p><p>Russia has been on a roll in the region, with a winning military intervention in Syria; a strengthening of diplomatic and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel; a mercenary involvement in Libya; and a toe in the waters of the western Mediterranean through joint naval exercises with Algeria. But Moscow's gains have come through craft, stealth and a large measure of luck, rather than through major-power prowess, and the challenge will be to sustain and build on those achievements.</p><p>Potential pitfalls abound. Putin has forged a generally useful working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he may have to start fresh in a post-Netanyahu era, depending on Israel's third round of elections in March. Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been receptive to Russian dealmaking, but neither is a client state of Moscow by any measure. And the real key to Russia's Middle Eastern success almost certainly depends on its longtime ally Iran, now shaken by violent protests.</p><p>In Syria, the Russian military effort has come with little cost and less pain. The real fighting on the ground on behalf of the government of Bashar al-Assad has been carried out by Iran and its Hezbollah allies. But anti-Hezbollah unrest in Lebanon, anti-Iran unrest in Iraq and upheaval on the streets of Iran itself could significantly alter the calculation.</p><p>If Iran stumbles, would Putin be forced to bail out Assad, at the risk of getting ensnared in Syria and sparking disquiet at home? Could he continue to avoid a confrontation with Turkey? Would the Saudis be as friendly with Moscow if they thought Iran was distracted by its own troubles? Will the mood shift unpredictably in Washington?</p><p>In 2019, Russia demonstrated its agility in the Middle East. The real test may still lie ahead. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">teCh by tony romm</emphasis></p><p>Washington will try to lock down Silicon Valley</p><p>Very few things unite President Trump and the Democrats vying to take his place in the White House, but both are readying for battle against Big Tech.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook, Google and their Silicon Valley peers could face the first major consequences in the coming year from investigations by state and federal regulators into whether they undermine privacy, mishandle sensitive online content, damage elections or quash competition.</p><p>Amazon is in the crosshairs for the tactics it's used to dominate e-commerce, Facebook for the way it gobbles up users' data (and its corporate rivals) and Google for its dominance of the online ad business. Attorney General William P. Barr has said the Justice Department plans to wrap up its wideranging look at search, social media and online shopping in 2020. That could result in calls for new regulations and potentially punishments - the most extreme being an attempt to break up one or more companies.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee spent 2019 demanding internal documents from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. In 2020, it's expected to issue a report on whether the industry has, in effect, subverted federal antitrust protections. And if Trump loses the White House, the pressure will mount: Democratic contenders, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have promised to unwind some of the mergers that helped the giants become so big in the first place, such as Facebook's purchases of the photosharing app Instagram and the messaging platform WhatsApp.</p><p>Internet companies spent $55 million over the first nine months of this year to lobby Washington, and they'll throw more political weight around as the threat grows. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg hinted about a fierce counteroffensive in a talk with employees last summer. \"At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,\" he said. That fight is about to intensify. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the eConomy by heather long</emphasis></p><p>A fragile boom keeps going and going</p><p>Although risks remain, the U.S. economy appears unlikely to fall into a recession in 2020. Another year of decent growth will probably make it easier for even more Americans to find jobs - and boost President Trump's chances of reelection. And the trade wars that dominated economic discussion in 2019 seem to be over, at least for now.</p><p>Growth is expected to be 1.8 percent next year, according to a closely watched survey of economists. That's far from the boom that Trump promised and slower than this year's pace of about 2.2 percent and last year's rate of 2.9 percent - but the president and the Federal Reserve may have it in their power to nudge the figure upward.</p><p>Trump just reached trade agreements with China, Canada and Mexico. The deals are more modest than what he vowed he could achieve, but they signal that he is hitting pause on his trade battles, a welcome relief for Wall Street investors and many business leaders. Although consumers continue to spend at a healthy clip, companies had dramatically scaled back purchases this year because of the trade uncertainty. If Trump keeps the peace on trade, business spending could resume.</p><p>Economists and investors also expect the Fed to lower rates at least once more in 2020, providing another boost. Three rate cuts by the Fed in 2019 were a major reason the stock market hit record highs and recession fears abated.</p><p>Although unemployment is at a 50-year low, the position of the middle class remains precarious. Jobs that pay middle-income wages are increasingly going away, replaced by positions paying over $100,000 or under $30,000. That socially destabilizing phenomenon will be a focus of the presidential race.</p><p>Economists, meanwhile, are also keeping a vigilant eye on robots - because firms typically accelerate the automation of jobs done by temporary and lowskilled workers in the months leading up to a significant downturn.</p><p>But the general expectation is that the longest expansion in U.S. history, which began in mid-2009, will last at least one more year.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">hollywood by elahe izadi</emphasis></p><p>No one will stay canceled for good</p><p>We have had a full year of hand-wringing over \"cancel culture,\" particularly as it relates to comedians. Shane Gillis, for example, hired and then fired by \"Saturday Night Live\" for racist language on podcasts, was denounced on social media by celebrities - and also defended by famous comedians.</p><p>But 2020 may be the year when we learn that no one is canceled forever.</p><p>The controversies will continue, yes. The societywide reckoning with sexual harassment and assault will not abate. There will be more denounced jokes; comedy, more than most art forms, ages terribly. Norms and tastes rapidly evolve. More performers will come under fire for past or recent statements, jokes, offstage behavior or allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>\"Getting canceled,\" though, means suffering professional and personal consequences, not being permanently silenced.</p><p>Look at Aziz Ansari, who was embroiled in controversy in 2018 after Babe.net published an anonymous accusation of sexual impropriety (Ansari said that the interaction \"by all indications was completely consensual\"). He retreated from the limelight for a while, but then he returned to standup, doing small shows to work out material before hitting the road to perform in packed theaters. He even addressed the allegation in an acclaimed Netflix special.</p><p>Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct after the New York Times published allegations from five women, lost his manager, publicist and all of the cultural cachet he had built up in his career. But he had a massive email list pre-scandal, and he can still promote himself to his die-hard fans, the ones most likely to have remained as subscribers. C.K. is still performing, and as he announced to his list, he has several club and theater gigs in the United States and abroad in 2020.</p><p>Even Bill Cosby, convicted of assault, has found an audience - albeit behind bars - eager to listen to him opine.</p><p>Corporate entities putting together TV shows and movies will remain skittish about backing performers accused of problematic behavior, or ones criticized for offensive material. But there will still be audiences willing to watch. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">world by ishaan Tharoor</emphasis></p><p>Protests won't stop. Neither will government crackdowns.</p><p>The motives of the millions who took to the streets in Santiago, La Paz, Algiers and Basra were as varied as their geography. But the demonstrators were united in what has become an epochal display of global discontent, an explosion of popular unrest that capped a decade of angst and anger. When they weren't clamoring for greater freedoms and democracy, protesters were marching against corruption, inequality and state brutality. In their wake, presidents fled, prime ministers resigned and governments fell.</p><p>And the movements that flared in 2019 aren't about to peter out.</p><p>Across Latin America, a creaking social contract seems on the verge of collapse: In Chile, widely viewed as one of South America's most stable societies, weeks of protests against austerity measures compelled the center-right president to shuffle his cabinet and announce reforms. But protesters remain on the streets, demanding a wholesale remaking of the socioeconomic order. Demonstrators in Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina and Haiti echoed the call for economic justice. An uprising in Bolivia chased out a long-ruling leftist president, while autocrats in Venezuela and Nicaragua cling to power despite popular challenges. More polarization, paralysis and violence may follow.</p><p>That's all the more on view in the Arab world, where a stunning wave of protests unseated leaders in Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon and Iraq. But an entrenched and often corrupt old guard is desperately trying to stay in control. In Iraq, security forces and pro-Iran militias have killed about 500 people and are preparing for a deeper crackdown.</p><p>Iran hasn't been spared, either. In November, authorities cut off Internet access and killed potentially hundreds to quash protests that erupted after a rise in fuel prices. As Iran's theocratic regime enters its fifth decade, a tanking economy and widespread public anger over political elites' mismanagement and corruption only add to the sense of a brewing existential crisis.</p><p>In Hong Kong, a sustained pro-democracy movement remains grimly determined, defying the authoritarian leadership in Beijing and its local proxies. China has no intention of acceding to protesters' demands, though, and 2020 could mark a bloody tipping point for Asia's financial capital.</p><p>President Trump, known more for his coziness with autocrats than commitment to democracy struggles abroad, has been conspicuously silent about most of these displays of people power. But only in a few instances - Hong Kong's American-flag-waving youth come to mind - are any of these movements explicitly calling for U.S. support. The immediacy of social media still allows us to bear witness and hold repressive governments to account. There will be plenty to watch in the year to come.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The whiTe hoUse by Josh dawsey</emphasis></p><p>President Trump knows you don't like him. He doesn't care.</p><p>President Trump has begun admitting what polls have shown for three years: Many, many people hate him. And he's okay with that.</p><p>\"You don't like me. You have no choice but to vote for me,\" he told Wall Street bankers in November. \"You're ... not nice people at all, but you have to vote for me,\" he said to a room of Jewish supporters in December. \"You have no choice ... you're not going to vote for the wealth tax!\"</p><p>It is a rare admission from a politician. But it's key to a campaign strategy built around an awareness that Trump's favorability - even before he was impeached by the House - is near record lows and that he won't stop tweeting, offering bombast and insults, saying things that aren't true, or making polarizing decisions. So Trump's advisers are leaning in.</p><p>\"He's no Mr. Nice Guy,\" said the narrator in a $1 million-plus ad that ran during the World Series, highlighting some of the president's accomplishments while admitting that voters might not like him. \"But sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.\"</p><p>The idea is to talk more about his record and less about his personality - while slashing and burning Democratic opponents. At a briefing with reporters in mid-December, campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Jared Kushner showed data from 2016 indicating that people who said they disapproved of Trump still voted for him. They said many people don't want to publicly admit that they back Trump, but they ultimately will. Their targets are primarily suburban women and independents.</p><p>Essentially, Trump's bet is: If your paycheck is better, and we can make you hate the other candidate, you will vote for the president, even if you find him detestable.</p><p>The-campaign-expects-to-send-surrogates-who-areless-bombastic,-such-as-Ivanka-Trump,-into-areaswhere-suburban-women-might-be-persuaded-to-votefor-him.</p><p>Officials-point-to-statistics-that-cut-in-thepresident's-favor.-For-example,-a-recent-Quinnipiacpoll-showed-that-57-percent-of-voters-nationally-saythey-are-better-off-than-before-Trump's-presidency.-Heregularly-scores-high-marks-on-the-economy,-whichhas-continued-to-improve.</p><p>That-same-poll,-though,-found-Trump-losing-to\u00adBernie-Sanders,-Elizabeth-Warren,-Mike-Bloomberg,\u00ad

And similar predictions have already been made by other influential academics, too. Yuval Noah Harari, in his bestselling book Homo Deus, for example, anticipates that technological developments will lead to humans enhancing themselves with abilities like eternal life.</p><p><br/>But far from portraying an Ex-Machina-esque scenario, in which our AI creations would take over the world and fundamentally change human nature, Lennox warns that the dangers of AI are more imminent.\u00a0<br/>\"If creating an AI that surpasses humans were to happen, of course it would be a threat,\" Lennox tells ZDNet. \"But there are major dangers long before then, and these dangers are actually happening now. I think it is misleading to tell people about the problems that will come in the future - it's what's happening now that demands an ethical and moral response.\" \u00a0\u00a0<br/>Lennox separates the field of AI into two categories: general, and narrow. He describes general artificial intelligence as the attempt to enhance human beings through add-ons, drugs, bio-engineering - and ultimately, to liberate us from our biological bodies, by uploading our minds onto forever-lasting silicon chips.<br/>Narrow artificial intelligence is less glamorous and more real, according to Lennox. It is the technology that already exists in our smartphones, or the program that guides autonomous vehicles, and the code that optimizes Amazon's robotic warehouse pickers. \"It's not intelligence at all,\" says Lennox. \"It is simply a computer doing what it's programmed to do.\"<br/>And yet, Lennox is far more afraid of narrow AI than he is of general AI. Or rather, he is afraid of whose hands narrow AI tools might fall into. He quotes, in his book, C.S. Lewis' 1943 novel The Abolition of Man: \"What we call Man's power over Nature turns out to be a power exercised by some men over other men with Nature as its instrument.\"<br/>In other words, it is not AI itself that will cause trouble, and an apocalyptic take-over of the human species by intelligent robots is not on the cards just yet. An immediate reason to worry, however, has to do with how the technology can be used, and sometimes is already. \"AI is not immoral,\" says Lennox, \"it is amoral. It's what you do with it that can be either moral, immoral, or in some cases, neutral.\"<br/>Lennox takes the often-cited example of facial-recognition technology, and specifically how the tool is used in the Xinjiang province in China, which is home to ten million Uighur people, who are predominantly Muslim. It was recently found that the Chinese government has been tapping facial recognition to implement extensive surveillance of the population, including gate-like scanning systems that record biometric images, as well as smartphone fingerprints - with the goal of keeping track of the Uighur community's movements.<br/>Fingers can equally be pointed to the US and Europe, where the past few years have been punctuated with privacy scandals and examples of big tech leaking personal data to third parties without user consent - another form of surveillance that requires just as much scrutiny, says Lennox.<br/>Of course, it is well-known among experts and policy-makers that AI, even though it is in its early days, needs to be regulated. But Lennox is skeptical that the right context is in place to do so. Quoting Vladimir Putin's statement that whoever controls AI \"will become the ruler of the world\", Lennox says that the power structures in place do not favor a responsible use of the technology.<br/>\"Certainly, the concentration of power centers that we see developing in the world at the moment indicate that there would be a risk if AI were to fall in the hands of a world government,\" says Lennox.<br/>The race to dominate AI is certainly on. China has already announced that AI is a national priority, while Russia is ramping up research in the Era technopolis for the deployment of AI in the military sphere. The US, for its part, has completed the first year of its American Artificial Intelligence initiative, with the goal of consolidating the country's leadership in the field.<br/>If a large power block were to make huge strides in AI, would it lead to an AI-infused fulfillment of George Orwell's prophecy, 1,000 years later? \"My book's title is certainly designed to reflect Orwell's 1984, and it reflects its dystopic character,\" says Lennox.\u00a0<br/>But despite all the potential dangers that the technology could pose, the academic does not believe in calling the AI project off altogether. \"As a scientist, that would be absurd,\" says Lennox, citing the immense benefits that algorithms have brought in fields like health or manufacturing. \"Should we abandon electricity because it can sometimes be dangerous? That attitude just doesn't work,\" he adds.<br/>The way forward, according to the scientist, is to draw international agreements that provide frameworks for an ethical use of AI. Some work has already been done, particularly by the European Commission, which recently released a white paper on artificial intelligence, designed to make the technology a \"force for good\", and one that won't harm citizens.\u00a0<br/>Similarly, the US Department of Defense (DoD) published a 65-page set of ethical guidelines last year on the military use of AI, to keep killer robots in check. The Pentagon details the need to stick with principles such as responsibility or reliability when deploying the technology.\u00a0<br/>Those efforts are positive developments, recognizes Lennox, but they remain tied to a single party's, or nation's, worldview. What happens when this worldview contradicts that of another major power block remains to be seen.<br/>\"There are different worldviews competing in the marketplace,\" says Lennox. \"A lot depends on which worldview is having the most influence in a particular moment. Drawing lines is good, but in ethics you are always up against the question: Who said so, and why should I do that?\"<br/>If all countries had equal weight on the international scene, implementing ethical guidelines would be more realistic. But that is far from being the case.

AI today is what should worry us.       A professor of mathematics at the University of Oxford, doubling as a philosopher of science and religion, John Lennox has some pretty unique insights to put forward when it comes to the future of artificial intelligence.    The title of his new book, ambitiously named 2084: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity,  certainly suggests a post-Orwellian vision of dystopia, complete with an algorithmic Big Brother and an army of bio-engineered super-humans. And similar predictions have already been made by other influential academics, too. Yuval Noah Harari, in his bestselling book Homo Deus , for example, anticipates that technological developments will lead to humans enhancing themselves with abilities like eternal life.    But far from portraying an Ex-Machina -esque scenario, in which our AI creations would take over the world and fundamentally change human nature, Lennox warns that the dangers of AI are more imminent.    \"If creating an AI that surpasses humans were to happen, of course it would be a threat,\" Lennox tells ZDNet. \"But there are major dangers long before then, and these dangers are actually happening now. I think it is misleading to tell people about the problems that will come in the future \u2013 it's what's happening now that demands an ethical and moral response.\"   SEE:  Managing AI and ML in the enterprise 2020 (free PDF)          Lennox separates the field of AI into two categories: general, and narrow. He describes general artificial intelligence as the attempt to enhance human beings through add-ons, drugs, bio-engineering \u2013 and ultimately, to liberate us from our biological bodies, by uploading our minds onto forever-lasting silicon chips.   Narrow artificial intelligence is less glamorous and more real, according to Lennox. It is the technology that already exists in our smartphones, or the program that guides autonomous vehicles, and the code that optimizes Amazon's robotic warehouse pickers. \"It's not intelligence at all,\" says Lennox. \"It is simply a computer doing what it's programmed to do.\"      And yet, Lennox is far more afraid of narrow AI than he is of general AI. Or rather, he is afraid of whose hands narrow AI tools might fall into. He quotes, in his book, C.S. Lewis' 1943 novel The Abolition of Man : \"What we call Man's power over Nature turns out to be a power exercised by some men over other men with Nature as its instrument.\"   In other words, it is not AI itself that will cause trouble, and an apocalyptic take-over of the human species by intelligent robots is not on the cards just yet. An immediate reason to worry, however, has to do with how the technology can be used, and sometimes is already. \"AI is not immoral,\" says Lennox, \"it is amoral. It's what you do with it that can be either moral, immoral, or in some cases, neutral.\"   Lennox takes the often-cited example of facial-recognition technology, and specifically how the tool is used in the Xinjiang province in China, which is home to ten million Uighur people, who are predominantly Muslim. It was recently found that the Chinese government has been tapping facial recognition to implement extensive surveillance of the population, including gate-like scanning systems that record biometric images, as well as smartphone fingerprints \u2013 with the goal of keeping track of the Uighur community's movements.   Fingers can equally be pointed to the US and Europe, where the past few years have been punctuated with privacy scandals and examples of big tech leaking personal data to third parties without user consent \u2013 another form of surveillance that requires just as much scrutiny, says Lennox.   Of course, it is well-known among experts and policy-makers that AI, even though it is in its early days, needs to be regulated. But Lennox is skeptical that the right context is in place to do so. Quoting Vladimir Putin's statement that whoever controls AI \"will become the ruler of the world\", Lennox says that the power structures in place do not favor a responsible use of the technology.   \"Certainly, the concentration of power centers that we see developing in the world at the moment indicate that there would be a risk if AI were to fall in the hands of a world government,\" says Lennox.   The race to dominate AI is certainly on. China has already announced that AI is a national priority , while Russia is ramping up research in the Era technopolis for the deployment of AI in the military sphere . The US, for its part, has completed the first year of its American Artificial Intelligence initiative, with the goal of consolidating the country's leadership in the field .   If a large power block were to make huge strides in AI, would it lead to an AI-infused fulfillment of George Orwell's prophecy, 1,000 years later? \"My book's title is certainly designed to reflect Orwell's 1984, and it reflects its dystopic character,\" says Lennox.    But despite all the potential dangers that the technology could pose, the academic does not believe in calling the AI project off altogether. \"As a scientist, that would be absurd,\" says Lennox, citing the immense benefits that algorithms have brought in fields like health or manufacturing. \"Should we abandon electricity because it can sometimes be dangerous? That attitude just doesn't work,\" he adds.   The way forward, according to the scientist, is to draw international agreements that provide frameworks for an ethical use of AI. Some work has already been done, particularly by the European Commission, which recently released a white paper on artificial intelligence , designed to make the technology a \"force for good\", and one that won't harm citizens.    Similarly, the US Department of Defense (DoD) published a 65-page set of ethical guidelines last year on the military use of AI, to keep killer robots in check. The Pentagon details the need to stick with principles such as responsibility or reliability when deploying the technology.    SEE: Working from home? Your boss has a creepy new way to spy on you   Those efforts are positive developments, recognizes Lennox, but they remain tied to a single party's, or nation's, worldview. What happens when this worldview contradicts that of another major power block remains to be seen.   \"There are different worldviews competing in the marketplace,\" says Lennox. \"A lot depends on which worldview is having the most influence in a particular moment. Drawing lines is good, but in ethics you are always up against the question: Who said so, and why should I do that?\"   If all countries had equal weight on the international scene, implementing ethical guidelines would be more realistic. But that is far from being the case. And if one powerful block was to sideline the ethical use of AI, there is not much that could be done to hold them accountable.   From the current state of things, it is hard to anticipate what will come next, says Lennox. The scientist recommends staying anxious about some of AI's potential, while also welcoming its positive impact in certain fields.   \"But my predominant impression is that there are a lot of negative outcomes associated with AI, and that there is huge risk if we go too far,\" says Lennox. And with 2084 not that far off, we might find out soon enough. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42640094083</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D5-RR61-F07F-84MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1274\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ZDNet</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TSZ</classCode><className>PHILOSOPHY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000179</classCode><className>BIOETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

(This is putting to one side the shortcomings of these particular categories.) On the Right, this has meant allegations of Google's bias against conservatives. In the center, it has included allegations of Google's power against competition. </p><p>On the Left, it has meant allegations of Google's exploitation of just about everybody. The latter came to the fore again last year in the wake of Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff's book entitledThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power[1](January 2019[2]). The Amazon entry for this book in part reads: #8216;[T]he first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called #8216;surveillance capitalism,' and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behavior.#8217; As a starting point, one ought to be skeptical of any explicit or implied claims of #8216;game changers#8217; and #8216;new economics.#8217; One ought also to be suspicious of any explicit or implied assertion that #8216;out-of-control#8217; capitalism is, once again, the problem and that the solution, yet again, is government #8216;in greater control.#8217; Finally, one's BS detector ought to be on high alert when reading such doublespeak as ascribes to capitalism the hallmarks of statism\u2014i.e., #8216;powerful,#8217; #8216;control,#8217; and, of course, #8216;surveillance.#8217; What the Left Is Saying Sam Biddle quickly gives away the anticapitalist agenda of those on the Left in his article forThe Intercept(February 2019[3]) by favorably #8216;drawing comparisons to seminal socioeconomic investigations like Rachel Carson'sSilent Springand Karl Marx'sCapital.#8217; He also interviewed Zuboff, who explained that Google and others are #8216;just secretly scraping your private experience as raw material, and [selling] predictions of what you're gonna do.#8217; And Zuboff alarmingly concluded: #8216;These are bald-faced interventions in the exercise of human autonomy,the #8216;right to the future tense',[and] the very material essence of the idea of free will.#8217; In another interview,this time by John Laidler of theHarvard Gazette(March 2019[4]), Zuboff expanded on this:I define surveillance capitalism as the unilateral claiming of private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. These data are then computed and packaged as prediction products and sold into behavioral futures markets.She also boldly asserted that: #8216;this [is] actually a new variant of capitalism,#8217; which supposedly #8216;has now spread beyond the tech companies to new surveillance-based ecosystems in virtually every economic sector#8217; and purportedly #8216;arose in the era of a neoliberal consensus around the superiority of self-regulating companies and markets.#8217; Katie Fitzpatrick starts her review of Zuboff's book forThe Nation(April 2019[5]) with more subtle anticapitalism than Biddle did:By resisting Go365 [a health monitoring app], the West Virginia teachers waged two battles at once: They fought in the trenches of state austerity and on the front lines of private digital surveillance.Although Fitzpatrick doesn't mention Marx as Biddle did, she uses Marxist language throughout to describe #8216;earlier capitalism#8217; and #8216;surveillance capitalism,#8217; such as #8216;exploitation,#8217; #8216;surplus,#8217; and #8216;extraction,#8217; not to mention postmodern statist concepts such as #8216;free will illusion,#8217; #8216;individual freedom chaos,#8217; and #8216;conditioned social engineering.#8217; She revealingly concluded, and lamented that Zuboff did not, that:The problem with surveillance capitalism is as much the capitalism as it is the surveillance.Two new attempts to regulate #8216;the problem#8217; of #8216;surveillance capitalism,#8217; and thus #8216;capitalism#8217; as well, come from Europe and California. Regarding the former, theFinancial Times(FT) reported onDecember 2019[6]that #8216;the EU's landmarkGeneral Data Protection Regulation[GDPR], [was] six years in the making before coming into force in May 2018.#8217; They also, as the mainstream media (MSM) almost always does, inappropriately mixed in plenty of subjective prostatism opinions, such as: #8216;There is no doubt that GDPR has already done a lot of good#8217; and #8216;But GDPR is deficient in several respects.It should be looking to reshape data markets, rather than just regulate them as they are.#8217; Slatereported on similar regulations that recently passed in California, and they wasted no time with subtleties, putting their opinion right in the subtitle:#8216;Thanks, California!#8217; (December 2019[7]). They then described howTheCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act[CCPA] essentiallyempowersconsumers [starting on New Year's Day 2020] to access the personal data that companies have collected on them, to demand that it be deleted, and to prevent it from being sold to third parties.They also optimistically opine:Since it's a lot more work to create a separate infrastructure just for California residents to opt out of, these requirements will transform the internet for everyone.As if that were not enough, they start, as theFTdid for GDPR, the process of lobbying for more market intervention: #8216;The law is vague on how much power and transparency companies must offer to consumers in this process.#8217; What the Center Is Saying In an article forTruth on the Market, Alec Stapp states his thesis in the title itself: #8216;Any Way You Measure It, Warren Is Wrong to Claim #8216;Facebook and Google Account for 70% of All Internet Traffic#8217; (October 2019[8]). In countering Senator Elizabeth Warren's statistic about Facebook and Google's combined 70 percent market share of traffic, Stapp provides the following alternative stats: 20 percent of volume; 21 percent of time; 38 percent of connections; 33 percent of referrals; 32 percent of all advertising; and 59 percent of online advertising. And he, very importantly, notes that online advertising prices have fallen 42 percent over the past decade as volume has increased. Adam Candeub and Mark Epstein address a key legal question about Google, and others, such as Facebook and Twitter, in an article forCity Journalasking the question, #8216;Platform or Publisher?#8217; (May 2018[9]). They write: #8216;Section 230 of theCommunications Decency Actimmunizes online platforms for their users' defamatory, fraudulent, or otherwise unlawful contentbut the law was not intended to facilitate political censorship.#8217; They also importantly note that Section 230 was a response to a judicial decision, under the common law, that concluded thatutilizing technology and the manpower to delete objectionable content made [one] more like publisher[s] thannewsstands, bookstores, and libraries.Michael Dougherty provides some further background to Section 230 in theNational Review(June 2019[10]). He writes that it was passed: #8216;in part to allow Internet servicesto block pornography[and not be] treated in the law as publishers[which are] liable for whatever libels and slanders users posted on them.#8217; Section 230: #8216;allows proprietors of websites and forums to set standards\u2014to edit and moderate their content without becoming a publisher of them.#8217; But also, Section 230: #8216;is now the legal remit under which social-media giants shadow-ban, block, and censor conservative speech.#8217; What the Right Is Saying In his article entitled #8216;Google Marxism#8217; (December 2019[11]), Michael Rectenwald asserted that there is nowadays a #8216;Google Archipelago,#8217; which #8216;is guided by aleft authoritarianism.#8217; He described this as: #8216;the most developed set of technological apparatuses for disciplinary and governmental power and control in the world,#8217; including #8216;The principals of what I call Big Digital\u2014the purveyors of mega-data services, media, cable, and internet services, social media platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, apps, and the developing Internet of Things.#8217; He thus warned that #8216;Socialism has always had global pretensions. OnlyGoogle Marxismis capable of creating it, albeit in corporate socialist form.#8217; William Anderson has also written about Google for the Mises Institute on a number of occasions over the years, including in the context of woke capitalism (July 2019[12]), economy bureaucratization (July 2018[13]) and antitrust law (December 2005[14]). Regarding the latter, he wrote: #8216;Google's search policies are decidedly left-wing,#8217; but #8216;[n]o one is forced to use the Internet at all and, thus, can avoid Google altogether if that is their choice.#8217; Nevertheless, Anderson warned, #8216;The vagueness ofAntitrust Lawmakes it easy for government to heap abuse upon those firms that are out of favor at any given time, as no real legal proof is needed for the courts to act against the alleged monopolist.#8217; And he added: #8216;despite the millions of dollars that the company's leaders and employees have raised for the Democrats, it is doubtful that many Democrats would be willing to stand up for a firm that is accused of being a monopolist.#8217; Writing for Antiwar.com (August 2018[15]), Justin Raimondo reminded that: #8216;TheCommunications Decency Actimmunizes these companies against any [common law] torts,#8217; and that #8216;[t]his two-tiered system is responsible for the cartel-like conditions enjoyed by Facebook, Google, Twitter, and the rest of the Silicon Valley crowd.#8217; He added that, this plus #8216;[t]he vast wealth poured into this new technology by investors buoyed by historically low interest rates, has resulted in the enrichment of Big Data beyond the dreams ofCroesus[16].#8217; The result is that #8216;In recognition of [these] government-granted privilegestheLords of the Internethave agreed to become the regime's enforcers.#8217; Conclusion These organizations that allegedly practice #8216;surveillance capitalism#8217; have become seemingly inescapable in our modern economy. This has led to a host of critics attempting to identify and explain the many ways that organizations like Facebook and Google have become damaging to our everyday lives and freedoms. Many of these critics get it wrong, though. On the Left, the reports and commentary about Google's so-called surveillance capitalism were more about the capitalism than the surveillance. As they've done many times in the past (such as during theGFC[17](Global Financial Crisis) of the late 2000s, theDot-com collapse[18]of the early 2000s, and theMicrosoft dominance[19]of the 1990s), they call for failed and selfish markets to be heavily regulated or even replaced by successful and selfless government. And emotion-laden stories, from the edges of thebell curve[20], are once again trotted out to bolster their case. In the center, there is largely an acceptance of the mixed economy (of markets and government) as it currently stands, and, in at least two cases, some pushback on further government intervention. Although these two do not seem to grasp the significance, they imply that government may be the source of a #8216;market structure,#8217; resulting in #8216;market power,#8217; and that regardless of that, #8216;market conduct#8217; includes #8216;market performance#8217; resulting in falling prices. (For more on structure-conduct-performance, seeRegulated Monopolies are not #8216;Natural,#8217;April 2018[21].) Some conservatives get closer to the mark in their concern for free speech and the potential for abuse of government power through crony capitalism. Yet, only the free market critics cut through to the most important problem\u2014namely that the state's antitrust legislation has provided legal advantages against competitors while providing legal immunity to these firms. The size and power of the #8216;surveillance capitalists#8217; has allowed the industry to escape the brunt of antitrust legislation. Many of their competitors have not been so lucky, and this an unfair advantage, to say the least. Meanwhile, as Raimondo notes, federal law protects these firms from being called to account in the civil courts. The result is a legal landscape that favors some at the expense of others. But as Anderson concludes, no one is forced to use the services of these firms, so claims of #8216;monopoly#8217; are questionable. Ultimately, it is this lack of true monopoly that illustrates the weakness of many claims that government action is necessary to rein in firms that are powerfulprecisely becauseso many voluntarily use their services.

Do you  guys know that bumbles bounce right now?  Shannon Bream, take it away.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  We got serious things to talk about  Laura.  How can I not laugh at that?  It's goofy.  All right, thank you  very much.  Here's what's coming up on our show tonight.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Merry Christmas America.</p><p>BREAM:  ObamaCare's individual mandate repealed, $1.5 trillion in tax cuts,  companies already responding, so why are critics saying bah humbug?  </p><p>REP. JACKIE SPEIER (D), CALIFORNIA:  A lump of coal into your Christmas  stocking.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  The economy is not  going to take off.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The ugliest display of pigs at the </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you living in a fantasy world? </p><p>BREAM:  Will downplaying historic tax cuts backfire on the President's  critics?

And he once said that President Trump was a menace to  conservatism.  Rich Lowry explains why some never Trumpers are now partying  with the President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @NIGHT, I'm Shannon Bream in  Washington.  New tonight, as the most sweeping changes to the tax code in  more than 30 years make their way to the President's desk, we're learning  about new challenges to the $1.5 trillion tax cuts and new indications it's  already having a positive impact.  First those challenges.  Blue states  like California, New York, and New Jersey are already looking at taking  legal action trying to stop tax reform before it becomes law.  The bill  hits those states hardest with high incomes, high property values and high  state and local taxes.  For example, Bloomberg reporting tonight about this  effect on Wall Street, \"One trader sipping a Bloody Mary on a morning  flight to somewhere more tropical said he's going to stop registering as a  Republican.\"  New Jersey Governor-elect Democrat Phil Murphy says  \"everything is on the table including challenging the constitutionality of  the bill.</p><p>PHIL MURPHY (D), GOVERNOR-ELECT, NEW JERSEY:  It's many thousands of  dollars Carl and this is an awful bill for America, it's an awful day for  America and it certainly is an awful bill for New Jersey.  We're going to  have to fight back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, they're going to have to move fast because here are the  pluses.  One sign, taxpayers across the nation will likely see the first  changes to their tax and their pay holding -- paycheck holdings as soon as  February.  Also, several major companies announcing their workers will see  some of the tax windfalls from cutting the corporate tax rate from 21  percent to -- from 35 percent including big bonuses for workers in some  cases.  Democrats calling it all a public relations stunt, \"a fraction of  the bounty\" as one media report puts it.  Things are moving fast here in  Washington so we've got team coverage tonight.  Ellison Barber has the  latest on the next big fight which is keeping the government open past the  Friday deadline.  And Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry is covering the  development since the President and Republicans celebrated their  legislative victory.  So, Ed, we begin with you.  Good evening.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Shannon, I  haven't seen any Bloody Marys around here at the White House tonight but I  can tell you remembering the campaign, President Trump promised that  Americans would get tired of all the winning.  And while to be sure, he has  a long way to go before he can say that he's enacted a large share of his  agenda.  He is claiming momentum tonight that just a few short weeks or  even months ago would've seemed impossible.  </p><p>Take a look at this pep rally he had on the south lawn in addition to the  last cabinet meeting, the last cabinet meeting of the year where he was  touting various successes.  He had Republican Leaders like Paul Ryan and  Mitch McConnell on board.  Remember, after the failure of repeal and  replace, the President mocked McConnell on Twitter and left the door open  to another Republican taking the Majority Leader post.  Tonight here's the  big picture is tax cuts that could supercharge an economy taking off.   Thanks in part to massive cuts the government regulations have already  taken place.  The tax bill also includes ANWR.  That means opening the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration.  That's decades in  the making.  If it we're standalone bill, it would be massive in and of  itself.  There's also a major initiative on health care.  </p><p>They eliminated the individual mandate in ObamaCare.  It is not repeal and  replace but it is a major pushing back on the signature domestic  achievement of the President's predecessor.  The President also at that  cabinet meeting today touting the fact that ISIS is on the run, something  that he promised in the campaign to much skepticism, also touting the  confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch plus a record number of  Circuit Court Judicial Nominees that have been confirmed.  Not a single  Democrat though voted for this tax package.  So if it succeeds, they'll  have a hard time explaining it in the midterm elections.  But Democrats  have been consistent about charging this will cost too much money.  It will  add a lot to the debt, and perhaps the most prominent talking point of all  has been that the corporate tax cut they say will not trickle down the  workers.  Listen to Chuck Schumer. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER:  At&amp;T, a big American company, a fine American company.  They are  tax rate over the last ten years was a mere eight percent and they cut  80,000 jobs.  That one statistic belies all of this trickle-down bunk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY:  Yet, just a couple of hours later, At&amp;T announced it will pay yes,  a special $1,000 bonus to more than200,000 of their employees trickling  down.  Today Boeing announced $300 million in employee-related investments.   Fifth Third Bank Corp. announced plans to raise its minimum hourly wage for  all employees.  All employees to $15 and distribute yes a one-time bonus of  $1000 because of the tax cut.  Wells Fargo saying its pay rate will go up  to $15 and they're pledging next year $400 million in charitable  contributions as well.  All reasons why some of the President's advisor  tonight are telling me they want to pivot out of this victory on tax cuts  to infrastructure, immigration information reform, other big issues.  And  there's pro-Trump non-profit group America first policies is now planning  $1 million T.V. ad blitz that will start on Christmas Day, but in fact,  they're giving FOX NEWS @NIGHT a first look.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you for cutting my taxes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you for fixing our economy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for keeping my family safe.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for putting America first.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you for supporting Israel.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As veterans, thank you for reminding us to stand for  our National Anthem.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you, President Trump.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you, President Trump, for letting us a Merry  Christmas again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY:  And we mention that riff with Senator Mitch McConnell, they were  all smiles in the Oval Office today.  The Kentucky Senator bringing yes, a  Louisville slugger from his home state to give to the President after this  tax cut victory.  Clearly, they are trying to pivot out of this to other  victories.  Although there are still a lot of challenges heading into the  New Year for this President including yes, the Special Counsel  investigation by Robert Mueller, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  What a difference a big legislative win makes.  Ed  Henry at the White House, thank you so much, Ed.  All right, as President  Trump and the GOP celebrate a big win on the tax bill, they do face a very  new challenge getting Democrats on board with a funding measure to keep the  government going past midnight Friday.  The clock is ticking and loudly.   Ellison Barber joins us now with more on that looming battle.  Good evening  Ellison.</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening Shannon.   Republican Leaders and the White House say a shutdown is absolutely not  going to happen.  Behind the scenes though, rank-and-file Republicans do  not seem as optimistic.  Utah Congressman Chris Stewart told one of our  producers that this, the continuing resolution, would never be as easy as  party leaders expected.  He also said, \"we need to do a better job  multitasking.\"  Republicans met at 5:00 this evening and talked for an  hour, trying to find a way to move ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you have a plan?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think there's a number of different factors.  There's  you know, do you do separate bills, do you put them all together?  You  know, the coalition of supplemental versus 702 reauthorizations.</p><p>REP. DAVE BRAT (R), VIRGINIA:  There are some disparate needs in terms of  defense (INAUDIBLE) right?  I want get defense right.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm optimistic we can get there.  We're not there yet.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBER:  Republicans tested the waters among their party tonight with two  options.  One, an interim bill that funds the government at current levels  through mid-January and includes defense anomalies or bumps that increase  spending, renewal of the controversial domestic spying FISA program, and  some assistance for children's health insurance.  The second, a stand-alone  $81 billion supplemental disaster spending bill for hurricane damage in  places Puerto Rico and Texas and the wildfires in California.  Some say  Republicans waited too long to do all of this and spent too much time  focusing on the tax bill.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER:  The bottom line is we haven't even seen anything.  They're so  busy with the tax proposal that we haven't even seen a proposal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBER:  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent this note to Democrats  earlier today urging a No vote on the C.R.  It says in part, \"Democrats  want to see funding for opioids, veterans pensions, and support for the  DREAM Act which would clarify the legal status for hundreds of thousands of  immigrants.\"  She also writes \"unless we see respect for our values and  priorities, we continue to urge a strong No on the continuing resolution.\"   Now here's what some House Democrats said last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH CROWLEY (D), NEW YORK:  The question really is as to whether we will  have that leverage.  We believe when we are discussing a spending package  for next year that they will need our votes to pass it.  And when they do,  they will need to talk to us about what our priorities are which includes  DACA, which includes CHIP, which includes community health sentence, which  includes opioids.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBER:  Republican celebrated a major political win this afternoon, a  little doubt about that.  But now the question seems to be will the  Republicans in Congress negate that win in less than 48 hours by failing to  prevent a shutdown and sending thousands of government workers home for  Christmas without a paycheck.  Shannon?</p><p>BREAM:  All right, we'll keep an eye on it as it plays out.  Ellison  Barber, thank you very much.  Will Democrats find themselves in a conundrum  tonight having to fight a measure that hits wealthier blue states hard but  according to even critics will give 80 percent of Americans a nice tax cut?   That means they have to downplay a $1.5 trillion overall tax cut.  Here's  how President Trump feels about that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Unfortunately the Democrats don't like to see tax cutting.  They  like to see tax increases and they like to complain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right former Chief of Staff for West Virginia Senator Joe  Manchin, Chris Kofinis, and the t Matt Schlapp, the President of the  American Conservative Union join us now to discuss.  Good to see you both  gentleman.  </p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Good to see you,  Shannon. </p><p>BREAM:  Ok, I want to play a sound bite from Democrat Congresswoman Jackie  Speier.  Here's what she says about this bill that just got passed and  celebrated today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SPEIER:  So what we're doing here today is basically saying wealthy  Americans, big fat Christmas present for you.  Tiny Tim, we're taking your  crutch away from you and all the other kids in this country.  And we're  putting a lump of coal into your Christmas stocking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Matt, so no crutches, just lumps of coal.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You got to pick a metaphor in politics Shannon.  You got to pick  one and go with it.  Coal, a crutch, look, I think the Democrats are on  very thin ice.  The President is talking about allowing working people to  keep more of the money they work hard to earn.  He's going to move to  infrastructure which is bridges and roads which we all use.  And then he's  going to want to reinstate the idea that the states to put a work  requirement on welfare reform.  This resistance to everything in the Trump  agenda might work for a lot of Democrats but it doesn't work for those key  Democrats up in more purple districts especially those Senators.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, but they didn't vote yes on this tax bill.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's exactly right.  They are starting off by saying were not  going to agree with anything on the Trump agenda and it's dicey politics,  especially on issues that in the end are going to be very popular,  including a growing economy.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Chris, they must feel emboldened that they didn't need to  vote for this.  I mean,  they feel like it was the right stand for them to  take.</p><p>CHRIS KOFINIS, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF, JOE MANCHIN:  Well, I think you look  at for example what's happened in Alabama, what's happened in Virginia, two  states that are traditionally pretty strong, to say the least for  Republicans that they haven't done very well.</p><p>BREAM:  I would argue that Virginia, where I live is very purple this days.</p><p>KOFINIS:  Yes, but you know, this was a -- you know, when you have an  incumbent, usually you'll have a switch.  But putting it aside I think when  talk about the tax bill, what's interesting to me is this whole argument  about somehow Democrats opposed to tax cuts.  That actually is not true.   Democrats are opposed to tax cuts to benefit an incredibly small percentage  of the population.</p><p>BREAM:  80 percent of Americans is a small percentage?</p><p>KOFINIS:  Yes, but where's -- the disproportionate amount of -- the money  is going at the top and it's going for corporations.</p><p>BREAM:  80 percent are getting -- this is from Tax Policy Center which is - - they're (INAUDIBLE) you know that.  I mean, they say 80 percent get a  cut, 15 percent no change, five percent will probably get a raise and a lot  of us is going to be wealthy people.</p><p>KOFINIS:  But if you're going to have $1.5 trillion tax cut, don't you  think the overall majority should go to the middle the middle class?  Do  you really think that people who are -- </p><p>BREAM:  800 percent of Americans.</p><p>KOFINIS:  But my point is, do you really -- did anyone really think that  people who are billionaires or corporations are struggling right now?   Corporate profits are at a record level, right?  We all know that.  Now,  you want to -- you want to reduce corporate taxes, great but how do you  reduce corporate taxes and with the same face and the same voice I should  turn around and say you care about the deficit.  You can't have it both  ways.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I reject -- I reject this idea that the Democrats actually care  about the deficit when Barack Obama spent more in eight years than all the  presidents before him.  And I reject this notion that we shouldn't do  everything possible to increase economic growth so that American could have  greater economic prosperity.</p><p>KOFINIS:  Wait.  Wait -- but Matt -- </p><p>BREAM:  I just -- I just want to put this up real quick.  This is something  that Ed had in his package.  I think we have it too as well about the  different companies that today announced they're going to be giving  bonuses, they're going to be pouring money back into their workers and  employees.  There were a number of big corporations.  You can see in there.   Comcast, Wells Fargo, AT&amp;T, I mean, these are big names Chris of companies  that said great, we've got this.  Now, a lot of you are going to get  bonuses or we're going to -- in other words benefit our employees.</p><p>KOFINIS:  Listen, I'm the happiest when anyone gets a raise.  There's no  question about that.  </p><p>BREAM:  You work for (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>KOFINIS:  No I do not.  No, I don't.  But if you look at for example the  history of major tax cuts, the Reagan tax cuts, the Bush Jr. tax cuts,  right, both during all those -- both during those big significant tax cuts,  if you look at where wages have been for income for workers, they've been  stagnant.  For the last three decades, wages have been stagnant.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's not right.</p><p>KOFINIS:  It is right.  That is -- </p><p>SCHLAPP:  That is not right.  And the evidence -- </p><p>KOFINIS:  It is right.  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  And the other thing -- and the other thing -- the one thing about  all those previous tax cuts is you had significant number of Democrats that  put the country's interest over their parties interests and they actually  did what was right for the economy.</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, in 1986, the last big one of these was bipartisan.  But  there are Democrats that you know, who say this time around Republicans  made it impossible for them to come along.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And that's because they say it was done on reconciliation.  They  make it sound like reconciliation is a Republican only.  </p><p>BREAM:  Well, that is how we got healthcare.  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  And that is wrong.  The fact is the system is all kinds of  reconciliation measures in the past that have been bipartisan.  There's no  reason why the Democrats --and if Chris says the Democrats want to cut  taxes.  What's the name of the bill?  I haven't seen the bill.</p><p>KOFINIS:  So here's one thing.  I can -- I can -- just use my former boss  as a perfect example.  When you're talking about you know, a Democrat from  a pretty reddish state as of late.  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  He turned red.</p><p>KOFINIS:  Yes, to say the least.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  He's been a little bit of double for them.  </p><p>KOFINIS:  Well, I mean, let's -- well, let's focus on the tax cut.  And  he's not in trouble.  He's won every -- you know, every race.</p><p>BREAM:  He's very well loved.  I cover -- I'm covering history --- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  We are talking about Joe Manchin by the way in West Virginia and I  covered that race and he's very well loved on both sides.</p><p>KOFINIS:  Senator Manchin was very open to tax cuts.  He met with the  administration.  He met with the President.  There were discussions about  it.  And they -- and Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans and Senate  Leadership and others shut the door down.  And it is right.  It is right.  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  No that's not right.  Let me jump in there.  Let me jump in -- </p><p>KOFINIS:  He said that himself.</p><p>BREAM:  We have to wrap it up.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  He said that he want a 25 percent income tax rate for  corporations.  That is out of step with where the world is.  American jobs,  American companies are leaving America since our rating are too high.</p><p>KOFINIS:  No but if you want to -- if you want to create -- if you want to  create jobs -- if you want to create jobs, it actually benefit the middle  class.</p><p>BREAM:  Wrap it up.  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  There you go.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and the thing is I mean, we got to -- we got to see how the  GOP now sells it because before the midterm, they have to convince  Americans that by the time they get their tax bill April of 2019, that this  is going to benefit them.  So they've got a job to do on that.  Chris  remains unconvinced.  </p><p>KOFINIS:  Well, if you look at the polls, they're right.  </p><p>BREAM:  OK, goodbye.  Good to see you both.  Thanks for coming in.  </p><p>All right, the Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe will have a closed- door transcribed interview tomorrow with two Congressional Committees.  Now  the Justice Department though has sent a letter today to the House  Judiciary and House Oversight Committee stating that McCabe will not be  allowed to discuss anything related to Mueller's Russia investigation.   Congressional Investigators tell Fox News that yesterday is seven-hour  interrogation of McCabe presented conflicts with the testimony of previous  witnesses.  And now, that is prompting the House Intelligence Committee to  potentially issue new subpoenas next week for FBI and Justice Department  personnel renewing speculation that demoted Justice Department official  Bruce Ohr, the one who is talking with Fusion GPS, he may be among those  summoned for testimony.  </p><p>Well, a new twist in the case of an illegal immigrant teen seeking an  abortion here in the U.S.  Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn response to the  latest turn in the legal battle over young illegals in the U.S. and  abortion.  And a Member of Congress demands answers after a report that a  Congressional I.T. staffer (INAUDIBLE) by a leading Democrat may have been  laundering money for Hezbollah through a phony car dealership.  That's  ahead.  Plus, joining the party, what's the status of the never-Trump  movement after today's big win for the President?  Stick around and see how  they're feeling.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Homeland Security releasing a pregnant 19-year-old illegal  immigrant who lied about her age, now freeing the government from any  obligation to facilitate her abortion.  According to The Washington Times,  the illegal immigrant identified by the pseudo name Jane Roe falsely  claimed to be 17 when she was arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border so she  would be eligible for a lenient treatment.  The feds say they released her  on her own terms so her anticipated abortion would not have to be  facilitated by the U.S. government.  Well, President Trump promising to get  even tougher on immigration, pledging to do away with the primary ways that  people come here from other countries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We will get rid of chain migration and the Visa Lottery Program.   We have a lottery program where we take in a lottery people from other  countries.  In some places, we are bringing in some very bad, bad people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  So how is Congress responding to those calls from the President?   GOP Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee joins us now.  great to  have you with us today.  </p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BREAM:  OK, how is Congress going to tackle this?  Will there be any  bipartisan movement on this big issue?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I would hope that there would be.  The Raise Act is something  that would address the lottery and the chain migration issues.  And this is  one of the things that we know.  It's time to move to a merit-based system.   Canada uses it.  This is something that we should do.  We are a country  that recognizes merit.  So let's move to that.</p><p>BREAM:  OK, well, the archbishop of Miami.  I want to play or put up a  little bit of a quote that we have from him.  What he says about this and  the fact that we need to move forward.  He says \"derisive comments on chain  migration forget that a foundational principle of our immigration law has  long been to reunite families.\"  He says that's a principle that we worked  on.  But this principle has been seriously eroded in recent years and  administration officials seem to be poised to make it worse.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, they're going to clean the system up.  It is time to make  certain that we change the way people come here.  And look at what recently  happened in New York.  The last two occurrences there, the Visa Lottery and  chain migration.  So let's stop it.  We know where this is happening, but  we know where the weaknesses are, the vulnerabilities are.  And we also  know that it's a fairness issue.  Move to a merit system.  Set up a points  system.  And then let's make certain that we are bringing the best of the  best that are wanting to come in and that we are ending this process of  chain migration.</p><p>BREAM:  Let me ask you on this other illegal -- legal immigrant story that  we've been covering right before this about this -- these growing number of  legal cases that we see where underage teenagers are coming across the  border and seeking abortions here in the U.S.  The ACLU was mounting a  larger legal assault on that and say they want to make sure these women who  are here have access to abortion even if they're underage.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  And this is one of those things where we have to say they're  here illegally.  They are not entitled to the services, and it's  inappropriate.  And when I talk to my constituents in Tennessee, they talk  about this as fairness.  We do not use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.   And they don't want it to take place with those that are here illegally.</p><p>BREAM:  In the last case I know that we had, there were some confusion  about who was funding the abortion, the case that happens in October.  Her  attorneys said that there was somebody stepping up to help with the  funding.  We never really got a clear answer on that.  I also want to ask  you about you chaired a year the select panel that looked into Planned  Parenthood, whether or not they were trafficking it all in body parts of  aborted fetuses.  And now you have news that the DOJ and FBI are  investigating based on what you found.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's exactly right.  Our panel did a tremendous amount of  work.  We did 15 criminal referrals, 11 to States Attorney General and four  were to federal, to DOJ.  And then we found out that between DOJ and the  FBI, they taking up all 15.  And looking at what has transpired between the  abortion clinics and these third-party sellers of the baby body parts.  So  we're pleased that that investigation is moving forward.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Planned Parenthood as you know, has denied any wrongdoing,  any criminal wrongdoing in the case so we'll watch and see how these cases  proceed.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you very much for coming tonight.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  Merry Christmas.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  And to you too.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Silicon Valley could win big under the tax cut plan.   Stick around for reaction from leading liberal like Mark Zuckerberg and the  Google guy.  And trouble for Matt Damon at the premiere of his new movie.   Details on that just ahead.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  A busy night in Hollywood, Matt Damon did  not show up for the L.A. premiere of his new movie, Downsizing.  Apparent,  Matt rep. said it was because his dealing with an ongoing family matter.   But the Hollywood Reporter says many believe he didn't show because of his  recent comments over the current sexual harassment controversy.  Damon has  said, he believes the culture of outrage needs to recognize that there is a  spectrum of behavior when it comes to sexual misconduct.</p><p>Meanwhile, longtime E! News host Catt Sadler quit the network after she  says she found out a male counterpart of hers with paid close to double her  salary for some time.  Sadler writing on her blog that she asked for what  she knows she deserves and was denied repeatedly.</p><p>And actor Stephen Baldwin is predicting that older brother Alec,  impersonator and vocal critic of Donald Trump will be voting to reelect the  President.  Stephen and avid Trump supporter told the Hollywood Reporter,  he believes his brother will vote for Trump after the actor benefits from  the new GOP tax bill.  When bet on that.</p><p>All right, bill many thank billionaires openly lean far to the left, are  any of them praising President Trump or the GOP now that major benefits  under the new tax cut plan are headed their way?  Trace Gallagher is  checking in on Silicon Valley tonight, hey Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Shannon, you know, even if  Silicon Valley does lean left, you can bet a portion of the GOP tax bill is  quietly being applauded, the simply the part of the bill that allows major  tech companies to bring home the boatloads of money currently being stored  overseas to avoid America's aggressive taxation.</p><p>In other words, right now, profits are being parked in places like Ireland  and Bermuda where the tax rates are low.  The problem with hoarding all  that money in far-flung destinations is the companies can't put it to work.   So, now the Apples and Googles of the world can bring their vast wealth  back to the U.S. at a one-time taxation rate of 15.5 percent.  That's about  20 points off the current 35 percent rate.</p><p>And here is the math.  According to several reports, the big five tech  companies, we're talking, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft  have about $457 billion in overseas subsidiaries.  If you bring it all back  stateside instead of spending 159 billion in taxes, the tariff is only 70  billion.  That's a cool 89 billion in added profit.</p><p>And now you know why during the third quarter of this year, the big tech  company spent about 25 percent more on lobbying in D.C. than they did  during the second quarter.  Listen to how the President solved this last  week.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You look at the great  companies, Apple and so many others they have billions of dollars overseas  that they want to bring back.  Now, they're going to be able to bring it  back and will be spending that money and they'll be spending that money  right here and there will be jobs and lots of other good things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Of course, it might be the other way run.  Might be lots of  good things and then jobs because back in 2004, when George W. Bush signed  the one-time amnesty for offshore profits, companies reportedly use the  money initially for pay increases and bonuses.  By the way, Zion Research  estimates U.S. companies in general, have about $2.8 trillion in offshore  accounts.  That's a lot of money that could come home.  Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  We will watch and see.  Trace, thank you very much.  Federal  investigators looking into Monday's deadly train derailment near Seattle  are trying to determine if the engineer was distracted by a second person  in the cab, maybe a cell phone or something else.  Officials say, the  Amtrak train was going 80 miles an hour, just ahead of a 30 mile an hour  zone when the cars jump the track and fell on to a busy highway, three  people were killed.</p><p>Investigators say a conductor in training was in the locomotive with the  engineer at the time of the crash.  All right, remember those Never  Trumpers?  What they're saying tonight and why'd it matters so much going  forth for the President agenda.  And later, the Hezbollah connection to the  Obama-Iran deal, and some shady I.T. workers for a top Democratic lawmakers  does it all tight together?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  We learned today, Minnesota Democrat Senator Al Franken plans to  officially resign January 2nd.  His appointed replacement, Minnesota  Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith, is expected to be sworn in the next day.   Franken announced his resignation earlier this month after several women  accused him of sexual misconduct.</p><p>Well, the Never Trump movement still has adherence within the Republican  Party even if they've been a little bit quieter, lately.  But after today's  passage of the tax cuts and jobs act, is President any closer to winning  over his harshest critics within his own Party?  Who better to ask, than  Rich Lowry, editor of the National Review.  Great to have you with us  tonight.</p><p>RICH LOWRY, EDITOR, NATIONAL REVIEW:  Hi, there.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So, how would you describe where you were on the President a  year ago versus where you are now?</p><p>LOWRY:  Very skeptical, very worried about what might happen both in terms  of the agenda and his behavior in office.  He was -- in the campaign, when  we talk about he's to spend more money and infrastructure than Hillary  Clinton, talked a lot about ripping up trade deals and imposing tariffs,  none was that has come to pass first year.</p><p>And this week is when I think we really reached the tipping point where we  can say it's been a solid first year of accomplishment and conservative  accomplishment.  He had always had this, unilateral actions.  Gorsuch, most  important.  A lot of unspooling of regulations which is good but they had  nothing legislatively.</p><p>A big failure on Obamacare.  Now, they have a big victory on taxes.  Some  things that he noted today that are kind of tucked in almost as  afterthoughts on this bill that if they're just stand-alone measures,  people would have made a big deal of drilling on ANWR, repeal the  individual mandate.  So, I think you have to give him a pretty good grade  on this year.</p><p>BREAM:  Here's what you said in your pieces, said, \"For much of the year,  Trump's presidency had seemed to be sound and fury signifying that much  besides the welcome ascension of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.  Now,  it is sound and fury signifying a discernible shift of American government  to the right.\"</p><p>So, do you think even though you may be are giving him credit, obviously  for some of this thing that he's done, many within the mainstream media, no  way that happens and certainly not the left?</p><p>LOWRY:  Correct.</p><p>BREAM:  And even begrudgingly -- </p><p>LOWRY:  Right.</p><p>BREAM:  I don't think we're going to (INAUDIBLE) that.</p><p>LOWRY:  Well, one, they're lying about this bill.  There is saying it's  that tax increase for the middle class based on a projection of what  happens in 2027 when all the individual tax cuts expire.</p><p>BREAM:  And that's the Democrats don't -- if they don't agree to extend  them, so, they're going to have some part of them.  Is that, that happens  because 9-10 years -- </p><p>LOWRY:  Correct, yes, the only way it would happen is if Democrats oppose  it.</p><p>BREAM:  Right.</p><p>LOWRY:  Which, you know, if they're tone in favor of middle-class tax cuts,  they wouldn't.  So, that would undermine their talking point there.  They  want to ignore the economy and look, Trump inherited an economy as much  better than what Obama inherited.  But right after this election you  immediately saw the stock market going up, a surge of business confidence  on the expectation that you'd see the deregulation, corporate tax reform,  and tax cuts, now, all that's happened.</p><p>So, hopefully, that will be an accelerant on the economy and allow  Republicans to take credit for the economy and the year ahead.  And they  need things like that because it does seems as though there's a Democratic  wave building just based on animus towards this President.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, OK, so, let's talk here some of the things, you mentioned  several of these, the ISIS caliphate virtually beaten, the stock market  soaring, tax reform passed, out of the Paris climate accord, Jerusalem now  designated as Israel's capital we see U.S. recognition.  ANWR open for  exploration, individual mandate repealed as part of the tax deal, a Justice  Gorsuch, unemployment down, and many other things.</p><p>So, we've talked a lot about the domestic and the economy which a lot of  businesses that you said were acting on the expectations there.  But this  issue about ISIS is really not getting much attention at all.  And not to  say that this group is gone away because we know that they full men and,  you know, go into other areas and recreate as other things sometimes.  But  that whole caliphate idea that they were, you know, accelerating just a  couple of years ago, it seems at least geographically that's been broken  up.</p><p>LOWRY:  Yes, it's a big deal that we've -- we're over the hump in terms of  ISIS and his headed, you know, that the left thinks of him is just a wild- eyed maniac just based on this Twitter feed.  They look at this policy in  the Middle East, it's been quite cautious.  There's been (INAUDIBLE) still  tight war against ISIS that has been successful.  But you haven't seen any  major interventions broaden that release.  With North Korea, it's more or  less been a status quo approach just with a -- with much more aggressive  rhetoric.</p><p>No one else would call him little rocket man except for President Trump.</p><p>BREAM:  No, (INAUDIBLE) -- </p><p>LOWRY:  But there's not in a war's imminent on the Korean Peninsula either.   A couple of things where I think, you know, a lot of deregulation and tax  cuts, any other Republican would have pushed those things.  Where -- I  think, we have to thank Navy, these are a couple things only Trump would  have done, decertify the Iran deal, pulling out of the Paris accords,  declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel.  These were things where he  really rand totally against polite opinion, where more conventional  Republican might have been more hesitant to do that.</p><p>BREAM:  Much has happened in this first year, thank you for cataloging a  very interesting piece, outlining what's happened.  Rich, good to see you.</p><p>LOWRY:  Thanks very much, Merry Christmas.</p><p>BREAM:  You too.  All right, they worked for former DNC Chairwoman Debbie  Wasserman Schultz, could a former I.T. staffers have ties to Hezbollah or  other terror groups?  We're learning a lot more.  We're hearing from a  congressman who was demanding that the DOJ probe into this matter, he wants  answers, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  We've got another follow-up tonight to our reporting on an  investigation into alleged Obama administration interference in  investigations involving the Hezbollah terror group.  POLITICO, reports  that interference was because of the pending Iran nuclear deal.  Tonight,  Correspondent Doug McKelway on a possible Hezbollah connection to a scandal  we told you about previously here on FOX NEWS @ NIGHT involving I.T.  workers with high-level connections to the Democrats.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  it was called Cars International  Aid, CIA for short.  A used car dealership in (INAUDIBLE), Virginia.  That  a lawsuit alleges gave a bad name to used car dealers everywhere.  Often  bankrupt, the dealership took loans from Hezbollah-linked businessmen in  Lebanon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LUKE ROSIAK, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, THE DAILY CALLER:  If got basically  fake staffers, they don't have inventory.  If someone shows up wanted to  buy a car, they go across the street and borrow one -- </p><p>MCKELWAY:  The owner, Imran Awan, the same man who along with four family  members was paid $7 million taxpayer dollars to provide I.T. services to 44  Democratic members of Congress, including then, DNC Chairwoman Debbie  Wasserman Schultz.  During Awan's I.T. work, $120,000 of computer equipment  went missing.  Imran was arrested on unrelated bank fraud charges at Dallas  Airport in July.  As he tried to flee to Pakistan.  A Daily Caller News  Foundation piece posted today found that Awan's used car business had a  curious pattern sighted in a recent POLITICO investigation.</p><p>ROSIAK:  This was a used car dealership, so, are classic money laundering  operation that is to use by Hezbollah.  Pakistani Intel like I saw I uses  them as well.  There were reasons, political reasons why even as our  nation's security was at stake, prosecutors didn't want to bring charges.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  The I.T. scandal occurred in the same time frame that POLITICO  reports the Obama administration was pulling back on interdiction of  Hezbollah drug operations, allegedly so as not to jeopardize the nuclear  deal with Iran.  Heading up, the Obama administrations organized crime drug  enforcement task force at that time was Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr.</p><p>Ohr was demoted this month after Fox News's James Rosen, reported that he'd  concealed meetings with fusion GPS, the company which commissioned the  anti-Trump dossier and that Ohr's wife, Nellie works for Fusion.</p><p>ROSIAK:  There appears to be a cover-up.  There's really no other way to  look at it.  Think about the timing of -- it is shortly before the 2016  election.  WikiLeaks has just published the DNC e-mails.  How is that not  routed to the highest levels of the FBI?</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  This at least cries out  for a series investigation when you got people who have money problems  hanging out with and getting a loan from someone known to hang out with  Hezbollah and they have access to the server for dozens and dozens of  Democrat elected officials.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Late today, Fox News confirmed that the House Oversight  Committee will be launching an investigation in the next few days.  Five  months since Imran Awan's arrested tell us he has yet to be charged with  any espionage or terrorism crimes.  Preserving the Iran deal is one  explanation but there's another.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Imran Awan downloaded thousands and thousands of Democratic member's  personal e-mails on to external hard drives.  If spying charges were  brought against him, there would be no shortage of black male material that  might be released.  Law enforcement under pressure from Democrats may be  willing to let this sleeping dog lie.  Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Doug McKelway, we will see.  Well, Imran Awan, most  recently employed by a former Chair of the DNC Congresswoman Debbie  Wasserman Schultz, also may have exposed congressional information online.   He's facing multiple federal charges including bank fraud but also these  accusations of allegedly double charging the House for I.T. equipment and  many other things now servicing.  Republican congressman from Florida, Ron  DeSantis, joins us now.  And you think there may be a national security  risk here.</p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Well, if you look at,  this is clearly some type of money laundering operation when you have that  CIA car dealership which really didn't have cars and they had a fake staff  -- </p><p>BREAM:  And that was the name they gave it, CIA.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Right.</p><p>BREAM:  People know what we're talking about, not a CIA car dealership.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Exactly.  Well, but I mean, I think people, look at that, they  probably doing that for a reason, our -- potentially we're doing of reason.   So, you have a situation, they're all making the whole family.  Awan, his  wife, brothers, they're making like 160 grand a year -- </p><p>BREAM:  Each.</p><p>DESANTIS:  -- suppose we do this, I.T. work.  So, that's equivalent to the  highest ranking staffers and Congress chiefs of staff.  This guys, Awan was  a little older, his -- one of his brothers was like in his early 20's, and  working at McDonald's part-time.  So, this whole thing just right there  states.  Then, what happened to all this money?  And really there's no good  explanation for it other than this is money that's being sent overseas,  they had deep relationships with people on Pakistan -- we travel there.   The first $100,000 for the car dealership was given to them by an Iraqi  with ties to Hezbollah.  So, what was going on in the House?  Why didn't  anyone see what these guys were up to?  What were they doing with the data  that they were had access to few members of Congress?  And where was this  money going, it wasn't going for a furious purpose?</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, because their allegations that they were logging into accounts  of members they weren't working for.  They were never hired to work for on  the Hill.  If you read this piece in The Daily Caller by Luke Rosiak, it  talks about these car dealerships, these businesses that don't seem to make  much sense.  The financial trail is very fuzzy, the explanation are very  strange.  Here is what Luke said today about what this looks like when you  look at the story of this guys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSIAK:  This was a used car dealership, so, are classic money laundering  operation that is to use by Hezbollah.  Pakistani Intel like I saw I uses  them as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  So, you think that may have been what was happening here, and I  know you're pressing the DOJ for some answers or at least for them to take  a different look at this.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Right, because Awan is under indictment now but not for anything  national security related.</p><p>BREAM:  Right.</p><p>DESANTIS:  There's an investigation into the Democrats in the -- within the  House, in the House Admin Committee.  Which is important but that's not  going to get into national security implications.  So, I think we need to  do that and I do think we need more answers than we been given.</p><p>BREAM:  I want to ask you too because we have talked you and I a lot about  Israel, this move that the President primly has announced about recognizing  Jerusalem as the capital, the United Nations not too happy.  The Security  Council held a vote earlier this week, the U.S., the only once to be until  on seen it against this, there'll be a vote again tomorrow.  Here is what  the President has said about what may go down at the U.N. tomorrow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I like the message Nikki sent yesterday at the United Nations.  For  all of these nations that take our money and then they vote against us at  the Security Council.  Or they vote against us potentially at the assembly.   They take hundreds and millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and  then they vote against us.  Well, we're watching these votes.  Let them  vote against us, we'll save a lot.  We don't care.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Do you think he's going to cut off the money?  Some of it, either  to the U.N. or certainly this company -- or country because you know, their  votes are not going to be close.</p><p>DESANTIS:  I love it.  I mean, the first in 2016, the U.N. had of 24  resolutions, 20 of them were against Israel.  It is one tiny little  country, only Democracy in the Middle East, and oh, by the way, the only  Jewish State in the world.  And the U.N. is pathologically focused on  singling them out.  And I -- we've seen enough of it.  I'm glad the  President say, enough with this.</p><p>His decision to recognize Jerusalem was the right one.  It was not  necessarily an easy one because other Presidents have promised it and they  reneged on their promise.  He kept his promise and I think that was the  right decision and I look forward to Nikki Haley standing up for the U.S.,  the President's decision and standing by our friend Israel.</p><p>BREAM:  She says we'll be taking names tomorrow.  Meanwhile, we know we've  got a busy week trying to work on getting the government funded.  Keep us  updated on that for things we're making time in the meantime -- </p><p>DESANTIS:  Good to see you, Merry Christmas.</p><p>BREAM:  And Merry Christmas to you.  All right, coming up, an incredible  story of survival and striving of a badly wounded marine.  Stick around.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Tonight, a salute to Marine Kyle Carpenter, who was awarded the  Medal of Honor for throwing himself on an exploding grenade, saving the  life of the fellow Marine.  Despite suffering the loss of his right eye and  a collapsed lung, Carpenter came home determined to complete his college  education.</p><p>He graduated Monday from the University of South Carolina.  Carpenter  called it one of the most incredible moments since he woke up in the  hospital and realized he had a second chance of life.  We can never thank  him enough and congratulations.  Most watched, most trusted, and most  grateful you spent the evening with us.  Good night from Washington, I'm  Shannon Bream.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Rich Lowry explains why some never Trumpers are now partying with the President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Hello and welcome to <person><nameText>FOX NEWS @</nameText></person>NIGHT, I'm Shannon Bream in Washington. New tonight, as the most sweeping changes to the tax code in more than 30 years make their way to the President's desk, we're learning about new challenges to the $1.5 trillion tax cuts and new indications it's already having a positive impact. First those challenges. Blue states like California, New York, and New Jersey are already looking at taking legal action trying to stop tax reform before it becomes law. The bill hits those states hardest with high incomes, high property values and high state and local taxes. For example, Bloomberg reporting tonight about this effect on Wall Street, \"One trader sipping a Bloody Mary on a morning flight to somewhere more tropical said he's going to stop registering as a Republican.\" New Jersey Governor-elect Democrat <person><nameText>Phil Murphy </nameText></person>says \"everything is on the table including challenging the constitutionality of the bill.</p><p><person><nameText>PHIL MURPHY </nameText></person>(D), GOVERNOR-ELECT, NEW JERSEY: It's many thousands of dollars Carl and this is an awful bill for America, it's an awful day for America and it certainly is an awful bill for New Jersey. We're going to have to fight back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Well, they're going to have to move fast because here are the pluses. One sign, taxpayers across the nation will likely see the first changes to their tax and their pay holding -- paycheck holdings as soon as February. Also, several major companies announcing their workers will see some of the tax windfalls from cutting the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to -- from 35 percent including big bonuses for workers in some cases. Democrats calling it all a public relations stunt, \"a fraction of the bounty\" as one media report puts it. Things are moving fast here in Washington so we've got team coverage tonight. Ellison Barber has the latest on the next big fight which is keeping the government open past the Friday deadline. And Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry is covering the development since the President and Republicans celebrated their legislative victory. So, Ed, we begin with you. Good evening.</p><p>ED HENRY, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHANNEL, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Shannon, I haven't seen any Bloody Marys around here at the White House tonight but I can tell you remembering the campaign, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>promised that Americans would get tired of all the winning. And while to be sure, he has a long way to go before he can say that he's enacted a large share of his agenda. He is claiming momentum tonight that just a few short weeks or even months ago would've seemed impossible.</p><p>Take a look at this pep rally he had on the south lawn in addition to the last cabinet meeting, the last cabinet meeting of the year where he was touting various successes. He had Republican Leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell on board. Remember, after the failure of repeal and replace, the President mocked McConnell on Twitter and left the door open to another Republican taking the Majority Leader post. Tonight here's the big picture is tax cuts that could supercharge an economy taking off. Thanks in part to massive cuts the government regulations have already taken place. The tax bill also includes ANWR. That means opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration. That's decades in the making. If it we're standalone bill, it would be massive in and of itself. There's also a major initiative on health care.</p><p>They eliminated the individual mandate in ObamaCare. It is not repeal and replace but it is a major pushing back on the signature domestic achievement of the President's predecessor. The President also at that cabinet meeting today touting the fact that ISIS is on the run, something that he promised in the campaign to much skepticism, also touting the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch plus a record number of Circuit Court Judicial Nominees that have been confirmed. Not a single Democrat though voted for this tax package. So if it succeeds, they'll have a hard time explaining it in the midterm elections. But Democrats have been consistent about charging this will cost too much money. It will add a lot to the debt, and perhaps the most prominent talking point of all has been that the corporate tax cut they say will not trickle down the workers. Listen to <person><nameText>Chuck Schumer.</nameText></person></p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: At&amp;T, a big American company, a fine American company. They are tax rate over the last ten years was a mere eight percent and they cut 80,000 jobs. That one statistic belies all of this trickle-down bunk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: Yet, just a couple of hours later, At&amp;T announced it will pay yes, a special $1,000 bonus to more than200,000 of their employees trickling down. Today Boeing announced $300 million in employee-related investments. Fifth Third Bank Corp. announced plans to raise its minimum hourly wage for all employees. All employees to $15 and distribute yes a one-time bonus of $1000 because of the tax cut. Wells Fargo saying its pay rate will go up to $15 and they're pledging next year $400 million in charitable contributions as well. All reasons why some of the President's advisor tonight are telling me they want to pivot out of this victory on tax cuts to infrastructure, immigration information reform, other big issues. And there's pro-Trump non-profit group America first policies is now planning $1 million T.V. ad blitz that will start on Christmas Day, but in fact, they're giving <person><nameText>FOX NEWS @</nameText></person>NIGHT a first look. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you for cutting my taxes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you for fixing our economy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you for keeping my family safe.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you for putting America first.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you for supporting Israel.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As veterans, thank you for reminding us to stand for our National Anthem.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>for letting us a Merry Christmas again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY: And we mention that riff with Senator Mitch McConnell, they were all smiles in the Oval Office today. The Kentucky Senator bringing yes, a Louisville slugger from his home state to give to the President after this tax cut victory. Clearly, they are trying to pivot out of this to other victories. Although there are still a lot of challenges heading into the New Year for this President including yes, the Special Counsel investigation by Robert Mueller, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right. What a difference a big legislative win makes. Ed Henry at the White House, thank you so much, Ed. All right, as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and the GOP celebrate a big win on the tax bill, they do face a very new challenge getting Democrats on board with a funding measure to keep the government going past midnight Friday. The clock is ticking and loudly. Ellison Barber joins us now with more on that looming battle. Good evening Ellison.</p><p>ELLISON BARBER, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening Shannon. Republican Leaders and the White House say a shutdown is absolutely not going to happen. Behind the scenes though, rank-and-file Republicans do not seem as optimistic. Utah Congressman Chris Stewart told one of our producers that this, the continuing resolution, would never be as easy as party leaders expected. He also said, \"we need to do a better job multitasking.\" Republicans met at 5:00 this evening and talked for an hour, trying to find a way to move ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have a plan?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think there's a number of different factors. There's you know, do you do separate bills, do you put them all together? You know, the coalition of supplemental versus 702 reauthorizations.</p><p>REP. DAVE BRAT (R), VIRGINIA: There are some disparate needs in terms of defense (INAUDIBLE) right? I want get defense right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm optimistic we can get there. We're not there yet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBER: Republicans tested the waters among their party tonight with two options. One, an interim bill that funds the government at current levels through mid-January and includes defense anomalies or bumps that increase spending, renewal of the controversial domestic spying FISA program, and some assistance for children's health insurance. The second, a stand-alone $81 billion supplemental disaster spending bill for hurricane damage in places Puerto Rico and Texas and the wildfires in California. Some say Republicans waited too long to do all of this and spent too much time focusing on the tax bill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER: The bottom line is we haven't even seen anything. They're so busy with the tax proposal that we haven't even seen a proposal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBER: House Minority Leader <person><nameText>Nancy Pelosi </nameText></person>sent this note to Democrats earlier today urging a No vote on the C.R. It says in part, \"Democrats want to see funding for opioids, veterans pensions, and support for the DREAM Act which would clarify the legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants.\" She also writes \"unless we see respect for our values and priorities, we continue to urge a strong No on the continuing resolution.\" Now here's what some House Democrats said last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH CROWLEY (D), NEW YORK: The question really is as to whether we will have that leverage. We believe when we are discussing a spending package for next year that they will need our votes to pass it. And when they do, they will need to talk to us about what our priorities are which includes DACA, which includes CHIP, which includes community health sentence, which includes opioids.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBER: Republican celebrated a major political win this afternoon, a little doubt about that. But now the question seems to be will the Republicans in Congress negate that win in less than 48 hours by failing to prevent a shutdown and sending thousands of government workers home for Christmas without a paycheck. Shannon?</p><p>BREAM: All right, we'll keep an eye on it as it plays out. Ellison Barber, thank you very much. Will Democrats find themselves in a conundrum tonight having to fight a measure that hits wealthier blue states hard but according to even critics will give 80 percent of Americans a nice tax cut? That means they have to downplay a $1.5 trillion overall tax cut. Here's how <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>feels about that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Unfortunately the Democrats don't like to see tax cutting. They like to see tax increases and they like to complain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: All right former Chief of Staff for West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, Chris Kofinis, and the t Matt Schlapp, the President of the American Conservative Union join us now to discuss. Good to see you both gentleman.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Good to see you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Ok, I want to play a sound bite from Democrat Congresswoman Jackie Speier. Here's what she says about this bill that just got passed and celebrated today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SPEIER: So what we're doing here today is basically saying wealthy Americans, big fat Christmas present for you. Tiny Tim, we're taking your crutch away from you and all the other kids in this country. And we're putting a lump of coal into your Christmas stocking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: All right, Matt, so no crutches, just lumps of coal.</p><p>SCHLAPP: You got to pick a metaphor in politics Shannon. You got to pick one and go with it. Coal, a crutch, look, I think the Democrats are on very thin ice. The President is talking about allowing working people to keep more of the money they work hard to earn. He's going to move to infrastructure which is bridges and roads which we all use. And then he's going to want to reinstate the idea that the states to put a work requirement on welfare reform. This resistance to everything in the Trump agenda might work for a lot of Democrats but it doesn't work for those key Democrats up in more purple districts especially those Senators.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, but they didn't vote yes on this tax bill.</p><p>SCHLAPP: That's exactly right. They are starting off by saying were not going to agree with anything on the Trump agenda and it's dicey politics, especially on issues that in the end are going to be very popular, including a growing economy.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Chris, they must feel emboldened that they didn't need to vote for this. I mean, they feel like it was the right stand for them to take.</p><p>CHRIS KOFINIS, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF, JOE MANCHIN: Well, I think you look at for example what's happened in Alabama, what's happened in Virginia, two states that are traditionally pretty strong, to say the least for Republicans that they haven't done very well.</p><p>BREAM: I would argue that Virginia, where I live is very purple this days.</p><p>KOFINIS: Yes, but you know, this was a -- you know, when you have an incumbent, usually you'll have a switch. But putting it aside I think when talk about the tax bill, what's interesting to me is this whole argument about somehow Democrats opposed to tax cuts. That actually is not true. Democrats are opposed to tax cuts to benefit an incredibly small percentage of the population.</p><p>BREAM: 80 percent of Americans is a small percentage?</p><p>KOFINIS: Yes, but where's -- the disproportionate amount of -- the money is going at the top and it's going for corporations.</p><p>BREAM: 80 percent are getting -- this is from Tax Policy Center which is - - they're (INAUDIBLE) you know that. I mean, they say 80 percent get a cut, 15 percent no change, five percent will probably get a raise and a lot of us is going to be wealthy people.</p><p>KOFINIS: But if you're going to have $1.5 trillion tax cut, don't you think the overall majority should go to the middle the middle class? Do you really think that people who are --</p><p>BREAM: 800 percent of Americans.</p><p>KOFINIS: But my point is, do you really -- did anyone really think that people who are billionaires or corporations are struggling right now? Corporate profits are at a record level, right? We all know that. Now, you want to -- you want to reduce corporate taxes, great but how do you reduce corporate taxes and with the same face and the same voice I should turn around and say you care about the deficit. You can't have it both ways.</p><p>SCHLAPP: I reject -- I reject this idea that the Democrats actually care about the deficit when Barack Obama spent more in eight years than all the presidents before him. And I reject this notion that we shouldn't do everything possible to increase economic growth so that American could have greater economic prosperity.</p><p>KOFINIS: Wait. Wait -- but Matt --</p><p>BREAM: I just -- I just want to put this up real quick. This is something that Ed had in his package. I think we have it too as well about the different companies that today announced they're going to be giving bonuses, they're going to be pouring money back into their workers and employees. There were a number of big corporations. You can see in there. Comcast, Wells Fargo, AT&amp;T, I mean, these are big names Chris of companies that said great, we've got this. Now, a lot of you are going to get bonuses or we're going to -- in other words benefit our employees.</p><p>KOFINIS: Listen, I'm the happiest when anyone gets a raise. There's no question about that.</p><p>BREAM: You work for (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>KOFINIS: No I do not. No, I don't. But if you look at for example the history of major tax cuts, the Reagan tax cuts, the Bush Jr. tax cuts, right, both during all those -- both during those big significant tax cuts, if you look at where wages have been for income for workers, they've been stagnant. For the last three decades, wages have been stagnant.</p><p>SCHLAPP: That's not right.</p><p>KOFINIS: It is right. That is --</p><p>SCHLAPP: That is not right. And the evidence --</p><p>KOFINIS: It is right.</p><p>SCHLAPP: And the other thing -- and the other thing -- the one thing about all those previous tax cuts is you had significant number of Democrats that put the country's interest over their parties interests and they actually did what was right for the economy.</p><p>BREAM: I mean, in 1986, the last big one of these was bipartisan. But there are Democrats that you know, who say this time around Republicans made it impossible for them to come along.</p><p>SCHLAPP: And that's because they say it was done on reconciliation. They make it sound like reconciliation is a Republican only.</p><p>BREAM: Well, that is how we got healthcare.</p><p>SCHLAPP: And that is wrong. The fact is the system is all kinds of reconciliation measures in the past that have been bipartisan. There's no reason why the Democrats --and if Chris says the Democrats want to cut taxes. What's the name of the bill? I haven't seen the bill.</p><p>KOFINIS: So here's one thing. I can -- I can -- just use my former boss as a perfect example. When you're talking about you know, a Democrat from a pretty reddish state as of late.</p><p>SCHLAPP: He turned red.</p><p>KOFINIS: Yes, to say the least.</p><p>SCHLAPP: He's been a little bit of double for them.</p><p>KOFINIS: Well, I mean, let's -- well, let's focus on the tax cut. And he's not in trouble. He's won every -- you know, every race.</p><p>BREAM: He's very well loved. I cover -- I'm covering history ---</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM: We are talking about Joe Manchin by the way in West Virginia and I covered that race and he's very well loved on both sides.</p><p>KOFINIS: Senator Manchin was very open to tax cuts. He met with the administration. He met with the President. There were discussions about it. And they -- and Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans and Senate Leadership and others shut the door down. And it is right. It is right.</p><p>SCHLAPP: No that's not right. Let me jump in there. Let me jump in --</p><p>KOFINIS: He said that himself.</p><p>BREAM: We have to wrap it up.</p><p>SCHLAPP: He said that he want a 25 percent income tax rate for corporations. That is out of step with where the world is. American jobs, American companies are leaving America since our rating are too high.</p><p>KOFINIS: No but if you want to -- if you want to create -- if you want to create jobs -- if you want to create jobs, it actually benefit the middle class.</p><p>BREAM: Wrap it up.</p><p>SCHLAPP: There you go.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and the thing is I mean, we got to -- we got to see how the GOP now sells it because before the midterm, they have to convince Americans that by the time they get their tax bill April of 2019, that this is going to benefit them. So they've got a job to do on that. Chris remains unconvinced.</p><p>KOFINIS: Well, if you look at the polls, they're right.</p><p>BREAM: OK, goodbye. Good to see you both. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>All right, the Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe will have a closed- door transcribed interview tomorrow with two Congressional Committees. Now the Justice Department though has sent a letter today to the House Judiciary and House Oversight Committee stating that McCabe will not be allowed to discuss anything related to Mueller's Russia investigation. Congressional Investigators tell <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>that yesterday is seven-hour interrogation of McCabe presented conflicts with the testimony of previous witnesses. And now, that is prompting the House Intelligence Committee to potentially issue new subpoenas next week for FBI and Justice Department personnel renewing speculation that demoted Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, the one who is talking with Fusion GPS, he may be among those summoned for testimony.</p><p>Well, a new twist in the case of an illegal immigrant teen seeking an abortion here in the U.S. Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn response to the latest turn in the legal battle over young illegals in the U.S. and abortion. And a Member of Congress demands answers after a report that a Congressional I.T. staffer (INAUDIBLE) by a leading Democrat may have been laundering money for Hezbollah through a phony car dealership. That's ahead. Plus, joining the party, what's the status of the never-Trump movement after today's big win for the President? Stick around and see how they're feeling.</p><p>BREAM: Homeland Security releasing a pregnant 19-year-old illegal immigrant who lied about her age, now freeing the government from any obligation to facilitate her abortion. According to The Washington Times, the illegal immigrant identified by the pseudo name Jane Roe falsely claimed to be 17 when she was arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border so she would be eligible for a lenient treatment. The feds say they released her on her own terms so her anticipated abortion would not have to be facilitated by the U.S. government. Well, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>promising to get even tougher on immigration, pledging to do away with the primary ways that people come here from other countries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We will get rid of chain migration and the Visa Lottery Program. We have a lottery program where we take in a lottery people from other countries. In some places, we are bringing in some very bad, bad people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: So how is Congress responding to those calls from the President? GOP Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee joins us now. great to have you with us today.</p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE: Great to be with you.</p><p>BREAM: OK, how is Congress going to tackle this? Will there be any bipartisan movement on this big issue?</p><p>BLACKBURN: I would hope that there would be. The Raise Act is something that would address the lottery and the chain migration issues. And this is one of the things that we know. It's time to move to a merit-based system. Canada uses it. This is something that we should do. We are a country that recognizes merit. So let's move to that.</p><p>BREAM: OK, well, the archbishop of Miami. I want to play or put up a little bit of a quote that we have from him. What he says about this and the fact that we need to move forward. He says \"derisive comments on chain migration forget that a foundational principle of our immigration law has long been to reunite families.\" He says that's a principle that we worked on. But this principle has been seriously eroded in recent years and administration officials seem to be poised to make it worse.</p><p>BLACKBURN: No, they're going to clean the system up. It is time to make certain that we change the way people come here. And look at what recently happened in New York. The last two occurrences there, the Visa Lottery and chain migration. So let's stop it. We know where this is happening, but we know where the weaknesses are, the vulnerabilities are. And we also know that it's a fairness issue. Move to a merit system. Set up a points system. And then let's make certain that we are bringing the best of the best that are wanting to come in and that we are ending this process of chain migration.</p><p>BREAM: Let me ask you on this other illegal -- legal immigrant story that we've been covering right before this about this -- these growing number of legal cases that we see where underage teenagers are coming across the border and seeking abortions here in the U.S. The ACLU was mounting a larger legal assault on that and say they want to make sure these women who are here have access to abortion even if they're underage.</p><p>BLACKBURN: And this is one of those things where we have to say they're here illegally. They are not entitled to the services, and it's inappropriate. And when I talk to my constituents in Tennessee, they talk about this as fairness. We do not use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. And they don't want it to take place with those that are here illegally.</p><p>BREAM: In the last case I know that we had, there were some confusion about who was funding the abortion, the case that happens in October. Her attorneys said that there was somebody stepping up to help with the funding. We never really got a clear answer on that. I also want to ask you about you chaired a year the select panel that looked into Planned Parenthood, whether or not they were trafficking it all in body parts of aborted fetuses. And now you have news that the DOJ and FBI are investigating based on what you found.</p><p>BLACKBURN: That's exactly right. Our panel did a tremendous amount of work. We did 15 criminal referrals, 11 to States Attorney General and four were to federal, to DOJ. And then we found out that between DOJ and the FBI, they taking up all 15. And looking at what has transpired between the abortion clinics and these third-party sellers of the baby body parts. So we're pleased that that investigation is moving forward.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Planned Parenthood as you know, has denied any wrongdoing, any criminal wrongdoing in the case so we'll watch and see how these cases proceed.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM: Thank you very much for coming tonight.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: Merry Christmas.</p><p>BLACKBURN: And to you too.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Silicon Valley could win big under the tax cut plan. Stick around for reaction from leading liberal like Mark Zuckerberg and the Google guy. And trouble for Matt Damon at the premiere of his new movie. Details on that just ahead.</p><p>SHANNON BREAM, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>HOST: A busy night in Hollywood, Matt Damon did not show up for the L.A. premiere of his new movie, Downsizing. Apparent, Matt rep. said it was because his dealing with an ongoing family matter. But the Hollywood Reporter says many believe he didn't show because of his recent comments over the current sexual harassment controversy. Damon has said, he believes the culture of outrage needs to recognize that there is a spectrum of behavior when it comes to sexual misconduct.</p><p>Meanwhile, longtime E! News host Catt Sadler quit the network after she says she found out a male counterpart of hers with paid close to double her salary for some time. Sadler writing on her blog that she asked for what she knows she deserves and was denied repeatedly.</p><p>And actor Stephen Baldwin is predicting that older brother Alec, impersonator and vocal critic of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will be voting to reelect the President. Stephen and avid Trump supporter told the Hollywood Reporter, he believes his brother will vote for Trump after the actor benefits from the new GOP tax bill. When bet on that.</p><p>All right, bill many thank billionaires openly lean far to the left, are any of them praising <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>or the GOP now that major benefits under the new tax cut plan are headed their way? Trace Gallagher is checking in on Silicon Valley tonight, hey Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Shannon, you know, even if Silicon Valley does lean left, you can bet a portion of the GOP tax bill is quietly being applauded, the simply the part of the bill that allows major tech companies to bring home the boatloads of money currently being stored overseas to avoid America's aggressive taxation.</p><p>In other words, right now, profits are being parked in places like Ireland and Bermuda where the tax rates are low. The problem with hoarding all that money in far-flung destinations is the companies can't put it to work. So, now the Apples and Googles of the world can bring their vast wealth back to the U.S. at a one-time taxation rate of 15.5 percent. That's about 20 points off the current 35 percent rate.</p><p>And here is the math. According to several reports, the big five tech companies, we're talking, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have about $457 billion in overseas subsidiaries. If you bring it all back stateside instead of spending 159 billion in taxes, the tariff is only 70 billion. That's a cool 89 billion in added profit.</p><p>And now you know why during the third quarter of this year, the big tech company spent about 25 percent more on lobbying in D.C. than they did during the second quarter. Listen to how the President solved this last week. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You look at the great companies, Apple and so many others they have billions of dollars overseas that they want to bring back. Now, they're going to be able to bring it back and will be spending that money and they'll be spending that money right here and there will be jobs and lots of other good things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Of course, it might be the other way run. Might be lots of good things and then jobs because back in 2004, when George W. Bush signed the one-time amnesty for offshore profits, companies reportedly use the money initially for pay increases and bonuses. By the way, Zion Research estimates U.S. companies in general, have about $2.8 trillion in offshore accounts. That's a lot of money that could come home. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: We will watch and see. Trace, thank you very much. Federal investigators looking into Monday's deadly train derailment near Seattle are trying to determine if the engineer was distracted by a second person in the cab, maybe a cell phone or something else. Officials say, the Amtrak train was going 80 miles an hour, just ahead of a 30 mile an hour zone when the cars jump the track and fell on to a busy highway, three people were killed.</p><p>Investigators say a conductor in training was in the locomotive with the engineer at the time of the crash. All right, remember those Never Trumpers? What they're saying tonight and why'd it matters so much going forth for the President agenda. And later, the Hezbollah connection to the Obama-Iran deal, and some shady I.T. workers for a top Democratic lawmakers does it all tight together?</p><p>BREAM: We learned today, Minnesota Democrat Senator Al Franken plans to officially resign January 2nd. His appointed replacement, Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith, is expected to be sworn in the next day. Franken announced his resignation earlier this month after several women accused him of sexual misconduct.</p><p>Well, the Never Trump movement still has adherence within the Republican Party even if they've been a little bit quieter, lately. But after today's passage of the tax cuts and jobs act, is President any closer to winning over his harshest critics within his own Party? Who better to ask, than Rich Lowry, editor of the National Review. Great to have you with us tonight.</p><p>RICH LOWRY, EDITOR, NATIONAL REVIEW: Hi, there.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So, how would you describe where you were on the President a year ago versus where you are now?</p><p>LOWRY: Very skeptical, very worried about what might happen both in terms of the agenda and his behavior in office. He was -- in the campaign, when we talk about he's to spend more money and infrastructure than Hillary Clinton, talked a lot about ripping up trade deals and imposing tariffs, none was that has come to pass first year.</p><p>And this week is when I think we really reached the tipping point where we can say it's been a solid first year of accomplishment and conservative accomplishment. He had always had this, unilateral actions. Gorsuch, most important. A lot of unspooling of regulations which is good but they had nothing legislatively.</p><p>A big failure on Obamacare. Now, they have a big victory on taxes. Some things that he noted today that are kind of tucked in almost as afterthoughts on this bill that if they're just stand-alone measures, people would have made a big deal of drilling on ANWR, repeal the individual mandate. So, I think you have to give him a pretty good grade on this year.</p><p>BREAM: Here's what you said in your pieces, said, \"For much of the year, Trump's presidency had seemed to be sound and fury signifying that much besides the welcome ascension of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Now, it is sound and fury signifying a discernible shift of American government to the right.\"</p><p>So, do you think even though you may be are giving him credit, obviously for some of this thing that he's done, many within the mainstream media, no way that happens and certainly not the left?</p><p>LOWRY: Correct.</p><p>BREAM: And even begrudgingly --</p><p>LOWRY: Right.</p><p>BREAM: I don't think we're going to (INAUDIBLE) that.</p><p>LOWRY: Well, one, they're lying about this bill. There is saying it's that tax increase for the middle class based on a projection of what happens in 2027 when all the individual tax cuts expire.</p><p>BREAM: And that's the Democrats don't -- if they don't agree to extend them, so, they're going to have some part of them. Is that, that happens because 9-10 years --</p><p>LOWRY: Correct, yes, the only way it would happen is if Democrats oppose it.</p><p>BREAM: Right.</p><p>LOWRY: Which, you know, if they're tone in favor of middle-class tax cuts, they wouldn't. So, that would undermine their talking point there. They want to ignore the economy and look, Trump inherited an economy as much better than what Obama inherited. But right after this election you immediately saw the stock market going up, a surge of business confidence on the expectation that you'd see the deregulation, corporate tax reform, and tax cuts, now, all that's happened.</p><p>So, hopefully, that will be an accelerant on the economy and allow Republicans to take credit for the economy and the year ahead. And they need things like that because it does seems as though there's a Democratic wave building just based on animus towards this President.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, OK, so, let's talk here some of the things, you mentioned several of these, the ISIS caliphate virtually beaten, the stock market soaring, tax reform passed, out of the Paris climate accord, Jerusalem now designated as Israel's capital we see U.S. recognition. ANWR open for exploration, individual mandate repealed as part of the tax deal, a Justice Gorsuch, unemployment down, and many other things.</p><p>So, we've talked a lot about the domestic and the economy which a lot of businesses that you said were acting on the expectations there. But this issue about ISIS is really not getting much attention at all. And not to say that this group is gone away because we know that they full men and, you know, go into other areas and recreate as other things sometimes. But that whole caliphate idea that they were, you know, accelerating just a couple of years ago, it seems at least geographically that's been broken up.</p><p>LOWRY: Yes, it's a big deal that we've -- we're over the hump in terms of ISIS and his headed, you know, that the left thinks of him is just a wild- eyed maniac just based on this Twitter feed. They look at this policy in the Middle East, it's been quite cautious. There's been (INAUDIBLE) still tight war against ISIS that has been successful. But you haven't seen any major interventions broaden that release. With North Korea, it's more or less been a status quo approach just with a -- with much more aggressive rhetoric.</p><p>No one else would call him little rocket man except for <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>BREAM: No, (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>LOWRY: But there's not in a war's imminent on the Korean Peninsula either. A couple of things where I think, you know, a lot of deregulation and tax cuts, any other Republican would have pushed those things. Where -- I think, we have to thank Navy, these are a couple things only Trump would have done, decertify the Iran deal, pulling out of the Paris accords, declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel. These were things where he really rand totally against polite opinion, where more conventional Republican might have been more hesitant to do that.</p><p>BREAM: Much has happened in this first year, thank you for cataloging a very interesting piece, outlining what's happened. Rich, good to see you.</p><p>LOWRY: Thanks very much, Merry Christmas.</p><p>BREAM: You too. All right, they worked for former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, could a former I.T. staffers have ties to Hezbollah or other terror groups? We're learning a lot more. We're hearing from a congressman who was demanding that the DOJ probe into this matter, he wants answers, next.</p><p>BREAM: We've got another follow-up tonight to our reporting on an investigation into alleged Obama administration interference in investigations involving the Hezbollah terror group. POLITICO, reports that interference was because of the pending Iran nuclear deal. Tonight, Correspondent Doug McKelway on a possible Hezbollah connection to a scandal we told you about previously here on <person><nameText>FOX NEWS @ </nameText></person>NIGHT involving I.T. workers with high-level connections to the Democrats.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: it was called Cars International Aid, CIA for short. A used car dealership in (INAUDIBLE), Virginia. That a lawsuit alleges gave a bad name to used car dealers everywhere. Often bankrupt, the dealership took loans from Hezbollah-linked businessmen in Lebanon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LUKE ROSIAK, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, THE DAILY CALLER: If got basically fake staffers, they don't have inventory. If someone shows up wanted to buy a car, they go across the street and borrow one --</p><p>MCKELWAY: The owner, Imran Awan, the same man who along with four family members was paid $7 million taxpayer dollars to provide I.T. services to 44 Democratic members of Congress, including then, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. During Awan's I.T. work, $120,000 of computer equipment went missing. Imran was arrested on unrelated bank fraud charges at Dallas Airport in July. As he tried to flee to Pakistan. A Daily Caller News Foundation piece posted today found that Awan's used car business had a curious pattern sighted in a recent POLITICO investigation.</p><p>ROSIAK: This was a used car dealership, so, are classic money laundering operation that is to use by Hezbollah. Pakistani Intel like I saw I uses them as well. There were reasons, political reasons why even as our nation's security was at stake, prosecutors didn't want to bring charges.</p><p>MCKELWAY: The I.T. scandal occurred in the same time frame that POLITICO reports the Obama administration was pulling back on interdiction of Hezbollah drug operations, allegedly so as not to jeopardize the nuclear deal with Iran. Heading up, the Obama administrations organized crime drug enforcement task force at that time was Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr.</p><p>Ohr was demoted this month after <person><nameText>Fox News's </nameText></person>James Rosen, reported that he'd concealed meetings with fusion GPS, the company which commissioned the anti-Trump dossier and that Ohr's wife, Nellie works for Fusion.</p><p>ROSIAK: There appears to be a cover-up. There's really no other way to look at it. Think about the timing of -- it is shortly before the 2016 election. WikiLeaks has just published the DNC e-mails. How is that not routed to the highest levels of the FBI?</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: This at least cries out for a series investigation when you got people who have money problems hanging out with and getting a loan from someone known to hang out with Hezbollah and they have access to the server for dozens and dozens of Democrat elected officials.</p><p>MCKELWAY: Late today, <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>confirmed that the House Oversight Committee will be launching an investigation in the next few days. Five months since Imran Awan's arrested tell us he has yet to be charged with any espionage or terrorism crimes. Preserving the Iran deal is one explanation but there's another.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Imran Awan downloaded thousands and thousands of Democratic member's personal e-mails on to external hard drives. If spying charges were brought against him, there would be no shortage of black male material that might be released. Law enforcement under pressure from Democrats may be willing to let this sleeping dog lie. Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Doug McKelway, we will see. Well, Imran Awan, most recently employed by a former Chair of the DNC Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, also may have exposed congressional information online. He's facing multiple federal charges including bank fraud but also these accusations of allegedly double charging the House for I.T. equipment and many other things now servicing. Republican congressman from Florida, Ron DeSantis, joins us now. And you think there may be a national security risk here.</p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Well, if you look at, this is clearly some type of money laundering operation when you have that CIA car dealership which really didn't have cars and they had a fake staff --</p><p>BREAM: And that was the name they gave it, CIA.</p><p>DESANTIS: Right.</p><p>BREAM: People know what we're talking about, not a CIA car dealership.</p><p>DESANTIS: Exactly. Well, but I mean, I think people, look at that, they probably doing that for a reason, our -- potentially we're doing of reason. So, you have a situation, they're all making the whole family. Awan, his wife, brothers, they're making like 160 grand a year --</p><p>BREAM: Each.</p><p>DESANTIS: -- suppose we do this, I.T. work. So, that's equivalent to the highest ranking staffers and Congress chiefs of staff. This guys, Awan was a little older, his -- one of his brothers was like in his early 20's, and working at McDonald's part-time. So, this whole thing just right there states. Then, what happened to all this money? And really there's no good explanation for it other than this is money that's being sent overseas, they had deep relationships with people on Pakistan -- we travel there. The first $100,000 for the car dealership was given to them by an Iraqi with ties to Hezbollah. So, what was going on in the House? Why didn't anyone see what these guys were up to? What were they doing with the data that they were had access to few members of Congress? And where was this money going, it wasn't going for a furious purpose?</p><p>BREAM: Yes, because their allegations that they were logging into accounts of members they weren't working for. They were never hired to work for on the Hill. If you read this piece in The Daily Caller by Luke Rosiak, it talks about these car dealerships, these businesses that don't seem to make much sense. The financial trail is very fuzzy, the explanation are very strange. Here is what Luke said today about what this looks like when you look at the story of this guys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSIAK: This was a used car dealership, so, are classic money laundering operation that is to use by Hezbollah. Pakistani Intel like I saw I uses them as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: So, you think that may have been what was happening here, and I know you're pressing the DOJ for some answers or at least for them to take a different look at this.</p><p>DESANTIS: Right, because Awan is under indictment now but not for anything national security related.</p><p>BREAM: Right.</p><p>DESANTIS: There's an investigation into the Democrats in the -- within the House, in the House Admin Committee. Which is important but that's not going to get into national security implications. So, I think we need to do that and I do think we need more answers than we been given.</p><p>BREAM: I want to ask you too because we have talked you and I a lot about Israel, this move that the President primly has announced about recognizing Jerusalem as the capital, the United Nations not too happy. The Security Council held a vote earlier this week, the U.S., the only once to be until on seen it against this, there'll be a vote again tomorrow. Here is what the President has said about what may go down at the U.N. tomorrow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I like the message Nikki sent yesterday at the United Nations. For all of these nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the Security Council. Or they vote against us potentially at the assembly. They take hundreds and millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us. Well, we're watching these votes. Let them vote against us, we'll save a lot. We don't care.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Do you think he's going to cut off the money? Some of it, either to the U.N. or certainly this company -- or country because you know, their votes are not going to be close.</p><p>DESANTIS: I love it. I mean, the first in 2016, the U.N. had of 24 resolutions, 20 of them were against Israel. It is one tiny little country, only Democracy in the Middle East, and oh, by the way, the only Jewish State in the world. And the U.N. is pathologically focused on singling them out. And I -- we've seen enough of it. I'm glad the President say, enough with this.</p><p>His decision to recognize Jerusalem was the right one. It was not necessarily an easy one because other Presidents have promised it and they reneged on their promise. He kept his promise and I think that was the right decision and I look forward to Nikki Haley standing up for the U.S., the President's decision and standing by our friend Israel.</p><p>BREAM: She says we'll be taking names tomorrow. Meanwhile, we know we've got a busy week trying to work on getting the government funded. Keep us updated on that for things we're making time in the meantime --</p><p>DESANTIS: Good to see you, Merry Christmas.</p><p>BREAM: And Merry Christmas to you. All right, coming up, an incredible story of survival and striving of a badly wounded marine. Stick around.</p><p>BREAM: Tonight, a salute to Marine Kyle Carpenter, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on an exploding grenade, saving the life of the fellow Marine. Despite suffering the loss of his right eye and a collapsed lung, Carpenter came home determined to complete his college education.</p><p>He graduated Monday from the University of South Carolina. Carpenter called it one of the most incredible moments since he woke up in the hospital and realized he had a second chance of life. We can never thank him enough and congratulations. Most watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent the evening with us.

That's what Tristram Hunt, the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, called tech billionaires last week. The former Labour MP told the Cliveden Literary Festival that the richest entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and Europe were not following the gilded lead set by the billionaire businessmen of the past. \"Their passions in terms of philanthropy are often not connected to cultural institutions,\" he said. Oliver Barker, the European chairman of Sotheby's auctioneers, who was also at the festival, added that Silicon Valley's elite had little interest in or knowledge of the art market.</p><p>Hunt and Barker have a point - up to a point. They're wrong that techies don't care for art. Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder who is worth $20.5bn (\u00a315.7bn), once showed me round his vast Bond-villain-style home on Mercer Island, 15 minutes' drive from central Seattle, and pointed out works by Monet, Picasso, Renoir and Lichtenstein. He has exhibited many of them to the public at Seattle Art Fair, which he sponsors. He has also founded and funds a museum of pop culture in his hometown, where you can sometimes find some of his other prized possessions: Yoda's cane from Star Wars, Paul Newman's hat from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the black Everlast boxing gloves Robert De Niro wore in Raging Bull.</p><p>Larry Ellison, co-founder of the software giant Oracle, has a large collection of Japanese art. Sixty-four works were exhibited at San Francisco's Asian Art Museum in 2013. Evan Spiegel, co-founder and chief executive of the social media company Snap, owns several works by the contemporary painter Wyatt Mills and commissioned him to paint a mural outside Snap's headquarters in Venice, California - though the two did go to high school together.</p><p>But Hunt and Barker are right that very few of the big-tech bosses support public arts and culture with \"billanthropy\". Look around the main art galleries, theatres and concert halls in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris and you'll find plenty of big names on big buildings - Sainsbury, Getty, Geffen, BP, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Guggenheim, Dorfman, Pritzker, Blavatnik, Clore, Duffield - but they're from the worlds of retail, industry, finance and entertainment. The only big arts venue named after a Silicon Valley titan is the Steve Jobs Theatre, and that's tucked away for Apple's private use in its new $5bn headquarters in Cupertino, California.</p><p>\"It's definitely a cultural shift,\" says Rohan Silva, the creator of London's Tech City initiative, and a former adviser to David Cameron. Why are tech titans so reluctant to show their artistic side?</p><p>Many of the founders of the biggest tech companies do not really see the need to do and be seen to do good works at all, since they think that's already what they do in their day job. Goldman Sachs may need to soften its \"blood-sucking vampire squid\" image by sponsoring the arts, but tech firms argue they're doing \"God's work\". Google is making the world's information available to everyone for free. What could be evil about that? Facebook is connecting the world, with some 2.2bn people using its platform regularly. \"They don't feel ashamed of their business, nor feel they have to civilise themselves or their reputation by putting their name on a new wing or a gallery,\" says Silva.</p><p>Jeff Dauber, a former Apple executive who has a private collection of 325 works of mainly contemporary art at his home in San Francisco, says age is an issue. Many of the new establishment are billionaires, but they are also very young, too young to appreciate art or be confident enough in their judgment to invest either for themselves or on behalf of their company. \"The tech boom has brought a lot of money in, but if you didn't grow up seeing art, spending half a million dollars on one piece can be really intimidating,\" he says. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/art\">Facebook</url> co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, worth $60bn, is 34.</p><p>Advisers to entrepreneurs say many are suspicious of the arts because so many galleries and museums are publicly funded by government and city councils. \"The default techie mindset is: we're new and different. We're disruptors. We're free from the shackles of the past, especially regulation and government that stifle innovation,\" says one leading West Coast executive who works with some of the wealthiest company bosses, so asked not to be named. \"They see the world solely through a private-sector lens.\"</p><p>The techies have side projects, of course. Every self-respecting billionaire needs one. But these tend to be moon shots that chime with their desire to solve practical problems and change the world, not cultural hit-and-hopes. Larry Page, Google co-founder, is personally funding two secretive flying car start-ups: Zee Aero and Kitty Hawk. With his fellow Google founder, Sergey Brin, he is experimenting with putting giant solar-powered wi-fi devices on balloons to bring the internet to remote places on the planet. Soon, people in Burkina Faso will be able to watch Donald Trump mash-up videos on YouTube, too.</p><p>Brin owns the $80m 240ft superyacht Dragonfly, but he's also spending $100m on an \"air yacht\", a giant airship that will bring humanitarian aid to the world's poor. Brin and Page's holding company Alphabet is pouring $750m into a \"longevity lab\" that is researching how we can stay young indefinitely. Ellison also funds \"life extension\" research. \"Death makes me very angry,\" says Ellison, as if it were just another practical problem, such as traffic congestion, that brain power, research and technology can solve. Live for ever?

His goal is to move mining and manufacturing off Earth and into space to safeguard our environment.</p><p>Elon Musk also has his own pocket rocket that he wants to use to help mankind to conquer Mars, which is where some investors in his electric car firm, Tesla, might like to send him after its recent share-price slump. Musk is also backing Open AI, a non-profit organisation that aims to promote and develop \"safe\" artificial intelligence. He's worried that smart machines could all too easily turn against their creators - us - Terminator-style.</p><p>When Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder and early investor in Facebook, is not using his $2.5bn fortune to settle petty scores - he bankrupted media website Gawker because it wrote nasty things about him - he is partial to crafting a survival strategy for himself and his fellow techno-libertarians. He's buying up chunks of New Zealand, a country he sees as a haven of peace and stability blissfully devoid of the roiling backlash against the global elite. Just in case that doesn't work, he is flirting with creating floating offshore city states on man-made islands in international waters.</p><p>None of this is to say that techies don't give to charity. They do. But when they do, they prefer to act in line with their business instincts. That means doing something innovative that has not been tried before, ideally in an area where they can measure the benefits of their largesse with hard data. You can't calibrate the impact of splurging on art, other than perhaps by totting up the personal pleasure it gives the buyer. Data is more precise than Degas.</p><p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which was launched in 2000 with $20bn and whose endowments now total more than $50bn, focuses on global health and education but in a market-oriented way. Rather than helping to cure cancer, which the largest pharmaceutical companies are already trying to do, it focuses on diseases that kill far more people worldwide but attract less interest from big pharma because most of the victims live in developing countries so there is little money to be made from a cure. The best example is malaria, which Gates and his wife say they are on the way to conquering.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. It funds medical research and makes investments in science and education. The couple have pledged an initial $3bn, and 99% of Zuckerberg's Facebook shares over their lifetimes, worth $45bn at the time of its launch. Their most ambitious stated goal is to help cure, manage or prevent all disease by the year 2100.</p><p>Bezos recently pledged $2bn to the Bezos Day One Fund, an initiative to create a network of free Montessori-based pre-schools in needy areas in the US. The Bezos family has also given $35m to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre and $33m for scholarships for undocumented migrants in the US.</p><p>There's an unwieldy name for this kind of giving: philanthrocapitalism. Garry Jenkins, law professor at Minnesota University, describes it as \"directive, controlling, metric-focused and business- oriented\". It sounds anathema to Hunt, but Silva welcomes it as a breath of fresh air.</p><p>\"It's great that the West Coast entrepreneurs are not simply mimicking the approach of the past: make a ton of money, feel bad about how you made it, salve your conscience and launder your reputation by slapping your name on a gallery or two and sit back and wait for your gong,\" he says. \"You might think it's nerdy to scan the horizon for problems to solve and then set yourself wildly ambitious goals supported with billions of dollars, but what's more important: ridding the world of killer diseases or a new statue for Tristram Hunt?\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-48021956</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TF2-W711-F021-631M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1603\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 7, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001X99</classCode><className>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

That's what Tristram Hunt, the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, called tech billionaires last week. The former Labour MP told the Cliveden Literary Festival that the richest entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and Europe were not following the gilded lead set by the billionaire businessmen of the past. \"Their passions in terms of philanthropy are often not connected to cultural institutions,\" he said. Oliver Barker, the European chairman of Sotheby's auctioneers, who was also at the festival, added that Silicon Valley's elite had little interest in or knowledge of the art market.</p><p>Hunt and Barker have a point - up to a point. They're wrong that techies don't care for art. Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder who is worth $20.5bn (\u00a315.7bn), once showed me round his vast Bond-villain-style home on Mercer Island, 15 minutes' drive from central Seattle, and pointed out works by Monet, Picasso, Renoir and Lichtenstein. He has exhibited many of them to the public at Seattle Art Fair, which he sponsors. He has also founded and funds a museum of pop culture in his hometown, where you can sometimes find some of his other prized possessions: Yoda's cane from Star Wars, Paul Newman's hat from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the black Everlast boxing gloves Robert De Niro wore in Raging Bull.</p><p>Larry Ellison, co-founder of the software giant Oracle, has a large collection of Japanese art. Sixtyfour works were exhibited at San Francisco's Asian Art Museum in 2013. Evan Spiegel, co-founder and chief executive of the social media company Snap, owns several works by the contemporary painter Wyatt Mills and commissioned him to paint a mural outside Snap's headquarters in Venice, California - though the two did go to high school together.</p><p>But Hunt and Barker are right that very few of the big-tech bosses support arts and culture with \"billanthropy\". Look around the main art galleries, theatres and concert halls in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris and you'll find plenty of big names on big buildings - Sainsbury, Getty, Geffen, BP, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Guggenheim, Dorfman, Pritzker, Blavatnik, Clore, Duffield - but they're from the worlds of retail, industry, finance and entertainment.</p><p>The only big arts venue named after a Silicon Valley titan is the Steve Jobs Theatre, and that's tucked away for Apple's private use in its new $5bn headquarters in Cupertino, California.</p><p>\"It's definitely a cultural shift,\" says Rohan Silva, the creator of London's Tech City initiative, and a former adviser to David Cameron. Why are tech titans so reluctant to show their artistic side? Many of the founders of the biggest tech companies do not really see the need to do and be seen to do good works at all, since they think that's already what they do in their day job. Goldman Sachs may need to soften its \"blood-sucking vampire squid\" image by sponsoring the arts, but tech firms argue they're doing \"God's work\". Google is making the world's information available to everyone for free. What could be evil about that? Facebook is connecting the world, with some 2.2bn people using its platform regularly. \"They don't feel ashamed of their business, nor feel they have to civilise themselves or their reputation by putting their name on a new wing or a gallery,\" says Silva.</p><p>Jeff Dauber, a former Apple executive who has a private collection of 325 works of mainly contemporary art at his home in San Francisco, says age is an issue. Many of the new establishment are bilpublic lionaires, but they are also very young, too young to appreciate art or be confident enough in their judgment to invest either for themselves or on behalf of their company. \"The tech boom has brought a lot of money in, but if you didn't grow up seeing art, spending half a million dollars on one piece can be really intimidating,\" he says. The Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, worth $60bn, is 34.</p><p>Advisers to entrepreneurs say many are suspicious of the arts because so many galleries and museums are publicly funded by government and city councils. \"The default techie mindset is: we're new and different. We're disruptors. We're free from the shackles of the past, especially regulation and government that stifle innovation,\" says one leading West Coast executive who works with some of the wealthiest company bosses, so asked not to be named. \"They see the world solely through a private-sector lens.\"</p><p>The techies have side projects, of course. Every self-respecting billionaire needs one. But these tend to be moon shots that chime with their desire to solve practical problems and change the world, not cultural hit-and-hopes. Larry Page, Google co-founder, is personally funding two secretive flying car start-ups: Zee Aero and Kitty Hawk. With his fellow Google founder, Sergey Brin, he is experimenting with putting giant solar-powered wi-fi devices on balloons to bring the internet to remote places on the planet. Soon, people in Burkina Faso will be able to watch Donald Trump mash-up videos on YouTube, too.</p><p>Brin owns the $80m 240ft superyacht Dragonfly, but he's also spending $100m on an \"air yacht\", a giant airship that will bring humanitarian aid to the world's poor. Brin and Page's holding company Alphabet is pouring $750m into a \"longevity lab\" that is researching how we can stay young indefinitely. Ellison also funds \"life extension\" research. \"Death makes me very angry,\" says Ellison, as if it were just another practical problem, such as traffic congestion, that brain power, research and technology can solve. Live for ever? Click here.</p><p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, who is the world's richest man worth $157bn, is investing $1bn a year in Blue Origin, his space exploration company, which has already launched several rockets into orbit that have successfully returned to Earth. His goal is to move mining and manufacturing off Earth and into space to safeguard our environment.</p><p>Elon Musk also has his own pocket rocket that he wants to use to help mankind to conquer Mars, which is where some investors in his electric car firm, Billionaires are pouring money into, from above left, flying cars, mobile solar-powered wi-fi, and healthcare Tesla, might like to send him after its recent share-price slump. Musk is also backing Open AI, a non-profit organisation that aims to promote and develop \"safe\" artificial intelligence. He's worried that smart machines could all too easily turn against their creators - us - Terminator-style.</p><p>When Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder and early investor in Facebook, is not using his $2.5bn fortune to settle petty scores - he bankrupted media website Gawker because it wrote nasty things about him - he is partial to crafting a survival strategy for himself and his fellow techno-libertarians. He's buying up chunks of New Zealand, a country he sees as a haven of peace and stability blissfully devoid of the roiling backlash against the global elite. Just in case that doesn't work, he is flirting with creating floating offshore city states on man-made islands in international waters.</p><p>None of this is to say that techies don't give to charity. They do. But when they do, they prefer to act in line with their business instincts. That means doing something innovative that has not been tried before, ideally in an area where they can measure the benefits of their largesse with hard data. You can't calibrate the impact of splurging on art, other than perhaps by totting up the personal pleasure it gives the buyer. Data is more precise than Degas.</p><p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which was launched in 2000 with $20bn and whose endowments now total more than $50bn, focuses on global health and education but in a market-oriented way. Rather than helping to cure cancer, which the largest pharmaceutical companies are already trying to do, it focuses on diseases that kill far more people worldwide but attract less interest from big pharma because most of the victims live in developing countries so there is little money to be made from a cure. The best example is malaria, which Gates and his wife say they are on the way to conquering.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. It funds medical research and makes investments in science and education. The couple have pledged an initial $3bn, and 99% of Zuckerberg's Facebook shares over their lifetimes, worth $45bn at the time of its launch. Their most ambitious stated goal is to help cure, manage or prevent all disease by the year 2100.</p><p>Bezos recently pledged $2bn to the Bezos Day One Fund, an initiative to create a network of free Montessoribased pre-schools in needy areas in the US. The Bezos family has also given $35m to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre and $33m for scholarships for undocumented migrants in the US.</p><p>There's an unwieldy name for this kind of giving: philanthrocapitalism. Garry Jenkins, law professor at Minnesota University, describes it as \"directive, controlling, metric-focused and businessoriented\". It sounds anathema to Hunt, but Silva welcomes it as a breath of fresh air.</p><p>\"It's great that the West Coast entrepreneurs are not simply mimicking the approach of the past: make a ton of money, feel bad about how you made it, salve your conscience and launder your reputation by slapping your name on a gallery or two and sit back and wait for your gong,\" he says. \"You might think it's nerdy to scan the horizon for problems to solve and then set yourself wildly ambitious goals supported with billions of dollars, but what's more important: ridding the world of killer diseases or a new statue for Tristram Hunt?\"</p><p>Techies don't see the need to do good works.

That's what Tristram Hunt, the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, called tech billionaires last week. The former Labour MP told the Cliveden Literary Festival that the richest entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and Europe were not following the gilded lead set by the billionaire businessmen of the past. \"Their passions in terms of philanthropy are often not connected to cultural institutions,\" he said. Oliver Barker, the European chairman of Sotheby's auctioneers, who was also at the festival, added that Silicon Valley's elite had little interest in or knowledge of the art market.</p><p>Hunt and Barker have a point - up to a point. They're wrong that techies don't care for art. Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder who is worth $20.5bn ((EURO)17.7bn), once showed me round his vast Bond-villain-style home on Mercer Island, 15 minutes' drive from central Seattle, and pointed out works by Monet, Picasso, Renoir and Lichtenstein. He has exhibited many of them to the public at Seattle Art Fair, which he sponsors. He has also founded and funds a museum of pop culture in his hometown, where you can sometimes find some of his other prized possessions: Yoda's cane from Star Wars, Paul Newman's hat from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the black Everlast boxing gloves Robert De Niro wore in Raging Bull.</p><p>Larry Ellison, co-founder of the software giant Oracle, has a large collection of Japanese art. Sixtyfour works were exhibited at San Francisco's Asian Art Museum in 2013. Evan Spiegel, co-founder and chief executive of the social media company Snap, owns several works by the contemporary painter Wyatt Mills and commissioned him to paint a mural outside Snap's headquarters in Venice, California - though the two did go to high school together.</p><p>But Hunt and Barker are right that very few of the big-tech bosses support public arts and culture with \"billanthropy\". Look around the main art galleries, theatres and concert halls in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris and you'll find plenty of big names on big buildings - Sainsbury, Getty, Geffen, BP, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Guggenheim, Dorfman, Pritzker, Blavatnik, Clore, Duffield - but they're from the worlds of retail, industry, finance and entertainment. The only big arts venue named after a Silicon Valley titan is the Steve Jobs Theatre, and that's tucked away for Apple's private use in its new $5bn headquarters in Cupertino, California.</p><p>\"It's definitely a cultural shift,\" says Rohan Silva, the creator of Lon-don's Tech City initiative, and a former adviser to David Cameron. Why are tech titans so reluctant to show their artistic side? Many of the founders of the biggest tech companies do not really see the need to do and be seen to do good works at all, since they think that's already what they do in their day job. Goldman Sachs may need to soften its \"blood-sucking vampire squid\" image by sponsoring the arts, but tech firms argue they're doing \"God's work\". Google is making the world's information available to everyone for free. What could be evil about that? Facebook is connecting the world, with some 2.2bn people using its platform regularly. \"They don't feel ashamed of their business, nor feel they have to civilise themselves or their reputation by putting their name on a new wing or a gallery,\" says Silva.</p><p>Jeff Dauber, a former Apple executive who has a private collection of 325 works of mainly contemporary art at his home in San Francisco, says age is an issue.</p><p>Many of the new establishment are billionaires, but they are also very young, too young to appreciate art or be confident enough in their judgment to invest either for themselves or on behalf of their company. \"The tech boom has brought a lot of money in, but if you didn't grow up seeing art, spending half a million dollars on one piece can be really intimidating,\" he says. The Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, worth $60bn, is 34.</p><p>Advisers to entrepreneurs say many are suspicious of the arts because so many galleries and museums are publicly funded by government and city councils. \"The default techie mindset is: we're new and different. We're disruptors. We're free from the shackles of the past, especially regulation and government that stifle innovation,\" says one leading West Coast executive who works with some of the wealthiest company bosses, so asked not to be named. \"They see the world solely through a private-sector lens.\"</p><p>The techies have side projects, of course. Every self-respecting billionaire needs one. But these tend to be moon shots that chime with their desire to solve practical problems and change the world, not cultural hit-and-hopes. Larry Page, Google co-founder, is personally funding two secretive flying car start-ups: Zee Aero and Kitty Hawk. With his fellow Google founder, Sergey Brin, he is experimenting with putting giant solar-powered wi-fi devices on balloons to bring the internet to remote places on the planet.</p><p>Soon, people in Burkina Faso will be able to watch Donald Trump mash-up videos on YouTube, too.</p><p>Brin owns the $80m 240ft superyacht Dragonfly, but he's also spending $100m on an \"air yacht\", a giant airship that will bring humanitarian aid to the world's poor. Brin and Page's holding company Alphabet is pouring $750m into a \"longevity lab\" that is researching how we can stay young indefinitely. Ellison also funds \"life extension\" research. \"Death makes me very angry,\" says Ellison, as if it were just another practical problem, such as traffic congestion, that brain power, research and technology can solve. Live for ever? Click here.</p><p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, who is the world's richest man worth $157bn, is investing $1bn a year in Blue Origin, his space exploration company, which has already launched several rockets into orbit that have successfully returned to Earth. His goal is to move mining and manufacturing off Earth and into space to safeguard our environment.</p><p>Elon Musk also has his own pocket rocket that he wants to use to help mankind to conquer Mars, which is where some investors in his electric car firm, Tesla, might like to send him after its recent share-price slump. Musk is also backing Open AI, a non-profit organisation that aims to promote and develop \"safe\" artificial intelligence. He's worried that smart machines could all too easily turn against their creators - us - Terminator-style.</p><p>When Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder and early investor in Facebook, is not using his $2.5bn fortune to settle petty scores - he bankrupted media website Gawker because it wrote nasty things about him - he is partial to crafting a survival strategy for himself and his fellow techno-libertarians. He's buying up chunks of New Zealand, a country he sees as a haven of peace and stability blissfully devoid of the roiling backlash against the global elite. Just in case that doesn't work, he is flirting with creating floating offshore city states on man-made islands in international waters.</p><p>None of this is to say that techies don't give to charity. They do. But when they do, they prefer to act in line with their business instincts. That means doing something innovative that has not been tried before, ideally in an area where they can measure the benefits of their largesse with hard data. You can't calibrate the impact of splurging on art, other than perhaps by totting up the personal pleasure it gives the buyer. Data is more precise than Degas. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which was launched in 2000 with $20bn and whose endowments now total more than $50bn, focuses on global health and education but in a market-oriented way. Rather than helping to cure cancer, which the largest pharmaceutical companies are already trying to do, it focuses on diseases that kill far more people worldwide but attract less interest from big pharma because most of the victims live in developing countries so there is little money to be made from a cure. The best example is malaria, which Gates and his wife say they are on the way to conquering.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. It funds medical research and makes investments in science and education. The couple have pledged an initial $3bn, and 99% of Zuckerberg's Facebook shares over their lifetimes, worth $45bn at the time of its launch. Their most ambitious stated goal is to help cure, manage or prevent all disease by the year 2100.</p><p>Bezos recently pledged $2bn to the Bezos Day One Fund, an initiative to create a network of free Montessoribased pre-schools in needy areas in the US. The Bezos family has also given $35m to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre and $33m for scholarships for undocumented migrants in the US.</p><p>There's an unwieldy name for this kind of giving: philanthrocapitalism. Garry Jenkins, law professor at Minnesota University, describes it as \"directive, controlling, metric-focused and businessoriented\". It sounds anathema to Hunt, but Silva welcomes it as a breath of fresh air.</p><p>\"It's great that the West Coast entrepreneurs are not simply mimicking the approach of the past: make a ton of money, feel bad about how you made it, salve your conscience and launder your reputation by slapping your name on a gallery or two and sit back and wait for your gong,\" he says. \"You might think it's nerdy to scan the horizon for problems to solve and then set yourself wildly ambitious goals supported with billions of dollars, but what's more important: ridding the world of killer diseases or a new statue for Tristram Hunt?\"</p><p>Techies don't see the need to do good works. They think they do that already in their job</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Musk: backs 'safe' AIBezos: $2bn schools donorBillionaires are pouring money into, from above left, flying cars, mobile solar-powered wi-fi, and healthcare</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-142344771</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS3-T8N1-JCBW-N04K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 7, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001X99</classCode><className>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;
