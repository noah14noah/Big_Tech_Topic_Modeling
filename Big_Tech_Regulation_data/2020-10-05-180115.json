No wonder so many fearful guardians of the status quo are working so hard to remove him from office. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/380300245\">https://player.vimeo.com/video/380300245</url>[1]From the White House, Washington DC, December 17, 2019 To: The Honorable Nancy PelosiSpeaker of the House of RepresentativesWashington, D.C. 20515 Dear Madam Speaker: I write to express my strongest and most powerful protest against the partisan impeachment crusade being pursued by the Democrats in the House of Representatives. This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers, unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history. The Articles of Impeachment introduced by the House Judiciary Committee are not recognizable under any standard of Constitutional theory, interpretation, or jurisprudence. They include no crimes, no misdemeanors, and no offenses whatsoever. You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment! By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy. You dare to invoke the Founding Fathers in pursuit of this election-nullification scheme yet your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America's founding and your egregious conduct threatens to destroy that which our Founders pledged their very lives to build. Even worse than offending the Founding Fathers, you are offending Americans of faith by continually saying 'I pray for the President,' when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense. It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I! Your first claim, 'Abuse of Power,' is a completely disingenuous, meritless, and baseless invention of your imagination. You know that I had a totally innocent conversation with the President of Ukraine. I then had a second conversation that has been misquoted, mischaracterized, and fraudulently misrepresented. Fortunately, there was a transcript of the conversation taken, and you know from the transcript (which was immediately made available) that the paragraph in question was perfect. I said to President Zelensky: 'I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.' I said do us a favor, not me, and our country, not a campaign. I then mentioned the Attorney General of the United States. Every time I talk with a foreign leader, I put America's interests first, just as I did with President Zelensky. You are turning a policy disagreement between two branches of government into an impeachable offense it is no more legitimate than the Executive Branch charging members of Congress with crimes for the lawful exercise of legislative power. You know full well that Vice President Biden used his office and $1 billion dollars of U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing the prosecutor who was digging into the company paying his son millions of dollars. You know this because Biden bragged about it on video. Biden openly stated: 'I said, 'I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars'I looked at them and said: 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.' Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it 'looked bad.' Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely accusing me of doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actually did. President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong, and that there was No Pressure. He further emphasized that it was a 'good phone call,' that 'I don't feel pressure,' and explicitly stressed that 'nobody pushed me.' The Ukrainian Foreign Minister stated very clearly: 'I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance.' He also said there was 'No Pressure.' Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a supporter of Ukraine who met privately with President Zelensky, has said: 'At no time during this meetingwas there any mention by Zelensky or any Ukrainian that they were feeling pressure to do anything in return for the military aid.' Many meetings have been held between representatives of Ukraine and our country. Never once did Ukraine complain about pressure being applied not once! Ambassador Sondland testified that I told him: 'No quid pro quo. I want nothing. I want nothing. I want President Zelensky to do the right thing, do what he ran on.' The second claim, so-called 'Obstruction of Congress,' is preposterous and dangerous. House Democrats are trying to impeach the duly elected President of the United States for asserting Constitutionally based privileges that have been asserted on a bipartisan basis by administrations of both political parties throughout our Nation's history. Under that standard, every American president would have been impeached many times over. As liberal law professor Jonathan Turley warned when addressing Congressional Democrats: 'I can't emphasize this enoughif you impeach a president, if you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power. It's your abuse of power. You're doing precisely what you're criticizing the President for doing.' Everyone, you included, knows what is really happening. Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306-227), and you and your party have never recovered from this defeat. You have developed a full-fledged case of what many in the media call Trump Derangement Syndrome and sadly, you will never get over it! You are unwilling and unable to accept the verdict issued at the ballot box during the great Election of 2016. So you have spent three straight years attempting to overturn the will of the American people and nullify their votes. You view democracy as your enemy! Speaker Pelosi, you admitted just last week at a public forum that your party's impeachment effort has been going on for 'two and a half years,' long before you ever heard about a phone call with Ukraine. Nineteen minutes after I took the oath of office, the Washington Post published a story headlined, 'The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.' Less than three months after my inauguration, Representative Maxine Waters stated, 'I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached.' House Democrats introduced the first impeachment resolution against me within months of my inauguration, for what will be regarded as one of our country's best decisions, the firing of James Comey (see Inspector General Reports) who the world now knows is one of the dirtiest cops our Nation has ever seen. A ranting and raving Congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib, declared just hours after she was sworn into office, 'We're gonna go in there and we're gonna impeach the motherf****r.' Representative Al Green said in May, 'I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected.' Again, you and your allies said, and did, all of these things long before you ever heard of President Zelensky or anything related to Ukraine. As you know very well, this impeachment drive has nothing to do with Ukraine, or the totally appropriate conversation I had with its new president. It only has to do with your attempt to undo the election of 2016 and steal the election of 2020! Congressman Adam Schiff cheated and lied all the way up to the present day, even going so far as to fraudulently make up, out of thin air, my conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine and read this fantasy language to Congress as though it were said by me. His shameless lies and deceptions, dating all the way back to the Russia Hoax, is one of the main reasons we are here today. You and your party are desperate to distract from America's extraordinary economy, incredible jobs boom, record stock market, soaring confidence, and flourishing citizens. Your party simply cannot compete with our record: 7 million new jobs; the lowest-ever unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans; a rebuilt military; a completely reformed VA with Choice and Accountability for our great veterans; more than 170 new federal judges and two Supreme Court Justices; historic tax and regulation cuts; the elimination of the individual mandate; the first decline in prescription drug prices in half a century; the first new branch of the United States Military since 1947, the Space Force; strong protection of the Second Amendment; criminal justice reform; a defeated ISIS caliphate and the killing of the world's number one terrorist leader, al-Baghdadi; the replacement of the disastrous NAFTA trade deal with the wonderful USMCA (Mexico and Canada); a breakthrough Phase One trade deal with China; massive new trade deals with Japan and South Korea; withdrawal from the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal; cancellation of the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord; becoming the world's top energy producer; recognition of Israel's capital, opening the American Embassy in Jerusalem, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; a colossal reduction in illegal border crossings, the ending of Catch-and-Release, and the building of the Southern Border Wall and that is just the beginning, there is so much more. You cannot defend your extreme policies open borders, mass migration, high crime, crippling taxes, socialized healthcare, destruction of American energy, late-term taxpayer-funded abortion, elimination of the Second Amendment, radical far-left theories of law and justice, and constant partisan obstruction of both common sense and common good. There is nothing I would rather do than stop referring to your party as the Do-Nothing Democrats. Unfortunately, I don't know that you will ever give me a chance to do so. After three years of unfair and unwarranted investigations, 45 million dollars spent, 18 angry Democrat prosecutors, the entire force of the FBI, headed by leadership now proven to be totally incompetent and corrupt, you have found NOTHING! Few people in high position could have endured or passed this test. You do not know, nor do you care, the great damage and hurt you have inflicted upon wonderful and loving members of my family. You conducted a fake investigation upon the democratically elected President of the United States, and you are doing it yet again. There are not many people who could have taken the punishment inflicted during this period of time, and yet done so much for the success of America and its citizens. But instead of putting our country first, you have decided to disgrace our country still further. You completely failed with the Mueller report because there was nothing to find, so you decided to take the next hoax that came along, the phone call with Ukraine even though it was a perfect call. And by the way, when I speak to foreign countries, there are many people, with permission, listening to the call on both sides of the conversation. You are the ones interfering in America's elections. You are the ones subverting America's Democracy. You are the ones Obstructing Justice. You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political, and partisan gain. Before the Impeachment Hoax, it was the Russian Witch Hunt. Against all evidence, and regardless of the truth, you and your deputies claimed that my campaign colluded with the Russians a grave, malicious, and slanderous lie, a falsehood like no other. You forced our Nation through turmoil and torment over a wholly fabricated story, illegally purchased from a foreign spy by Hillary Clinton and the DNC in order to assault our democracy. Yet, when the monstrous lie was debunked and this Democrat conspiracy dissolved into dust, you did not apologize. You did not recant. You did not ask to be forgiven. You showed no remorse, no capacity for self-reflection. Instead, you pursued your next libelous and vicious crusade you engineered an attempt to frame and defame an innocent person. All of this was motivated by personal political calculation. Your Speakership and your party are held hostage by your most deranged and radical representatives of the far left. Each one of your members lives in fear of a socialist primary challenger this is what is driving impeachment. Look at Congressman Nadler's challenger. Look at yourself and others. Do not take our country down with your party. If you truly cared about freedom and liberty for our Nation, then you would be devoting your vast investigative resources to exposing the full truth concerning the FBI's horrifying abuses of power before, during, and after the 2016 election including the use of spies against my campaign, the submission of false evidence to a FISA court, and the concealment of exculpatory evidence in order to frame the innocent. The FBI has great and honorable people, but the leadership was inept and corrupt. I would think that you would personally be appalled by these revelations, because in your press conference the day you announced impeachment, you tied the impeachment effort directly to the completely discredited Russia Hoax, declaring twice that 'all roads lead to Putin,' when you know that is an abject lie. I have been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever even thought to be. Any member of Congress who votes in support of impeachment against every shred of truth, fact, evidence, and legal principle is showing how deeply they revile the voters and how truly they detest America's Constitutional order. Our Founders feared the tribalization of partisan politics, and you are bringing their worst fears to life. Worse still, I have been deprived of basic Constitutional Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present. I have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses, like the so-called whistleblower who started this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was made. Once I presented the transcribed call, which surprised and shocked the fraudsters (they never thought that such evidence would be presented), the so-called whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, disappeared because they got caught, their report was a fraud, and they were no longer going to be made available to us. In other words, once the phone call was made public, your whole plot blew up, but that didn't stop you from continuing. More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials. You and others on your committees have long said impeachment must be bipartisan it is not. You said it was very divisive it certainly is, even far more than you ever thought possible and it will only get worse! This is nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup that will, based on recent sentiment, badly fail at the voting booth. You are not just after me, as President, you are after the entire Republican Party. But because of this colossal injustice, our party is more united than it has ever been before. History will judge you harshly as you proceed with this impeachment charade. Your legacy will be that of turning the House of Representatives from a revered legislative body into a Star Chamber of partisan persecution. Perhaps most insulting of all is your false display of solemnity. You apparently have so little respect for the American People that you expect them to believe that you are approaching this impeachment somberly, reservedly, and reluctantly. No intelligent person believes what you are saying. Since the moment I won the election, the Democrat Party has been possessed by Impeachment Fever. There is no reticence. This is not a somber affair. You are making a mockery of impeachment and you are scarcely concealing your hatred of me, of the Republican Party, and tens of millions of patriotic Americans. The voters are wise, and they are seeing straight through this empty, hollow, and dangerous game you are playing. I have no doubt the American people will hold you and the Democrats fully responsible in the upcoming 2020 election. They will not soon forgive your perversion of justice and abuse of power. There is far too much that needs to be done to improve the lives of our citizens. It is time for you and the highly partisan Democrats in Congress to immediately cease this impeachment fantasy and get back to work for the American People. While I have no expectation that you will do so, I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record. One hundred years from now, when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it, and learn from it, so that it can never happen to another President again. Sincerely yours, DONALD J.

It sounds childish to describe it with such simple adjectives, but ultimately, it's true. The idea of the President of the United States, the leader of the free world, essentially being fired is one that is difficult to wrap one's head around. This is especially the case for investors who've seen political issues inspire volatility in the market for years now. When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she was opening an impeachment inquiry, the market's first reaction was a negative one. The Dow fell triple digits and the S&amp;P 500 closed the day down nearly 1%. Jim Cramer recently referred to the impeachment process as a  Uncertainty is never good for markets, yet in this case, I think the political circus that is likely to play itself out in our nation's capital over the impeachment issue can be really bullish for big-tech names like Alphabet  and Facebook  .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Looking For A Safe Haven </emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Global trade concerns have weighed on the major market averages for months now and one of the big concerns for the market is that the impeachment process will result in a lame duck Congress that will put trade agreements, like the USMCA, in jeopardy. Law makers have said in recent days that the trade talks will continue throughout the impeachment proceedings, yet bipartisan deals seem more unlikely now than ever.</p><p>One would imagine that with so many trade tensions tainting market sentiment, investors nervous about economically sensitive assets would flock towards secular growth stories that would experience a relatively slight impact. This is the type of environment that big-tech used to thrive in. However, when FANG -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet -- began to be demonized by Congress it lost some of its safe-haven status.</p><p>In recent years, I think the divide between the two parties of the American political system has widened. Throughout the Trump administration's time in the White House, there have been very few things that both sides of the political aisle agree about. However, something that both Democrats and Republicans appeared to agree on was that the rising power that corporations in Silicon Valley possess is an issue that needs to be addressed.  regarding recent merger activity as a part of an anti-trust probe. And Facebook  last week to discuss potential internet regulation. These headlines have caused the FANG names to lose some of their luster. </p><p>But, assuming that political gridlock in Washington D.C. increases as both parties hunker down for a knock-down, drag-out fight over the White House, I suspect that the Trump investigations will cause the crosshairs that have put on big-tech to shift. I wouldn't be surprised to see the regulatory pressures recently placed on names like Facebook and Alphabet ease in the short-term.</p><p>This will allow investors to focus on things like sales growth and free cash flows rather than congressional hearings and  . This bodes well for Facebook and Alphabet because the fundamentals of these two companies remain attractive.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Not All FANGs Are Created Equally </emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>I've always dividend the FANG group into two parts with Facebook FB and Alphabet GOOGL on one side and Amazon AMZN and Netflix  on the other. Facebook and Alphabet generally trade with attractive valuations that are easily justified by their underlying fundamentals. Amazon and Netflix have traditionally traded with much more speculative valuations due to their underwhelming bottom-line results.</p><p>Facebook's trailing twelve-month earnings per share is $6.73. That represents a ttm price-to-earnings ratio of 26.7 at the company's current $180 share price. This may seem expensive at first glance, but considering that analysts expect to see Facebook produce earnings growth of 53% in 2020 and another 18% on top of that in 2021, the company's forward looking multiples are quite cheap. Furthermore, Facebook has generated more than $15 billion of free cash flow during the last year. The company's free cash flow has increased by nearly 5x during the last 5 years.</p><p>In short, this isn't your typical speculatively valued, high-growth tech name that trades with a sales multiple because it can't turn a profit. Facebook is highly profitable with strong sales growth and high margins and an attractive balance sheet that most conservative, value-oriented investors would be interested in.</p><p>Alphabet is not growing its cash flows quite as fast as Facebook, but it has increased FCF by 4x during the last 5 years. Obviously, that is nothing to scoff at. Alphabet generated more than $27 billion in free cash flow during the trailing twelve months and nearly $50 in earnings per share. These earnings represent a 25x ttm P/E multiple at Alphabet's current $1,242 share price. Analysts are expecting to see EPS growth in the mid-teens moving forward, resulting in attractive forward looking P/E and PEG ratios.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ignore the Noise and Focus on the Fundamentals </emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Even if the House moves to impeach, I think it's likely that the Republican controlled Senate will acquit President Trump. In other words, when all of this is said and done, it's likely that the impeachment proceedings will be more of a political sideshow than anything else.</p><p>Remember, the market rallied by double digits during the Clinton administration during the process that saw him impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate. Looking back at the long-term charts, we see that the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 30% from the time that details began to emerge about Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and the ultimate Senate acquittal.</p><p>That process took about a year to play out and while I don't expect to see the major averages to rally another 30% from their current levels, which are already near all-time highs, over the next 12 months or so, I do think history can serve as a guide to provide solace to investors who are concerned about the market's potential reaction to the recent political news. </p><p>The past cannot be counted on as an accurate predictor of the future. This is a lesson that is taught in investing 101. However, I think another basic investing principle should be followed during these volatile times: ignore the noise and focus on high quality companies with attractive valuations and improving fundamentals.</p><p>Doing so will remove fear and greed from the equation and those two variables, more than anything else (including impeachment headlines) are what ultimately lead towards subpar returns.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon.com are holdings in Jim Cramer's </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

It was a historic day in Washington as lawmakers unveiled <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">articles of impeachment</url> against President Trump. The move brings a sitting president to the brink of removal from office for the fourth time in American history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two articles charge Mr. Trump with abusing his power and obstructing Congress, and assert that he \u201cignored and injured the interests of the Nation\u201d in \u201ccorruptly soliciting\u201d election assistance from the government of Ukraine in the form of investigations that would smear his Democratic political rivals. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">Read the articles of impeachment</url>, being reviewed above before the release by the House Judiciary Committee.

Democrats had more on their agenda, reaching a deal to bring President Trump\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">new North American trade pact to a vote</url>.</p><p>The new provisions, solidified after months of negotiations between House Democrats and the Trump administration, would strengthen the trade deal\u2019s protections for workers.</p><p>The agreement handed the administration one of its biggest legislative victories just an hour after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced formal charges against Mr. Trump. Democrats are also on the verge of approving a bipartisan defense bill and a bill that would lower the cost of prescription drugs. </p><p>The outbreak of cooperation amid impeachment proceedings <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/nyt-now-evening-briefing?module=inline\">was hardly an accident</url>.

Hate on the rise, CNN's survey shows worrying trends of anti-Semitism in  Europe.  And gene editing outrage, China orders an over a scientist's claim  that he created the world's first genetically modified babies.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A tense standoff between Russia and Ukraine is escalating in the waters of  Crimea.  Ukrainian lawmakers have voted to impose 30 days of Martial Law in  parts of the country beginning on Wednesday.  This includes border areas  with Russia.  It follows Sunday's naval confrontation in the Kerch Strait.   Take a look at this video appears shows a Russian ship ramming the  Ukrainian tugboat, but the Kremlin accuses Ukraine of being the aggressor  calling the incident a quote, \"dangerous provocation by Kiev.\"  Russia  seized three Ukrainian ships and detained two dozen sailors.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, we are following this story from all angles.  We have CNN's Matthew  Chance live for us in Moscow, but first, let's go to Nick Paton Walsh in  Kiev, and Nick, Ukraine is, again, preparing for martial law.  What will it  look like when it goes into effect tomorrow?  </p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, we don't  actually know, in all honesty.  It's the first time it's being implemented  and we know that on paper we're expected to see sort of heightened military  activity defenses, cyber defenses predominantly limited to 10 regions of  the country, all of which have one thing on common, they border parts of  Russia where there are Russian troops or Russian backed separatists.  </p><p>But given this has never happened in the country before, I think many are  approaching it with some degree of anxiety here, not at least because there  are elections ahead.  It should well be over before March's presidential  vote, but it's sort of bringing perhaps an air of uncertainty here as to  exactly what that will do, although there are guarantees from the President  that Constitutional rights will be protected.  </p><p>The kremlin, though, have wasted no time, their spokesperson saying that  it's a barely camouflaged overtone of a bid to try and raise tension here.   And I presume they will be suggesting the blockades may be in place towards  separatist areas which will make things worse.  </p><p>I have to say, there's very little doubt I think that the tension will rise  once Martial Law is potentially in place albeit perhaps because Russia may  seek to exploit that.  But there's an important thing to remember here,  Kristie.  You know, this is not an incident and is an isolation.  </p><p>Ukraine has been in at war with Russia and Russian-backed separatists for  four years now, on and off.  And people die every week in the front lines  in the east.  So we're looking at a very public, globally discussed  incident here, but it's symptomatic frankly of Russia pushing Ukraine and  at times, Ukraine not quite being as internationally backed or coordinated  in its response as some people might like to see.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, there has been this growing tension between both sides  since Crimea was annexed back in 2014.  Let's go to Matthew Chance standing  by in Moscow now and Matthew, your thoughts on the politics of this rising  tension.  Could it actually benefit Vladimir Putin whose approval ratings  there are flagging?  </p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, it's  certainly possible, and you're right to say that Vladimir Putin's normally  sky high approval ratings which are regularly in the mid-80s in terms of  percentage points have dipped over the past several months, partly because  of the economic climate and the lack of economic growth in this country.  </p><p>And, of course, in the past when the Crimean peninsula was annexed by  Russia back in 2014, that led to an enormous sort of  nationalistic boost  for Vladimir Putin and even opposition voices in the country to a large  extent.  Closed ranks and supported the President in that - what we've seen  as a national effort.  </p><p>And so reintroducing the Ukrainian bogeyman, as it were, may well prove to  be beneficial for those popularity ratings, whether or not that was the  motivation for this I think is something for people to debate, but equally  on the other side, and Nick just referred to this, the Kremlin says that  this was a crisis that was orchestrated for political reasons by the  Ukrainians.  </p><p>[08:05:05]  </p><p>CHANCE:  The Ukrainian President is also suffering terrible polling  figures.  He's going into an election cycle next year.  And, you know, the  speculation here in Moscow is that this was orchestrated in order to change  that for him and to make him more popular.  And so I think the takeout from  that is that perhaps both presidents, ironically, of Russia and of Ukraine  may stand to benefit from this renewed standoff.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Domestic politics play in both countries, both sides blaming the  other. Matthew Chance reporting live from Moscow.  Nick Paton Walsh live  for us in Kiev, thank you.  </p><p>Western powers, they are furious over Russia's aggression and they are  calling for de-escalation.  Here is what the outgoing US Ambassador to the  UN said about the incident.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>NIKKI HALEY, US AMBASSADOR TO THE UN:  This is no way for a law-abiding  civilized nation to act.  Impeding Ukraine's lawful transit through the  Kerch Strait is a violation under international law.  It is an arrogant act  that the international community must condemn and will never accept.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  And while American diplomats condemn Russia's actions, US  President Donald Trump appears hesitant to do the same.  Let's bring in  CNN's Joe Johns.  He joins us live from the White House.  And Joe, we heard  a pretty tough reaction from Ambassador Haley, but why is Donald Trump  hesitant to condemn Russia here?  </p><p>JOE JOHNS, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Million-dollar question,  I think.  And as you know, Kristie, this isn't the first time the President  has been tepid on a response to the - if you will, aggression by Russia  toward Ukraine.  Let's just listen to the President's response that has  been seen as quite tepid as compared to his UN Ambassador, others in his  administration as well as a number of western leaders have been quite clear  in condemning it.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've let our position be  known and we're not happy about it.  We do not like what's happening;  either way, we don't like what's happening and hopefully, it will get  straightened out.  I know Europe is - they are not thrilled.  They are  working on it, too.  We're all working on it together.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JOHNS:  So back to your question at the top, Kristie, why?  Why is the  President seemingly fairly tepid on all of this?  Especially given the fact  that he's likely to meet Vladimir Putin at the G-20 in Buenos Aires later  this week.  Anybody's guess.  We do know there has been a level of intrigue  involving this administration, this President and Russia going all the way  back to the 2016 campaign, the ensuing investigation into Russian  interference in that election and anybody's guess, though, at the bottom  why this President doesn't step out there like so many others, both western  leaders and even people in his own administration.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, and tepid is the word when we hear from the President  saying, \"Yes, it will get straightened out somehow.\"  And looking ahead to  that G-20 Summit between Trump and Putin, and judging from his language and  his past encounters, will Trump press Vladimir Putin not only on Ukraine,  but on other hot button issues like election interference?  </p><p>JOHNS:  Again, anybody's guess.  We are hoping later today to get some more  information about the approach this administration is going to take to that  meeting with Putin and others, whether it's going to be formal or another  pull aside, as has occurred in the past.  </p><p>But one thing that is clear, this President continues to be reluctant to go  after Russia on a variety of different issues including Ukraine.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Joe Johns, live at the White House, thank you.  Now, Donald  Trump is warning Apple products imported from China could be one of several  products hit with hefty new tariffs.  That's if the two countries can't  work something out at this week's G-20 Summit.  </p><p>Mr. Trump told \"The Wall Street Journal\" it was highly unlikely he would  accept an offer by the Chinese President aimed at averting a third round of  US tariffs on more than $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.  Apple's stock  fell 1.5 percentage points in after-hours trading on Monday following that  interview.  It is still in the red as we approach the bell Tuesday morning  in New York.  </p><p>Now, President Trump also dealt a blow to a trade deal across the Atlantic  on Tuesday by throwing his weight behind those criticizing the British  Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan.  He said that the deal was  unclear on Britain's freedom to trade with the US in the future.  Take a  listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  Right now, if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade  with us and that wouldn't be a good thing.  I don't think they meant that.  </p><p>[08:10:04]  </p><p>TRUMP:  I don't think that the Prime Minister meant that and hopefully  she'll be able to do something about that, but right now, as the deal  stands, she may not - they may  not be able to trade with the US and I  don't think they want that at all.  That would be a very big negative for  the deal.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Nina dos Santos joins us now from London.  And Nina, Theresa  May's deal roundly criticized by President Trump and not only that,  criticized by MPs in the House of Commons.  How damaging is this for her  and her big sales pitch going forward?  </p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, it's not the first time that  Donald Trump has criticized Theresa May.  You remember famously on the  visit, the state visit that he made to the United Kingdom over the course  of this summer, he blasted Theresa May saying in an interview with \"The  Sun,\" one of the most read newspapers that he had told her to organize  Brexit, but she didn't listen to him.  </p><p>And obviously now, he's making the point that he believes that she has got  a raw deal.  That is something that obviously is resonating with MPs, even  before Donald Trump waded into this hot debate.  We knew that the House of  Commons was bitterly divided, even her own party is bitterly divided on the  deal that she's managed to come back with from Brussels.  </p><p>So, obviously, we've got less than 15 days to go before UK MPs actually  vote on this.  Aside from all of the minutia of the Parliamentary math,  just broadly speaking, it's looking at though we've got about 90 members of  Theresa May's own party who are likely to rebel against this even though  the whips are in action trying to get them back on board.  The opposition  Labour Party, who she may well try and get some votes from, they've made it  clear that it doesn't meet their criteria and we've also got regional  parties who are feeling alienated by this, as well.  </p><p>That brings me to what Theresa May is doing today.  She is spending much of  the day in places like Wales, also Northern Ireland.  In Northern Ireland,  obviously, she's relying upon the support of the Northern Irish Party, the  DUP, to try and get many of her bills through Parliament because she's lost  her majority, so that is particularly sensitive.  </p><p>And she is also trying to rally the business community behind her cause, as  well.  Now, we have got the Treasury that is going to be publishing a big  report on Brexit tomorrow.  That could be sobering because they're going to  be testing what a no deal scenario would mean for the UK.  Theresa May  trying to get business leaders to tell MPs that the deal she's got is the  best one they're going to get and that they should vote it through in two  weeks' time.  Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  According to that Parliamentary math as you laid out, it is a  tough road ahead for the British Prime Minister.  Nina dos Santos,  reporting live from London.  Thank you.  </p><p>A remarkable development in the special counsel's investigation to Russian  interference in the 2016 US Presidential Election.  Prosecutors say  President Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, breached his  plea agreement by lying to the FBI on a variety of matters.  Manafort's  side denied that, but both sides asked the judge to move Manafort's case to  sentencing.  He pleaded guilty to conspiracy in witness tampering back in  September and agreed to cooperate with the prosecutors on the Russia probe.  </p><p>A scientist in China claims he has helped create the world's first  genetically edited babies, why the international community is now up in  arms.  Also ahead, we talk exclusively to Uber's CEO at times of  retribution across Silicon Valley.  We ask Dara Khosrowshahi some tough  questions, next.  </p><p>[08:15:00]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Welcome back.  This is \"News Stream.\"  Chinese health and ethics  officials are investigating a scientist's claim that he helped create the  world's first genetically edited babies.  He Jiankui with his video  announcement on YouTube shocked and horrified the international scientific  community.  </p><p>There is an international agreement not to edit the genes of human embryos  intended for pregnancy.  He says twin girls were born earlier this month  using in vitro fertilization.  The embryos were modified before  implantation using CRISPR that's technology that allows scientists to  modify specific genes in the DNA.  </p><p>The hospital named in his ethical approval documents has denied involvement  in the procedures.  His purpose, he says, was to make the babies resistant  to HIV.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>HE JIANKUI, SCIENTIST:  Right after we sent her the husband's sperm into  her egg, we're also sending a little bit of protein and instruction for  gene surgery.  When Lulu and Lasla was just a single cell.  This surgery  removed the doorway through which HIV enter to infect people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, some scientists are calling the research monstrous and  they're warning of unintended consequences.  Off target effects as they're  called, like diseases later in life that we may not know about.  More than  120 Chinese scientists condemned the research on the social media platform  Weybo saying in a joint statement that the trial is a huge blow to the  reputation of Chinese biomedical research.  </p><p>They write this, quote, \"Directly experimenting on humans is nothing but  crazy.  As soon as a living human is produced, no one could predict what  kind of impact it will bring.\"  </p><p>Joining us now is Benjamin Hurlbut, Associate Professor at Arizona State  University School of Life Science.  He is here in Hong Kong for the Genome  Editing Summit where He Jiankui is set to speak on Wednesday.  </p><p>Sir, thank you for joining us here to lend some clarity on this mind  boggling story.  If his claims of these gene-edited babies are true, does  this open a sort of Pandora's Box?  </p><p>BENJAMIN HURLBUT, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF  LIFE SCIENCE:  You know, yes and no.  It is a first and it's a significant  first and it's a worrisome first.  Yet at the same time, it's simply a  single instance and there's still ample opportunity for the wider  certificate community and indeed the wider world to consider what is at  stake here and set limits if necessary.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, so let's consider that.  He Jiankui says that this twin  girls had their DNA altered to make them HIV resistant.  What other kinds  of gene editing could this lead to?  </p><p>HURLBUT:  Well, I mean, I think there's a vast range of possible  applications, all the way from correcting disease-causing genes, single  gene that's cause diseases often in some cases very severe diseases, to  much more frivolous applications.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  You're talking about designer babies, altering eye color, even  IQ.  </p><p>HURLBUT:  Well, to be clear, there are many features of our bodies that are  encoded in our genes, but in extremely complex ways.  So only the sorts of  changes that can be affected through a change to a single gene or a  relatively small number of sites in the genome will be possible.  Yet that  still remains a fairly large number of different types of traits.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Got it.  And you know, fears of designer babies aside, is there  any good that could come out of this?  For example, if there were strict  international regulations because eliminating inheritable diseases, that's  a good thing, isn't it?  </p><p>HURLBUT:  Well, I think one important good that can come out of this is a  broader, more robust and in a sense more urgent conversation about what is  at stake here.  Because in my view, what is at stake here is not simply  whether this technology is safe or even whether it's appropriate to apply  it in this particular way but, rather, the ways in which we relate to our  children, the kinds of procreation that we engage in, the ways in which  they become projects for us or not.  </p><p>[08:20:02]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, human beings and the human genome will continue to evolve.   But do you think, from this point on, we will evolve at a more hastened way  because technologies like CRISPR?  </p><p>HURLBUT:  I don't buy into that kind of speculation.  Although, yes, I  mean, there is the possibility that with the application of these sorts of  techniques, it will change us.  It will change the face of the human  species in important ways.  But I think the changes are actually more  significant on a sort of a social level than they are on a biological  level.  </p><p>Let me give just one example.  So in this case, there's essentially no  medical reason for making this alteration.  The reason that the researchers  gave is that the father of these children has HIV and, therefore,  apparently faces forms of discrimination and sigma in Chinese culture and  wishes for his children to never find themselves in a circumstance where  they have to face those same problems.  </p><p>But that's not a biological problem.  That's a social problem.  This is a  genetic fix to a problem of social stigma and that is a dangerous door to  open.  There are many features of our appearances that have, you might say,  stigma attached to them and yet, sort of accepting that and dealing with it  by making changes to our appearance instead of our attitudes towards  diversity ...  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Absolutely.  </p><p>HURLBUT:   ... is a serious concern.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Professor Hurlbut, we'll leave it at that, but you leave us with  a lot to consider.  Thank you.  </p><p>HURLBUT:  Thank you.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  The founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, has been outed as a Communist  Party member.  The revelation came in an article in the party's official  newspaper, \"The People's Daily.\"  About 100 people who have helped  transform China's economy.  The Communist Party requires putting the  party's interest above all else.  Alibaba is a $30 billion company that  trades on the New York Stock Exchange.  Washington has showing a growing  suspicion of Chinese companies looking to expand overseas and Jack Ma's  membership in the Communist Party could add fuel to that.  </p><p>Turning to the UK now where a top Facebook executive appeared before  lawmakers from nine different countries as part of this international  hearing on disinformation.  But the star witness was notably absent.  Mark  Zuckerberg was repeatedly asked to attend, but the social media giant sent  Richard Allan instead.  He is the company's Vice President of Public Policy  for Europe.  </p><p>Members of the committee stopped short of releasing documents that Facebook  has been fighting to keep from the public.  Now, in an exclusive  conversation with CNN, the CEO of Uber says tech companies must take  responsibility for the reckoning that is rippling across Silicon Valley.  </p><p>Dara Khosrowshahi says the public must trust but verify whether big tech is  truly making the world a better place.  Now, let's bring in our senior tech  correspondent Laurie Segall.  She joins us live from New York.  And Laurie,  you spoke with him.  How does the Uber chief plan to move his company  forward?  </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  You know, I think  he's done quite a bit in the last year and he has quite a few plans for the  future.  It is interesting talking to him about this.  It's a fascinating  moment for the company.  This is a company that's hit - that had this win  at all costs reputation.  It was hit with so many different scandals.  </p><p>But Dara Khosrowshahi is the new CEO.  It's who they brought in to replace  the old CEO and try to repaint their image.  He is an Iranian immigrant.   He has a very interesting story.  He says he knows quite a bit about  reinvention given his personal story and he says it's changing how he wants  to do business at Uber.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SEGALL:  At one point, the FBI came to your door in Tarrytown.  This is  when you moved over and said your family was going to be deported.  How did  that shape you as a leader now, especially in this political environment?  </p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, CEO, UBER:  My mom did a great job of protecting us from  those issues.  But for me, it has created a true thankfulness for what we  have here in the US because we were truly lucky to come to this country  during a time when immigrants were welcome.  I understand what it's like to  be different and I understand what a prize we have here as American  citizens.  </p><p>SEGALL:  You said the American dream is the greatest brand on earth.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Yes.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Do you think that brand is being tarnished?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I think it is at this point.  I think that we have always  been seen within the international community of a country, an immigrant  nation that was welcoming, that created the opportunity for success for  anyone and everyone regardless of background.  And, you know, this is a  personal opinion, but I think the direction that we're going in a little  bit is unfortunate.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Can you give me anything specific about how you as a leader have  kind of changed in this new era.  </p><p>[08:25:01]  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  You know, I have to tell you, it's an area that makes me  uncomfortable.  A CEO taking his personal beliefs and translating them into  the actions of a company, because in the end, I'm here to build this  company.  I am here to serve our constituencies, our drivers, our riders,  our customers and ultimately our investors.  So why should I let my  personal feelings get in the way or affect the direction of the company?  </p><p>Many, many of our driver partners are immigrants that have come to this  nation.  It is part of the agenda of this company to provide an environment  of success for them.  This public/private kind of borders, they're  blurring.  And I think it's a relatively uncomfortable time for CEOs and,  you know, we have got to figure out how to change them.  </p><p>I'm figuring out as we go.  </p><p>SEGALL:  I've always been such an optimist on technology and I'm looking at  the last couple of years and thinking, \"Oh, my god,\" because this idea of  are you making the world better?  I think people are genuinely questioning  as Silicon Valley is doing what they promised.  You guys have said trust us  for a while, and I think a lot of people don't have that trust.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I think it's fair to say trust, but verify.  Our platform is  a transportation platform.  Facebook's platform is a digital connection  platform et cetera, and I think the hypothesis in the past was, well, we're  building a platform and there are good people and bad people and we're not  responsible for what they do on the platform because we don't want to be  the sensor.  We don't want to tell you what to say.  </p><p>But these platforms can create super powers.  If you communicate something  in the old world, you can get at five people.  These platforms allow you to  communicate to a million and that realization has created, I think now the  responsibility.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SEGALL:  And you certainly can understand what he's talking about when he  talks about platform when you look at the story of Facebook and what's  happened with Facebook.  So he talks about Uber not being any different.  </p><p>And I will say also, I asked him about sexism at the company because  there's a very high profile case of sexism against Uber and people speaking  out a year and a half ago which led to many women in Silicon Valley and in  the tech industry speaking out against unfair treatment, and I said, you  know, what are we not allowed to say about the women's movement and what  are we hearing behind the scenes in Silicon Valley that people aren't  saying?  </p><p>He was uncomfortable with the question but he answered it.  And what he  said was, \"You know, I think people are afraid to say certain things and I  think we need more open discourse and we need to start talking and having  these uncomfortable conversations and making mistakes in order to grow.\"   And I think that's maybe a good lesson for Silicon Valley.  </p><p>We hope they make less mistakes going forward, but it's been a really  challenging time, I think in Silicon Valley and looking at the implications  of these platforms and looking at some of the other issues like sexism that  have come along with this incredibly powerful and influential industry.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Laurie, I'm so happy that you brought up the issue of work  culture at Uber because given the issues over the years, a lot needs to be  fixed there.  Laurie Segall reporting.  Thank you for bringing that  interview with us and take care.  </p><p>And Laurie's interview, it's part of her new series.  You want to watch it.   It's called \"The Human Code,\" and she sits down with the most influential  leaders in Silicon Valley who share their thoughts on where tech is headed  and how it will continue to change our lives.  You can find it at  cnnbusiness.com.  </p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\"  And still to come, strong reactions  following CNN's exclusive poll on anti-Semitism around the world.  Leaders  and lawmakers say the findings are appalling.  </p><p>[08:30:00]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.  You're watching \"News  Stream.\"  And these are your world headlines.  Ukrainian lawmakers have  voted to impose 30 days of Martial Law in some areas of Ukraine including  along the border with Russia beginning Wednesday.  It follows Sunday's  naval confrontation in the Kerch Strait.  Ukraine says Russia seized three  of its vessels and around two dozen sailors.  Both sides accuse the other  of being the aggressor.  And moments ago, a report crossed on Russia state  news agency RIA Novosti, it says that a court in Crimea sentenced one of  the Ukrainian sailors detained to two months detention.  </p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron says he will not lower fuel prices and  during a televised speech, Mr. Macron condemned violent protest nationwide  and said he would not concede anything to those who want destruction and  disorder.  More demonstrations are planned for this weekend.  </p><p>US President Donald Trump is defending US authorities' use of teargas to  disburse migrants at the border with Mexico on Sunday.  Mr. Trump described  it as a very minor form of teargas and he questioned why the parents were  approaching the border with children at all, suggesting some of the adults  grab children to better their chances of entering the US.  </p><p>And now to a major CNN investigation revealing just how widespread and  growing anti-Semitic attitudes are in Europe.  More than 70 years ago when  the nightmare of the holocaust came to an end with the close of World War  II, Germany as a nation vowed to never forget.  Yet it seems that many in  Europe have done exactly that or even more shockingly have never even known  about the atrocities committed against millions of Jews by the Nazis.  All  this week, we are focusing on this shadow over Europe.  </p><p>Our chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward begins our coverage  with a sweeping news survey commissioned by CNN that unearthed some  surprising statistics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CLARISSA WARD, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  To give us our  unprecedented look at anti-Semitism in Europe, we spoke to more than 7,000  European citizens across these seven countries.  Forty four percent said  they believe anti-Semitism is a growing problem in their country, with 40%  saying Jewish people are at risk of racist violence there.  Sixty three  percent, around two-thirds of the people we spoke to agree that  commemorating the holocaust helps ensure that such atrocities will never  happen again.  But awareness of the genocide seems to be fading.  </p><p>Of the people in the 18 to 34 age bracket that we spoke to, almost two- fifths said they had either never even heard of the holocaust or had had  just a little knowledge of it.  The situation is especially bad in France;  8% of people we spoke to there across all age groups said they had never  heard of the holocaust.  That is around five million people in France  alone, more than double the population of Paris.  </p><p>The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance spells out what anti- Semitism is with 11 specific examples.  One is the myth that Jewish people  control global media, economies and governments.  </p><p>In Europe, 28% responded that Jewish people had too much influence in  finance and business across the world, a view that was most common in  Poland and Hungary.  Europe's understanding of how many Jewish people there  are in the world is also way off the mark.  Sixteen percent of respondents  thought that Jewish people make up at least a fifth of the global  population.  </p><p>According to Pew research, it's a hundredth of that, around 0.2%.  </p><p>[08:35:04]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  The Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel issued a statement  today saying it is deeply concerned by the findings in CNN's anti-Semitism  poll.  Let's bring in Clarissa Ward.  She joins us live from London and  Clarissa, it never went away, anti-Semitism never disappeared in Europe.   Why?  </p><p>WARD:  Well, I think that part of the problem, Kristie, based on this poll  and based on conversations with dozens of members of the Jewish communities  of various different European countries is that no one is really willing to  accept responsibility for anti-Semitism within their own community or  belief structure.  So you will have some people who would like to just say  anti-Semitism is just a problem of the far right and we've seen the far  right gaining more momentum in the last few years and, therefore, it's a  far right problem.  </p><p>Then you talk to people on the right and they'll say no, actually, anti- Semitism is a phenomenon of the Muslim community and of elements within the  Muslim community, and then you'll speak to Muslims who will say, no, anti- Semitism is about Israel and Israel's policies.  </p><p>So what you have is kind of a perfect storm where all the various different  ideologies and theologies don't want to accept that anti-Semitism exists  within their communities.  They are eager to sort of push or shunt the  blame of onto other communities.  </p><p>The reality that we found, Kristie, based on the polling, based on all the  different types of people that we were speaking to across many different  countries is that anti-Semitism is complex, it is pervasive,it exists in  the right, it exists in the left, it exists in Muslim communities.  It  exists in many different places within Europe and until you have some kind  of a sincere conversation as to the scale of the problem, I mean, you have  18% of Europeans saying outright, that's nearly a fifth of Europeans saying  that they believe that anti-Semitism in their own countries is the result  of the everyday behavior of Jewish people.  That is a startling fact.  </p><p>Nineteen percent of Hungarians saying flat out they have an unfavorable  impression of Jews altogether.  Until you can have a serious conversation  about where those attitudes come from and the depths to which they permeate  society, then, obviously, you're going to continue to see this troubling  rise in anti-Semitism in, of course, the very continent where the holocaust  genocide took place, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  This lack of a conversation, a serious one.  This lack of  accountability has allowed this intolerance to fester.  Clarissa Ward,  reporting live for us.  Clarissa, thank you.  Now, we are getting more  reactions from Europe and Israel to CNN's anti-Semitism poll.  </p><p>Isaac Herzog, the Chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel says the anti- Semitism is one of the oldest diseases for which there is no vaccine.  He  says this, quote, \"I call upon the enlightened leaders of the world to take  the gloves off and work immediately and strongly against the worrying signs  of anti-Semitism that can be found in various countries.\"  Unquote.  </p><p>Israel's former Ambassador to the US and current member of the Knesset,  Michael Oren says this, \"CNN's survey of anti-Semitism in Europe while  revealing some positive trends confirms that the world's oldest hatred  persists in the continent that invented it.\"  </p><p>Our week long look at anti-Semitism in Europe, it focuses on Germany on  wednesday.  Clarissa Ward will be taking us to a right wing extremist march  on the streets of Berlin.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WARD:  Christian Weisberger explains that Neo-Nazis are finding new ways to  express the same old hatred.  And he should know.  Weisberger used to be a  right wing extremist himself.  </p><p>CHRISTIAN WEISBERGER, FORMER RIGHT WING EXTREMIST:  I would say that it is  a form of anti-Semitism that disguises itself, so they don't talk about the  Jew any more.  They talk about the Zionists or the globalists or the  bankers.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now Clarissa also meets with members of the Jewish community who  are questioning their future in Germany.  Join us for the next report in  this exclusive series that is called \"A Shadow Over Europe: Anti-Semitism  in 2018,\" Wednesday on CNN.  </p><p>Meanwhile, you can find out more about anti-Semitism in Europe and the  results of this CNN survey.  Visit cnn.com/antisemitism.  You're watching  \"News Stream.\"  We'll be right back.  </p><p>[08:40:30]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Welcome back.  Now, how old are you?  It's a simple question,  but the answer is a lot more interesting than you think.  On today's \"Live  Longer,\" CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta introduces us to a Yale researcher who  looks age beyond her calendar years.  Take a look at what that means for  disease prevention and for just how long we'll live.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SANJAY GUPTA, CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  In her office at Yale,  researcher and professor Morgan Levine writes out a series of letters and  numbers on the whiteboard.  </p><p>MORGAN LEVINE, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PATHOLOGY, YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE:   This is really interesting mathematical distribution which basically shows  mortality rates.  </p><p>GUPTA:  This represents age, but not in a way that you might think.  </p><p>LEVINE:  In my lab, we work on a lot of different types of aging measures.   One of the most recent ones is based on just blood measures that you get at  your normal doctor's appointment and we basically take those and combine  them using different algorithms to get what we call someone's phenotypic  age or biological age.  </p><p>GUPTA:  Your chronological age is how old the calendar says you are, but  what Levine and her team are most interested in is your biological or  phenotypic age, basically the age at which your body is functioning.  </p><p>LEVINE:  People of the same chronological age aren't all at the same risk  for developing cardiovascular disease or cancer or even dying.  So what  this does is it actually gives us a better idea of where someone stands for  their age.  So even though you're maybe chronologically 50 years old, you  might have the health risks of someone who is 55.  </p><p>GUPTA:  The team identified nine biomarkers taken in a simple blood test  that seems to be the most influential on life span.  It included blood  sugar, kidney, liver markers as well as immune and inflammatory measures.  </p><p>LEVINE:  We can calculate everyone's phenotypic age in this sample and then  we plot the phenotypic age versus the chronologic age.  And basically, for  everyone that falls on this red line, it means their phenotypic age is  exactly equal to their chronological age, so they look as we would expect.  </p><p>Those above this red line are the ones that are of the highest mortality  risk and they look much older than they'd expect.  I think the most  exciting thing about this research is that these things aren't set in  stone.  I think we are given the information much earlier in the process  hopefully before someone ever develops disease and then they can really  take steps to improve their health before it's too late.  </p><p>GUPTA:  Before it's too late.  That's the key here.  Identifying these  risks earlier can help life spans in the long run by providing doctors with  the information to help patients take the right steps toward living longer.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  And that is \"News Stream.\"  \"World Sport\" with Rhiannon Jones is  next.  </p><p>(SPORTS)  </p><p>[09:00:00]  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Hate on the rise, CNN's survey shows worrying trends of anti-Semitism in Europe. And gene editing outrage, China orders an over a scientist's claim that he created the world's first genetically modified babies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A tense standoff between Russia and Ukraine is escalating in the waters of Crimea. Ukrainian lawmakers have voted to impose 30 days of Martial Law in parts of the country beginning on Wednesday. This includes border areas with Russia. It follows Sunday's naval confrontation in the Kerch Strait. Take a look at this video appears shows a Russian ship ramming the Ukrainian tugboat, but the Kremlin accuses Ukraine of being the aggressor calling the incident a quote, \"dangerous provocation by Kiev.\" Russia seized three Ukrainian ships and detained two dozen sailors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, we are following this story from all angles. We have CNN's Matthew Chance live for us in Moscow, but first, let's go to Nick Paton Walsh in Kiev, and Nick, Ukraine is, again, preparing for martial law. What will it look like when it goes into effect tomorrow?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, we don't actually know, in all honesty. It's the first time it's being implemented and we know that on paper we're expected to see sort of heightened military activity defenses, cyber defenses predominantly limited to 10 regions of the country, all of which have one thing on common, they border parts of Russia where there are Russian troops or Russian backed separatists.</p><p>But given this has never happened in the country before, I think many are approaching it with some degree of anxiety here, not at least because there are elections ahead. It should well be over before March's presidential vote, but it's sort of bringing perhaps an air of uncertainty here as to exactly what that will do, although there are guarantees from the President that Constitutional rights will be protected.</p><p>The kremlin, though, have wasted no time, their spokesperson saying that it's a barely camouflaged overtone of a bid to try and raise tension here. And I presume they will be suggesting the blockades may be in place towards separatist areas which will make things worse.</p><p>I have to say, there's very little doubt I think that the tension will rise once Martial Law is potentially in place albeit perhaps because Russia may seek to exploit that. But there's an important thing to remember here, Kristie. You know, this is not an incident and is an isolation.</p><p>Ukraine has been in at war with Russia and Russian-backed separatists for four years now, on and off. And people die every week in the front lines in the east. So we're looking at a very public, globally discussed incident here, but it's symptomatic frankly of Russia pushing Ukraine and at times, Ukraine not quite being as internationally backed or coordinated in its response as some people might like to see.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, there has been this growing tension between both sides since Crimea was annexed back in 2014. Let's go to Matthew Chance standing by in Moscow now and Matthew, your thoughts on the politics of this rising tension. Could it actually benefit Vladimir Putin whose approval ratings there are flagging?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, it's certainly possible, and you're right to say that Vladimir Putin's normally sky high approval ratings which are regularly in the mid-80s in terms of percentage points have dipped over the past several months, partly because of the economic climate and the lack of economic growth in this country.</p><p>And, of course, in the past when the Crimean peninsula was annexed by Russia back in 2014, that led to an enormous sort of nationalistic boost for Vladimir Putin and even opposition voices in the country to a large extent. Closed ranks and supported the President in that - what we've seen as a national effort.</p><p>And so reintroducing the Ukrainian bogeyman, as it were, may well prove to be beneficial for those popularity ratings, whether or not that was the motivation for this I think is something for people to debate, but equally on the other side, and Nick just referred to this, the Kremlin says that this was a crisis that was orchestrated for political reasons by the Ukrainians.</p><p>[08:05:05]</p><p>CHANCE: The Ukrainian President is also suffering terrible polling figures. He's going into an election cycle next year. And, you know, the speculation here in Moscow is that this was orchestrated in order to change that for him and to make him more popular. And so I think the takeout from that is that perhaps both presidents, ironically, of Russia and of Ukraine may stand to benefit from this renewed standoff.</p><p>LU STOUT: Domestic politics play in both countries, both sides blaming the other. Matthew Chance reporting live from Moscow. Nick Paton Walsh live for us in Kiev, thank you.</p><p>Western powers, they are furious over Russia's aggression and they are calling for de-escalation. Here is what the outgoing US Ambassador to the UN said about the incident.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, US AMBASSADOR TO THE UN: This is no way for a law-abiding civilized nation to act. Impeding Ukraine's lawful transit through the Kerch Strait is a violation under international law. It is an arrogant act that the international community must condemn and will never accept.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: And while American diplomats condemn Russia's actions, US President Donald Trump appears hesitant to do the same. Let's bring in CNN's Joe Johns. He joins us live from the White House. And Joe, we heard a pretty tough reaction from Ambassador Haley, but why is Donald Trump hesitant to condemn Russia here?</p><p>JOE JOHNS, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Million-dollar question, I think. And as you know, Kristie, this isn't the first time the President has been tepid on a response to the - if you will, aggression by Russia toward Ukraine. Let's just listen to the President's response that has been seen as quite tepid as compared to his UN Ambassador, others in his administration as well as a number of western leaders have been quite clear in condemning it. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've let our position be known and we're not happy about it. We do not like what's happening; either way, we don't like what's happening and hopefully, it will get straightened out. I know Europe is - they are not thrilled. They are working on it, too. We're all working on it together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS: So back to your question at the top, Kristie, why? Why is the President seemingly fairly tepid on all of this? Especially given the fact that he's likely to meet Vladimir Putin at the G-20 in Buenos Aires later this week. Anybody's guess. We do know there has been a level of intrigue involving this administration, this President and Russia going all the way back to the 2016 campaign, the ensuing investigation into Russian interference in that election and anybody's guess, though, at the bottom why this President doesn't step out there like so many others, both western leaders and even people in his own administration.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, and tepid is the word when we hear from the President saying, \"Yes, it will get straightened out somehow.\" And looking ahead to that G-20 Summit between Trump and Putin, and judging from his language and his past encounters, will Trump press Vladimir Putin not only on Ukraine, but on other hot button issues like election interference?</p><p>JOHNS: Again, anybody's guess. We are hoping later today to get some more information about the approach this administration is going to take to that meeting with Putin and others, whether it's going to be formal or another pull aside, as has occurred in the past.</p><p>But one thing that is clear, this President continues to be reluctant to go after Russia on a variety of different issues including Ukraine.</p><p>LU STOUT: Joe Johns, live at the White House, thank you. Now, Donald Trump is warning Apple products imported from China could be one of several products hit with hefty new tariffs. That's if the two countries can't work something out at this week's G-20 Summit.</p><p>Mr. Trump told \"The Wall Street Journal\" it was highly unlikely he would accept an offer by the Chinese President aimed at averting a third round of US tariffs on more than $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Apple's stock fell 1.5 percentage points in after-hours trading on Monday following that interview. It is still in the red as we approach the bell Tuesday morning in New York.</p><p>Now, President Trump also dealt a blow to a trade deal across the Atlantic on Tuesday by throwing his weight behind those criticizing the British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan. He said that the deal was unclear on Britain's freedom to trade with the US in the future. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Right now, if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us and that wouldn't be a good thing. I don't think they meant that.</p><p>[08:10:04]</p><p>TRUMP: I don't think that the Prime Minister meant that and hopefully she'll be able to do something about that, but right now, as the deal stands, she may not - they may not be able to trade with the US and I don't think they want that at all. That would be a very big negative for the deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Nina dos Santos joins us now from London. And Nina, Theresa May's deal roundly criticized by President Trump and not only that, criticized by MPs in the House of Commons. How damaging is this for her and her big sales pitch going forward?</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, it's not the first time that Donald Trump has criticized Theresa May. You remember famously on the visit, the state visit that he made to the United Kingdom over the course of this summer, he blasted Theresa May saying in an interview with \"The Sun,\" one of the most read newspapers that he had told her to organize Brexit, but she didn't listen to him.</p><p>And obviously now, he's making the point that he believes that she has got a raw deal. That is something that obviously is resonating with MPs, even before Donald Trump waded into this hot debate. We knew that the House of Commons was bitterly divided, even her own party is bitterly divided on the deal that she's managed to come back with from Brussels.</p><p>So, obviously, we've got less than 15 days to go before UK MPs actually vote on this. Aside from all of the minutia of the Parliamentary math, just broadly speaking, it's looking at though we've got about 90 members of Theresa May's own party who are likely to rebel against this even though the whips are in action trying to get them back on board. The opposition Labour Party, who she may well try and get some votes from, they've made it clear that it doesn't meet their criteria and we've also got regional parties who are feeling alienated by this, as well.</p><p>That brings me to what Theresa May is doing today. She is spending much of the day in places like Wales, also Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, obviously, she's relying upon the support of the Northern Irish Party, the DUP, to try and get many of her bills through Parliament because she's lost her majority, so that is particularly sensitive.</p><p>And she is also trying to rally the business community behind her cause, as well. Now, we have got the Treasury that is going to be publishing a big report on Brexit tomorrow. That could be sobering because they're going to be testing what a no deal scenario would mean for the UK. Theresa May trying to get business leaders to tell MPs that the deal she's got is the best one they're going to get and that they should vote it through in two weeks' time. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: According to that Parliamentary math as you laid out, it is a tough road ahead for the British Prime Minister. Nina dos Santos, reporting live from London. Thank you.</p><p>A remarkable development in the special counsel's investigation to Russian interference in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Prosecutors say President Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, breached his plea agreement by lying to the FBI on a variety of matters. Manafort's side denied that, but both sides asked the judge to move Manafort's case to sentencing. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy in witness tampering back in September and agreed to cooperate with the prosecutors on the Russia probe.</p><p>A scientist in China claims he has helped create the world's first genetically edited babies, why the international community is now up in arms. Also ahead, we talk exclusively to Uber's CEO at times of retribution across Silicon Valley. We ask Dara Khosrowshahi some tough questions, next.</p><p>[08:15:00]</p><p>LU STOUT: Welcome back. This is \"News Stream.\" Chinese health and ethics officials are investigating a scientist's claim that he helped create the world's first genetically edited babies. He Jiankui with his video announcement on YouTube shocked and horrified the international scientific community.</p><p>There is an international agreement not to edit the genes of human embryos intended for pregnancy. He says twin girls were born earlier this month using in vitro fertilization. The embryos were modified before implantation using CRISPR that's technology that allows scientists to modify specific genes in the DNA.</p><p>The hospital named in his ethical approval documents has denied involvement in the procedures. His purpose, he says, was to make the babies resistant to HIV.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HE JIANKUI, SCIENTIST: Right after we sent her the husband's sperm into her egg, we're also sending a little bit of protein and instruction for gene surgery. When Lulu and Lasla was just a single cell. This surgery removed the doorway through which HIV enter to infect people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, some scientists are calling the research monstrous and they're warning of unintended consequences. Off target effects as they're called, like diseases later in life that we may not know about. More than 120 Chinese scientists condemned the research on the social media platform Weybo saying in a joint statement that the trial is a huge blow to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research.</p><p>They write this, quote, \"Directly experimenting on humans is nothing but crazy. As soon as a living human is produced, no one could predict what kind of impact it will bring.\"</p><p>Joining us now is Benjamin Hurlbut, Associate Professor at Arizona State University School of Life Science. He is here in Hong Kong for the Genome Editing Summit where He Jiankui is set to speak on Wednesday.</p><p>Sir, thank you for joining us here to lend some clarity on this mind boggling story. If his claims of these gene-edited babies are true, does this open a sort of Pandora's Box?</p><p>BENJAMIN HURLBUT, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LIFE SCIENCE: You know, yes and no. It is a first and it's a significant first and it's a worrisome first. Yet at the same time, it's simply a single instance and there's still ample opportunity for the wider certificate community and indeed the wider world to consider what is at stake here and set limits if necessary.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, so let's consider that. He Jiankui says that this twin girls had their DNA altered to make them HIV resistant. What other kinds of gene editing could this lead to?</p><p>HURLBUT: Well, I mean, I think there's a vast range of possible applications, all the way from correcting disease-causing genes, single gene that's cause diseases often in some cases very severe diseases, to much more frivolous applications.</p><p>LU STOUT: You're talking about designer babies, altering eye color, even IQ.</p><p>HURLBUT: Well, to be clear, there are many features of our bodies that are encoded in our genes, but in extremely complex ways. So only the sorts of changes that can be affected through a change to a single gene or a relatively small number of sites in the genome will be possible. Yet that still remains a fairly large number of different types of traits.</p><p>LU STOUT: Got it. And you know, fears of designer babies aside, is there any good that could come out of this? For example, if there were strict international regulations because eliminating inheritable diseases, that's a good thing, isn't it?</p><p>HURLBUT: Well, I think one important good that can come out of this is a broader, more robust and in a sense more urgent conversation about what is at stake here. Because in my view, what is at stake here is not simply whether this technology is safe or even whether it's appropriate to apply it in this particular way but, rather, the ways in which we relate to our children, the kinds of procreation that we engage in, the ways in which they become projects for us or not.</p><p>[08:20:02]</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, human beings and the human genome will continue to evolve. But do you think, from this point on, we will evolve at a more hastened way because technologies like CRISPR?</p><p>HURLBUT: I don't buy into that kind of speculation. Although, yes, I mean, there is the possibility that with the application of these sorts of techniques, it will change us. It will change the face of the human species in important ways. But I think the changes are actually more significant on a sort of a social level than they are on a biological level.</p><p>Let me give just one example. So in this case, there's essentially no medical reason for making this alteration. The reason that the researchers gave is that the father of these children has HIV and, therefore, apparently faces forms of discrimination and sigma in Chinese culture and wishes for his children to never find themselves in a circumstance where they have to face those same problems.</p><p>But that's not a biological problem. That's a social problem. This is a genetic fix to a problem of social stigma and that is a dangerous door to open. There are many features of our appearances that have, you might say, stigma attached to them and yet, sort of accepting that and dealing with it by making changes to our appearance instead of our attitudes towards diversity ...</p><p>LU STOUT: Absolutely.</p><p>HURLBUT: ... is a serious concern.</p><p>LU STOUT: Professor Hurlbut, we'll leave it at that, but you leave us with a lot to consider. Thank you.</p><p>HURLBUT: Thank you.</p><p>LU STOUT: The founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, has been outed as a Communist Party member. The revelation came in an article in the party's official newspaper, \"The People's Daily.\" About 100 people who have helped transform China's economy. The Communist Party requires putting the party's interest above all else. Alibaba is a $30 billion company that trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Washington has showing a growing suspicion of Chinese companies looking to expand overseas and Jack Ma's membership in the Communist Party could add fuel to that.</p><p>Turning to the UK now where a top Facebook executive appeared before lawmakers from nine different countries as part of this international hearing on disinformation. But the star witness was notably absent. Mark Zuckerberg was repeatedly asked to attend, but the social media giant sent Richard Allan instead. He is the company's Vice President of Public Policy for Europe.</p><p>Members of the committee stopped short of releasing documents that Facebook has been fighting to keep from the public. Now, in an exclusive conversation with CNN, the CEO of Uber says tech companies must take responsibility for the reckoning that is rippling across Silicon Valley.</p><p>Dara Khosrowshahi says the public must trust but verify whether big tech is truly making the world a better place. Now, let's bring in our senior tech correspondent Laurie Segall. She joins us live from New York. And Laurie, you spoke with him. How does the Uber chief plan to move his company forward?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN: You know, I think he's done quite a bit in the last year and he has quite a few plans for the future. It is interesting talking to him about this. It's a fascinating moment for the company. This is a company that's hit - that had this win at all costs reputation. It was hit with so many different scandals.</p><p>But Dara Khosrowshahi is the new CEO. It's who they brought in to replace the old CEO and try to repaint their image. He is an Iranian immigrant. He has a very interesting story. He says he knows quite a bit about reinvention given his personal story and he says it's changing how he wants to do business at Uber. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SEGALL: At one point, the FBI came to your door in Tarrytown. This is when you moved over and said your family was going to be deported. How did that shape you as a leader now, especially in this political environment?</p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, CEO, UBER: My mom did a great job of protecting us from those issues. But for me, it has created a true thankfulness for what we have here in the US because we were truly lucky to come to this country during a time when immigrants were welcome. I understand what it's like to be different and I understand what a prize we have here as American citizens.</p><p>SEGALL: You said the American dream is the greatest brand on earth.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Yes.</p><p>SEGALL: Do you think that brand is being tarnished?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I think it is at this point. I think that we have always been seen within the international community of a country, an immigrant nation that was welcoming, that created the opportunity for success for anyone and everyone regardless of background. And, you know, this is a personal opinion, but I think the direction that we're going in a little bit is unfortunate.</p><p>SEGALL: Can you give me anything specific about how you as a leader have kind of changed in this new era.</p><p>[08:25:01]</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: You know, I have to tell you, it's an area that makes me uncomfortable. A CEO taking his personal beliefs and translating them into the actions of a company, because in the end, I'm here to build this company. I am here to serve our constituencies, our drivers, our riders, our customers and ultimately our investors. So why should I let my personal feelings get in the way or affect the direction of the company?</p><p>Many, many of our driver partners are immigrants that have come to this nation. It is part of the agenda of this company to provide an environment of success for them. This public/private kind of borders, they're blurring. And I think it's a relatively uncomfortable time for CEOs and, you know, we have got to figure out how to change them.</p><p>I'm figuring out as we go.</p><p>SEGALL: I've always been such an optimist on technology and I'm looking at the last couple of years and thinking, \"Oh, my god,\" because this idea of are you making the world better? I think people are genuinely questioning as Silicon Valley is doing what they promised. You guys have said trust us for a while, and I think a lot of people don't have that trust.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I think it's fair to say trust, but verify. Our platform is a transportation platform. Facebook's platform is a digital connection platform et cetera, and I think the hypothesis in the past was, well, we're building a platform and there are good people and bad people and we're not responsible for what they do on the platform because we don't want to be the sensor. We don't want to tell you what to say.</p><p>But these platforms can create super powers. If you communicate something in the old world, you can get at five people. These platforms allow you to communicate to a million and that realization has created, I think now the responsibility.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SEGALL: And you certainly can understand what he's talking about when he talks about platform when you look at the story of Facebook and what's happened with Facebook. So he talks about Uber not being any different.</p><p>And I will say also, I asked him about sexism at the company because there's a very high profile case of sexism against Uber and people speaking out a year and a half ago which led to many women in Silicon Valley and in the tech industry speaking out against unfair treatment, and I said, you know, what are we not allowed to say about the women's movement and what are we hearing behind the scenes in Silicon Valley that people aren't saying?</p><p>He was uncomfortable with the question but he answered it. And what he said was, \"You know, I think people are afraid to say certain things and I think we need more open discourse and we need to start talking and having these uncomfortable conversations and making mistakes in order to grow.\" And I think that's maybe a good lesson for Silicon Valley.</p><p>We hope they make less mistakes going forward, but it's been a really challenging time, I think in Silicon Valley and looking at the implications of these platforms and looking at some of the other issues like sexism that have come along with this incredibly powerful and influential industry.</p><p>LU STOUT: Laurie, I'm so happy that you brought up the issue of work culture at Uber because given the issues over the years, a lot needs to be fixed there. Laurie Segall reporting. Thank you for bringing that interview with us and take care.</p><p>And Laurie's interview, it's part of her new series. You want to watch it. It's called \"The Human Code,\" and she sits down with the most influential leaders in Silicon Valley who share their thoughts on where tech is headed and how it will continue to change our lives. You can find it at cnnbusiness.com.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\" And still to come, strong reactions following CNN's exclusive poll on anti-Semitism around the world. Leaders and lawmakers say the findings are appalling.</p><p>[08:30:00]</p><p>LU STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream.\" And these are your world headlines. Ukrainian lawmakers have voted to impose 30 days of Martial Law in some areas of Ukraine including along the border with Russia beginning Wednesday. It follows Sunday's naval confrontation in the Kerch Strait. Ukraine says Russia seized three of its vessels and around two dozen sailors. Both sides accuse the other of being the aggressor. And moments ago, a report crossed on Russia state news agency RIA Novosti, it says that a court in Crimea sentenced one of the Ukrainian sailors detained to two months detention.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron says he will not lower fuel prices and during a televised speech, Mr. Macron condemned violent protest nationwide and said he would not concede anything to those who want destruction and disorder. More demonstrations are planned for this weekend.</p><p>US President Donald Trump is defending US authorities' use of teargas to disburse migrants at the border with Mexico on Sunday. Mr. Trump described it as a very minor form of teargas and he questioned why the parents were approaching the border with children at all, suggesting some of the adults grab children to better their chances of entering the US.</p><p>And now to a major CNN investigation revealing just how widespread and growing anti-Semitic attitudes are in Europe. More than 70 years ago when the nightmare of the holocaust came to an end with the close of World War II, Germany as a nation vowed to never forget. Yet it seems that many in Europe have done exactly that or even more shockingly have never even known about the atrocities committed against millions of Jews by the Nazis. All this week, we are focusing on this shadow over Europe.</p><p>Our chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward begins our coverage with a sweeping news survey commissioned by CNN that unearthed some surprising statistics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARISSA WARD, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: To give us our unprecedented look at anti-Semitism in Europe, we spoke to more than 7,000 European citizens across these seven countries. Forty four percent said they believe anti-Semitism is a growing problem in their country, with 40% saying Jewish people are at risk of racist violence there. Sixty three percent, around two-thirds of the people we spoke to agree that commemorating the holocaust helps ensure that such atrocities will never happen again. But awareness of the genocide seems to be fading.</p><p>Of the people in the 18 to 34 age bracket that we spoke to, almost two- fifths said they had either never even heard of the holocaust or had had just a little knowledge of it. The situation is especially bad in France; 8% of people we spoke to there across all age groups said they had never heard of the holocaust. That is around five million people in France alone, more than double the population of Paris.</p><p>The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance spells out what anti- Semitism is with 11 specific examples. One is the myth that Jewish people control global media, economies and governments.</p><p>In Europe, 28% responded that Jewish people had too much influence in finance and business across the world, a view that was most common in Poland and Hungary. Europe's understanding of how many Jewish people there are in the world is also way off the mark. Sixteen percent of respondents thought that Jewish people make up at least a fifth of the global population.</p><p>According to Pew research, it's a hundredth of that, around 0.2%.</p><p>[08:35:04]</p><p>LU STOUT: The Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel issued a statement today saying it is deeply concerned by the findings in CNN's anti-Semitism poll. Let's bring in Clarissa Ward. She joins us live from London and Clarissa, it never went away, anti-Semitism never disappeared in Europe. Why?</p><p>WARD: Well, I think that part of the problem, Kristie, based on this poll and based on conversations with dozens of members of the Jewish communities of various different European countries is that no one is really willing to accept responsibility for anti-Semitism within their own community or belief structure. So you will have some people who would like to just say anti-Semitism is just a problem of the far right and we've seen the far right gaining more momentum in the last few years and, therefore, it's a far right problem.</p><p>Then you talk to people on the right and they'll say no, actually, anti- Semitism is a phenomenon of the Muslim community and of elements within the Muslim community, and then you'll speak to Muslims who will say, no, anti- Semitism is about Israel and Israel's policies.</p><p>So what you have is kind of a perfect storm where all the various different ideologies and theologies don't want to accept that anti-Semitism exists within their communities. They are eager to sort of push or shunt the blame of onto other communities.</p><p>The reality that we found, Kristie, based on the polling, based on all the different types of people that we were speaking to across many different countries is that anti-Semitism is complex, it is pervasive,it exists in the right, it exists in the left, it exists in Muslim communities. It exists in many different places within Europe and until you have some kind of a sincere conversation as to the scale of the problem, I mean, you have 18% of Europeans saying outright, that's nearly a fifth of Europeans saying that they believe that anti-Semitism in their own countries is the result of the everyday behavior of Jewish people. That is a startling fact.</p><p>Nineteen percent of Hungarians saying flat out they have an unfavorable impression of Jews altogether. Until you can have a serious conversation about where those attitudes come from and the depths to which they permeate society, then, obviously, you're going to continue to see this troubling rise in anti-Semitism in, of course, the very continent where the holocaust genocide took place, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: This lack of a conversation, a serious one. This lack of accountability has allowed this intolerance to fester. Clarissa Ward, reporting live for us. Clarissa, thank you. Now, we are getting more reactions from Europe and Israel to CNN's anti-Semitism poll.</p><p>Isaac Herzog, the Chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel says the anti- Semitism is one of the oldest diseases for which there is no vaccine. He says this, quote, \"I call upon the enlightened leaders of the world to take the gloves off and work immediately and strongly against the worrying signs of anti-Semitism that can be found in various countries.\" Unquote.</p><p>Israel's former Ambassador to the US and current member of the Knesset, Michael Oren says this, \"CNN's survey of anti-Semitism in Europe while revealing some positive trends confirms that the world's oldest hatred persists in the continent that invented it.\"</p><p>Our week long look at anti-Semitism in Europe, it focuses on Germany on wednesday. Clarissa Ward will be taking us to a right wing extremist march on the streets of Berlin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARD: Christian Weisberger explains that Neo-Nazis are finding new ways to express the same old hatred. And he should know. Weisberger used to be a right wing extremist himself.</p><p>CHRISTIAN WEISBERGER, FORMER RIGHT WING EXTREMIST: I would say that it is a form of anti-Semitism that disguises itself, so they don't talk about the Jew any more. They talk about the Zionists or the globalists or the bankers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now Clarissa also meets with members of the Jewish community who are questioning their future in Germany. Join us for the next report in this exclusive series that is called \"A Shadow Over Europe: Anti-Semitism in 2018,\" Wednesday on CNN.</p><p>Meanwhile, you can find out more about anti-Semitism in Europe and the results of this CNN survey. Visit cnn.com/antisemitism. You're watching \"News Stream.\" We'll be right back.</p><p>[08:40:30]</p><p>LU STOUT: Welcome back. Now, how old are you? It's a simple question, but the answer is a lot more interesting than you think. On today's \"Live Longer,\" CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta introduces us to a Yale researcher who looks age beyond her calendar years. Take a look at what that means for disease prevention and for just how long we'll live.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SANJAY GUPTA, CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: In her office at Yale, researcher and professor Morgan Levine writes out a series of letters and numbers on the whiteboard.</p><p>MORGAN LEVINE, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PATHOLOGY, YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: This is really interesting mathematical distribution which basically shows mortality rates.</p><p>GUPTA: This represents age, but not in a way that you might think.</p><p>LEVINE: In my lab, we work on a lot of different types of aging measures. One of the most recent ones is based on just blood measures that you get at your normal doctor's appointment and we basically take those and combine them using different algorithms to get what we call someone's phenotypic age or biological age.</p><p>GUPTA: Your chronological age is how old the calendar says you are, but what Levine and her team are most interested in is your biological or phenotypic age, basically the age at which your body is functioning.</p><p>LEVINE: People of the same chronological age aren't all at the same risk for developing cardiovascular disease or cancer or even dying. So what this does is it actually gives us a better idea of where someone stands for their age. So even though you're maybe chronologically 50 years old, you might have the health risks of someone who is 55.</p><p>GUPTA: The team identified nine biomarkers taken in a simple blood test that seems to be the most influential on life span. It included blood sugar, kidney, liver markers as well as immune and inflammatory measures.</p><p>LEVINE: We can calculate everyone's phenotypic age in this sample and then we plot the phenotypic age versus the chronologic age. And basically, for everyone that falls on this red line, it means their phenotypic age is exactly equal to their chronological age, so they look as we would expect.</p><p>Those above this red line are the ones that are of the highest mortality risk and they look much older than they'd expect. I think the most exciting thing about this research is that these things aren't set in stone. I think we are given the information much earlier in the process hopefully before someone ever develops disease and then they can really take steps to improve their health before it's too late.</p><p>GUPTA: Before it's too late. That's the key here. Identifying these risks earlier can help life spans in the long run by providing doctors with the information to help patients take the right steps toward living longer.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: And that is \"News Stream.\" \"World Sport\" with Rhiannon Jones is next.</p><p>(SPORTS)</p><p>[09:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018112701cbk31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TV6-TPR1-DXH2-64RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6071\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Russia, Ukraine, Martial Law, China, Genetics, CRISPR, Uber, Anti- Semitism</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Hate on the rise, CNN's survey shows worrying trends of anti-Semitism in  Europe.  And gene editing outrage, China orders an over a scientist's claim  that he created the world's first genetically modified babies.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A tense standoff between Russia and Ukraine is escalating in the waters of  Crimea.  Ukrainian lawmakers have voted to impose 30 days of Martial Law in  parts of the country beginning on Wednesday.  This includes border areas  with Russia.  It follows Sunday's naval confrontation in the Kerch Strait.   Take a look at this video appears shows a Russian ship ramming the  Ukrainian tugboat, but the Kremlin accuses Ukraine of being the aggressor  calling the incident a quote, \"dangerous provocation by Kiev.\"  Russia  seized three Ukrainian ships and detained two dozen sailors.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, we are following this story from all angles.  We have CNN's Matthew  Chance live for us in Moscow, but first, let's go to Nick Paton Walsh in  Kiev, and Nick, Ukraine is, again, preparing for martial law.  What will it  look like when it goes into effect tomorrow?  </p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, we don't  actually know, in all honesty.  It's the first time it's being implemented  and we know that on paper we're expected to see sort of heightened military  activity defenses, cyber defenses predominantly limited to 10 regions of  the country, all of which have one thing on common, they border parts of  Russia where there are Russian troops or Russian backed separatists.  </p><p>But given this has never happened in the country before, I think many are  approaching it with some degree of anxiety here, not at least because there  are elections ahead.  It should well be over before March's presidential  vote, but it's sort of bringing perhaps an air of uncertainty here as to  exactly what that will do, although there are guarantees from the President  that Constitutional rights will be protected.  </p><p>The kremlin, though, have wasted no time, their spokesperson saying that  it's a barely camouflaged overtone of a bid to try and raise tension here.   And I presume they will be suggesting the blockades may be in place towards  separatist areas which will make things worse.  </p><p>I have to say, there's very little doubt I think that the tension will rise  once Martial Law is potentially in place albeit perhaps because Russia may  seek to exploit that.  But there's an important thing to remember here,  Kristie.  You know, this is not an incident and is an isolation.  </p><p>Ukraine has been in at war with Russia and Russian-backed separatists for  four years now, on and off.  And people die every week in the front lines  in the east.  So we're looking at a very public, globally discussed  incident here, but it's symptomatic frankly of Russia pushing Ukraine and  at times, Ukraine not quite being as internationally backed or coordinated  in its response as some people might like to see.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, there has been this growing tension between both sides  since Crimea was annexed back in 2014.  Let's go to Matthew Chance standing  by in Moscow now and Matthew, your thoughts on the politics of this rising  tension.  Could it actually benefit Vladimir Putin whose approval ratings  there are flagging?  </p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, it's  certainly possible, and you're right to say that Vladimir Putin's normally  sky high approval ratings which are regularly in the mid-80s in terms of  percentage points have dipped over the past several months, partly because  of the economic climate and the lack of economic growth in this country.  </p><p>And, of course, in the past when the Crimean peninsula was annexed by  Russia back in 2014, that led to an enormous sort of  nationalistic boost  for Vladimir Putin and even opposition voices in the country to a large  extent.  Closed ranks and supported the President in that - what we've seen  as a national effort.  </p><p>And so reintroducing the Ukrainian bogeyman, as it were, may well prove to  be beneficial for those popularity ratings, whether or not that was the  motivation for this I think is something for people to debate, but equally  on the other side, and Nick just referred to this, the Kremlin says that  this was a crisis that was orchestrated for political reasons by the  Ukrainians.  </p><p>[08:05:05]  </p><p>CHANCE:  The Ukrainian President is also suffering terrible polling  figures.  He's going into an election cycle next year.  And, you know, the  speculation here in Moscow is that this was orchestrated in order to change  that for him and to make him more popular.  And so I think the takeout from  that is that perhaps both presidents, ironically, of Russia and of Ukraine  may stand to benefit from this renewed standoff.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Domestic politics play in both countries, both sides blaming the  other. Matthew Chance reporting live from Moscow.  Nick Paton Walsh live  for us in Kiev, thank you.  </p><p>Western powers, they are furious over Russia's aggression and they are  calling for de-escalation.  Here is what the outgoing US Ambassador to the  UN said about the incident.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>NIKKI HALEY, US AMBASSADOR TO THE UN:  This is no way for a law-abiding  civilized nation to act.  Impeding Ukraine's lawful transit through the  Kerch Strait is a violation under international law.  It is an arrogant act  that the international community must condemn and will never accept.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  And while American diplomats condemn Russia's actions, US  President Donald Trump appears hesitant to do the same.  Let's bring in  CNN's Joe Johns.  He joins us live from the White House.  And Joe, we heard  a pretty tough reaction from Ambassador Haley, but why is Donald Trump  hesitant to condemn Russia here?  </p><p>JOE JOHNS, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Million-dollar question,  I think.  And as you know, Kristie, this isn't the first time the President  has been tepid on a response to the - if you will, aggression by Russia  toward Ukraine.  Let's just listen to the President's response that has  been seen as quite tepid as compared to his UN Ambassador, others in his  administration as well as a number of western leaders have been quite clear  in condemning it.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've let our position be  known and we're not happy about it.  We do not like what's happening;  either way, we don't like what's happening and hopefully, it will get  straightened out.  I know Europe is - they are not thrilled.  They are  working on it, too.  We're all working on it together.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JOHNS:  So back to your question at the top, Kristie, why?  Why is the  President seemingly fairly tepid on all of this?  Especially given the fact  that he's likely to meet Vladimir Putin at the G-20 in Buenos Aires later  this week.  Anybody's guess.  We do know there has been a level of intrigue  involving this administration, this President and Russia going all the way  back to the 2016 campaign, the ensuing investigation into Russian  interference in that election and anybody's guess, though, at the bottom  why this President doesn't step out there like so many others, both western  leaders and even people in his own administration.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, and tepid is the word when we hear from the President  saying, \"Yes, it will get straightened out somehow.\"  And looking ahead to  that G-20 Summit between Trump and Putin, and judging from his language and  his past encounters, will Trump press Vladimir Putin not only on Ukraine,  but on other hot button issues like election interference?  </p><p>JOHNS:  Again, anybody's guess.  We are hoping later today to get some more  information about the approach this administration is going to take to that  meeting with Putin and others, whether it's going to be formal or another  pull aside, as has occurred in the past.  </p><p>But one thing that is clear, this President continues to be reluctant to go  after Russia on a variety of different issues including Ukraine.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Joe Johns, live at the White House, thank you.  Now, Donald  Trump is warning Apple products imported from China could be one of several  products hit with hefty new tariffs.  That's if the two countries can't  work something out at this week's G-20 Summit.  </p><p>Mr. Trump told \"The Wall Street Journal\" it was highly unlikely he would  accept an offer by the Chinese President aimed at averting a third round of  US tariffs on more than $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.  Apple's stock  fell 1.5 percentage points in after-hours trading on Monday following that  interview.  It is still in the red as we approach the bell Tuesday morning  in New York.  </p><p>Now, President Trump also dealt a blow to a trade deal across the Atlantic  on Tuesday by throwing his weight behind those criticizing the British  Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan.  He said that the deal was  unclear on Britain's freedom to trade with the US in the future.  Take a  listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  Right now, if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade  with us and that wouldn't be a good thing.  I don't think they meant that.  </p><p>[08:10:04]  </p><p>TRUMP:  I don't think that the Prime Minister meant that and hopefully  she'll be able to do something about that, but right now, as the deal  stands, she may not - they may  not be able to trade with the US and I  don't think they want that at all.  That would be a very big negative for  the deal.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Nina dos Santos joins us now from London.  And Nina, Theresa  May's deal roundly criticized by President Trump and not only that,  criticized by MPs in the House of Commons.  How damaging is this for her  and her big sales pitch going forward?  </p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, it's not the first time that  Donald Trump has criticized Theresa May.  You remember famously on the  visit, the state visit that he made to the United Kingdom over the course  of this summer, he blasted Theresa May saying in an interview with \"The  Sun,\" one of the most read newspapers that he had told her to organize  Brexit, but she didn't listen to him.  </p><p>And obviously now, he's making the point that he believes that she has got  a raw deal.  That is something that obviously is resonating with MPs, even  before Donald Trump waded into this hot debate.  We knew that the House of  Commons was bitterly divided, even her own party is bitterly divided on the  deal that she's managed to come back with from Brussels.  </p><p>So, obviously, we've got less than 15 days to go before UK MPs actually  vote on this.  Aside from all of the minutia of the Parliamentary math,  just broadly speaking, it's looking at though we've got about 90 members of  Theresa May's own party who are likely to rebel against this even though  the whips are in action trying to get them back on board.  The opposition  Labour Party, who she may well try and get some votes from, they've made it  clear that it doesn't meet their criteria and we've also got regional  parties who are feeling alienated by this, as well.  </p><p>That brings me to what Theresa May is doing today.  She is spending much of  the day in places like Wales, also Northern Ireland.  In Northern Ireland,  obviously, she's relying upon the support of the Northern Irish Party, the  DUP, to try and get many of her bills through Parliament because she's lost  her majority, so that is particularly sensitive.  </p><p>And she is also trying to rally the business community behind her cause, as  well.  Now, we have got the Treasury that is going to be publishing a big  report on Brexit tomorrow.  That could be sobering because they're going to  be testing what a no deal scenario would mean for the UK.  Theresa May  trying to get business leaders to tell MPs that the deal she's got is the  best one they're going to get and that they should vote it through in two  weeks' time.  Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  According to that Parliamentary math as you laid out, it is a  tough road ahead for the British Prime Minister.  Nina dos Santos,  reporting live from London.  Thank you.  </p><p>A remarkable development in the special counsel's investigation to Russian  interference in the 2016 US Presidential Election.  Prosecutors say  President Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, breached his  plea agreement by lying to the FBI on a variety of matters.  Manafort's  side denied that, but both sides asked the judge to move Manafort's case to  sentencing.  He pleaded guilty to conspiracy in witness tampering back in  September and agreed to cooperate with the prosecutors on the Russia probe.  </p><p>A scientist in China claims he has helped create the world's first  genetically edited babies, why the international community is now up in  arms.  Also ahead, we talk exclusively to Uber's CEO at times of  retribution across Silicon Valley.  We ask Dara Khosrowshahi some tough  questions, next.  </p><p>[08:15:00]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Welcome back.  This is \"News Stream.\"  Chinese health and ethics  officials are investigating a scientist's claim that he helped create the  world's first genetically edited babies.  He Jiankui with his video  announcement on YouTube shocked and horrified the international scientific  community.  </p><p>There is an international agreement not to edit the genes of human embryos  intended for pregnancy.  He says twin girls were born earlier this month  using in vitro fertilization.  The embryos were modified before  implantation using CRISPR that's technology that allows scientists to  modify specific genes in the DNA.  </p><p>The hospital named in his ethical approval documents has denied involvement  in the procedures.  His purpose, he says, was to make the babies resistant  to HIV.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>HE JIANKUI, SCIENTIST:  Right after we sent her the husband's sperm into  her egg, we're also sending a little bit of protein and instruction for  gene surgery.  When Lulu and Lasla was just a single cell.  This surgery  removed the doorway through which HIV enter to infect people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, some scientists are calling the research monstrous and  they're warning of unintended consequences.  Off target effects as they're  called, like diseases later in life that we may not know about.  More than  120 Chinese scientists condemned the research on the social media platform  Weybo saying in a joint statement that the trial is a huge blow to the  reputation of Chinese biomedical research.  </p><p>They write this, quote, \"Directly experimenting on humans is nothing but  crazy.  As soon as a living human is produced, no one could predict what  kind of impact it will bring.\"  </p><p>Joining us now is Benjamin Hurlbut, Associate Professor at Arizona State  University School of Life Science.  He is here in Hong Kong for the Genome  Editing Summit where He Jiankui is set to speak on Wednesday.  </p><p>Sir, thank you for joining us here to lend some clarity on this mind  boggling story.  If his claims of these gene-edited babies are true, does  this open a sort of Pandora's Box?  </p><p>BENJAMIN HURLBUT, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF  LIFE SCIENCE:  You know, yes and no.  It is a first and it's a significant  first and it's a worrisome first.  Yet at the same time, it's simply a  single instance and there's still ample opportunity for the wider  certificate community and indeed the wider world to consider what is at  stake here and set limits if necessary.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, so let's consider that.  He Jiankui says that this twin  girls had their DNA altered to make them HIV resistant.  What other kinds  of gene editing could this lead to?  </p><p>HURLBUT:  Well, I mean, I think there's a vast range of possible  applications, all the way from correcting disease-causing genes, single  gene that's cause diseases often in some cases very severe diseases, to  much more frivolous applications.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  You're talking about designer babies, altering eye color, even  IQ.  </p><p>HURLBUT:  Well, to be clear, there are many features of our bodies that are  encoded in our genes, but in extremely complex ways.  So only the sorts of  changes that can be affected through a change to a single gene or a  relatively small number of sites in the genome will be possible.  Yet that  still remains a fairly large number of different types of traits.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Got it.  And you know, fears of designer babies aside, is there  any good that could come out of this?  For example, if there were strict  international regulations because eliminating inheritable diseases, that's  a good thing, isn't it?  </p><p>HURLBUT:  Well, I think one important good that can come out of this is a  broader, more robust and in a sense more urgent conversation about what is  at stake here.  Because in my view, what is at stake here is not simply  whether this technology is safe or even whether it's appropriate to apply  it in this particular way but, rather, the ways in which we relate to our  children, the kinds of procreation that we engage in, the ways in which  they become projects for us or not.  </p><p>[08:20:02]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, human beings and the human genome will continue to evolve.   But do you think, from this point on, we will evolve at a more hastened way  because technologies like CRISPR?  </p><p>HURLBUT:  I don't buy into that kind of speculation.  Although, yes, I  mean, there is the possibility that with the application of these sorts of  techniques, it will change us.  It will change the face of the human  species in important ways.  But I think the changes are actually more  significant on a sort of a social level than they are on a biological  level.  </p><p>Let me give just one example.  So in this case, there's essentially no  medical reason for making this alteration.  The reason that the researchers  gave is that the father of these children has HIV and, therefore,  apparently faces forms of discrimination and sigma in Chinese culture and  wishes for his children to never find themselves in a circumstance where  they have to face those same problems.  </p><p>But that's not a biological problem.  That's a social problem.  This is a  genetic fix to a problem of social stigma and that is a dangerous door to  open.  There are many features of our appearances that have, you might say,  stigma attached to them and yet, sort of accepting that and dealing with it  by making changes to our appearance instead of our attitudes towards  diversity ...  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Absolutely.  </p><p>HURLBUT:   ... is a serious concern.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Professor Hurlbut, we'll leave it at that, but you leave us with  a lot to consider.  Thank you.  </p><p>HURLBUT:  Thank you.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  The founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, has been outed as a Communist  Party member.  The revelation came in an article in the party's official  newspaper, \"The People's Daily.\"  About 100 people who have helped  transform China's economy.  The Communist Party requires putting the  party's interest above all else.  Alibaba is a $30 billion company that  trades on the New York Stock Exchange.  Washington has showing a growing  suspicion of Chinese companies looking to expand overseas and Jack Ma's  membership in the Communist Party could add fuel to that.  </p><p>Turning to the UK now where a top Facebook executive appeared before  lawmakers from nine different countries as part of this international  hearing on disinformation.  But the star witness was notably absent.  Mark  Zuckerberg was repeatedly asked to attend, but the social media giant sent  Richard Allan instead.  He is the company's Vice President of Public Policy  for Europe.  </p><p>Members of the committee stopped short of releasing documents that Facebook  has been fighting to keep from the public.  Now, in an exclusive  conversation with CNN, the CEO of Uber says tech companies must take  responsibility for the reckoning that is rippling across Silicon Valley.  </p><p>Dara Khosrowshahi says the public must trust but verify whether big tech is  truly making the world a better place.  Now, let's bring in our senior tech  correspondent Laurie Segall.  She joins us live from New York.  And Laurie,  you spoke with him.  How does the Uber chief plan to move his company  forward?  </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  You know, I think  he's done quite a bit in the last year and he has quite a few plans for the  future.  It is interesting talking to him about this.  It's a fascinating  moment for the company.  This is a company that's hit - that had this win  at all costs reputation.  It was hit with so many different scandals.  </p><p>But Dara Khosrowshahi is the new CEO.  It's who they brought in to replace  the old CEO and try to repaint their image.  He is an Iranian immigrant.   He has a very interesting story.  He says he knows quite a bit about  reinvention given his personal story and he says it's changing how he wants  to do business at Uber.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SEGALL:  At one point, the FBI came to your door in Tarrytown.  This is  when you moved over and said your family was going to be deported.  How did  that shape you as a leader now, especially in this political environment?  </p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, CEO, UBER:  My mom did a great job of protecting us from  those issues.  But for me, it has created a true thankfulness for what we  have here in the US because we were truly lucky to come to this country  during a time when immigrants were welcome.  I understand what it's like to  be different and I understand what a prize we have here as American  citizens.  </p><p>SEGALL:  You said the American dream is the greatest brand on earth.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  Yes.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Do you think that brand is being tarnished?  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I think it is at this point.  I think that we have always  been seen within the international community of a country, an immigrant  nation that was welcoming, that created the opportunity for success for  anyone and everyone regardless of background.  And, you know, this is a  personal opinion, but I think the direction that we're going in a little  bit is unfortunate.  </p><p>SEGALL:  Can you give me anything specific about how you as a leader have  kind of changed in this new era.  </p><p>[08:25:01]  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  You know, I have to tell you, it's an area that makes me  uncomfortable.  A CEO taking his personal beliefs and translating them into  the actions of a company, because in the end, I'm here to build this  company.  I am here to serve our constituencies, our drivers, our riders,  our customers and ultimately our investors.  So why should I let my  personal feelings get in the way or affect the direction of the company?  </p><p>Many, many of our driver partners are immigrants that have come to this  nation.  It is part of the agenda of this company to provide an environment  of success for them.  This public/private kind of borders, they're  blurring.  And I think it's a relatively uncomfortable time for CEOs and,  you know, we have got to figure out how to change them.  </p><p>I'm figuring out as we go.  </p><p>SEGALL:  I've always been such an optimist on technology and I'm looking at  the last couple of years and thinking, \"Oh, my god,\" because this idea of  are you making the world better?  I think people are genuinely questioning  as Silicon Valley is doing what they promised.  You guys have said trust us  for a while, and I think a lot of people don't have that trust.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  I think it's fair to say trust, but verify.  Our platform is  a transportation platform.  Facebook's platform is a digital connection  platform et cetera, and I think the hypothesis in the past was, well, we're  building a platform and there are good people and bad people and we're not  responsible for what they do on the platform because we don't want to be  the sensor.  We don't want to tell you what to say.  </p><p>But these platforms can create super powers.  If you communicate something  in the old world, you can get at five people.  These platforms allow you to  communicate to a million and that realization has created, I think now the  responsibility.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SEGALL:  And you certainly can understand what he's talking about when he  talks about platform when you look at the story of Facebook and what's  happened with Facebook.  So he talks about Uber not being any different.  </p><p>And I will say also, I asked him about sexism at the company because  there's a very high profile case of sexism against Uber and people speaking  out a year and a half ago which led to many women in Silicon Valley and in  the tech industry speaking out against unfair treatment, and I said, you  know, what are we not allowed to say about the women's movement and what  are we hearing behind the scenes in Silicon Valley that people aren't  saying?  </p><p>He was uncomfortable with the question but he answered it.  And what he  said was, \"You know, I think people are afraid to say certain things and I  think we need more open discourse and we need to start talking and having  these uncomfortable conversations and making mistakes in order to grow.\"   And I think that's maybe a good lesson for Silicon Valley.  </p><p>We hope they make less mistakes going forward, but it's been a really  challenging time, I think in Silicon Valley and looking at the implications  of these platforms and looking at some of the other issues like sexism that  have come along with this incredibly powerful and influential industry.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Laurie, I'm so happy that you brought up the issue of work  culture at Uber because given the issues over the years, a lot needs to be  fixed there.  Laurie Segall reporting.  Thank you for bringing that  interview with us and take care.  </p><p>And Laurie's interview, it's part of her new series.  You want to watch it.   It's called \"The Human Code,\" and she sits down with the most influential  leaders in Silicon Valley who share their thoughts on where tech is headed  and how it will continue to change our lives.  You can find it at  cnnbusiness.com.  </p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\"  And still to come, strong reactions  following CNN's exclusive poll on anti-Semitism around the world.  Leaders  and lawmakers say the findings are appalling.  </p><p>[08:30:00]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.  You're watching \"News  Stream.\"  And these are your world headlines.  Ukrainian lawmakers have  voted to impose 30 days of Martial Law in some areas of Ukraine including  along the border with Russia beginning Wednesday.  It follows Sunday's  naval confrontation in the Kerch Strait.  Ukraine says Russia seized three  of its vessels and around two dozen sailors.  Both sides accuse the other  of being the aggressor.  And moments ago, a report crossed on Russia state  news agency RIA Novosti, it says that a court in Crimea sentenced one of  the Ukrainian sailors detained to two months detention.  </p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron says he will not lower fuel prices and  during a televised speech, Mr. Macron condemned violent protest nationwide  and said he would not concede anything to those who want destruction and  disorder.  More demonstrations are planned for this weekend.  </p><p>US President Donald Trump is defending US authorities' use of teargas to  disburse migrants at the border with Mexico on Sunday.  Mr. Trump described  it as a very minor form of teargas and he questioned why the parents were  approaching the border with children at all, suggesting some of the adults  grab children to better their chances of entering the US.  </p><p>And now to a major CNN investigation revealing just how widespread and  growing anti-Semitic attitudes are in Europe.  More than 70 years ago when  the nightmare of the holocaust came to an end with the close of World War  II, Germany as a nation vowed to never forget.  Yet it seems that many in  Europe have done exactly that or even more shockingly have never even known  about the atrocities committed against millions of Jews by the Nazis.  All  this week, we are focusing on this shadow over Europe.  </p><p>Our chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward begins our coverage  with a sweeping news survey commissioned by CNN that unearthed some  surprising statistics.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CLARISSA WARD, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  To give us our  unprecedented look at anti-Semitism in Europe, we spoke to more than 7,000  European citizens across these seven countries.  Forty four percent said  they believe anti-Semitism is a growing problem in their country, with 40%  saying Jewish people are at risk of racist violence there.  Sixty three  percent, around two-thirds of the people we spoke to agree that  commemorating the holocaust helps ensure that such atrocities will never  happen again.  But awareness of the genocide seems to be fading.  </p><p>Of the people in the 18 to 34 age bracket that we spoke to, almost two- fifths said they had either never even heard of the holocaust or had had  just a little knowledge of it.  The situation is especially bad in France;  8% of people we spoke to there across all age groups said they had never  heard of the holocaust.  That is around five million people in France  alone, more than double the population of Paris.  </p><p>The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance spells out what anti- Semitism is with 11 specific examples.  One is the myth that Jewish people  control global media, economies and governments.  </p><p>In Europe, 28% responded that Jewish people had too much influence in  finance and business across the world, a view that was most common in  Poland and Hungary.  Europe's understanding of how many Jewish people there  are in the world is also way off the mark.  Sixteen percent of respondents  thought that Jewish people make up at least a fifth of the global  population.  </p><p>According to Pew research, it's a hundredth of that, around 0.2%.  </p><p>[08:35:04]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  The Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel issued a statement  today saying it is deeply concerned by the findings in CNN's anti-Semitism  poll.  Let's bring in Clarissa Ward.  She joins us live from London and  Clarissa, it never went away, anti-Semitism never disappeared in Europe.   Why?  </p><p>WARD:  Well, I think that part of the problem, Kristie, based on this poll  and based on conversations with dozens of members of the Jewish communities  of various different European countries is that no one is really willing to  accept responsibility for anti-Semitism within their own community or  belief structure.  So you will have some people who would like to just say  anti-Semitism is just a problem of the far right and we've seen the far  right gaining more momentum in the last few years and, therefore, it's a  far right problem.  </p><p>Then you talk to people on the right and they'll say no, actually, anti- Semitism is a phenomenon of the Muslim community and of elements within the  Muslim community, and then you'll speak to Muslims who will say, no, anti- Semitism is about Israel and Israel's policies.  </p><p>So what you have is kind of a perfect storm where all the various different  ideologies and theologies don't want to accept that anti-Semitism exists  within their communities.  They are eager to sort of push or shunt the  blame of onto other communities.  </p><p>The reality that we found, Kristie, based on the polling, based on all the  different types of people that we were speaking to across many different  countries is that anti-Semitism is complex, it is pervasive,it exists in  the right, it exists in the left, it exists in Muslim communities.  It  exists in many different places within Europe and until you have some kind  of a sincere conversation as to the scale of the problem, I mean, you have  18% of Europeans saying outright, that's nearly a fifth of Europeans saying  that they believe that anti-Semitism in their own countries is the result  of the everyday behavior of Jewish people.  That is a startling fact.  </p><p>Nineteen percent of Hungarians saying flat out they have an unfavorable  impression of Jews altogether.  Until you can have a serious conversation  about where those attitudes come from and the depths to which they permeate  society, then, obviously, you're going to continue to see this troubling  rise in anti-Semitism in, of course, the very continent where the holocaust  genocide took place, Kristie.  </p><p>LU STOUT:  This lack of a conversation, a serious one.  This lack of  accountability has allowed this intolerance to fester.  Clarissa Ward,  reporting live for us.  Clarissa, thank you.  Now, we are getting more  reactions from Europe and Israel to CNN's anti-Semitism poll.  </p><p>Isaac Herzog, the Chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel says the anti- Semitism is one of the oldest diseases for which there is no vaccine.  He  says this, quote, \"I call upon the enlightened leaders of the world to take  the gloves off and work immediately and strongly against the worrying signs  of anti-Semitism that can be found in various countries.\"  Unquote.  </p><p>Israel's former Ambassador to the US and current member of the Knesset,  Michael Oren says this, \"CNN's survey of anti-Semitism in Europe while  revealing some positive trends confirms that the world's oldest hatred  persists in the continent that invented it.\"  </p><p>Our week long look at anti-Semitism in Europe, it focuses on Germany on  wednesday.  Clarissa Ward will be taking us to a right wing extremist march  on the streets of Berlin.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WARD:  Christian Weisberger explains that Neo-Nazis are finding new ways to  express the same old hatred.  And he should know.  Weisberger used to be a  right wing extremist himself.  </p><p>CHRISTIAN WEISBERGER, FORMER RIGHT WING EXTREMIST:  I would say that it is  a form of anti-Semitism that disguises itself, so they don't talk about the  Jew any more.  They talk about the Zionists or the globalists or the  bankers.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now Clarissa also meets with members of the Jewish community who  are questioning their future in Germany.  Join us for the next report in  this exclusive series that is called \"A Shadow Over Europe: Anti-Semitism  in 2018,\" Wednesday on CNN.  </p><p>Meanwhile, you can find out more about anti-Semitism in Europe and the  results of this CNN survey.  Visit cnn.com/antisemitism.  You're watching  \"News Stream.\"  We'll be right back.  </p><p>[08:40:30]  </p><p>LU STOUT:  Welcome back.  Now, how old are you?  It's a simple question,  but the answer is a lot more interesting than you think.  On today's \"Live  Longer,\" CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta introduces us to a Yale researcher who  looks age beyond her calendar years.  Take a look at what that means for  disease prevention and for just how long we'll live.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SANJAY GUPTA, CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  In her office at Yale,  researcher and professor Morgan Levine writes out a series of letters and  numbers on the whiteboard.  </p><p>MORGAN LEVINE, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PATHOLOGY, YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE:   This is really interesting mathematical distribution which basically shows  mortality rates.  </p><p>GUPTA:  This represents age, but not in a way that you might think.  </p><p>LEVINE:  In my lab, we work on a lot of different types of aging measures.   One of the most recent ones is based on just blood measures that you get at  your normal doctor's appointment and we basically take those and combine  them using different algorithms to get what we call someone's phenotypic  age or biological age.  </p><p>GUPTA:  Your chronological age is how old the calendar says you are, but  what Levine and her team are most interested in is your biological or  phenotypic age, basically the age at which your body is functioning.  </p><p>LEVINE:  People of the same chronological age aren't all at the same risk  for developing cardiovascular disease or cancer or even dying.  So what  this does is it actually gives us a better idea of where someone stands for  their age.  So even though you're maybe chronologically 50 years old, you  might have the health risks of someone who is 55.  </p><p>GUPTA:  The team identified nine biomarkers taken in a simple blood test  that seems to be the most influential on life span.  It included blood  sugar, kidney, liver markers as well as immune and inflammatory measures.  </p><p>LEVINE:  We can calculate everyone's phenotypic age in this sample and then  we plot the phenotypic age versus the chronologic age.  And basically, for  everyone that falls on this red line, it means their phenotypic age is  exactly equal to their chronological age, so they look as we would expect.  </p><p>Those above this red line are the ones that are of the highest mortality  risk and they look much older than they'd expect.  I think the most  exciting thing about this research is that these things aren't set in  stone.  I think we are given the information much earlier in the process  hopefully before someone ever develops disease and then they can really  take steps to improve their health before it's too late.  </p><p>GUPTA:  Before it's too late.  That's the key here.  Identifying these  risks earlier can help life spans in the long run by providing doctors with  the information to help patients take the right steps toward living longer.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>LU STOUT:  And that is \"News Stream.\"  \"World Sport\" with Rhiannon Jones is  next.  </p><p>(SPORTS)  </p><p>[09:00:00]  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Commercial products promising better appetite control or improved sleep and focus are already a reality.<br/><br/>There are no internally implanted interfaces licensed outside of medicine, but the report says this might soon be a reality.<br/><br/>Professor Toumazou, of Imperial's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, said: 'The applications for neural interfaces are as unimaginable today as the smartphone was a few decades ago. They could bring huge economic benefits to the UK and transform sectors like the NHS, public health and social care.<br/><br/>'However, if developments are dictated by a handful of companies then less commercial applications could be side-lined.<br/><br/>'That is why we are calling on the government to launch a national investigation into this emerging field, to identify the UK's priorities and let the public help shape how the technology develops and where we want it to take us.'<br/><br/>Benefiting humanity<br/><br/>The report, called 'iHuman: blurring lines between mind and machine' is the first piece of work to explore the ethical questions in depth, and is also the first to propose concrete actions - including suggesting ministers should act swiftly to understand the ethical risks and ensure regulations are fit to make the UK a global leader in the field.<br/><br/>To do this, researchers say government should be aware of the ethics surrounding the issue, to help stimulate innovation and allow the public to help shape the field - rather than it be led solely by for-profit companies.<br/><br/>Dr Constandinou, also from Imperial's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, said: 'By 2040, neural interfaces are likely to be an established option to help people walk after paralysis, and to tackle treatment-resistant depression. They might even have made treating Alzheimer's disease a reality.<br/><br/>'While advances like seamless brain-to-computer communication seem a much more distant possibility, we should act now to ensure our ethical and regulatory safeguards are flexible enough for any future development.<br/><br/>'In this way we can guarantee these emerging technologies are implemented safely and for the benefit of humanity.'<br/><br/>Act now<br/><br/>The report recommends:<br/><br/>A 'national investigation' of the ethical issues presented by neural interfaces, to address questions of what data should be collected, how it is kept safe, and the acceptability of enhancements.<br/><br/>Ministers work with industry and universities to create a UK Neural Interface Ecosystem which encourages innovation and collaboration in this field.<br/><br/>Government and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority should trial new ways of encouraging innovation to prevent a monopoly by 'Big Tech' firms. This could include a 'sandbox' approach for new medical devices to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in a controlled environment.<br/><br/>Giving the public a clear voice in shaping how this technology is used and regulated for the public good and opting citizens out of having their neural data shared as a default.<br/><br/>A public dialogue exercise led by the Royal Society found strong support for neural interfaces in situations where they enable patients to recover something that has been lost due to injury or a medical condition;

I am Steve Hilton and this is the home of positive populism: pro-worker, pro-family, pro-community and always pro-America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With us tonight for the hour, Florida Congressman, Matt Gates and Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moments away tonight, we will be joined by Congressman Andy Biggs, Head of the Freedom Caucus, and also Raymond Arroyo is here later on with some highlights from his exclusive conversation with President Trump.</p><p>But first, do not underestimate the significance of the Bolton effect. This is not just a short-term swamp story that will soon be replaced by another. It is the big story of the last five years ever since Donald Trump came down and escalator and launched the Populist Revolution, and it will be the big story of the 2020 election.</p><p>From the start, the Republican establishment has been trying to take Trump down. They shoveled cash, over a hundred million dollars into pockets of Jeb Bush. That didn't work. They organized the Never Trump Movement starting with this issue of \"National Review\" Magazine in early 2016. That didn't work.</p><p>They turned on Trump in the final stages of the campaign. That didn't work either. They even ran their own candidate against him. Ask President McMullen how that turned out?</p><p>None of it worked. So, they were stuck with President Trump, but they didn't give up. They just kept going, doing everything they could to sabotage the new administration.</p><p>Their chosen tactic, put their own establishment stooges into key positions. Once there, these self-appointed guardians of the national interest would inform, educate and guide President Trump away from the policies the American people actually voted for and towards the establishment ideology the voters rejected in the election -- open borders, globalism and endless war.</p><p>There's a kind of breathtaking arrogance to it if you think about it. These establishment megalomaniacs genuinely believe they should be in power regardless of actual elections and they call Trump an authoritarian.</p><p>The President brought them in precisely because, as he puts it in the tweet last week, he likes hearing differing points of view, but these establishment stooges aren't satisfied just giving their opinion.</p><p>Here's Bolton this week explaining why he went to work for a President he fundamentally disagreed with.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Look, I thought it was possible to work with somebody, I thought, surely they would want to learn about the complexities of arms-control negotiation and that sort of thing, and as I detail in the book, that turned out not to be true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Oh surely he'd want to learn about arms-control and that sort of thing. Bolton thought he could go in there and overrule Trump, especially in the Middle East. But he wasn't the first, Rex Tillerson tried to overrule Trump on disrupting foreign policy, exactly what Trump was elected to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REX TILLERSON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: I think he grew tired of me being the guy every day that told him he can't do that, and let's talk about what we can do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: John Kelly tried to overrule Trump on the wall in the most patronizing way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KELLY, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: He has very definitely changed his attitude toward the DACA issue and even the wall once we briefed him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Once we briefed him. James Mattis went in and he tried to overrule Trump, not just on Defense and Military matters, but on trade for goodness' sake.</p><p>These smug self-righteous elitists think they think they were defending America when they duplicitously took senior jobs from a President they despised and opposed, but they weren't defending America or Americans. They were defending their own class and their own interests.</p><p>The globalist elite, the military industrial complex -- in a word, the swamp. That's what all of them -- Bolton, Tillerson, Kelly, Mattis -- really are, agents of the swamp.</p><p>James Mattis doesn't even try to hide it. As soon as he was out of there, he cashed in on his years of taxpayer-funded employment by joining a swamp lobbyist that has worked to ship American defense and manufacturing jobs overseas.</p><p>Let's keep an eye on Bolton by the way. Watch where he ends up. Pay attention to his future clients.</p><p>But there is one thing he said this week that I strongly agree with.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: I do think that one way or another, whether Trump wins or loses in November, the Republican Party has to have an extensive conversation with itself about what it wants to look like in the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: Yes, exactly and I can tell you now that we will fight from morning until night to stop the Republican Party slipping back into the clutches of the arrogant elitist warmongering gang of globalist thieves who line their own pockets while destroying the American dream.</p><p>The establishment Republicans, the never Trumpers -- they are desperate to get power back so they can get back to doing what they love, exploiting American workers.</p><p>Look at Republicans for Biden run by Anthony Scaramucci. His Skybridge Capital just put this out, \"Hedge fund opportunities out of the COVID-19 crisis.\" Nice.</p><p>Look at the deeply shallow Bill Kristol, uninterested in policy, obsessed with style over substance, founder of the so-called Lincoln Project babbling like a lunatic because he has zero understanding or empathy for the millions of millions of patriotic working Americans who support Trump, \"Trump's path to victory depends on voter suppression, mass disinformation, foreign interference and unabashed use of Executive Branch power to shape events and perceptions this fall.\"</p><p>Oh my God, what does it tell you? That all these establishment Republicans are now endorsing Biden. It tells you that they now see Biden as the best vehicle for their elitist agenda. They are a virus. They tried to infect Trump, but he fought them off.</p><p>Now, they've jumped to Biden where they will find a willing host for their destructive ideas. Because, Biden himself is the swamp. He is the very figurehead of the failed ruling class that Bolton, Tillerson, Kelly, Mattis, and all the rest of them are members of.</p><p>A figurehead, remember has no real power. Biden, if elected would have no real power. He is mentally malfunctioning. He will be pushed and pulled in all directions.</p><p>The establishment want cheap labor, open border, sellout to China. The Unions want higher taxes, pension protection, more regulation. The loony left want their Cultural Revolution, abolish the police, crush free speech, rule of the mob and so as we approach the election, the Bolton affair reminds us again what a vital choice it is because all of them, the establishment Republicans and the establishment Democrats, the loony left, they will use a Biden win to seize power permanently.</p><p>They don't just want to beat Trump, they want to crush the Populist Revolution.</p><p>Whatever voters think about coronavirus or George Floyd, the election is a choice about the future. People power or the swamp. Trump or the mob. American workers first or open borders forever. A growing free enterprise economy or stagnation, sclerosis and slump. Trump versus the establishment -- just like 2016.</p><p>All right, let us know what you think of that @SteveHiltonx and @NextRevFNC. Please follow us and share this message when we post it.</p><p>And now, joining me to it react, Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, Arizona Congressman, Andy Biggs. Congressman, we were a little bit worried you wouldn't make it. Your flight got in early, you got to the studio, everything's great, it's so good to see you tonight.</p><p>A lot of President Trump supporters, as you know, one of their big concerns over the past -- what is it -- three and half years has been the President hasn't had enough support in Congress. Not enough populist allies that are right behind his agenda. That's the sort of thing I was talking about just then, the establishment Republicans and others. What do you -- how do you see it?</p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): It's good to be with you, Steve. I'm glad my flight made it. But you're exactly right. I hear that from my constituents, why aren't you supporting him more in Congress?</p><p>Well, I'll tell you, the House Freedom Caucus has stood staunchly by this President and we've taken it on the chin from some of our colleagues who don't want to see this President succeed.</p><p>They will give lip service to it, but you're exactly right on the money because the swamp is deep. It's filled with swamp creatures, and you know what? In my opinion, the choice is so stark here. You get people like the Lincoln Project and those guys, Bill Kristol et cetera.</p><p>What they are doing is they are saying, we would rather have a Marxist leftist authoritarian type of regime where we can make money and have a special interest protected than to support President Trump who is going to protect this country and make this country truly great and let everybody succeed or fail on their own personal merit.</p><p>HILTON: So in the Freedom Caucus, what are the kind of priorities that you're looking at in terms of policy issues, particular bills you might be focused on? How do you see the next few months and then looking ahead after what we hope is a victory in November, the next four years of this President?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, we will continue to focus on the budget and the fact that we are sitting at a $26 trillion national debt and roughly $6 trillion structural deficit for this year.</p><p>So we will work on that. We will continue to work on tax issues, on how we can find ways to reduce taxes. We are going to find ways to reduce regulation so people can be freer economically.</p><p>We are going to try to put in place the regimes that will allow individuals to make freer choices for their own healthcare, more affordable medicines and prescriptions. We are going to do that same thing over and over again. We are going to continue focusing on the border.</p><p>These are huge issues, Steve and that's where were going to be. Those are the things we have been fighting on all long and sometimes, we get a lot of support from some of our colleagues and some just don't like that message.</p><p>HILTON: Do you see things moving your way in Congress in terms of support building behind this kind of new conservative populism as I've described it?</p><p>BIGGS: I would say yes, for this reason, when we've been in the minority, you have seen a much more unified Republican Party than I saw even in our first couple of years when we actually had the majority.</p><p>And I think it has taught everyone a lesson that we have got to stick together and we have got to stick together for the American people. What the American people have told us is they like the fight in Donald Trump. They want the policies that President Trump has advocated, whether it's bringing our troops home to building the wall to fewer taxes, that I think has coalesced most of the Republicans in Congress.</p><p>HILTON: And then last question, I just wanted to get your take on something I am going to be discussing with your colleague, Matt Gaetz and also with Lisa later on in the show tonight, but while you're here, I want to get your take, which is you know, we've seen a lot of focus this week on polls, the election.</p><p>A lot of people freaking out about that. A lot of advice thrown President Trump's way in terms of whether he should stick to his core message, reach out. Remember that this is the General Election, not the primary, lots of advice. What would be your advice to the President?</p><p>BIGGS: I would say be Trump. Do you because President Trump has some of the best intuition I've ever seen for a candidate and when he can connect with people, which is every time he can get out in front in a face-to-face, you know what? He wins them over.</p><p>So, he needs to just be Trump and his campaign guys need to let Donald Trump be Donald Trump.</p><p>HILTON: All right, well, Congressman, great to see you tonight. I hope you'll be back soon. We appreciated it. All the best.</p><p>BIGGS: Thank you, Steve. Good to be with you.</p><p>HILTON: All right. Now, let's bring in our guest for the hour. Congressman Matt Gaetz and Lisa Boothe, both great friends of this show.</p><p>Congressman, let's start with you. You just saw your colleague there, Andy Biggs. What's your take on what we were discussing?</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Well, Andy Biggs is a great guest. He is my best friend in Congress. I'm not his best friend, it's just that I have far fewer friends than he does.</p><p>You are right that Bill Kristol and John Bolton represent a vision of conservativism that would have us invade everywhere and invite everyone.</p><p>I think that John Bolton has been in favor of ten out of the last three wars and would probably start four more of them by lunchtime tomorrow if he could. He was largely a mascot in the Trump administration who used to troll Iran.</p><p>His advice was never taken, and so he was resentful. But it's important that President Trump's vision for putting our people and our country first, demanding that our allies pay their fair share, re-domesticating our manufacturing so that we are more resilient. That that prevail in the message worthy of delivering.</p><p>Because if you look at the vision from the radical left, they would lock you in your home. They would make your business illegal. Then they would put an open for business sign at the border, inviting MS-13 to move in next door while regular Americans are just disarmed.</p><p>So, if we want to have safe streets and stable communities, if we want families that are able to be secure in their economic and physical future, then my suggestion is that we rally to this America first vision. It will prevail over the America last views of Kristol and Bolton.</p><p>HILTON: All right, so what I love about that is there is so much in there that is positive. It is forward-looking and practical in terms of supporting families and so on.</p><p>As I have said, last week, I do think we need that forward-looking positive agenda from the President and his team.</p><p>Lisa, you've been around politics in all sort of sides of it on the Republican side. How do you see this conversation that's going on? A lot of people on the establishment Republican side are openly expressing a view that the Trump candidacy and presidency is some kind of aberration, and then after the President has gone, and they are hoping that will be soon, it will revert to the establishment G.O.P. from before.</p><p>How do you see that?</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think that's going to happen because it was a willing takeover by then candidate Donald Trump when Republicans turned out to support him and to nominate him as their nominee for the Republican Party.</p><p>But you know, here is what I think is really important for people to realize, you have groups like the Lincoln Project who they say that they are operating under the guise of protecting democracy and protecting the Constitution, but that's a farce, Steve, and we all know it.</p><p>Because there has been a lot of dangerous precedents set in recent time, but it's not by President Trump, it is by the Obama-Biden administration. It's by the resisters who have been trying to fight President Trump all along and who aren't afraid to use government powers to do so.</p><p>I mean, we saw that with the Obama-Biden administration using the I.R.S. to target conservatives. We saw that with the Obama-Biden administration using the D.O.J. And the F.B.I. to spy on a political opponent, spy on American citizens, use those tools, counterintelligence tools to go after a political opponent or we saw that with Democrats in the House, weaponizing an innocuous phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky to impeach him over, to criminalize a phone call that happens between two sitting Presidents.</p><p>So they are the ones who are setting up these dangerous precedents. They are the ones who are undermining the rule of law and shredding norms in this country.</p><p>So, I think it's something to pay attention to.</p><p>HILTON: It's so well put, Lisa. I mean, that is so -- it is exactly how they are. And Matt, you know, that's why, I described Bill Kristol as shallow because actually, it is all about -- they ignore all the points that they want to talk about, all of the things that Lisa brought up because it doesn't help their case, because now, they are siding with the Democrats.</p><p>And when they criticize President Trump, it's mostly about things of style. It's totally superficial. They don't want to go to the policy argument it seems to be because they know they've already lost the policy argument in terms of where the vast majority of Republican voters are.</p><p>GAETZ: Yes, they've lost the policy argument and it appears to be quite the batch of losers when you look at their electoral success. These are consultants that do not have a win-loss record that anyone would particularly be envious of, and I think that's because it's a low energy aversion of conservatism that they back.</p><p>The President now has the best team, I think, he has ever had. People like Mark Meadows, Kayleigh McEnany along with folks like Stephen Miller who have done so well serving the administration through many years.</p><p>And so now, we must rally the Trump administration in our country to a strong defense of America because what we see from this Marxist movement in Black Lives Matter to totally overturn our country, to make us hate our country and replace it with something else is very dangerous, and I think we will see a winner in this election through strength, a candidate that can stand up and say that America is worth defending, worth preserving and we are going to fight for her with all we have to make her stronger.</p><p>President trump has done that in the past, he will do it in a second term.</p><p>HILTON: Yes. Great points there, Matt. I just totally agree with you, actually, a really important point about the team. And I would add to your list, Attorney General Barr who I just think is just doing such an incredibly strong and brave and principled job in his role.</p><p>GAETZ: Sure.</p><p>HILTON: And I just want to say Kayleigh McEnany, she used to be a frequent guest on this show. We loved having her. Our loss is the White House's gain. She is really, really something up there. She's doing so well.</p><p>All right, thank you both.</p><p>Coming up, unbelievable reckless misinformation in the media about coronavirus. We will show you the truth, next.</p><p>HILTON: Welcome back, everyone. NBC's Chuck Todd has turned into a nonstop coronavirus misinformation machine. Last week he said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: According to Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. is doing a far worse job of controlling this pandemic than the European Union is doing, basically similar size, if you will, look at that graph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: That is so outrageous. As we've shown you before when we pointed out Rachel Maddow doing the same thing night after night, the cases thing is so misleading.</p><p>When it comes to the measure that really matters, deaths per 100,000 countries all on the same scale. Other countries are much worse than America. Just look at that. You've got Belgium, the U.K., Spain, Italy, Sweden, France -- all worse than the U.S.</p><p>But that doesn't fit the blame Trump for everything narrative, so the media will rarely bring it up. It is so outrageous.</p><p>Lisa, you've been on this from the start that way they endlessly talk about cases. And you see it now in the reporting of the update. I mean, the way the media has behaved over this whole thing from the beginning, it's so irresponsible. I can barely contain myself, so I'm going to hand it over to you.</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, and Steve, I always ask myself with all of this is, how would the media be covering it if President Obama was in office and not President Trump? Because the media has really sensationalized the coronavirus pandemic and they've really led with fear-based coverage as opposed to fact-based coverage.</p><p>And so -- and we also know, if you look at the serological studies that were previously done, we've always known that we have been missing a significant portion of asymptomatic and mild cases. So, it makes sense that the more testing that we're doing that we're going to start capturing more of those cases that were previously missing.</p><p>I also reached out to Dr. Scott Atlas of the Hoover Institution who has been one of the salient and sober voices in the conversation and he said that there's really no reason right now to be alarmed because it's not translating into significant increases in ICU admissions or fatalities.</p><p>And also what we're seeing in the majority of the cases are young people and we know that young people are likely going to be -- have you know -- higher tendency to be asymptomatic or mild. And if you look at the fatality rate for 70 and under, it's pretty much equal or less than the flu.</p><p>So, I really think it's dangerous to have fear-based conversations in the country, especially around something like this. We should be fact-based, which you have done on your show, but unfortunately, many have not.</p><p>HILTON: Oh, it's so true. And actually, I just wanted to add to that, Lisa, as I pointed out in a tweet today, follow me @SteveHiltonx if you want to see them. Of course, it was going to be the case that as you open up, you're going to get more cases. That's totally never that -- the C.D.C. itself said that most people in the country are going to be exposed to the virus. That's how this works.</p><p>The idea that just only -- you know, they could have kept the country locked down until Christmas, opened up then, and you'd see a resurgence in cases because that's what happens.</p><p>Matt, in Florida -- from the Florida perspective, you're seeing the cases go up. You're seeing some of the reopening pull back there. I just want to draw a comparison because again, this is all presented as, you know, it's through such a partisan lens. Oh, Ron DeSantis. What a disaster. Republican governor -- like it is the only place in the world where this is happening.</p><p>Let's just put this headline up from Germany. Germany is being praised everywhere as like having a model response and everything is great the way the Germans are handling it. They are also drawing -- pulling back their reopening. They've got a flare up in cases, but the media here don't report that. I just it is so ridiculous -- Matt.</p><p>GAETZ: Sure, I would say that the positivity rate is in part a consequence of the strategic work we're doing in Florida to go into areas that are more likely to have high coronavirus. So, if you're just sitting back and waiting for people to show up, you can maintain a low positivity rate, but then you're not on offense against the disease. And I don't think the media tells that story fairly.</p><p>But let's acknowledge a simple truth. Young people who do not believe that coronavirus poses a serious risk of death or harm to them are very unlikely to socially distance for an extended period of time as a result of coronavirus.</p><p>I wish that it was the case that we would have more exquisite hygiene, hand washing. I think those things are all very helpful. But the absolute radical approach to shutting things down hasn't worked really anywhere. And I don't suspect that that will be the plan that we return to in Florida.</p><p>HILTON: Yes, and by the way, just to emphasize that point, I want to put up another picture. This is from England, from the U.K. in the last couple of days. So again, everyone says, oh, these irresponsible reckless young people in Florida going on the beach, and you know, they're being led astray by the Republicans.</p><p>Look at that picture. That's the U.K. So, don't tell me that there's some unique problem in irresponsible red states with this whole issue. Everyone is sick of it. And actually, if we did have the right response from the beginning, Lisa, you and I, you know, really connected on this right from the word go, which is protect the vulnerable, and let everyone else go about their business.</p><p>Last word to you, Lisa.</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, and that is what's so infuriating is because you look at almost half the deaths in this country have come from nursing homes and assisted living facilities, and it's policies that were mandated from people like Governor Cuomo of New York who was praised and lauded by the media whose policy sent them to go infect other people and to die. And yet he gets a complete pass from the media and it's utterly ridiculous.</p><p>Also, the other part of this is how much more freedoms are we willing to give up to the government and we've let the government mandate when we can go to church, at what capacity we can go to church, if you can go to a restaurant, if you can open your restaurant?</p><p>You know, so how much more are we willing to give up? We've already given up so much. So, I think that's another aspect of this, to really think about as a society that is a free society.</p><p>HILTON: Exactly. Well, we will continue to bring the facts and the real arguments. Thank you both for that.</p><p>Coming up. Our friend, Raymond Arroyo is here. He has got some new highlights from his exclusive conversation with President Trump. That's next.</p><p>HILTON: Welcome back. Our friend, Raymond Arroyo recently sat down with the President for a wide ranging conversation for EWTN covering everything from Biden to Bolton and of course, the administration's efforts to protect national monuments. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a disgrace. Also remember some of this is great artwork. This is magnificent artwork as good as there is anywhere in the world. As good as you see in France, as good as you see anywhere. It's a disgrace.</p><p>Most of these people don't even know what they're taking down and we're going to make the cities guard their monuments. This is a disgrace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: So here he is, author of \"The Will Wilder\" book series and Fox News contributor, Raymond Arroyo. Raymond, thank you so much. We're very privileged you're sharing these exclusive highlights with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>So let's just -- I'll just want to play one more, and then we can talk about it all together. This is the President on the way that so many of the problems that the Democrats are going on and on about actually originate in the places that they run. Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Whether it's Chicago, it is Democrat; Seattle, it is Democrat; the State of Washington, it is Democrat; Portland, it's Democrat. All of these places are run by Democrats 20 out of 20, they are Democrat run. They don't know what they're doing, and if Biden got in, this country would be a disaster.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: So really strong points there. Just tell us your overall thoughts about that conversation with the President, and specifically this point about the Democratic cities.</p><p>RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, let's start with the statues. I mean, we cannot countenance -- and I think you're hearing the frustration of the President there. We can't countenance taking down of these statues, these mementos of our history. And that's what's happening, Steve.</p><p>Look, if communities want to agree and take a vote and have a conversation, that this statue or that plaque should be removed, fine, but to have mobs willy-nilly throwing ropes over the things and trying to yank them down, it just can't be allowed.</p><p>The President was right to sign that Executive Order. He told me that exclusively early in the week, he made good on it by the end of the week. And it basically, if you attempt to take down a military statue anywhere in the U.S., you could face 10 years in prison and some serious fines.</p><p>Cardinal Dolan wrote a great piece about this in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and he says when we remove these statues, we're depriving our kids the opportunity to point out not only that heroes have flaws, but that at times good men, good people can do horrible things. We need to learn from the totality of American history.</p><p>And as far as the comments about the democratically run cities, I think the President is trying to tie Joe Biden to a lot of the anarchic, roving bands we're seeing across the nation. And it's that tension, the Biden dilemma, Steve. He has to try to sell to the American people that less policing is a good thing, when 64 percent of Americans want more policing in the most recent poll.</p><p>But his challenge is, 52 percent of Democratic voters want police defund. They want them defunded entirely. That puts Biden in a real tough spot. We'll see how he emerges from it or if he can.</p><p>HILTON: Well, I mean, you know he's been pathetic on it. I mean, he's not wanted to say anything at all, Biden, because I so frightened of his mob as it were within the party that's pushing him on this. He doesn't want to stand up to them at all, being totally weak.</p><p>I totally agree with you on the statues, by the way. You know the other week, I set out my view on it, which is yes, there are things that can cause offense. We should pay attention to that. But there's a right way of doing it. Exactly, as you said, not through the mob, just this random vandalism, it is completely unacceptable.</p><p>Let's just take a look at the last clip we've got, which is, again, on Biden and why it is perhaps that he isn't putting out anything of any interest or intellectual coherence on any subject at all in the view of the President. Let's have a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: You know, and I know Biden is not going to be running things. It's going to be run by other people. Biden is shot. It's one of those things, I hate to say it, but Biden is shot. But the Democrats are not -- it's not just him. It's a party. It's a platform.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILTON: So that argument --</p><p>ARROYO: I frame this --</p><p>HILTON: Yes. Keep going. Keep going.</p><p>ARROYO: Yes, well, right now, Steve, I always say Joe Biden is really benefiting from what I call the First Lady dispensation. If you look at the way First Ladies poll, okay. They're always up above 50 percent. Why? Because we never see them say anything.</p><p>We just operate off of memory of how they look, who they stood next to. Right now, Joe Biden is nice, kindly Joe. The man who stood next to Barack Obama all those years.</p><p>But when Punxsutawney Biden finally emerges for that first gasp of election air, he's going to face some withering attention and he has a challenge. Both of these candidates have a challenge.</p><p>Joe Biden has to convince America that he is in charge, that he's not in cognitive decline and fragile and that he can actually run things.</p><p>The President, on the other hand, has to convince Americans that he will be the agent of not only law and order, but safety and prosperity in a winsome calm and winning way.</p><p>You saw a bit of that in my interview. He was somehow at peace, calm in that interview.</p><p>I think he needs to show people more of that otherwise, if he keeps reacting to every slog that comes his way, it gets into a cycle, and a media cycle that creates its own narrative and I think takes him off a point and off of his strong point, which is a thriving economy before COVID. And, and he is the law and order candidate, if he can make sure that lands.</p><p>But he's got to keep those women and he has got to also keep, you know, those independent voters that are right now awfully wobbling.</p><p>HILTON: Well, very good. As I was saying earlier in the show, a lot of advice being flung around over the last few days towards the President. I think that one, that piece there that we just heard from you, Raymond, is probably the best I've heard, which is that he is very, very good in those settings in that one to one conversation, as you say, calm and measured, focused on the detail.</p><p>I saw that in the conversation I had with him last year, and I think he should doing that all the time. Very good just to see you tonight, and those clips. We appreciate it, Raymond. See you soon.</p><p>ARROYO: Thank you my friend.</p><p>HILTON: All right, coming up outrageous anti-conservative censorship this week from Big Tech. They've really lost the plot this time. We'll show you the details after the break.</p><p>HILTON: Welcome back. So Twitter is at it again. This week, they censored the President for saying that anyone trying to create an Autonomous Zone in Washington, D.C. would be met with serious force. Twitter said it violated their policy against abusive behavior.</p><p>So lawlessly taking over parts of a city, threatening the police property and as we saw in Seattle, life, is fine. But trying to stop it is abusive? The tweet that started all this was the President warning about mail-in voting.</p><p>Twitter's idiotic fact check said it was misleading. But in 2016, millions of mail-in ballots were rejected. Imagine the chaos if the 2020 election is all mail-in as the Democrats want.</p><p>They want it for fraudulent schemes like ballot harvesting. In 2018, the Orange County Register in California said he had people dropping off maybe 100 or 200 ballots.</p><p>Just on Friday, Attorney General Barr described how hostile foreign governments are planning counterfeit ballots to interfere with November's election. I thought that lefty Big Tech elite were against that? When it turns out there's only one thing they're really against, and that is Trump.</p><p>Twitter's employees are far left giving nearly 375 times as much to Democrats as Republicans this election cycle so far. That's the Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey. He's not just left. He's lost it. He has misrepresented his role in founding Twitter in the first place and he is well known in Silicon Valley for being -- how should I put this? A bit dim.</p><p>You can tell that from the way Twitter is censoring views it disagrees with. There is not a shred of principle or intelligent thought anywhere near their capricious, intolerant and ignorant censorship decisions.</p><p>All right, what should we do about all of that? We'll discuss it with Matt and Lisa after the break.</p><p>HILTON: All right, Lisa Boothe and Matt Gaets are back with us. Twitter, Big Tech censorship, all of that. Matt, what do you make of it? What should we do about it?</p><p>GAETZ: Big Tech is censoring conservatives. They intend to steal this election from the voters and from Donald Trump and we should not let them. It's why I'm so disappointed and surprised that recently, Nikki Haley came out essentially toting the note for Big Tech saying that it would be against the interests of the First Amendment to have enforcement action and regulatory action.</p><p>Well, to me, that's loser talk. We ought to vindicate the First Amendment rights of all Americans and the way to do that is to treat them like common carriers, revoke Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act, and then have the Department of Justice bring antitrust actions against Twitter and other technology platforms that are using their market power to try to define the scope of debate in this country.</p><p>It is absolutely un-American and we need a response from our government that is stronger than the response that we got from former Ambassador Haley.</p><p>HILTON: Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, I also think competition is good and you see, you know things like Parler popping up to be an alternative to Twitter. So, I think competition is healthy as well and Republicans sort of setting up counter institutions and organizations is maybe the path to go down, as well.</p><p>But, you know, look, if President Trump didn't have Twitter, how would we communicate with the public? When you look at the fact that the vast majority of the media is negative, it's skewed, it's basically -- you know, there's not a lot of daylight between the media and the Democratic Party these days, and that is why you see Democrats and you see, you know, the Twitter giants trying to shut President Trump down even if it's just tweet by tweet because of that very reason.</p><p>The fact that he has almost 83 million people that follow him on Twitter that he can have an unfiltered access to and circumvent the media. So that is why Democrats have been so hell bent on trying to shut down his social media handles.</p><p>And it's not just that, we've even seen CNN last year wouldn't run one of his ads about Hunter Biden and Joe Biden even though it was factually correct regarding Ukraine and Burisma, so they're trying to shut him down. And you know, it's scary. It's unhealthy, I think.</p><p>GAETZ: But Steve, if I could add something there --</p><p>HILTON: ... with you about the competition point -- yes, go on, Matt. Yes, go for it.</p><p>GAETZ: Sure. Lisa mentioned unfiltered access and she is right. That's the strength of the President's communication style on Twitter. But unfortunately, that access is no longer unfiltered when Twitter is able to suppress the content not only of the President, but his allies, when Twitter is able to remove like investigative reporters like Raheem Kassam or meme artists like Carpe Donktum, they suppress the echo chamber that allows our movement to have the energy to grow and invite people in and so it's no longer unfiltered access.</p><p>And if we just sit back and sort of hope that competition emerges, I fear that we'll be too late. We had the element of surprise in 2016. They did not think Donald Trump would win. We have lost the element of surprise. We need to use the government to take action against Twitter and other digital platforms that are not fair.</p><p>HILTON: Yes, I've always said, by the way, just to sort of wrap it up that actually, we shouldn't be afraid of regulation if it's to enforce competition, or if it's to deal with abuses of the marketplace. That's a perfectly reasonable use of regulation.</p><p>Just quickly, Matt, are you on -- I didn't know you said Parler, I want to know how to pronounce it. So, Lisa has cleared that up. Are you on that? Did you set up an account there?</p><p>GAETZ: I'm on Parler. I'm ready to serve out my Parleys, I hope everyone will follow us, but we shouldn't decamp from Twitter. It's important that we stay engaged in every platform. Absolutely.</p><p>HILTON: Yes. Good to have both. All right. Thank you both, coming up --</p><p>BOOTHE: @LisaMarieBoothe on Twitter and Parler, you can follow me.</p><p>HILTON: Very good. Yes. Importantly, on both. You saw a lot of people freaking out this week about the polls and a lot of people giving President Trump election advice. What do we make of it all? That is coming up after the break.</p><p>HILTON: Welcome back. A lot of people this week, including some who really don't want a Biden presidency, like \"The Wall Street Journal\" are freaking out over the latest polls and saying President Trump and his team have to change course if he is to win in November and hold on to the Senate, too.</p><p>All right, Lisa, you're a Republican strategist, sometimes described as such -- what do you think about this question?</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, I mean, look, you look at -- the economy was President Trump's biggest selling point. Obviously, that has been undercut by the coronavirus. For me, I think President Trump seems a little bit lost right now.</p><p>I don't -- I'm not getting that strong fighter that we saw in 2016 or we saw it when he stood up to the entire world and withstood criticism from the entire world over moving the embassy to Jerusalem in Israel -- that guy. And so I don't know if it was the coronavirus and you know, the riots, but he seems to have been lost in all of it.</p><p>I want to see leadership from him. I want to see him step up and be that fighter that people went out to the polls to elect. I know it's still there. But I would like to see more of it.</p><p>HILTON: Matt, what's your take?</p><p>GAETZ: President Trump won't be running to keep America great, he'll largely be running to keep America, America. Because on the left, you have a vision for this country that bears no resemblance to the type of society that we've developed that is the greatest in all of human history.</p><p>And so I think, an enthusiastic, unapologetic embrace of Americanism is what will lead this President to victory. And I think we have to take action beyond just investigations into these people that are destroying our statues and monuments. I think there needs to be actual consequences for those folks that will deliver the type of leadership that I think Lisa and many other Americans are craving from this President in this time of great calamity.</p><p>HILTON: And Lisa, least earlier on, Matt was talking about some of the positive, forward looking messages as well as the important points he just made there, in terms of, you know, doing things to help families working for -- is that the kind of thing you also mean? You know, what am I going to do for you? What are the next four years going to be like?</p><p>BOOTHE: Well, and also just a pro-America message, and we see people right now who are set on destroying the country. So, I think Americans want to hear that.</p><p>Even from New York City while the show was going on, there are illegal fireworks going out in the middle of the street and it literally sounds like we're in the middle of a war zone.</p><p>I think there are people out there that might not necessarily be geared towards voting for Trump, but are really frustrated with the lack of leadership from liberal mayors, liberal governors who are doing nothing to protect their citizens.</p><p>So I think there's a message there for Trump to try to capture those voters. So, I'd like to hear a strong law and order message as well and standing up to that lawlessness.</p><p>HILTON: Thank you. Thank you, Lisa. Sorry to rush you. We're out of time.

I'm really sorry this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with CNN, breaking a public silence since the scandal erupted at the weekend. In a post on Facebook, he said the company \"made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.\"<br/> He said the social network planned to conduct an investigation of thousands of apps that have used Facebook's platform, restrict developer access to data, and give members a tool that lets them to disable access to their Facebook data more easily. However, his plans did not represent a big reduction of advertisers' ability to use Facebook data, which is the company's lifeblood.<br/> Zuckerberg said he was open to additional government regulation and happy to testify before the US Congress if he was the right person. \"I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" he told CNN. \"I actually think the question is more what is the right regulation rather than yes or no, should it be regulated? ... People should know who is buying the ads that they see on Facebook.\"<br/> Zuckerberg said Facebook was committed to stopping interference in the US midterm election in November and elections in India and Brazil.<br/> Investor fears<br/> Facebook shares pared gains on Wednesday after Zuckerberg's post, closing up 0.7 per cent. The company has lost more than $45 billion of its stock market value over the past three days on investor fears that any failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation.<br/> Zuckerberg told the New York Times in an interview published on Wednesday he had not seen a \"meaningful number of people\" deleting their accounts over the scandal. Facebook representatives, including Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman, met US congressional staff for nearly two hours on Wednesday and planned to continue meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Facebook was unable to answer many questions, two aides who attended the briefing said.<br/> Zuckerberg told the website Recode that fixes to protect users' data would cost \"many millions of dollars.\"<br/> The whistleblower who launched the scandal, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, said on Twitter he had accepted invitations to testify before US and UK lawmakers.<br/> The German government said Facebook must explain whether the personal data of the country's 30 million users were protected from unlawful use by third parties, according to a report in the Funke group of German regional newspapers.<br/> 'Scapegoat'<br/> On Tuesday, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended its Chief Executive Alexander Nix, who was caught in a secret recording boasting that his company played a decisive role in Trump's victory.<br/> However, the academic who provided the data disputed that on Wednesday. \"I think what Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic, and they've made claims that this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you. But I think the reality is it's not that,\" psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, an academic at Cambridge University, told the BBC in an interview.<br/> Kogan, who gathered the data by running a survey app on Facebook, also said he was being made a scapegoat by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Both companies have blamed Kogan for alleged data misuse.<br/> Only 3,00,000 Facebook users responded to Kogan's quiz, but that gave the researcher access to those people's Facebook friends as well, who had not agreed to share information, producing details on 50 million users.<br/> Facebook has said it subsequently made changes that prevent people from sharing data about friends and maintains that no breach occurred because the original users gave permission. Critics say that it essentially was a breach because data of unsuspecting friends was taken.<br/> Analysts have raised concerns that the incident will reduce user engagement with Facebook, potentially lessening its clout with advertisers. Three Wall Street brokerages cut their price targets. \"Investors now have to consider whether or not the company will conclude that it has grown in a manner that has proven to be untenable,\" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. The company has risen more than 550 percent in value in the past five years.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-n10433046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXW-J6B1-DYDW-726J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

There, her friend Owen was waiting with a joint already rolled. The weather was balmy; barely a cloud in sight. The pair smoked and caught up on school gossip, before Lucy judged that she should probably head home - any longer, and her parents might become suspicious.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When she got back, she chatted to her family, before heading upstairs to her bedroom, her mother none the wiser. Lucy, who is 17, wasn't going to let the coronavirus pandemic stop her marking <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/20/420-marijuana-hallmark-holiday\">4/20</url>, the international day of cannabis celebration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I do feel guilty about it,\" Lucy tells me, whispering (she does not want her parents to know about her weed-smoking). \"I have cut back on it the last week or so.\" Because she wanted to observe the lockdown rules? \"Well, mostly because the weather hasn't been great.\"</p><p>When social distancing measures were announced in March, thousands of students had to quickly throw their possessions into suitcases, bid goodbye to university friends, and return to their childhood bedrooms. Teenagers who'd been bracing themselves for the shock of GCSEs and A-levels were told to stand down, their exams cancelled. There will be no tearful goodbyes to friends, no rite-of-passage trips abroad, no festivals, no 18th-birthday parties. Instead, the summer months stretch out into a flat expanse of nothingness. Lucy is one of many young British adults who have been snatching moments of freedom when they can.</p><p>\"So much of your first year is about going out with your mates,\" says Harry Batt, 20, from Fareham, Hampshire. He was in his first year of a biomedical science degree at the University of Birmingham when he had to return home to live with his sister and parents, who are both key workers. \"You have that taste of freedom and then you lose it so abruptly. You feel like you're kind of existing. My sleeping patterns are pretty rubbish. There's not a lot to wake up for.\"</p><p>Socrates first complained that children \"love chatter in the place of exercise\" more than 2,000 years ago, and little has changed since then. The young adult brain is typically more dependent on social interaction than a fully matured adult's. \"The importance of peers has been a hallmark of adolescence for thousands of years,\" says Dr Amy Orben, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge's cognition and brain sciences unit. \"What we have seen in studies is that this period involves a strengthening of social ties and a reconfiguration of social networks. Young people are finding their place in a maturing social world.\" </p><p>It is too soon to know what the impact of the lockdown will be on young people, because the coronavirus pandemic is so unprecedented. \"It's something we will only fully understand in future years, through more detailed study,\" Orben says.</p><p>Batt's lockdown hasn't been entirely unsociable; he's in a tentative new romance with someone who lives locally. They connected on Instagram, and, although they haven't met yet, they have spent hours on video calls. \"The hours we've spent on FaceTime, it's ridiculous,\" Batt jokes. \"It's probably the equivalent of 10 dates.\" Once lockdown is over, they plan to go on their first date. \"He lives near the sea, so we'll probably go for a walk on the beach and to a McDonald's drive-through.\"</p><p>I've worked really hard to get my grades, and now I'm just going to be given them - it feels like I don't deserve it</p><p>It's not just their social lives that teenagers are missing. Away from the feckless stereotypes of tabloid lore, some conscientious young people crave the satisfaction of passing through examinations into adult life. If exam season is a corset, afterwards there is the sweet release of slouching into a summer free of obligations. Without the build-up to A-levels, 17-year-old Amina, a student from a small town in the north, says she feels aimless.</p><p>\"We haven't had a prom or a chance to say goodbye properly to friends or teachers,\" she says. \"We didn't do any of the stuff people do when they leave school. That's the most frustrating part.\" She's also fearful that being part of the \"Covid generation\" will impair her long-term job prospects. \"I've been working really hard for the last two years to get my grades, and now I'm just going to be given them - it feels like I don't deserve it. Everyone is going to think we just had our grades handed to us on a plate.\"</p><p>British teenagers are among the most tested in the world, and the unhappiest. \"We have been concerned about stress for some time now,\" says Natalie Perera of the Education Policy Institute. \"Other countries test as frequently as the UK, but what is different about England in particular is that there is greater accountability. These tests come with higher stakes. Your GCSE scores matter, and so do your A-levels.\" </p><p>For diligent students, the sudden cancellation of exams can be disorienting. \"There's an emotional component,\" Perera says. \"They've been working for two years to get to this point. In some cases, they may feel deflated: this milestone they've been building towards isn't going to happen.\" Of course, for others it may be a blessed relief: teenagers are not a homogeneous bloc.</p><p>Young people who haven't had exams cancelled are also concerned. Noor Hashmi, 17, from Manchester, takes her A-levels next year. She feels that her cohort has been \"overlooked\", because they're having to teach themselves the syllabus at home, using online learning. \"If I was in college I would be properly absorbing the information,\" Hashmi says. \"But there are only so many emails you can send to your teacher without feeling you're being annoying.\" Hashmi's classes have all moved online, but she worries she's not understanding the material fully. \"I feel the teachers are going through the content too quickly,\" she says. \"It's stressful knowing that everything we've covered so far won't be revisited in depth before our exams.\"</p><p>Despite Hashmi's concerns, some educationists believe coronavirus could accelerate our progression towards more online models of teaching. \"The government will have to give the whole area of education technology much more focus, in case there's a second wave,\" Perera says. As big tech continues to move into the education sector, some Silicon Valley venture capitalists are staking top dollar on bricks-and-mortar universities becoming a thing of the past.</p><p>Amina, who is estranged from her family, lives alone, in supported accommodation. She is classed as a vulnerable student, so has been able to access the school building during lockdown. \"It's really eerie, seeing the school so silent,\" she says. \"There's no one in the halls or the canteen to say hi to.\" At home, she passes the time by packing for uni and reading course textbooks, to get ahead. She has an offer to read law at Swansea, a course she opted for after her experience of legally breaking with her family. \"I know it's early to be reading my books,\" Amina admits, \"but I can't wait to get out of here and explore. I'm tired of being inside on my own all the time.\"</p><p>For those who had already made it to university, there is a different set of challenges. Stripped of their social networks and plunged back into a childhood holding pattern, many are struggling. \"My mental health was a lot better at uni,\" says Claudia, 20, from Leeds. She is in the second year of a computer science degree but is currently self-isolating with her mother and sister at home. Lately, things have been strained. Having grown used to her freedom at university, Claudia finds it hard being told what to do. \"We'll be watching TV for a bit and Mum will say, 'Right, you need to deep clean the kitchen,'\" Claudia says. \"You have to tiptoe round her. I think she's getting obsessive about cleaning because she's not sure what else to do. It makes me feel panicky when she gets like this. I don't know what she's going to be like, day to day.\"</p><p>Claudia is not alone: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/20/420-marijuana-hallmark-holiday\">University College London's ongoing Covid-19 social study</url>, which has been tracking the psychological and social experiences of adults in the UK during the pandemic, indicates that depression and anxiety levels have been higher in young adults than in the general population. In April, 17-year-old Manchester student       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/20/420-marijuana-hallmark-holiday\">Beth Palmer</url> took her own life after telling her parents that she was struggling to cope with the lockdown restrictions. A month later,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/20/420-marijuana-hallmark-holiday\">Matthew Mackell</url>, also 17, killed himself in a park in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Mackell, an academic high achiever, left behind a notebook in which the A-level student expressed his fears that the lockdown might affect his results.</p><p>As families have been forced to spend more time together, tensions can rise: the victims' commissioner for England and Wales has warned of a spike in domestic abuse cases, which impact children as well as adults.</p><p>\"Previous studies have shown that teenagers and young adults are among the most lonely people in the UK, despite being the most digitally connected,\" Orben says. \"The removal of contact outside the home during a lockdown can be very destructive.\" In addition to her family confrontations, Claudia tells me she misses her boyfriend; she hasn't seen him for six weeks, which, she says, feels like an eternity. \"I'm probably going to be here until September,\" she says. </p><p>When you feel your grasp on adult life slipping, you grab freedom wherever you can. Lucy has kept her violations to a smattering of joints with friends - although there was that one time where four of them got together in a field and hung out. \"In fairness, that was unplanned,\" Lucy says. \"It was spontaneous.\" Lucy has confessed to friends that she's been breaking the rules. \"They said, 'At least you're being honest about it, so we're not so angry.'\"</p><p>Other transgressors have come in for social censure. Someone Lucy knows recently had a birthday party in his parents' garden. Photos appeared online, and WhatsApp groups turned into choruses of disapproval. \"There was a backlash,\" Lucy says. \"It definitely wasn't OK, but I also don't think it's OK for people to bitch about him behind his back.\"</p><p>It's assumed that young people are unlikely to be seriously affected by coronavirus and are mostly in isolation to stop transmission to others - but many are in high-risk groups themselves. \"I'm stuck in limbo,\" says Adam Preston, a 22-year-old student at the University of Sheffield who is currently back at his family home in Eastbourne, East Sussex. </p><p>Preston has a rare form of blood cancer, meaning he is at high risk from coronavirus. The government has told him that he has to isolate until 30 June. Before the pandemic hit, Preston had been accepted on to an Erasmus programme in Stockholm. \"I worked so hard to get that place to study abroad,\" he says, sounding morose. \"And now, because of my health, it looks extremely unlikely I'm going to be able to do that.\"</p><p>In lieu of a year's study in Sweden, Preston's life is now limited to the four walls of his parents' house, and the occasional walk outside, avoiding human interaction. He was previously on a waiting list for NHS mental health support, but his long-awaited assessment was cancelled due to the pandemic. \"I feel like every avenue of progression I've been working towards for the last year has been frozen,\" he says.</p><p>Coronavirus is more than an existential fear: it has put the breaks on rebellion, or the generational search for answers</p><p>What might be the long-term consequences of so many months stuck indoors for a young person who already struggles with their mental health? \"A lot of people are drawing analogies with the Great Depression,\" says Dr Cheryl Sisk, professor of neuroscience at Michigan State University. \"We're seeing a big disruption in people's lives, and I think it's going to have a major influence on the generation that is currently in adolescence and young adulthood.\"</p><p>Sisk explains that young people feel stress more acutely than adults: tests on lab rats find that adolescent rats struggle to turn off their stress response as quickly as adult rats do. \"The general neural systems that regulate emotion and executive function are still a work in progress,\" Sisk says. \"That means that the brain is more susceptible to life disruptions than a fully matured brain. There is evidence from what we know about neural development that this could have a longer-lasting impact on teenagers than adults.\"</p><p>In addition, coronavirus will lead to the economic hangover to end all hangovers. \"Every generation has its own task in its own time,\" says the writer Jon Savage, author of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/20/420-marijuana-hallmark-holiday\">Teenage: The Creation</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/20/420-marijuana-hallmark-holiday\">Of Youth 1875-1945</url>. \"When I was a teenager in the 1960s, I was terrified I would die in a nuclear war. The thought that I could die at any time changed the way I looked at the world. There are always terrible events that threaten our future, until things change and the next threat comes along.\"</p><p>But coronavirus feels different. For starters, young people can't pin badges to their chests and go out to protest against the virus. They can't do anything, really, apart from obey their parents' house rules - few have places of their own - and wait for the world to reopen. Coronavirus is more than just an existential fear: it has also put the brakes on reaction, rebellion, or the generational search for answers. It has forced young adults to return to their families, and accelerated the destruction of existing models of work, in sectors such as high-street retail and manufacturing; this generation of young adults will have to navigate their way through a world that is radically changed.</p><p>\"This generation are growing up in the death throes of the post-world war two world order,\" Savage says. \"They are going to have to work out a new method of organisation that is sustainable and allows for a reasonable life for all.\"</p><p>This social reorganisation is likely to be conducted amid a protracted recession in which young people will suffer disproportionately. \"What we've seen in previous downturns is that the graduate job market has contracted,\" Perera says. She anticipates a rising number of young people going into stable professions such as teaching as a stopgap until (if) the economy gets back on track. \"We always need teachers, and it's a safe profession, although not as well paid as other graduate jobs.\"</p><p>Young people may also look at frontline health workers during the pandemic and consider careers in nursing and medicine; or they could see headlines about PPE shortages and be put off due to safety concerns. </p><p>'Coronavirus might change people for the better. We want to do our part and give back'</p><p>Coronavirus could even herald the end of teenagers as a social category entirely. \"The word 'teenager' really began as a marketing concept,\" Savage explains. \"America had won the war and democratic consumerism came to Europe; these were the fresh young people who could be marketed and sold to.\"</p><p>But teenagers aren't as valuable as they once were to marketers. \"Our society has learned to market products that were initially aimed at teenagers to people of all ages,\" Savage says. With teenagers likely to suffer the most from an economic downturn, the concept of the teenager as a discrete subgroup of cash-rich consumers, dreamed up in the boardrooms of Mad Men-era advertising agencies, will effectively be over. </p><p>This may not be an entirely bad thing. Once the dust settles, young people will have to reconsider their futures in a rapidly shifting world. \"Things aren't going to go back to normal,\" Savage says. \"The young are going to play an active part in either destroying or creating a new world. That's kind of extraordinary.\" He predicts greater youth-led social activism, particularly around the climate emergency and animal rights.</p><p>Hashmi tells me she feels tentatively hopeful for the future. \"I think coronavirus might change people for the better,\" she says. \"Some of my friends, who weren't considering working in hospitals and stuff, now look at clap-for-carers and think, we want to do our part and give back.\" She believes coronavirus will create a more compassionate, selfless generation of young people. \"I think we're more aware of others now,\" Hashmi goes on. \"At the start of this, I was just thinking about making myself safe. But seeing the death toll increase, I was thinking about everyone else.\" Despite the fact that the lockdown restrictions have been eased, with socially distanced meet-ups for one individual from each household now permitted, Hashmi is in no rush to start socialising. \"Most of my friends and I think that it would be safer and better to meet when the lockdown is way, way more relaxed and the death toll has decreased,\" she says. \"It doesn't feel safe to go out right now.\"</p><p>Most of the young adults I spoke to accepted the lockdown in a spirit of sacrifice, with equanimity and good grace. Very few had considered breaking the rules. \"We want to stay in,\" Batt explains. \"We know it's for the best.\"</p><p>And when the lockdown is finally over, they will step out into a world that is radically uncertain, full of promise but also doubt. Will the kids be all right? \"I'd like to think the kids will always be all right,\" Savage concludes. \"I have great faith in young people and their ability to see what is wrong with the world and come up with solutions. I am always optimistic.\" </p><p>                      Some names have been changed.

With Thanksgiving looming, I'm pondering all I'm grateful for.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks did great this year, and our global economy is finally growing almost everywhere. And leading indicators suggest more good times ahead. But there is so much more.</p><p>I'm tickled pink Brexit hasn't caused big global disasters, ISIS is retreating, Syrian incivility improved some and North Korea hasn't gone Ka-boom. And the fact that South Korea's stock market rose 45% this year indicates that we should fear nuclear North Korea less. I'm also glad that Europe's 2017 elections, so feared initially, were so benign overall. Few have faith in Europe -- its economy, banks and politics. But four-plus years of growth, political gridlock and super strong bank balance sheets are  uber-bullish.</p><p>I'm thankful society underestimates the stock market's extreme history. Few fathom that stocks have risen more than 20% in over a third of all years. Most folks feel 2017 is bigger compared to normal than it really is.</p><p>And I'm grateful that people believe stock valuations are too high for more bull market. See my October column showing why that's a bullish false fear. And that so many fear new market highs, per my September column.</p><p>Inflation is low globally, yet central banks misunderstand why. As detailed in my  column earlier this month, that will help keep interest rates lower than consensus expectations. And I'm happy stock strategists fear leftward lurches in Mexican and Brazilian elections next year, and from that, economic and market chaos and lower prices. That means current fears and pessimism are already holding down stock prices. So, even if it happens, stocks can't fall much. And if it doesn't happen, we get positive surprise and higher stock prices. Hurray.</p><p>It's also great that 2017's disastrous hurricanes and wildfires weren't even worse.</p><p>Thankfully, I'm American, where the two edgy national TV ads my firm currently runs --where I say controversial things like \"die and go to hell\" and babble on about the \"F-word\" while skewering large, slime-bag portions of the financial services sector -- remain uncensored. Liberty is cool and underrated.</p><p>I appreciate huge tech stocks scaring investors in June but, as predicted in my June column, rising strongly ever since. And I'm thankful for all that tech firms create for us. And for the media, which is now culture-hostile to big tech, regulatory-wise, giving these stocks upside sentiment potential.</p><p>I'm really glad I don't wash dishes for a living like I did when I was 16, five nights a week, and every weekend, for a year.</p><p>I'm thankful for my 60,000-plus Twitter followers reading my almost daily idiocy at @kennethlfisher since starting in February. And I'm thrilled you USA TODAY readers are the very first to know I just got Instagram up and working at @KenFisher_FisherInvestments.</p><p>Thank you for reading me here. It's truly my thrill. Keep on reading please.</p><p>Finally, I love USA TODAY's new format -- simpler, bolder, brighter -- directly in the tradition it pioneered 35 years ago.</p><p>Ken Fisher is the founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments, author of 11 books, four of which were New York Times bestsellers, and is No. 200 on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>photo</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-95459871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R0V-1BN1-JC8N-K0YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Gannett Company, Inc.

Doug Engelbart Institute[1]  Courtesy ofMargaret O'Mara[2], University of Washington[3] On a crisp California afternoon in early December 1968, a square-jawed, mild-mannered Stanford researcher named Douglas Engelbart took the stage at San Francisco's Civic Auditorium and proceeded to blow everyone's mind[4] about what computers could do. Sitting down at a keyboard, this computer-age Clark Kent calmly showed a rapt audience of computer engineers how the devices they built could be utterly different kinds of machines[5] - ones that were 'alive for you all day,' as he put it, immediately responsive to your input, and which didn't require users to know programming languages in order to operate. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/232179/original/file-20180815-2894-veevoq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/232179/original/file-20180815-2894-veevoq.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>   The prototype computer mouse Doug Engelbart used in his demo. Michael Hicks[6], CC BY[7]  Engelbart typed simple commands. He edited a grocery list. As he worked, he skipped the computer cursor across the screen using a strange wooden box that fit snugly under his palm. With small wheels underneath and a cord dangling from its rear, Engelbart dubbed it a 'mouse.' The 90-minute presentation went down in Silicon Valley history as the 'mother of all demos[8],' for it previewed a world of personal and online computing[9] utterly different from 1968's status quo. It wasn't just the technology that was revelatory; it was the notion that a computer could be something a non-specialist individual user could control from their own desk. Play Video[10]  The first part of the 'mother of all demos.'  Shrinking the massive machines In the America of 1968, computers weren't at all personal. They were refrigerator-sized behemoths that hummed and blinked, calculating everything from consumer habits to missile trajectories, cloistered deep within corporate offices, government agencies and university labs. Their secrets were accessible only via punch card and teletype terminals. The Vietnam-era counterculture already had made mainframe computers into ominous symbols of a soul-crushing Establishment. Four years before, the student protesters of Berkeley's Free Speech Movement[11] had pinned signs to their chests that bore a riff on the prim warning that appeared on every IBM punch card: 'I am a UC student. Please don't bend, fold, spindle or mutilate me[12].'       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://embed.radiopublic.com/e?if=heat-and-light-WYDE55\u2265=s1!d28fa9002b17ee1c91a07ef2450ba6954a597435\">https://embed.radiopublic.com/e?if=heat-and-light-WYDE55\u2265=s1!d28fa9002b17ee1c91a07ef2450ba6954a597435</url>[13] Hear Prof. O'Mara discuss this topic on our Heat and Light podcast[14]. Earlier in 1968, Stanley Kubrick's trippy '2001: A Space Odyssey' mined moviegoers' anxieties about computers run amok[15] with the tale of a malevolent mainframe that seized control of a spaceship from its human astronauts. Voices rang out on Capitol Hill about the uses and abuses of electronic data-gathering, too. Missouri Senator Ed Long regularly delivered floor speeches he called 'Big Brother updates[16].' North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin declared that mainframe power posed a threat to the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. 'The computer,' Ervin warned darkly[17], 'never forgets.' As the Johnson administration unveiled plans to centralize government data in a single, centralized national database, New Jersey Congressman Cornelius Gallagher declared that it was just another grim step toward scientific thinking taking over modern life, 'leaving as an end result a stack of computer cards where once were human beings[18].' The zeitgeist of 1968[19] helps explain why Engelbart's demo so quickly became a touchstone and inspiration for a new, enduring definition of technological empowerment[20]. Here was a computer that didn't override human intelligence or stomp out individuality, but instead could, as Engelbart put it, 'augment human intellect.' While Engelbart's vision of how these tools might be used was rather conventionally corporate - a computer on every office desk and a mouse in every worker's palm - his overarching notion of an individualized computer environment hit exactly the right note for the anti-Establishment technologists coming of age in 1968, who wanted to make technology personal and information free[21]. Play Video[22]  The second part of the 'mother of all demos.'  Over the next decade, technologists from this new generation would turn what Engelbart called his 'wild dream' into a mass-market reality - and profoundly transform Americans' relationship to computer technology. Government involvement In the decade after the demo, the crisis of Watergate[23] and revelations of CIA and FBI snooping[24] further seeded distrust in America's political leadership and in the ability of large government bureaucracies to be responsible stewards of personal information. Economic uncertainty and an antiwar mood slashed public spending[25] on high-tech research and development - the same money that once had paid for so many of those mainframe computers and for training engineers to program them. Enabled by the miniaturizing technology of the microprocessor[26], the size and price of computers plummeted[27], turning them into affordable and soon indispensable tools for work and play. By the 1980s and 1990s, instead of being seen as machines made and controlled by government, computers had become ultimate expressions of free-market capitalism[28], hailed by business and political leaders alike as examples of what was possible when government got out of the way and let innovation bloom. There lies the great irony in this pivotal turn in American high-tech history. For even though 'the mother of all demos' provided inspiration for a personal, entrepreneurial, government-is-dangerous-and-small-is-beautiful computing era, Doug Engelbart's audacious vision would never have made it to keyboard and mouse without government research funding in the first place. Engelbart was keenly aware of this, flashing credits up on the screen at the presentation's start listing those who funded his research team: the Defense Department's Advanced Projects Research Agency, later known as DARPA; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the U.S. Air Force. Only the public sector had the deep pockets, the patience and the tolerance for blue-sky ideas without any immediate commercial application. Although government funding played a less visible role in the high-tech story after 1968, it continued to function as critical seed capital for next-generation ideas. Marc Andreessen and his fellow graduate students developed their groundbreaking web browser in a government-funded university laboratory[29]. DARPA and NASA money helped fund the graduate research project[30] that Sergey Brin and Larry Page would later commercialize as Google. Driverless car technology got a jump-start after a government-sponsored competition[31]; so has nanotechnology, green tech and more. Government hasn't gotten out of Silicon Valley's way; it remained there all along, quietly funding the next generation of boundary-pushing technology. Play Video[32]  The third part of the 'mother of all demos.'  Today, public debate rages once again on Capitol Hill about computer-aided invasions of privacy[33]. Hollywood spins apocalyptic tales of technology run amok[34]. Americans spend days staring into screens, tracked by the smartphones in our pockets[35], hooked on social media[36]. Technology companies are among the biggest and richest[37] in the world. It's a long way from Engelbart's humble grocery list. But perhaps the current moment of high-tech angst can once again gain inspiration from the mother of all demos. Later in life, Engelbart described his life's work as a quest to 'help humanity cope better with complexity and urgency[38].' His solution was a computer that was remarkably different from the others of that era, one that was humane and personal, that augmented human capability rather than boxing it in. And he was able to bring this vision to life because government agencies funded his work. Now it's time for another mind-blowing demo of the possible future, one that moves beyond the current adversarial moment[39] between big government and Big Tech. It could inspire people to enlist public and private resources and minds in crafting the next audacious vision for our digital future.

They had convinced (almost) everyone that it would go on forever \u2026 but even cheating as much as they were, they were completely wrong. The degree to which they were getting away with rigging the system rotted the system, until eventually \u2014 once again \u2014 it collapsed. And this time it would have triggered a global financial meltdown if the very taxpayers they had been cheating hadn\u2019t bailed them out. We all suffered through that recession and are still suffering from the repercussions.</p><p> Are you seeing a pattern here? When industry isn\u2019t regulated, it eventually stops regulating itself \u2014 and then it collapses, taking everything down with it.</p><p> It\u2019s happening again with big tech \u201cunicorns\u201d that were propped up by Wall Street \u2026 despite the fact that they never made a profit and that it was never clear how they would make a profit. The financial laws of cause and effect were suspended for them. Now, they\u2019re starting to collapse and they\u2019re not just taking down investors \u2026 they\u2019re taking down their employees, and they already hurt all the people who were running actual businesses with actual revenue streams who couldn\u2019t compete against Wall Street pouring billions into businesses that were allowed to lose money. Those billions invested hurt competing businesses, artificially inflated real estate prices, upended traditional industries (like taxis) that nobody loved but that were at least functional and allowed people to make a living.</p><p> There\u2019s an obvious lesson here: When enough people in systems get away with breaking rules, the systems eventually collapse and take innocent people down with them. Some of the people breaking the rules (or, ya know, \u201ccommitting crimes,\u201d which is what usually happened) may end up profiting from the catastrophe: Uber\u2019s founder, Travis Kalanick, walked away with billions for creating a company that never turned a profit but wrecked all its functional competition, and WeWork\u2019s founder Adam Neumann got paid billions to leave a company worth a fraction of the value he claimed it was.</p><p> They\u2019re doing fine. But the damage they do to everyone around them \u2014 to us \u2014 is incalculable. And the more they succeed by gaming the system, the more the systems we depend on to live in the global economy crumble and rot.</p><p> The same thing applies in politics. The more politicians get away with breaking rules, the more our political system crumbles and rots.</p><p> When a president can successfully be above the law, the law itself collapses, just like when big businesses cheat and commit fraud \u2014 even if they\u2019re successful \u2014 the economic systems around them collapse. Donald Trump is the Enron of our politics. The only way he succeeds, at this point is if he can break everything else in government.</p><p> And isn\u2019t it interesting that the very politicians who say that businesses should never be regulated \u2014 that they should get to regulate themselves, despite that being catastrophic for the American people, again and again and again \u2014 are also the politicians saying that a president should get to regulate himself, no matter what he does. That any investigation of how he\u2019s used his power is out of bounds. That the law can\u2019t touch him, because he is the law.</p><p> Some people are very comfortable breaking everything, as long as it turns out well for them.</p><p> But, just to be clear, those people are not on your side. They are the people taking advantage of you.</p><p> When did we stop understanding that people who cannot be trusted to uphold just laws cannot be trusted at all? How did that happen?</p><p>           Benjamin Wachs archives his work at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.FascinatingStranger.com\">www.FascinatingStranger.com</url>. com.

Cyber threats in 2020: Top cybersecurity executives from companies around the world say they expect the banking and tech sectors, plus government agencies, to be top targets for attacks in 2020. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2.  Lifting tech protections: Sen. Ted Cruz is asking the U.S. Trade Representative to remove language in U.S. trade deals that protects top technology companies from lawsuits. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3.  TikTok in spotlight: No one from the Chinese-owned video app TikTok will be at the Senate Judiciary hearing this week to examine links between Beijing and the app developer, but that won't let the company escape scrutiny. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">4. Artificial intelligence will alter warfare: Machine learning will change the course of how conflicts are managed and prosecuted, and China and the U.S. are locked into a race to see who can leverage new technologies first and best, a new report to Congress says.  </p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Banking, tech, government seen as vulnerable to cyberattacks in 2020</p><p>Cyberattacks in 2020 are likely to persist at the same level as this year or even worsen, with banking, technology sectors and government agencies being the top three targets of such attacks, according to a global survey of cybersecurity experts commissioned by security research firm FireEye. </p><p>\"The biggest concerns for organizations during a cyberattack or breach event are loss of sensitive data, impacts to customers, and business operation disruptions,\" according to the survey findings released Monday. </p><p>A majority of the survey respondents said the cost of providing cybersecurity to their organizations was worth the price tag, adding they planned to increase cybersecurity spending in 2020 by as much as 9 percent compared with current spending. </p><p>The survey collected responses from 800 participants who were top cybersecurity executives of companies in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, Japan and South Korea. The survey was done during July and August, FireEye said. </p><p>More than half the companies surveyed said they were neither well prepared to detect nor ready to respond well to a cyberattack. And 29 percent of the companies that have plans to detect and respond to attacks said they had not tested such plans.</p><p>Almost all the companies in the survey said they had or were planning to get cybersecurity insurance in the next 18 months to protect against breaches and data loss, but 56 percent of those who have such insurance said they found the policies were too pricey for the value they provided.  </p><p>Respondents said attacks they had experienced in the past 12 months were perpetrated by hacker groups, criminals and lone actors. Nation states and their agencies were the least likely source of attacks, except in South Korea, where respondents believed foreign governments to be one of the top three sources of attacks. </p><p>The survey showed a divergence in views on security with 51 percent of companies in the United States believing that cloud services were more secure than on site networks, whereas globally 60 percent of organizations believed that on site networks were safer.</p><p>The vast majority of companies worldwide, or 88 percent, said they were using artificial intelligence technologies to detect cyberattacks. </p><p>2. Cruz wants to keep Big Tech's liability shield out of trade deals</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wants U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to remove language protecting technology companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google from lawsuits arising out of U.S. trade deals with Mexico, Canada and Japan.</p><p>In a letter to Lighthizer on Friday, Cruz also asked that language mirroring Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1996, which protects websites from being sued for third-party content posted on their platforms, not be included in the Trump administration's future trade deals.</p><p>Including the liability shield in trade deals is a good thing for Silicon Valley and effectively exports a key aspect of U.S. tech regulation around the world. But the deals come at a time when critics of Big Tech from both ends of the political spectrum have questioned whether the companies should continue to enjoy Section 230 protections.</p><p>Cruz specifically mentioned provisions in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which has not been ratified by Congress, and a mini-trade deal struck with Japan last month, which does not require congressional approval but has yet to be approved by the Diet, Japan's legislative body.</p><p>Cruz said trade deals brokered by the administration should reflect \"settled American law, values, and customs,\" and \"should not contain provisions that are the subject of ongoing debate.\"</p><p>\"With members of both the Senate and House of Representatives seriously considering whether to amend or eliminate Section 230's grant of immunity because big tech is not living up to its end of the legislative bargain, I believe that enshrining it in our trade agreements would be a mistake,\" Cruz wrote to Lighthizer.</p><p>Cruz's letter is available here. </p><p>-- Dean DeChiaro  </p><p>3. TikTok likely in the spotlight at Judiciary hearing on data privacy and China</p><p>The hugely popular video app TikTok isn't sending a representative to a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing about the relationship between technology companies and China, but that doesn't mean it will succeed in avoiding an undesirable spotlight.</p><p>The hearing comes days after Reuters reported that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has initiated a national security review of TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, amid concerns over how it stores user data and could potentially be used as a surveillance tool by the government in Beijing.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., the Big Tech critic who will chair Tuesday's hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, said in a tweet Monday that TikTok is making a \"mistake\" by not testifying.</p><p>\"Come and testify tomorrow about your ties to [the] Communist Chinese Party,\" Hawley tweeted. \"I'll save a place for you.\"</p><p>A representative for TikTok told Politico the company could not provide a witness on short notice but is \"committed to working productively with Congress.\"</p><p>The report of a government review of potential threats posed by TikTok won bipartisan praise last week, including from Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who had requested the review with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.</p><p>\"This new investigation is validation of our concern that apps like TikTok -- that store massive amounts of personal data accessible to foreign governments -- may pose serious risks to millions of Americans and deserve greater scrutiny,\" Schumer said in a statement.</p><p>-- Dean DeChiaro</p><p>4. Artificial intelligence competition could be decisive with China, report says</p><p>The United States is locked in a high-stakes competition with China over artificial intelligence, and whoever wins will have a significant security and economic edge.</p><p>That's the early conclusion reached by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which released its interim report to Congress on Monday.</p><p>To beat China in the quickly developing world of AI, the United States must meld the military's efforts with commercial technological breakthroughs and cutting-edge academic research, commission chairman Eric Schmidt and vice chairman Robert Work told reporters.</p><p>\"We've got to get this right. This is not optional. For our national security, for our economic prosperity, the stakes of this are immense,\" said Schmidt, the former executive chairman of Google and Alphabet Inc. who has chaired the advisory Defense Innovation Board since April 2016. \"How the U.S. adopts AI will have profound ramifications for our economic well-being and position in the world.\"</p><p>The publication of the interim report -- the commission's final product is due next spring -- concludes the commission's assessment phase of examining the challenges posed by AI, said Work.</p><p>\"To date, the assessment phase has focused on the foreign threats to our national security in the AI area, how AI can improve the government's ability to defend the country,\" and teaming with allies, said Work, who served as deputy Defense secretary during the Obama administration. \"We want to make sure we preserve a favorable balance of military power in the world so that our conventional deterrents are strong and the chances of us ever having to fight a war are reduced.\"</p><p>The interim report does not offer recommendations, but identifies five priorities: invest in AI research; apply AI to national security missions; train and recruit AI talent; protect and advance U.S. technological advantages; marshal global cooperation and prepare for possible confrontation.</p><p>Andrew Clevenger has more on the commission's report here. </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

As for what lies ahead in 2020, regulators will dig in further on the tech sector's handling of data, among other issues, with Facebook , Alphabet , Amazon , and others in the crosshairs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>European Debates <br/></p><p>As was the case with GDPR, the EU will lead the way in more aggressive oversight of privacy. And there are a few key debates to watch, according to Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna, senior policy counsel at the Future of Privacy Forum.</p><p>One is an effort to update the ePrivacy Directive, a 2002 law that serves as the other major pillar of European digital privacy law. GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive, which requires user consent for cookies and other tracking devices, \"have a very complex relationship,\" said Gabriela <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Zanfir</emphasis>-<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fortuna</emphasis>, a Senior Policy Counsel at the Future of Privacy Forum. Although updating the law has been discussed since at least 2017, EU regulators have not yet approved a framework for how the ePrivacy law should be updated to bring it into line with GDPR standards.</p><p>\"It's very difficult to strike the right balance,\" she noted.</p><p>The most recent draft, which member states will debate next year for possible adoption, would expand the ePrivacy law's scope to include IoT and machine-to-machine communication. If negotiations aren't successful, tech firms eager for more clarity on what to expect from the updated ePrivacy directive may have to wait. If it is adopted, it will also ratchet up fines for violations, a la GDPR, which can apply fines of up to 4% of a company's annual worldwide revenue. </p><p><br/>Antitrust Meets Data <br/></p><p>Competition and data privacy may seem like separate spheres, but regulators increasingly see an overlap where the biggest companies are concerned. And there are signs that European regulators could more explicitly tie the use of consumer data to antitrust enforcement. </p><p>Margrethe Vestager, head of the European Commission's antitrust division, recently signed on for a second term in that role, and also assumed expanded oversight powers over digital policy, not strictly limited to competition. That's a sign of things to come, noted Zanfir-Fortuna. </p><p>\"It gives her more power to be more strategic, and influence more of the policies of the EU,\" Zanfir-Fortuna said.</p><p>Vestager recently outlined an agenda that includes updating EU antitrust law in a way that will \"take into account the value of data whenever EU antitrust regulator looks at market power and other competitive factors,\" Zanfir-Fortuna added. \"We'll see a lot of action in this space.\"</p><p>In the U.S., regulators are also taking a harder look at how data may be used to unfairly stifle competition or evade government oversight. Earlier this week, the WSJ reported that the  as soon as January to stop the company from further integrating apps that regulators might seek to separate as part of a future breakup of the company. Facebook has sought to consolidate its data and advertising business on its core social network with Instagram and WhatsApp. </p><p><br/>U.S. Privacy Laws <br/></p><p>Although big tech firms have been pushing for a U.S. federal privacy law, with impeachment and a presidential campaign in the air, that looks unlikely to materialize in 2020. There are a few state laws on the books, namely California's Consumer Privacy Act, which goes into effect in January. And dealing with a patchwork of state laws comes with its own set of problems, according to Robert Cattanach, a partner at Dorsey &amp; Whitney and former trial attorney for the DOJ. </p><p>Contrary to popular assumptions that U.S. privacy rules will amount to watered-down versions of GDPR, Cattanach said that we may see some progressive U.S. jurisdictions propose even more aggressive regulatory schemes -- particularly in the digital advertising space. Expect more scrutiny of \"real-time bidding\" -- the ubiquitous, yet opaque, mechanism by which programmatic ads are bought and sold online. </p><p>\"There is a lot of personal information that's subject to real-time bidding, but no one really understands it other than the mysteries ad tech agencies,\" Cattanach said. \"Particularly in the EU, the regulators thought that GDPR would make some of that industry more transparent, and it hasn't it hasn't changed a thing.\" </p><p><br/><br/>Owing in part to those frustrations, some U.S. jurisdictions may seek to rewrite the rules of real-time bidding by \"making disclosure requirements more proscriptive, or use the concept of monetizing personal information to require compensating consumers\" in the bidding process, Cattanach added. </p><p>In the absence of a federal privacy law, California's privacy law is the de facto standard in the U.S. And while major tech firms with ample resources can more easily fall into compliance in 2020, one of the unintended consequences of CCPA that it places \"a disproportionate burden on smaller and mid-size companies who don't have the resources,\" Cattanach said.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon are holdings in Jim Cramer's </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-15192631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRM-C4P1-F00X-J2FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

No, I didn't think so. It was an online retailer for pet accessories that started operating in 1998.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It ran a wildly successful marketing campaign, featuring an odd doglike sock puppet, but more notably it was an early pioneer of selling stuff on the under-explored planes of the World Wide Web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the late 1990s companies were springing up like mushrooms after the rain, fertilised with bags of investor cash just for adding \".com\" to the end of their names.</p><p>Pets.com was a poster child of that boom. And regrettably as it turned out also of the bust. Listed publicly on the stock market in August 1998, fewer than 270 days later it filed for bankruptcy - a remarkable feat, even as the internet ushered in a new era of speed.</p><p>The problem was that the rise of the web had prompted almost unprecedented economic speculation. It opened up a galaxy of opportunity for both consumers and entrepreneurs. And every investor with cash in their pocket and dollar signs in their eyes wanted a piece of the sacred pie. Companies that had yet to turn a profit - and, as it later turned out, never would - were valued at billions of dollars. Rock-bottom interest rates made bank funding readily available.</p><p>And then suddenly, almost overnight, the glossy ecosystem of newfangled corporates started to unravel dramatically. Investors woke up to the idea that many of these new corporations lacked the basics: a fundamental ability to generate money on a sustainable level.</p><p>What happened next has been documented exhaustively, but in recent years this particular tale of economic demise has been drowned out in the bars, restaurants and boardrooms of Wall Street, Canary Wharf and Silicon Valley. It's become folklore. One for the annals of crises past. The mistakes of our ignorant forefathers.</p><p>Many of those making the investment decisions, launching the companies and even writing about them today don't remember how they felt when the Nasdaq tech stock index lost almost 80\u00e2\u20ac\u00afpercent of its value in the space of just over two years.</p><p>So what's there to say about it today? The only tech they (and we!) cared about was making sure Tamagotchis got fed. Mark Zuckerberg was 15 when Pets.com went bust and even a whizz-kid like him probably wouldn't have been able to tell you the merits of calculating a price-to-earnings ratio.</p><p>Now as Amazon's share price surges above $1\u00e2\u20ac\u00af000 (R13\u00e2\u20ac\u00af283), as Google owner Alphabet looks back on 30\u00e2\u20ac\u00afpercent of share price growth in the past year, and as investors start predicting that Apple will hit the $1\u00e2\u20ac\u00aftrillion valuation mark, it may well pay to start dusting off those history books.</p><p>Truth is, the evidence we might be heading for trouble is staggering and far more worrisome than what the global fallout from something as isolated as Brexit might be. And you don't have to take my word for it.</p><p>Last month Robert Bouroujerdi, chief investment officer at Goldman Sachs, and most definitely someone who does remember the last dotcom boom, published a report in which he cautioned of the growing risks presented by the meteoric rise of the Big Five tech behemoths: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft.</p><p>Bouroujerdi noted that in the year to the start of June, these companies added a total of $600bn of market capitalisation - the equivalent of the gross domestic product of Hong Kong and South Africa combined. Parallels to the 1999-2000 crash are becoming increasingly evident, he said.</p><p>The note roiled the market, giving us a taste of just how nervy some of the investors in these companies are becoming. Apple shares fell 4\u00e2\u20ac\u00afpercent, swiping about $30bn off the market capitalisation of the world's most valuable company, and this was a relatively moderate warning. Just think of the impact a more harrowing premonition might have had.</p><p>Tech companies are deeply intertwined: when one falls it often takes scores of others down with it and often psychology dictates that the more a stock falls the more likely it is to fall further. Imagine rats scuttling for the exit on a sinking ship.</p><p>No one wants to be caught inside a cabin and sink. The question we should be asking ourselves now is what will cause the first domino to topple. It could be any number of things.</p><p>The EU last month slapped Google with an eye-watering \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.4bn (R36.16bn) fine for abusing its dominance in the market for search engines. Now others are in the regulator's crosshairs, because of concerns around everything from advertising standards to consumer privacy.</p><p>The EU certainly has the teeth and the clout to curtail big tech companies' dominance. Some campaigners have even called for a break-up of the tech giants, borrowing the \"too-big-to-fail\" refrain from their banking buddies. Might that be enough to send investors scampering?</p><p>And then of course there are the reputational dramas that have engulfed the sector. A string of expos\u00c3\u00a9s has cast an unflattering and deeply necessary light on the rampant sexism and abuse prevalent across many of the big companies and their smaller prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9s.</p><p>Capitalist warriors looking for a quick buck or the prestige of being a Silicon Valley hero might not necessarily care about such issues as discrimination and misogyny for now. But they certainly will once the big financial endorsers determine that things have gotten a little too risqu\u00c3\u00a9 for them to be involved.</p><p>The tech sector is a small world and reputation can be quick to destroy and hellish to rebuild. Perhaps that will be the straw that breaks the unicorns' backs.</p><p>It might seem hard to think of companies of such titanic magnitude as anything other than unflappable. But once again, giants have fallen before. General Motors was the biggest company in the world 20 years ago. Today it doesn't feature in the top 10.</p><p>The business landscape is constantly evolving, sticking to a boom-and-bust cycle, as we experience and then forget what happens when we become too greedy.</p><p>A doglike sock puppet may have been an unlikely victim of the last dotcom crisis. I don't see why a precocious unicorn wouldn't be just as good at playing that part. - The Independent</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MERCSA-96490644</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MERCSA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NYM-6CD1-F091-R55T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312450</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 07, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0007598</classCode><className>IPET HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Overtourism, racial bias, fee transparency and controlling the party crowd are also in the mix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the travel wreckage caused by the pandemic, home-sharing has emerged as battered, but with a steady pulse, as rental houses became social-distancing refuges for the travel-starved. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Home rentals have outperformed hotels in 27 global markets since the onset of Covid-19, according to a report by the hotel benchmarking firm STR and the short-term rental analysts AirDNA. As leisure travel ticked up this summer, average daily rates were higher for rentals in July 2020 versus July 2019 in the United States -- from about $300 to $323 -- thanks to the popularity of larger homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Still, global restrictions have squeezed every aspect of the travel industry, including vacation rentals. Across home-sharing platforms, according to STR and AirDNA, occupancy fell by almost half between mid-March and the end of June to between roughly 33 and 36 percent, depending on the size of the rental (hotels by comparison fell to an average of 17.5 percent occupancy).</p><p>  The biggest player in the short-term rental market, with more than 7 million listings in over 220 countries, is Airbnb. Over the years, its rampant growth and lack of transparency have made it a target for everything from charges of fueling overtourism and turning formerly residential neighborhoods into tourist zones to enabling raucous parties despite complaints and virus-related restrictions on gatherings.</p><p>  After laying off a quarter of its work force in the spring, Airbnb jettisoned some new ventures, including forays into transportation and entertainment, and hunkered down to focus on its core strength, lodging, even as its valuation fell from a high of $31 billion to, recently, $18 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>  Now, as Airbnb prepares to go public, we talked to Airbnb's co-founder and chief executive, Brian Chesky, along with other industry experts, about some of the company's challenges and the ways it is changing travel.</p><p>  ''People want to travel, they just don't want to get on airplanes,'' Mr. Chesky said. ''They don't want to go for business. They don't want to stay in the really big cities as prevalently as they used to. They don't want to be in crowded hotel districts.'' But, he said, ''they do want to get out of the house. And so we think demand is going to be strong in the future. I'm very optimistic, actually, about the industry.''</p><p>  Lifestyle vs. vacation</p><p>  Airbnb has touted privacy and guests' control over their environment -- including having your own kitchen in lieu of patronizing restaurants -- as safeguards during the pandemic. It instituted new cleaning guidelines and indicated in late August that more than 1 million listings had earned the ''Enhanced Clean'' certification, which involves training in new guidelines that detail how and what to wash and sanitize. The procedures recommend 45 minutes of cleaning per room. Some listings guarantee a 72-hour vacancy window before check in.</p><p>  The company says its offerings are aligned with the way people are traveling now, in family and friend groups to less populated destinations. Over Labor Day weekend, 30 percent of its bookings -- double the previous year -- were in remote areas, though classic vacation spots like HiltonHead Island, S.C., and Palm Springs, Calif., were among the most popular. Urban bookings remain down.</p><p>  ''We're seeing a little blurring between traveling and living,'' Mr. Chesky said. ''Before the pandemic, you lived somewhere 50, 51 weeks of the year, and if you were so fortunate, you'd go on your once-or-twice-a-year vacation. Now the pandemic is changing how people want to work, travel and live.'' Remote school and work unbind families from their homes. ''People are living differently and people want to live anywhere,'' he added.</p><p>  Whether travel truly turns into nomadism remains to be seen, though the average length of stay since May 1 increased 58 percent to more than four days, and fall bookings are stronger than usual, according to AirDNA.</p><p>  Overtourism, rising rents and housing shortages</p><p>  Cities around the world, from Barcelona to Vancouver, are looking to curb Airbnb and other short-term rental companies, which many blame for hollowing out neighborhoods as real estate managers took long-term leases and listed them as more lucrative short-term rentals.</p><p>  ''You can earn more renting out apartments and houses on Airbnb than renting to locals,'' said David Wachsmuth, an associate professor in the School of Urban Planning at McGill University in Montreal. ''What's happened on their platform is that actual home-sharing is a fraction of the activity. It's dominated by commercial interests.''</p><p>  Research published in the Harvard Business Review found that as listings rise in a city, so do rents. Analyses by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, found the costs to local communities of having Airbnb listings, including rising housing prices and shrinking availability, likely outweigh the benefits.</p><p>  ''The problems of overtourism were in the making for a long time,'' said Makarand Mody, an assistant professor of marketing in the School of Hospitality Administration at Boston University. ''Airbnb came along and made it worse. It was seen as one evil that needs to be sorted out, but there are much deeper societal and economic issues. Airbnb is just the supply side. But demand has increased so much.''</p><p>  By 2019, the rise of the middle class globally contributed to expanding tourism above the rate of worldwide economic growth for nine years in a row, according to the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council. In Airbnb, many travelers found affordable accommodations that allowed them to stay in neighborhoods rather than business centers.</p><p>  Now that the pandemic is the ultimate overtourism disrupter, Mr. Chesky believes travel has been redistributed in a lasting way to places beyond bucket-list capitals. ''It's kind of redeemed our vision,'' he said. ''What I would love is to be able to help spread out travel to as many communities as possible rather than over-concentrating them in any one place.''</p><p>  ''My speculation is that the world does not quickly snap back to the way it was,'' he added. ''I don't think travel will ever, ever look like it did in January. The world can't change so dramatically like it has and then one of the industries that's been hit hardest just looks exactly like it did before.''</p><p>  Communities aim to ensure that. Last summer, Oahu enacted a law to restrict rentals without permits on the Hawaiian island, enforced with fines. In Europe, cities like Lisbon and Dublin are buying back leases or forcing landlords into long-term rentals in an effort to ensure that when tourism rebounds it won't overwhelm them again.</p><p>  Enforcement remains thorny, and Airbnb has been accused of looking the other way when it comes to illegal listings. Last year, Los Angeles limited rentals to owner-occupied properties registered with the city, though many illegal units remain on the site, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>  In response, Airbnb just launched a new City Portal that it says will allow governments to more easily identify listings that don't comply with local regulations, such as unregistered listings.</p><p>  Before the launch, the company shared the new tool with San Francisco's Office of Short-Term Rentals. ''They're pretty positive about it and hopeful this will definitely improve their ability to get bad actors off the platform,'' said Jeffrey Cretan, a spokesman for the city's mayor.</p><p>  Perhaps because of these scofflaws, Airbnb says it has not lost significant listings. According to AllTheRooms Analytics, among popular cities in Europe, only Rome and Lisbon have shed listings, about 2,000 each. In Lisbon, the crackdown still leaves just above 14,500 listings, the same figure as in January 2019, but down from the peak in July 2019.</p><p>  The effect of more regulations may show up in the future, posing a threat to a robust portfolio. ''For a platform like Airbnb, they're not just worried about the demand side, but the supply side,'' Mr. Mody, of Boston University, said, noting the travel freeze may convince hosts to put their units in the long-term rental market, shrinking the platform, and worrying potential investors. ''When you're living on venture capital, profitability is not as important as growth,'' Mr. Mody added. ''Shareholders will be a lot less patient.''</p><p>  The music stops at party houses</p><p>  During the pandemic, Host Compliance, which tracks legal compliance among short-term rentals for 350 cities and counties in the United States, said noise complaints about so-called ''party houses'' tripled.</p><p>  ''A lot of people have been at home for a long time and they have to let some steam off and can't jump on a plane to go to Europe or Canc\u00fan to party so they are renting out short-term rentals in driving distance from their homes,'' said Ulrik Binzer, the founder and general manager of Host Compliance.</p><p>  Often, these rentals are in residential neighborhoods, triggering noise complaints and health concerns about large gatherings.</p><p>  In Miami Beach, short-term rentals were closed this summer, though those within condo and apartment buildings were allowed to reopen, with capacity limits, in August. That month, the city of Los Angeles cut the power on a house (not an Airbnb property) rented by prominent TikTok stars during a large party.</p><p>  In August, Airbnb pulled the plug, too, announcing a global ban on party houses, defined as those that persistently generate complaints from neighbors. The company says 73 percent of listings already ban parties, though hosts often allow small gatherings like baby showers and birthday parties. Occupancy is now limited to 16 people.</p><p>  Airbnb imposed a similar restriction in Canada earlier this year after a party in Toronto ended in three shooting deaths, according to BBC News.</p><p>  ''We want to do everything we can do to preserve the character of the communities and not allow these parties to get out of hand,'' Mr. Chesky said.</p><p>  It's too soon, say observers, to know if the ban is working.</p><p>  ''The issue with Airbnb party houses is enforcement,'' Mr. Binzer said. ''It's a little like having the fox watch the henhouse.''</p><p>  The $52 rental with a $125 cleaning fee</p><p>  On Sept. 14, a Twitter user wrote, ''Found a cheap @Airbnb for 52 dollars. Cleaning fee for 1 night, 125. Nonsense.''</p><p>  It's a typical complaint about the platform, which lists attractive nightly rates, but buries the fees until users begin booking. Cleaning and service fees can be modest -- zero to $25, say -- or add $450 to a booking, reflecting a mix of mandatory and optional host-applied fees. Sometimes there are additional occupancy taxes. And in some countries, Airbnb applies a Value Added Tax on its service fees.</p><p>  Under Airbnb's pricing structure, hosts pay the company 3 percent of the booking subtotal, which includes the nightly rate plus any cleaning fee and fees for additional guests. Most guests are charged a service fee of less than 14.2 percent of the booking subtotal, which goes to Airbnb. (If hosts elect to cover the fee entirely, they normally pay Airbnb 14 to 16 percent of the subtotal.)</p><p>  Because of their variability and lack of transparency, fees are the latest financial facet users have fixated on after the company created its extenuating circumstances policy during the pandemic. It said that travelers who had reservations made on or before March 14 could cancel and not be subject to cancellation fees, even if, in their rental agreement, they were in the penalty period. The policy has been extended several times, now to Oct. 31. (While most guests were happy with the resolution, many hosts were not and Airbnb later apologized to hosts for not consulting them).</p><p>  Airbnb said it aims to introduce a redesign of price displays this year. ''We're trying to partner with hosts to create clear standards and change the search line, so if someone has higher cleaning fees, that affects their placement'' in search results, Mr. Chesky said. ''We've heard from travelers that they want a simpler way for us to show more of the price up front.''</p><p>  Reckoning with racial bias</p><p>  Four years before George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, igniting this summer's protests for social justice, the emergence of the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack called attention to a spate of racist incidents that users said happened at rental homes. Some Black renters were reported by neighbors as thieves. Others were subject to abuse by racist hosts rejecting their bookings. Complaints by Muslim, transgender and other groups followed.</p><p>  Airbnb worked to purge discrimination from its platform by hiding guest's profile pictures until a booking is confirmed; hiring anti-discrimination specialists to audit the platform; and creating a reporting channel to identify listings not complying with its nondiscrimination policy. The company said it has removed 1.3 million offenders.</p><p>  This month, Airbnb plans to launch Project Lighthouse, a research initiative in the United States that aims to measure bias through perception based on names and photos, to determine where and when bias happens on the platform, from booking through reviews.</p><p>  According to the company, the study has been in the works for two years in partnership with the racial justice organization Color of Change, with input from several social justice nonprofits, including Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p><p>  ''It's really hard to change what you can't measure,'' Mr. Chesky said. ''Then hopefully we will use this data to continue to evolve our platform and reduce the bias.''</p><p>  Its tech focus -- on the platform rather than the in-person experience -- won't address incidents of in-person bias. Through its existing Open Doors policy, Airbnb offers to find a guest an alternative place to stay if they feel they have been discriminated against by a host.</p><p>  ''In a departure from its peers in Big Tech who pass off structural problems on the behavior of individual users, with Project Lighthouse, Airbnb is attempting to take responsibility for how tech platforms create the opportunity for harm at scale,'' wrote Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, senior campaigns director at Color Of Change, in an email.</p><p>  Experiences in the digital age</p><p>  Airbnb doesn't just rent lodgings. Through its Airbnb Experiences branch, it offers classes in mole making with an Indigenous cook in Mexico City, a music and cultural tour of Havana with a D.J. and walks among penguins with a conservationist in South Africa.</p><p>  During the pandemic, many of its Experiences went virtual. Now, via Zoom, armchair travelers can visit an animal rescue farm in Connecticut, follow a plague doctor through Prague and sit in on a songwriting session in Nashville.</p><p>  After Airbnb's layoffs, many wondered whether Airbnb Experiences, long rumored to be losing money, would be shelved, too. In January, it had 50,000 Experiences in 1,000 cities. During the pandemic, the division was shut down, and later transitioned, with a fraction of its offerings, online. Today, it has 700 virtual Experiences generating $2 million in bookings over the past five months. In-person Experiences have resumed in more than 70 countries with restrictions on group sizes, though the company declined to say how many Experiences are available in person and how much money they are making.</p><p>  ''I would be surprised if they drop it completely,'' Mr. Mody, of Boston University, said. ''They don't want to be just a home rental company. Travel is about experiencing the destination in its entirety and they want to play a role in that.''</p><p>  The company said it stands by Experiences, even waiving its take -- which is normally 20 percent -- for its Social Impact Experiences, which include playing with shelter cats in Osaka, Japan ($25) and learning beat-making with an organization devoted to teaching underserved youth ($75).</p><p>  ''Experiences was hit hard by social distancing,'' Mr. Chesky said, maintaining that the online transition has been successful. ''In a world where there's not a lot of things to do, we think there's a window for Airbnb Experiences,'' he said.</p><p>  Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

They said it also threatened to delete the groups. The issue has affected do-it-yourself mask makers in states like Pennsylvania, Illinois and California, they said.</p><p>  Facebook has long struggled to distinguish between innocuous and malicious content on its site. While the Silicon Valley giant has relied on automated systems to flag and remove posts that violate its terms of service, those systems can have trouble spotting nuance and can sometimes be overly aggressive or make mistakes in identifying what may need to be taken down.</p><p>  In recent weeks, Facebook has worked to clamp down on potentially harmful coronavirus content. It has created teams to deal with the issue and has banned certain types of posts specifically related to the virus.</p><p>  At the top of its list were ads for masks, hand sanitizer and others looking to profit from the sale of safety equipment. Facebook banned advertising for such equipment last month, and has taken down nearly all posts related to the sale of masks across its Craigslist-like section, called Marketplace.</p><p>  But as the company ramped up efforts to crack down on scammers and other miscreants, volunteer coordinators may have been caught in the crossfire.</p><p>  ''The automated systems we set up to prevent the sale of medical masks needed by health workers have inadvertently blocked some efforts to donate supplies,'' Facebook said in a statement. ''We apologize for this error and are working to update our systems to avoid mistakes like this going forward. We don't want to put obstacles in the way of people doing a good thing.''</p><p>  Those who were affected include Nicole Jochym, a student at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, N.J. She recently put out a call on Facebook for people to use household materials to make their own versions of the masks to donate to medical workers.</p><p>  Her volunteer organization, Sew Face Masks Philadelphia, has grown to thousands of supporters since it became active in early March. More than 3,500 people have subscribed to her group's Facebook page alone.</p><p>  ''Our platform has become even more of a useful tool for our community members to engage with each other'' said Ms. Jochym, 33.</p><p>  But over the past few days, Ms. Jochym said Facebook's systems flagged some of the posts from the community, marking them as breaking its guidelines against regulated goods and services.</p><p>  Those whose posts were flagged or taken down were given a warning, and eventually threatened with being unable to post or comment on the site if other posts were flagged.</p><p>  Melissa Knapp, a moderator for the Sew Face Masks for Quincy, IL Healthcare Workers Facebook group, said she has received numerous messages threatening to limit her posts. Moderators of similar groups also complained in private Facebook messages that they have received warnings.</p><p>  Muddled messaging from government agencies on whether people should be using face masks may have compounded the problem. Officials initially warned people not to buy personal protective gear like masks for fear that there would not be enough for health care workers. But last week, the Center for Disease Control advised people to start wearing masks in public.</p><p>  Moderators said they believed the mixed messaging led to confusion at some of the big tech platforms, including Facebook.</p><p>  ''We support Facebook in their efforts in removing unethical sales'' from their platform,'' Ms. Jochym said. ''But we are hoping that they can update their procedures to protect community organizations such as ours.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Kim Collins, co-founder of MommaArts Pregnancy Care Center, sewing masks in her home in South Orange, N.J.

That firm, along with its peers, has been at the heart of the financial crisis and other debacles, but the auditors have largely escaped scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the mask is torn off in an explosive new book, Bean Counters by investigative journalist Richard Brooks. He has set out in unsparing detail how Britain s largest audit firms have consistently turned a blind eye to scandals and wrongdoing, and not only got away with it, but also charged enormous fees.</p><p>An audit - essentially an independent check of the books and systems - is a vital safeguard for shareholders, as well as for employees, customers and society as a whole.</p><p>It is meant to give reassurance that the company in question is not about to go bust and that its accounts give a true and fair picture of its financial position.</p><p>All too often, however, it does nothing of the sort - and when the auditors fail, we all suffer. Taxpayers are forced to foot the bill for bank bailouts. Black holes bloom in company pension funds. Small shareholders lose their shirts. Employees lose their jobs. Corporate tax revenues that could have financed schools and hospitals go unpaid.</p><p>And all of these consequences could perhaps have been averted if only the auditors had sounded an alarm in time.</p><p>The behaviour of the Big Four auditors - Deloitte, PwC and EY alongside KPMG - has been obscured by the veneer of prudence, even boringness, that they cultivate. Yet every single murky episode of recent years - from the implosion of RBS to the antics of the Crystal Methodist Paul Flowers at the Co-operative Bank to corruption at Fifa - has erupted with no advance warning.</p><p>As Brooks points out, the top audit firms are riddled with conflicts of interest. Their huge fees act as an incentive for them to placate, rather than confront company bosses, and senior accountants themselves often go on to hold important roles in corporate Britain where they may stay loyal to their former colleagues.</p><p>The failings of auditors came under inspection in the financial crisis but nothing happened. They are in the spotlight again for their role in the downfall of outsourcing firm Carillion. MPs earlier this month criticised KPMG for being complicit in  recklessness, hubris and greed  at the company, which collapsed earlier this year under the weight of its debt. That affair has led to calls for draconian reforms to the audit firms. On past form, the bean-counters will walk away scot-free and continue to enrich themselves with impunity - unless they are finally called to account.</p><p>IN THE plush, self-congratulatory backdrop of Number Twenty, it seems preposterous to imagine that KPMG has been at the heart of a string of the worst corporate failures of recent times - but that is exactly what has happened.</p><p>At the bar, partners sip cocktails overlooked by four Warhol-style portraits. The pop art prints on the walls are not of celebrities, but of the founders, Messrs Klynveld, Peat, Marwick and Goerdeler, whose initials spell out the name of the firm.</p><p>One can only imagine what these frugal fellows would make of their firm nowadays. They might be amazed as today s partners lift a champagne glass to celebrate the billions that pour in every year from clients. They might also feel a sting of shame at the way KPMG s reputation has taken a hammering.</p><p>In the year to the end of September, it pulled in nearly \u00a32.2\u2030billion of revenues. The average UK partner took home nearly \u00a3520,000 - and for the top ones, it would have been much more. It is a similar story at the other three top firms. But in KPMG s case, it has a long and unhappy list of audits for firms that have gone to the wall. Not least of these was HBOS, the former Halifax Building Society, which had merged with Bank of Scotland before pursuing an aggressive lending policy that ended in its ruin. KPMG earned \u00a356\u2030million from auditing HBOS in the eight years before its downfall and a further \u00a345\u2030million in consultancy fees.</p><p>Astoundingly, the audit firm s boss in the UK at the time, John Griffith-Jones, went on to chair regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, one of the watchdogs charged with investigating the collapse of HBOS. Politicians who gave the green light to his appointment were either unaware of, or untroubled by, the glaring conflict of interest. KPMG also gave unblemished audit certificates to Bradford &amp; Bingley, a former building society that had overstretched itself in the buy-to-let market and which duly disappeared in the credit crisis.</p><p>Similarly, the Co-operative Bank, chaired at the time of its disgrace by Paul Flowers, was able to wave an immaculate audit report courtesy of KPMG shortly before its implosion.</p><p>Another former client was HSBC, which six years ago was found guilty of widespread money laundering for drug barons and rogue states. In yet another unremarked conflict of interest, the bank s former finance director turned chairman, Douglas Flint, was an old boy of KPMG. The list of its clients who marched to disaster clutching a clean audit certificate is a lengthy and shameful one. Carillion, which was audited by KPMG for the entire 19 years of the outsourcing firm s existence, is just the latest disgrace.</p><p>The accountants raked in \u00a329\u2030million of fees, before Carillion collapsed under a \u00a31.5\u2030billion debt pile earlier this year.</p><p>MPs investigating the disaster, which affected hospitals including an urgently needed new building in Liverpool, declared that:  KPMG should take its own share of responsibility for the consequences. </p><p>If past experience is a guide, it seems unlikely.</p><p>KPMG is not alone. All of the Big Four have handed spotless audit reports to companies that turned out to be riddled with losses and fraud, yet they continue, largely unpunished and entirely unrepentant.</p><p>IN JANUARY this year, a bespectacled young man emerged from a Luxembourg courtroom, swathed in smiles. He was Antoine Deltour, a whistleblower extraordinaire, whose revelations had shed an astonishing light on the activities of one of the world s leading accountancy firms, PwC.</p><p>The court had just vindicated his crusade by overturning a suspended prison sentence he had been given for leaking information to the media. He had discovered the orchestration of tax avoidance on a grand scale by PwC, the world s largest accountancy firm, in the Grand Duchy.</p><p>As a 29-year-old junior auditor in PwC s Luxembourg office in 2010</p><p>, Deltour had stumbled across hundreds of secret  advance tax agreements  between his firm s clients and the Luxembourg tax authorities. In essence these were documents showing how the tax authorities had agreed to complicated schemes cooked up by PwC that would save the firms in question billions in tax.</p><p>Sensationally, Deltour had found and copied more than 500  rulings  involving 350 companies. When he passed the information to a journalist in what became known as the  Luxleaks  scandal, Deltour lifted the lid on one of the biggest ever tax avoidance factories in recent years. Another former PwC employee, office support worker Raphael Halet told a Luxembourg court in 2016 how the accountancy firm would send applications for approval on a Wednesday afternoon around 1.30pm to the director of the corporate tax office. PwC would draft not only the applications but also the taxman s agreement letters, under the letterhead of the tax division. The director had only to sign off, and literally rubber stamp the agreements.</p><p>Tax avoidance isn t new. The bricked-up windows still to be seen in old London houses tell of the reluctance in the 18th Century to pay window-tax. But in recent years, it has morphed from a relatively amateurish game into a worldwide industry - and the pioneers were the accountants. In an age of online transactions and globalisation it is easy for big companies to structure their businesses so the most profitable parts could be placed where they were lightly taxed.</p><p>Companies such as Gap and Nike sold to customers around the world from tax-friendly locations such as the Netherlands. Drugs companies including GlaxoSmithKline held the rights to blockbuster pharmaceuticals in fiscally efficient locations. Now the big tech companies like Apple and Google save billions of dollars in taxes in much the same way - all with the advice of the Big Four accountancy firms.</p><p>ACCOUNTANCY failure can allow corruption to go unnoticed for years. The canker silently rots business from within, and only occasionally erupts into public view. When it does, however, it can be spectacular. One such case began to unfold at 6am on May 27, 2015. When the sun rose over a serene Lake Zurich, plain-clothed Swiss police officers marched into the five-star Hotel Baur du Lac. Once inside, they woke seven of the world s top ten football officials with arrest warrants.</p><p>Hours later, the then US Attorney General Loretta Lynch unveiled a 161-page indictment against these and other FIFA officials, with offences from bribery to racketeering to money laundering alleged to have taken place over 20 years.</p><p>How had the governing organisation of the biggest sport on earth got away with so much corruption for so long? A large part of the answer was that its auditors, KPMG, had allowed it to.</p><p>From the start, when KPMG took on the audit in 1999, there should have been red flags.</p><p>A year earlier, the then new president Sepp Blatter had repaid the Saudi football federation for their support in his election with a sum of 470,000 Swiss francs to an unidentified recipient, without authorisation from the relevant committee. No alarm was raised.</p><p>But that was small beer compared with a decade later, in 2009, when payments adding up to $10\u2030million were wired from FIFA accounts in Switzerland to Caribbean Football Union accounts at the Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.</p><p>The accounts were controlled by former Trinidadian football executive Jack Warner, who has since been banned from the game for life. This was part of a scheme to bribe Warner into voting for South Africa s successful bid to host the 2010 World Cup, according to the US Department of Justice.</p><p>Again, KPMG raised no alarms, despite well-known question marks over Warner s dealings. Nor did the audit firm speak out against a co-ordinated attempt by Blatter and two other former top officials in 2010 to enrich themselves through salary increases, World Cup bonuses and other incentives adding up to more than 79\u2030million Swiss francs over five years.</p><p>In October last year, Swiss audit regulators said  shortcomings  had been found in KPMG s work between 2008 and 2014 and one individual was reprimanded.</p><p>Bean Counters by Richard Brooks is published by Atlantic on June 7, priced \u00a318.99.

That firm, along with its peers, has been at the heart of the financial crisis and other debacles, but the auditors have largely escaped scrutiny.</p><p>Now the mask is torn off in an explosive new book, Bean Counters by investigative journalist Richard Brooks. He has set out in unsparing detail how Britain's largest audit firms have consistently turned a blind eye to scandals and wrongdoing, and not only got away with it, but also charged enormous fees.</p><p>An audit - essentially an independent check of the books and systems - is a vital safeguard for shareholders, as well as for employees, customers and society as a whole. It is meant to give reassurance that the company in question is not about to go bust and that its accounts give a true and fair picture of its financial position.</p><p>All too often, however, it does nothing of the sort - and when the auditors fail, we all suffer. Taxpayers are forced to foot the bill for bank bailouts. Black holes bloom in company pension funds. Small shareholders lose their shirts. Employees lose their jobs. Corporate tax revenues that could have financed schools and hospitals go unpaid.</p><p>And all of these consequences could perhaps have been averted if only the auditors had sounded an alarm in time.</p><p>The behaviour of the Big Four auditors - Deloitte, PwC and EY alongside KPMG - has been obscured by the veneer of prudence, even boringness, that they cultivate. Yet every single murky episode of recent years - from the implosion of RBS to the antics of the Crystal Methodist Paul Flowers at the Co-operative Bank to corruption at Fifa - has erupted with no advance warning.</p><p>As Brooks points out, the top audit firms are riddled with conflicts of interest. Their huge fees act as an incentive for them to placate, rather than confront company bosses, and senior accountants themselves often go on to hold important roles in corporate Britain where they may stay loyal to their former colleagues.</p><p>The failings of auditors came under inspection in the financial crisis but nothing happened. They are in the spotlight again for their role in the downfall of outsourcing firm Carillion. MPs earlier this month criticised KPMG for being complicit in 'recklessness, hubris and greed' at the company, which collapsed earlier this year under the weight of its debt. That affair has led to calls for draconian reforms to the audit firms. On past form, the bean-counters will walk away scot-free and continue to enrich themselves with impunity - unless they are finally called to account.</p><p>KPMG's audit shame</p><p>In the plush, self-congratulatory backdrop of Number Twenty, it seems preposterous to imagine that KPMG has been at the heart of a string of the worst corporate failures of recent times - but that is exactly what has happened.</p><p>At the bar, partners sip cocktails overlooked by four Warhol-style portraits. The pop art prints on the walls are not of celebrities, but of the founders, Messrs Klynveld, Peat, Marwick and Goerdeler, whose initials spell out the name of the firm.</p><p>One can only imagine what these frugal fellows would make of their firm nowadays. They might be amazed as today's partners lift a champagne glass to celebrate the billions that pour in every year from clients. They might also feel a sting of shame at the way KPMG's reputation has taken a hammering.</p><p>In the year to the end of September, it pulled in nearly \u00a32.2 billion of revenues. The average UK partner took home nearly \u00a3520,000 - and for the top ones, it would have been much more. It is a similar story at the other three top firms. But in KPMG's case, it has a long and unhappy list of audits for firms that have gone to the wall. Not least of these was HBOS, the former Halifax Building Society, which had merged with Bank of Scotland before pursuing an aggressive lending policy that ended in its ruin. KPMG earned \u00a356 million from auditing HBOS in the eight years before its downfall and a further \u00a345 million in consultancy fees.</p><p>Astoundingly, the audit firm's boss in the UK at the time, John Griffith-Jones, went on to chair regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, one of the watchdogs charged with investigating the collapse of HBOS. Politicians who gave the green light to his appointment were either unaware of, or untroubled by, the glaring conflict of interest. KPMG also gave unblemished audit certificates to Bradford &amp; Bingley, a former building society that had overstretched itself in the buy-to-let market and which duly disappeared in the credit crisis.</p><p>Similarly, the Co-operative Bank, chaired at the time of its disgrace by Paul Flowers, was able to wave an immaculate audit report courtesy of KPMG shortly before its implosion.</p><p>                     Corporate grandee who rose to the top despite scandals\u00a0                   </p><p>Most people have never heard of John Connolly, but the chequered CV of this 67-year-old accountant-turned-corporate grandee deserves to be better known. For it is an exemplar of how auditors - once humdrum number-crunchers - have turned into a highly paid and seemingly untouchable elite who have aided and abetted in every financial scandal of the past decade.</p><p>A former chieftain at Big Four auditor Deloitte, he is just one of the multi-millionaire partners who haunt the pages of Richard Brooks' shocking expos\u00e9. Like his peers at the top of the profession, he is feted as a respected business leader. This is despite the fact he presided for years over a firm that allowed some of Britain's most appalling corporate offenders to brandish a clean audit certificate and to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.</p><p>A case in point is RBS, which ran into trouble after the reign of Fred Goodwin, a protege of Connolly's who worked under him at a predecessor firm of Deloitte. When he became chief executive of the bank in 2001, Goodwin's first act, almost, was to award the bank's multi-million pound audit contract to Deloitte.</p><p>Deloitte's total earnings from the bank would add up to more than \u00a3200 million. Yet in all the time it audited RBS, right up until the collapse in 2008, it sounded no warnings about the build-up of toxic debt on the books.Remarkably, this was not the first time Connolly had been close to a disaster.</p><p>If the downfall of RBS was the definitive financial scandal of the first decade of the 21st Century then the collapse of Barlow Clowes in 1988 played the same role in the 1980s. Barlow Clowes imploded at a cost of \u00a3150 million to taxpayers who were forced to fund compensation to investors who lost their savings. Connolly's role was as the senior audit partner who signed off on reports. He was judged to have done so with a lack of professional 'efficiency, conduct and competence', for which he was later severely reprimanded.</p><p>Yet far from damaging his career, the Barlow Clowes episode caused barely a hiccup in his relentless rise to the top of Deloitte, where he became UK senior partner and chief executive. In 2008, his income hit \u00a35.7 million. Having sailed through Barlow Clowes and RBS with his career and reputation undimmed, Connolly retired as senior partner of Deloitte in June 2011. He went on to bag sought-after roles as chairman of security company G4S, where his latest pay was around \u00a3380,000, and engineering group Amec Foster Wheeler where he took home \u00a3318,000.</p><p>A spokesman for Connolly said at the time of the Barlow Clowes issue he and the firm completely rejected the criticism. 'He was not the engagement partner to Barlow Clowes. Hence it did not affect John's career progression.'</p><p>Another former client was HSBC, which six years ago was found guilty of widespread money laundering for drug barons and rogue states. In yet another unremarked conflict of interest, the bank's former finance director turned chairman, Douglas Flint, was an old boy of KPMG. The list of its clients who marched to disaster clutching a clean audit certificate is a lengthy and shameful one. Carillion, which was audited by KPMG for the entire 19 years of the outsourcing firm's existence, is just the latest disgrace.</p><p>The accountants raked in \u00a329 million of fees, before Carillion collapsed under a \u00a31.5 billion debt pile earlier this year.</p><p>MPs investigating the disaster, which affected hospitals including an urgently needed new building in Liverpool, declared that: 'KPMG should take its own share of responsibility for the consequences.'</p><p>If past experience is a guide, it seems unlikely. KPMG is not alone. All of the Big Four have handed spotless audit reports to companies that turned out to be riddled with losses and fraud, yet they continue, largely unpunished and entirely unrepentant.</p><p>Luxleaks: the tax avoidance factory\u00a0</p><p>In January this year, a bespectacled young man emerged from a Luxembourg courtroom, swathed in smiles. He was Antoine Deltour, a whistleblower extraordinaire, whose revelations had shed an astonishing light on the activities of one of the world's leading accountancy firms, PwC.</p><p>The court had just vindicated his crusade by overturning a suspended prison sentence he had been given for leaking information to the media. He had discovered the orchestration of tax avoidance on a grand scale by PwC, the world's largest accountancy firm, in the Grand Duchy.</p><p>As a 29-year-old junior auditor in PwC's Luxembourg office in 2010, Deltour had stumbled across hundreds of secret 'advance tax agreements' between his firm's clients and the Luxembourg tax authorities. In essence these were documents showing how the tax authorities had agreed to complicated schemes cooked up by PwC that would save the firms in question billions in tax.</p><p>Sensationally, Deltour had found and copied more than 500 'rulings' involving 350 companies. When he passed the information to a journalist in what became known as the 'Luxleaks' scandal, Deltour lifted the lid on one of the biggest ever tax avoidance factories in recent years.\u00a0</p><p>Another former PwC employee, office support worker Raphael Halet told a Luxembourg court in 2016 how the accountancy firm would send applications for approval on a Wednesday afternoon around 1.30pm to the director of the corporate tax office.\u00a0PwC would draft not only the applications but also the taxman's agreement letters, under the letterhead of the tax division. The director had only to sign off, and literally rubber stamp the agreements.</p><p>Tax avoidance isn't new. The bricked-up windows still to be seen in old London houses tell of the reluctance in the 18th Century to pay window-tax. But in recent years, it has morphed from a relatively amateurish game into a worldwide industry - and the pioneers were the accountants. In an age of online transactions and globalisation it is easy for big companies to structure their businesses so the most profitable parts could be placed where they were lightly taxed.</p><p>Companies such as Gap and Nike sold to customers around the world from tax-friendly locations such as the Netherlands. Drugs companies including GlaxoSmithKline held the rights to blockbuster pharmaceuticals in fiscally efficient locations. Now the big tech companies like Apple and Google save billions of dollars in taxes in much the same way - all with the advice of the Big Four accountancy firms.</p><p>Caught offside\u00a0</p><p>Accountancy failure can allow corruption to go unnoticed for years. The canker silently rots business from within, and only occasionally erupts into public view. When it does, however, it can be spectacular. One such case began to unfold at 6am on May 27, 2015. When the sun rose over a serene Lake Zurich, plain-clothed Swiss police officers marched into the five-star Hotel Baur du Lac. Once inside, they woke seven of the world's top ten football officials with arrest warrants.</p><p>Hours later, the then US Attorney General Loretta Lynch unveiled a 161-page indictment against these and other FIFA officials, with offences from bribery to racketeering to money laundering alleged to have taken place over 20 years.</p><p>How had the governing organisation of the biggest sport on earth got away with so much corruption for so long? A large part of the answer was that its auditors, KPMG, had allowed it to.</p><p>From the start, when KPMG took on the audit in 1999, there should have been red flags. A year earlier, the then new president Sepp Blatter had repaid the Saudi football federation for their support in his election with a sum of 470,000 Swiss francs to an unidentified recipient, without authorisation from the relevant committee. No alarm was raised.</p><p>But that was small beer compared with a decade later, in 2009, when payments adding up to $10 million were wired from FIFA accounts in Switzerland to Caribbean Football Union accounts at the Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.</p><p>The accounts were controlled by former Trinidadian football executive Jack Warner, who has since been banned from the game for life. This was part of a scheme to bribe Warner into voting for South Africa's successful bid to host the 2010 World Cup, according to the US Department of Justice.</p><p>Again, KPMG raised no alarms, despite well-known question marks over Warner's dealings. Nor did the audit firm speak out against a co-ordinated attempt by Blatter and two other former top officials in 2010 to enrich themselves through salary increases, World Cup bonuses and other incentives adding up to more than 79 million Swiss francs over five years.</p><p>In October last year, Swiss audit regulators said 'shortcomings' had been found in KPMG's work between 2008 and 2014 and one individual was reprimanded.</p><p>Bean Counters by Richard Brooks is published by Atlantic on June 7, priced \u00a318.99.

The AI-powered systems must be subject to \u201cmeaningful human review.\u201d   Under the law\u2019s definitions, so long as a trained human being has power to overturn the machines\u2019 decisions, governments can use facial recognition systems to deny people access to loans, housing, insurance, education, jobs, healthcare, food, water, or their civil rights. The law leaves private companies\u2019 use of facial recognition unregulated.   Washington\u2019s law was written by a Microsoft employee and passed with strong lobbying support from the Seattle-based software giant. And now, those three words are spawning copies: After state legislators introduced the bill in January 2020, lawmakers in California , Maryland , Idaho , and South Dakota took up similar bills. They have nearly identical language about human review\u2014again under lobbying pressure from Microsoft .   In the absence of federal regulation on facial recognition, state and local governments have begun to fill in the gap with a patchwork of their own laws. Tech companies, led by Microsoft, have dispatched lobbyists to state capitals across the country to support loose regulations on facial recognition instead of bans that would squash the development and sale of the technology.   \u201cThe fact that a lot of these bills look like each other and match what the tech companies are calling for is just evidence of their influence,\u201d said Jameson Spivack, a policy associate at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology. \u201cBy getting out ahead of calls for bans or moratoria or stricter regulations, it allows them to steer the conversation better.\u201d   Civil liberties watchdogs worry that looser regulations, which allow companies to keep their facial recognition businesses intact, will leave citizens with fewer protections. When Washington\u2019s bill passed in March, the local ACLU chapter pilloried the \u201cmeaningful human review\u201d clause, which it said is not a sufficient safeguard against the misuse of facial recognition.   \u201cPeople routinely succumb to automation bias, deferring to output from computer decision-support systems, rather than using their own judgment,\u201d ACLU Washington technology lead Jennifer Lee argued in a blog post . \u201c\u2018Meaningful human review\u2019 is a deeply flawed concept and should not be used to justify use of face surveillance technology to make critical decisions.\u201d   Thinking about human oversight is very important, but by itself it doesn\u2019t provide you any guarantees.   Academics who study AI ethics have been calling for human oversight of AI systems for years. But Maria De-Arteaga, an assistant professor at UT Austin who studies the role human reviewers play in AI decision-making systems , says the mere presence of a person isn\u2019t a panacea.   \u201cThinking about human oversight is very important, but by itself it doesn\u2019t provide you any guarantees,\u201d she said. Factors like how much time people have to review an algorithm\u2019s work and the type of training they get play a big role in how good they are at catching machines\u2019 mistakes, she explained.   The Washington law\u2014and the mirror bills in California, Maryland, Idaho, and South Dakota\u2014contain identical, imprecise language that leaves a lot up to interpretation. The bills simply say that human reviewers must \u201chave the authority to alter the decision under review\u201d and be trained periodically on how facial recognition systems work and how to interpret their decisions.   \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really change that much about how facial recognition is used, especially when the language is as vague as it is in this law,\u201d Spivack said. He added that the regulations would be more useful if they specified that human reviewers follow, for example, a set of guidelines based on the Facial Identification Scientific Working Group\u2019s standards for image comparison and training .   But De-Arteaga says the human review requirement falls short on a more fundamental level. \u201cAdding a human doesn\u2019t address the fact that facial images are an unjustified basis for decision making in a vast number of cases,\u201d she said.   The ACLU argues that the main problem with the Microsoft-backed bill is that, in exchange for weak restrictions, it enshrines in law the legality of using facial recognition for making critical decisions about people\u2019s lives: \u201cAlternative regulations supported by big tech companies and opposed by impacted communities do not provide adequate protections\u2014in fact, they threaten to legitimize the infrastructural expansion of powerful face surveillance technology.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43104550918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W0-0SW1-JCSC-J4S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Quartz</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 18, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjE4Nzc5N0NGQTVDNDhDMkJEQjFEQURGRjBGRURDRkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

It is filled with books laden with urgency about climate catastrophe and the collapse of liberal democracy. Now with a looming pandemic, newsworthy crises are the realm of responsible readers. But instead of partaking there, I find myself drawn to different shelves, filled with another flourishing, but quieter, genre of new releases. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm referring to a growing library of self-help guides for the self-care generation. Clothed in minimalist cover jackets, bathed in soft hues, these books promise calm and reprieve: \"Silence: In the Age of Noise,\" \"The Longing for Less\" and \"How to do Nothing.\" Titles that once might have disappeared in lifestyle bins are now prominently displayed among the week's bestsellers. The literature of silence is having its moment, and for this reader, it feels especially resonant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I began my journalism career as a public radio producer, and I recall a terrifying orientation lecture about the professional liability of \"dead air.\" Radio silence was to be avoided at all costs, and if a few seconds of blank sound sneaked onto the airwaves, emergency procedures would be initiated, and penalties could follow. Manipulating, layering and delivering noise became my medium.</p><p>More than a decade later, a little silence, any kind of silence, can seem like a blessing. With the rise of podcasting and on-demand audio, certainly there is no lack of things to listen to. Infinite conversations and chatty companions are available at any time in any place. Despite the ascent of my own medium, I've found myself overwhelmed and exhausted by this sonic boom.</p><p>I'm tempted to dismiss my growing obsession with books about silence as a frivolous longing for \"chicken soup for an angsty soul.\" But the rise of this family of books speaks to a real need - and void - in contemporary life. Silence is more than the absence of noise. It is the cumulative experience of personal space and a mind at rest, with room to think and contemplate. For a long time, I thought I was alone in my inability to be present. I confess to a smartphone addiction and an unhealthy volume of streaming, bingeing and reading restlessness. When I bought my first guide to silence, aptly titled \"Silence,\" by the Norwegian writer and explorer Erling Kagge, I was comforted to learn that I wasn't alone in my struggle. Kagge's book was a visual feast of hazy horizons and poetic sentences about the value of silence. \"Shutting out the world is not about turning your back on your surroundings,\" he writes, \"but rather the opposite: it is seeing the world a bit more clearly, staying a course and trying to love your life.\" </p><p>Two years after it was first published, \"Silence\" is in its eighth printing and has been translated into 37 languages. Meanwhile, similarly themed books have proliferated. New Yorker writer David Owen's \"Volume Control\" warns that loud noise in the modern world has become a deafening threat to our physical and emotional health, with the sound in city bars and restaurants turned up to toxic decibels by design.</p><p>The artist Jenny Odell's \"How to do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy\" appeared on literary influencer Barack Obama's recent list of favorite books. In her elegant tome on the dangers of Big Tech's exploitation of the \"attention economy,\" Odell writes that \"solitude, observation and simple conviviality should be recognized not only as ends in and of themselves, but inalienable rights belonging to anyone lucky enough to be alive.\"</p><p>Georgetown professor Cal Newport's \"Digital Minimalism\" provides a step-by-step guide to online withdrawal in pursuit of deeper work.

Kagge's book was a visual feast of hazy horizons and poetic sentences about the value of silence. \"Shutting out the world is not about turning your back on your surroundings,\" he writes, \"but rather the opposite: it is seeing the world a bit more clearly, staying a course and trying to love your life.\" </p><p>Two years after it was first published, \"Silence\" is in its eighth printing and has been translated into 37 languages. Meanwhile, similarly themed books have proliferated. New Yorker writer David Owen's \"Volume Control\" warns that loud noise in the modern world has become a deafening threat to our physical and emotional health, with the sound in city bars and restaurants turned up to toxic decibels by design.</p><p>The artist Jenny Odell's \"How to do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy\" appeared on literary influencer Barack Obama's recent list of favorite books. In her elegant tome on the dangers of Big Tech's exploitation of the \"attention economy,\" Odell writes that \"solitude, observation and simple conviviality should be recognized not only as ends in and of themselves, but inalienable rights belonging to anyone lucky enough to be alive.\"</p><p>Georgetown professor Cal Newport's \"Digital Minimalism\" provides a step-by-step guide to online withdrawal in pursuit of deeper work. And, in January, journalist Kyle Chayka published \"The Longing for Less: Living With Minimalism,\" a travelogue through the art history of minimalism movements, including an entire section devoted to silence.</p><p>What unites these books is the authors' alarm that the sheer volume of physical, digital and political \"noise\" is fraying our state of mind. Some authors offer practical solutions to restoring balance; others offer more poetic ruminations. Chayka traces a geographic path to quietude, writing about the ancient Japanese city of Kyoto, where soft footsteps through rock gardens and Buddhist temples offer a seductive vision of paradise.</p><p>But fetishizing silence as a destination runs the risk of turning noise cancellation into a mere commodity. Meditation rooms and sound baths are arriving in cities, and expensive silent retreats are already a pillar of the wellness industrial complex. If silence becomes a luxury good, is it a worthwhile aspiration as these books suggest?</p><p>The quietest place I've ever lived is Germany, where sound regulations, urban forests and the occasional act of public shushing creates a different sonic landscape. I recently returned to Berlin to work on a radio documentary about my search for silence. On my first day, I was surprised to discover a mirror image of the D.C. bookstore where I began this reading project. In a small neighborhood shop, Kagge's book on silence was prominently displayed in German and English. When I later interviewed Kagge about the international success of his book, he told me, \"What it says is that it's a global phenomenon, that people feel cheated by circumstances and that they really need silence in their lives.\" Kagge famously walked to the South Pole alone, and he said it was an unsettling experience. \"Man has always been scared of silence. And the reason, of course, is because in the silence, you meet yourself, while in the noise, you live through other people. Noise will always be the easiest option.\"</p><p>As with most self-help books, it is impossible to live up to the prescriptions for sonic reduction. Somewhere among the discipline of abrupt digital withdrawals, walks to the South Pole and the structural blame on booming cities is the unavoidable rhythm of daily life. Each of us has a different tolerance for noise and available time for silence. But in applying small lessons from each of these books, I've discovered the possibilities lurking in the radio silence I once feared.</p><p>In choosing the book form to explore noise, these authors are making an implicit argument for reading as the ultimate gift of silence. The reader who appears quiet to the outsider knows the symphonic river of ideas and conversations that flow between the pages of a great book.</p><p>Now armed with silence as an orientation rather than a sonic condition, I find myself experiencing books, films and conversations through a new filter. I'm now inspired to spend even more time with writers that make space to think and consider rather than rattle with the noise of certitude. Given their popularity, the self-help sections devoted to silence are destined to grow with even more beautiful books to purchase. I'm learning to resist the consumption temptation and quietly practice what I've already read, and now preached.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bookworld@washpost.com\">bookworld@washpost.com</email></p><p> Bilal Qureshi  is a culture writer and radio journalist whose work has appeared in The Washington Post, the New York Times and Newsweek and on NPR.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-b2877e58-5fee-11ea-9055-5fa12981bbbf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YF2-X741-DXXY-339C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1194\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 15, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

Schwarzman, who is Chairman, CEO and Co-founder of Blackstone, one of the world's leading investment firms. It will be part of the Philosophy Faculty and based in the Stephen A. Schwarzman Centre for the Humanities at Oxford University.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Institute aims to tackle major ethical challenges posed by AI, from face recognition to voter profiling, brain machine interfaces to weaponised drones, and the ongoing discourse about how AI will impact employment on a global scale. The Schwarzman Centre will house Oxford's Humanities disciplines together for the first time in the University's history, and the Institute will benefit from collaboration with these disciplines.</p><p>The team will initially comprise:</p><p>The Director, Professor John Tasioulas, who will join as Director from King's College London, where he is the inaugural Chair of Politics, Philosophy and Law and Director of the Yeoh Tiong Lay Centre for Politics, Philosophy and Law. He previously taught Moral and Legal Philosophy at Oxford for 12 years, has held visiting posts at Chicago, Harvard, and Melbourne, and has acted as a consultant on human rights for the World Bank.</p><p>An Associate Professor in Philosophy, Dr Carissa Veliz, who is currently Research Fellow at Oxford's Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and the Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities.</p><p>An Associate Professor in Philosophy, Dr Milo Phillips-Brown, who will join from MIT where he is a Distinguished Fellow in Ethics and Technology. He is also Senior Research Fellow in Digital Ethics and Governance at the Jain Family Institute</p><p>Two Postdoctoral Research Fellows, Dr Carina Prunkl and Dr Ted Lechterman, who will join as postdoctoral research fellows, from Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute and the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, respectively.</p><p>Two doctoral students, who will start their programme in the coming academic year.</p><p>Professor Tasioulas said: \"AI will continue to have transformative effects on many parts of life, from medicine to law to how we do democracy. I do not want AI ethics to be seen as a narrow specialism, but to become something that anyone seriously concerned with the major challenges confronting humanity has to address. AI ethics is not an optional extra or a luxury, it is absolutely necessary if AI is to advance human flourishing.</p><p>\"My aim is for the Institute to bring the highest standards of academic rigour to the discussion of AI ethics. The Institute is strongly embedded in philosophy while also drawing on other disciplines like literature, medicine, history, music, law, and computer science. This is a radical attempt to bridge the divide between science and humanities in this area and Oxford is uniquely placed to pull it off.</p><p>\"AI is here to stay, so we must raise the level of debate around AI ethics and feed into the wider democratic process among citizens and legislators. AI regulation and policy are ultimately matters for democratic decision-making, but the quality of the deliberative process is enhanced by the arguments and insights of experts working on questions of AI ethics\".</p><p>Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt, who chairs the Institute's Steering Group and led the original proposal said: \"I am thrilled to welcome, as Institute faculty, this formidable group of academics. Our vision is for an Institute capable of laying the foundations for AI ethics so as to help guide and inform our use of this extraordinary technology. This great team and their research will help ensure that the technology augments rather diminishes the human experience.\"</p><p>Professor Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, said: \"This is an important milestone for the University as this excellent leadership team will accelerate our efforts to unite humanists and scientists in addressing critical global challenges.\"</p><p>Professor Karen O'Brien, Head of Humanities at Oxford University, said: \"We are delighted to have appointed an inaugural Director of the Institute of the calibre of John Tasioulas. John is an outstanding moral and legal philosopher and we were very impressed with his vision for the development of the Institute and the field of AI ethics as a whole. He has valuable and relevant experience of building up a successful research centre at King's College London.</p><p>\"Almost overnight, the Institute for Ethics in AI has become a leading research centre in this important emerging field of AI ethics. With a core academic team of seven outstanding researchers, the Institute can produce new research and put on more events which bring together academic experts, leaders in technology and government, and the wider public.\"</p><p>Commenting on the appointment, Stephen A. Schwarzman added: \"AI has the potential to be a force for good, but also carries immense risk if it is not applied ethically and responsibly. Oxford is uniquely positioned to explore these considerations, much as it has helped address the most pressing ethical questions facing society over the past millennium. I look forward to seeing John and the Institute's contributions.\"</p><p>The Institute will apply AI ethics to challenges like the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, Professor Michael Parker of the Institute's Steering Group advised the UK government on the ethics underpinning the development of its contact tracing app. He also co-authored research on how technology can slow the virus' rate of transmission.</p><p>Professor Tasioulas said the pandemic has shown exactly why philosophy must play a key role in democratic decision-making: \"COVID-19 demonstrates that it is never going to be enough just to 'follow the science'. There are always value judgements that have to be made, about things like the distribution of risk across society and trade-offs between prosperity and health.\"</p><p>\"Science can tell us the consequences of our actions but it does not tell us which goals we should pursue or what sacrifices are justified to achieve them. In so far as we are going to have AI as part of the technological solution to societal challenges, we inevitably have to address the ethical questions too. AI ethics is a way to get clearer about the value judgements involved and to encourage a more rigorous and inclusive debate.\"</p><p>One of the first pieces of work to come out of the Institute will be a book by Dr Carissa Veliz, a new Associate Professor in Philosophy at the Institute, to be published by Transworld (Penguin) on 24 September. 'Privacy Is Power' will explore the importance of privacy for democracy and freedom.</p><p>Dr Veliz said: \"Our aim as an Institute is to produce extremely rigorous research that is completely independent from the pressures of Big Tech, and to contribute to making sure that AI is only built and implemented in ways that are in accord with the highest ethical standards.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123965618</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WV-C2N1-JCBF-S4BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1211\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I do not want AI ethics to be seen as a narrow specialism, but to become something that anyone seriously concerned with the major challenges confronting humanity has to address. AI ethics is not an optional extra or a luxury, it is absolutely necessary if AI is to advance human flourishing.</p><p>'My aim is for the Institute to bring the highest standards of academic rigour to the discussion of AI ethics. The Institute is strongly embedded in philosophy while also drawing on other disciplines like literature, medicine, history, music, law, and computer science. This is a radical attempt to bridge the divide between science and humanities in this area and Oxford is uniquely placed to pull it off.</p><p>'AI is here to stay, so we must raise the level of debate around AI ethics and feed into the wider democratic process among citizens and legislators. AI regulation and policy are ultimately matters for democratic decision-making, but the quality of the deliberative process is enhanced by the arguments and insights of experts working on questions of AI ethics.'</p><p>Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt, who chairs the Institute\u2019s Steering Group and led the original proposal, said: 'I am thrilled to welcome, as Institute faculty, this formidable group of academics. Our vision is for an Institute capable of laying the foundations for AI ethics so as to help guide and inform our use of this extraordinary technology. This great team and their research will help ensure that the technology augments rather diminishes the human experience.'</p><p>Professor Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, said: 'This is an important milestone for the University as this excellent leadership team will accelerate our efforts to unite humanists and scientists in addressing critical global challenges.'</p><p>Professor Karen O\u2019Brien, Head of Humanities at Oxford University, said: 'We are delighted to have appointed an inaugural Director of the Institute of the calibre of John Tasioulas. John is an outstanding moral and legal philosopher and we were very impressed with his vision for the development of the Institute and the field of AI ethics as a whole. He has valuable and relevant experience of building up a successful research centre at King\u2019s College London.</p><p>'Almost overnight, the Institute for Ethics in AI has become a leading research centre in this important emerging field of AI ethics. With a core academic team of seven outstanding researchers, the Institute can produce new research and put on more events which bring together academic experts, leaders in technology and government, and the wider public.'</p><p>Commenting on the appointment, Stephen A. Schwarzman added: 'AI has the potential to be a force for good, but also carries immense risk if it is not applied ethically and responsibly. Oxford is uniquely positioned to explore these considerations, much as it has helped address the most pressing ethical questions facing society over the past millennium. I look forward to seeing John and the Institute\u2019s contributions.'</p><p>The Institute will apply AI ethics to challenges like the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this year, Professor Michael Parker of the Institute\u2019s Steering Group advised the UK government on the ethics underpinning the development of its contact tracing app. He is a member of the government'sScientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE) andco-authored research on how technology can slow the virus\u2019 rate of transmission.</p><p>Professor Tasioulas said the pandemic has shown exactly why philosophy must play a key role in democratic decision-making: 'COVID-19 demonstrates that it is never going to be enough just to \u2018follow the science\u2019. There are always value judgements that have to be made, about things like the distribution of risk across society and trade-offs between prosperity and health.</p><p>'Science can tell us the consequences of our actions but it does not tell us which goals we should pursue or what sacrifices are justified to achieve them. In so far as we are going to have AI as part of the technological solution to societal challenges, we inevitably have to address the ethical questions too. AI ethics is a way to get clearer about the value judgements involved and to encourage a more rigorous and inclusive debate.'</p><p>One of the first pieces of work to come out of the Institute will be a book by Dr Carissa V\u00e9liz, a new Associate Professor in Philosophy at the Institute, to be published by Transworld (Penguin) on 24 September. \u2018Privacy Is Power\u2019 will explore the importance of privacy for democracy and freedom.</p><p>Dr V\u00e9liz said: 'Our aim as an Institute is to produce extremely rigorous research that is completely independent from the pressures of Big Tech, and to contribute to making sure that AI is only built and implemented in ways that are in accord with the highest ethical standards.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3750258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V8-SJN1-F0YC-N047-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1231\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 14, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The draft code allows commercial news businesses to bargain - individually or collectively - with Google and Facebook, in order to be paid for news the tech giants publish on their services. According to ACCC chair Rod Sims, the code aims to address the bargaining power imbalance between news publishers and major digital platforms, to bring about fair payment for news. As Frydenberg said:The ACCC has previously found Google and Facebook's failure to pay for news content is eating into the advertising revenues which fund journalism.</p><p><br/>Treasurer John Frydenberg made the announcement today (July 31) in Melbourne. Daniel Pockett/AAP But what's 'news'?The code is set out as exposure draft legislation and an explanatory memorandum .These set out the rules for who can bargain. To be eligible, a news business must have employed journalists, earn more than A$150,000 per year in revenue and be registered with the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ). And they must provide 'core news', defined as:How will bargains be struck?The code does not specify how much news businesses should be paid. Instead, it provides a negotiating process in which Google and Facebook must take part. The negotiating phase lasts three months and includes at least one day of mediation. If there is no agreement at the end, the process moves to compulsory arbitration (by an ACMA appointed panel) which both parties pay for. The arbitration panel will then select one of the final offers in a process sometimes called ' baseball determination '. Their decision will be binding.The range of Facebook services subject to arbitration include Facebook News Feed, Instagram and the Facebook News Tab. The Google services are Google Search, Google News and Google Discover. WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) and Youtube (owned by Google) are not included. But if both parties agree, arbitration under the draft code could include other relevant digital platform services, too.The ACCC will also be able to make submissions in the arbitration process (which the arbitrator can decide to consider or not). Under limited and unlikely circumstances, the arbitrator may adjust the more reasonable of the final two offers.Algorithmic change noticesThe draft code introduces a series of 'minimum standards' for digital platforms to meet in their dealings with news businesses. These include a requirement for Google and Facebook to give 28 days' notice of any algorithmic change that will affect either referral traffic to news or the ranking of news behind paywalls. This gives news businesses the opportunity to adapt their business models to ensure their content retains its prominence. More importantly, it means their negotiated revenue will not drop. It may also help in decisions about what content stays behind paywalls.The same notice period is required for substantial changes to the display and presentation of news and advertising directly associated with news.There will be an obligation on Google and Facebook to give businesses clear information about the nature and availability of user data collected through users' interactions with the news. This does not mean Google or Facebook must share the data itself \u2014 only that news businesses will be informed of what kind of data are being collected.<br/>On July 29, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was one of four big tech CEOs interrogated in a US antitrust hearing on big tech's market power and dominance. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took part, too. Sipa USA More moderation opportunitiesThere are also obligations on the tech giants to publish proposals which appropriately recognise the media business' original news on their platforms and to provide those businesses with flexible tools for user comment moderation.In addition, Google and Facebook must allow news businesses to prevent their news from being included on any individual platform service. For instance, they may choose for an article to appear on Google Search but not Google News.News businesses will be able to moderate comments more easily. This is important considering they can be sued for comments published on their posts via platforms such as Facebook. Read more: Media companies can now be held responsible for your dodgy comments on social media ABC and SBS lose outThe ABC and SBS only benefit from the minimum standards imposed on digital platforms under the code. They are excluded from the remuneration process. The government said this is because advertising revenue is not the principal source of funding for public broadcasters.Anti-discrimination provisions are expected to prevent Google and Facebook from prioritising publicly-funded news to take advantage of this. Not a windfall, but still good newsThe draft code won't result in a A$600 million payday for news businesses, as Nine's chair proposed in May. However, the negotiation and arbitration process does provide certainty of a positive commercial outcome for news providers relying on advertising. There will also be more work required for Google and Facebook to give notice of algorithmic changes, which are managed in the United States. This obligation will mean adjustments to both the tech giants' business models. Google has already taken steps down this path by successfully negotiating revenue sharing with some Australian news businesses. In effect, it has created a benchmark for its position in the new negotiation framework. Meanwhile, Facebook has argued 'news does not drive significant long-term commercial value' for it. However, it said it was committed to following 'sensible regulatory frameworks for digital news'. Read more: Facebook vs news: Australia wants to level the playing field, Facebook politely disagrees Penalties for breachA breach of the code by Facebook or Google could have a few potential outcomes . The first is an infringement notice which has a penalty of A$133,200 for each breach. If the ACCC takes one of the tech giants to court, the maximum penalty is the higher of A$10 million, 10% of the digital platform's turnover in Australia in the past 12 months, or three times the benefit obtained by the tech giant as a result of the breach (if this can be calculated).The ACCC has previously had success against franchisers for breaches of the mandatory Franchising Code. It will likely be just as vigilant in policing the news media bargaining code.The draft code is open for public comment until the end of August. The final version will likely be considered by parliament in September.<br/>MENAFN3107202001990000ID1100569117</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1100569117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-NSG1-F04Y-T19P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1119\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But the decisions by tech giants Facebook and Google - the two biggest websites on the planet - might have as much impact as any single regulation in restricting access to payday lenders.</p><p>Industry officials, speaking generally of advertising restrictions placed on payday lenders, called the policies \"discriminatory,\" adding that some consumers may need access to the short-term loans if they cannot get credit through a traditional bank.</p><p>\"Facebook and others are making a blanket assessment about the payday lending industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors,\" the Community Financial Services Association of America, a payday lending trade group, said in a statement. \"This is unfair towards those that are legal, licensed lenders.\"</p><p>Millions of low-income Americans use the short-term loans to get cash quickly while planning to repay once they get their next paycheck. But all too often, borrowers get caught in a vicious cycle in which fees quickly mount and annual interest rates can be in the triple digits.</p><p>In many cases, this debt drama plays out online - and starts with a search query.</p><p>\"You search the Internet when you need help - and as a result you may give search engines some really sensitive information about your finances,\" explained Alvaro Bedoya, executive director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy &amp; Technology. When those desperate searches return targeted ads for payday loans, lenders end up profiting from the weaknesses those people have shared, he said.</p><p>But once a borrower has committed to an online payday loan, they may end up facing unexpected financial risks. According to a recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau analysis, half of borrowers who took out online payday loans were later hit with an average of $185 worth of bank fees or penalties when a lender submitted automatic repayment requests they could not afford.</p><p>While the total amount of payday loans taken out each year has declined slightly in recent years, online payday lenders are making up a bigger share of the market. About 40 percent of the roughly $40 billion issued in payday loans in 2015 was taken out online, according to estimates from Jefferies, an investment bank.</p><p>Google's move could make it more difficult, though not impossible, for online payday lenders to find new customers, said Jefferies analyst John Hecht.</p><p>\"Certainly, when Google modifies or limits advertising or search results, it can have a definite impact on an industry right away,\" Hecht said. But consumers who want a payday loan would still be able to turn to other search engines, or they could visit a storefront, he added.</p><p>The CFPB is working on a proposed rule targeting the industry, which it expects to unveil later this spring. The agency is considering rules that would limit the number of times consumers could get a loan rollover, capping them at two or three total loans.</p><p>Google had previously taken some steps to limit payday-loan ads. The decision to ban them outright came in part after pressure from a coalition of civil liberties and consumer advocacy groups that reached out to the search giant about the issue late last year.</p><p>The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights was one of those groups. \"This new policy addresses many of the long-standing concerns shared by the entire civil rights community about predatory payday lending,\" Wade Henderson, the group's president and chief executive, said in a statement.</p><p>To enforce the policy, those seeking to market financial products through Google's sprawling advertising network will be required to disclose the length of the loan and the annual interest rate before they will be allowed to place ads. The same standards will apply to sites that serve as middlemen who connect distressed borrowers to those lenders.</p><p>That's important, because banning ads for payday loans themselves may not be enough, according to some advocates. \"If you type in a search term that indicates financial distress, most of the ads you'll see will be for websites that are not the payday lenders themselves, but marketing companies who collect leads then auction them off to the lenders,\" said Aaron Rieke, one of the authors of a report on online payday lending advertisements released by consulting firm Upturn last year.</p><p>Google, of course, has also profited from those ads. Although they probably make up a small fraction of the company's online advertising revenue - which was more than $18 billion in the first quarter of this year - banning them will mean that the company is leaving dollars on the table.</p><p>\"Google is taking a principled stance here,\" Georgetown Law's Bedoya said. \"Hopefully, it's one that will help set a new standard for search engines.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:andrea.peterson@washpost.com\">andrea.peterson@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jonnelle.marte@washpost.com\">jonnelle.marte@washpost.com</email></p><p>\u00ef\u2026\u0152 More at washingtonpost.com/news/ the-switch </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-109d3fcc-17a6-11e6-924d-838753295f9a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JRV-VSK1-DXXY-300J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1086\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 12, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>Loan Review Risk Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OURGMDU0NjdBMjRCNDc1MkE3ODQ1QjQ0MzZDRjlFMDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0YzM0JGNzQ2OEE2NDk3OUFCMzM3MUU4QTYxNTEwNTY</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Loans</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI5M0E4NDRFRTc0NDQ2N0JGODJGNkQyMUZBQjgyMDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDJDQjg1RTk0N0RFNEQ3MkJGRTk2OUZDMEZBN0QzOTA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Payday Lending</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjM2QzFBNjFCQjNBNDlBMTk3NTEzOEUzMjdFM0QxQUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI5M0E4NDRFRTc0NDQ2N0JGODJGNkQyMUZBQjgyMDg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Authorities &amp;

To this point, the search giant has prohibited ads for largely illicit activities such as selling guns, explosives and drugs, and limited those that are sexually explicit or graphic in nature, for example. Critics of payday lenders say they hope the move by Google and other tech companies might undercut a business that finds huge numbers of willing customers on the Internet.</p><p>The move also shows the willingness of big tech companies to weigh in on critical policy issues - and exert their power as the gateways for the Internet. Facebook also does not display ads for payday loans. But others, such as Yahoo, still do.</p><p>Consumers will still be able to find payday lenders via a Google search. But beginning on July 13, the ads that appear on the top and right side of a search results page will not show marketing from the payday lending industry.</p><p>\"We'll continue to review the effectiveness of this policy, but our hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products,\" David Graff, Google's global product policy director, said in a blog post about the change.</p><p>Washington regulators, as well as a handful of states, have been trying to limit the activities of payday lenders by capping the interest rates that they can charge consumers. But the decisions by tech giants Facebook and Google - the two biggest websites on the planet - might have as much impact as any single regulation in restricting access to payday lenders.</p><p>Industry officials, speaking generally of advertising restrictions placed on payday lenders, called the policies \"discriminatory,\" adding that some consumers may need access to the short-term loans if they cannot get credit through a traditional bank.</p><p>\"Facebook and others are making a blanket assessment about the payday lending industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors,\" the Community Financial Services Association of America, a payday lending trade group, said in a statement. \"This is unfair towards those that are legal, licensed lenders.\"</p><p>Millions of low-income Americans use the short-term loans to get cash quickly while planning to repay once they get their next paycheck. But all too often, borrowers get caught in a vicious cycle in which fees quickly mount and annual interest rates can be in the triple digits.</p><p>In many cases, this debt drama plays out online - and starts with a search query.</p><p>\"You search the Internet when you need help - and as a result you may give search engines some really sensitive information about your finances,\" explained Alvaro Bedoya, executive director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy &amp; Technology. When those desperate searches return targeted ads for payday loans, lenders end up profiting from the weaknesses those people have shared, he said.</p><p>But once a borrower has committed to an online payday loan, they may end up facing unexpected financial risks. According to a recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau analysis, half of borrowers who took out online payday loans were later hit with an average of $185 worth of bank fees or penalties when a lender submitted automatic repayment requests they could not afford.</p><p>While the total amount of payday loans taken out each year has declined slightly in recent years, online payday lenders are making up a bigger share of the market. About 40 percent of the roughly $40 billion issued in payday loans in 2015 was taken out online, according to estimates from Jefferies, an investment bank.</p><p>Google's move could make it more difficult, though not impossible, for online payday lenders to find new customers, said Jefferies analyst John Hecht.</p><p>\"Certainly, when Google modifies or limits advertising or search results, it can have a definite impact on an industry right away,\" Hecht said. But consumers who want a payday loan would still be able to turn to other search engines, or they could visit a storefront, he added.</p><p>The CFPB is working on a proposed rule targeting the industry, which it expects to unveil later this spring. The agency is considering rules that would limit the number of times consumers could get a loan rollover, capping them at two or three total loans.  </p><p>Google had previously taken some steps to limit payday-loan ads. The decision to ban them outright came in part after pressure from a coalition of civil liberties and consumer advocacy groups that reached out to the search giant about the issue late last year.</p><p>The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights was one of those groups. \"This new policy addresses many of the long-standing concerns shared by the entire civil rights community about predatory payday lending,\" Wade Henderson, the group's president and chief executive, said in a statement.  </p><p>To enforce the policy, those seeking to market financial products through Google's sprawling advertising network will be required to disclose the length of the loan and the annual interest rate before they will be allowed to place ads.

AFP/Getty Images   'Fortnite' creator Epic Games is geared up for a bona fide dust-up against Big Tech, and it is winning the support of other prominent app developers in the process.  Spotify Technology Inc.</p><p>SPOT, -0.92%[1] and Match Group Inc. MTCH, +1.15%[2] recently issued statements in support of Epic, which filed suit[3] against Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.08%[4] and Alphabet Inc.'s GOOG, -0.70%[5] GOOGL, -0.79%[6] Google late Thursday alleging monopolistic practices. The tech giants, which represent the world's two dominant smartphone operating systems, pulled 'Fortnite' from their app stores for violating their rules on in-app payments after Epic tried offering discounts on in-game currency for players who bypassed Apple and Google with their purchases. 'We fully support Epic Games' effortsto show how Apple uses its dominant position and unfair policies to hurt consumers, app developers and entrepreneurs,' a Match Group spokeswoman said in a Thursday statement. 'Regulators across the globe have expressed similar concerns and are examining' what some describe as 'Apple's arbitrary practices.' A Spotify spokesperson said that the company 'applaud[s] Epic Games' decision to take a stand against Apple and shed further light on Apple's abuse of its dominant position.' The streaming music giant argued in its Thursday statement that 'Apple's unfair practices have disadvantaged competitors and deprived consumers for far too long.'  Facebook Inc. joined in on the criticism as well, with an executive telling Bloomberg News[7] that Apple didn't waive its 30% fee or allow Facebook to use its own payments tool on a new feature that the social-media giant was rolling out to allow businesses to host virtual events. Alphabet also isn't waiving the fee but will allow Facebook to use its own payment processing tool, according to the Bloomberg piece, and Facebook isn't taking a revenue cut from this feature.  Microsoft Corp. weighed in even before the Epic saga after Apple determined that the company couldn't list its xCloud game streaming service in the App Store because Apple wouldn't be able to review all of the games made available through the service. Microsoft argued that Apple 'consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content,' according to a statement quoted by The Verge[8].  Both Apple and Google keep as much as 30% of all purchases of digital goods made in apps that were downloaded through their app stores, a practice that is garnered increasing pushback from developers and government officials. Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in Europe last year, arguing that the company's App Store payment policies made it difficult for other apps to effectively compete against Apple Music[9].  Regulators are looking into Apple's App Store practices, which were also a focus of a House of Representatives antitrust hearing last month. Lawmakers questioned Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook on the company's App Store 'take rates' and what would prevent the company from increasing its cut of App Store-related purchases down the line.  Read more: Antitrust questions bruise but don't break Big Tech CEOs in historic hearing[10] Apple said in a Thursday statement following 'Fortnite's' removal that its App Store guidelines are 'designed to keep the store safe for our users' and that the company 'will make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return 'Fortnite' to the App Store.' Match Group, which operates Tinder and other dating apps, could be a prime beneficiary of more developer-friendly app store practices, analysts have said[11]. In general, developers pay Apple a 30% cut of digital service revenue for the first year of a recurring subscription and 15% for all remaining years, but many dating app users aren't signing on to paid plans for multiple years, meaning Match may be paying the full 30% more often than some other developers.  Apple shares have gained 48% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.12%[12] has risen 18%.

The company didn't hire an in-house lobbyist until 1995, 20 years after its founding, when it faced an antitrust inquiry from the Justice Department. The lobbyist, Jack Krumholtz, was a one-man shop, often making calls on his car phone between meetings, giving him the name \"Jack in the Jeep.\"</p><p>The lobbying effort grew quickly, but it did not hold the pressures at bay. Microsoft was sued by the government and pummeled in public. In 2002, a federal judge approved a five-year consent decree with the Justice Department that was extended twice.</p><p>By 2009, with its antitrust fights behind it and President Barack Obama taking office, Microsoft revamped its approach. It enlisted Fred Humphries, who had worked for Richard Gephardt, the former House majority leader, to run its Washington operations.</p><p>He pushed to open a big policy office on K Street, more than doubling the space for the same number of employees. One night it might host a fund-raiser for Senator Ted Cruz; on another, a panel for a tech industry association.</p><p>But Microsoft's polite veneer was at times overshadowed by fights it picked with competitors, as with its aggressive campaign against Google led by the Democratic pollster Mark Penn. It dumped opposition research with journalists and lawmakers and ran alarmist ads on TV saying consumers were \"Scroogled\" by the search company.</p><p>Publicly, Microsoft looked petty. It also got few results. In 2013, regulators decided not to bring antitrust charges against Google after a high-profile investigation.</p><p>In 2014, Mr. Nadella took over the reins as Microsoft's chief executive. The son of an idealist civil servant in India's first generation after colonial rule, Mr. Nadella did not see government as something to be gamed and insisted on a more \"principled\" approach, Mr. Smith said.</p><p>Soon, the company's Washington office got word that it was time to make nice. Scroogled was done. Mr. Penn left the company a year later.</p><p>Instead, the company methodically identified policies to pursue and then slowly ground through the interconnected power of lobbyists, regulators and lawmakers to make them happen. In 2015, Mr. Smith, then the general counsel, was also named Microsoft's president, bolstering his role as the company's chief statesman.</p><p>In 2017, Microsoft chose to push expanding broadband access in rural areas as a signature issue. The feel-good policy has business implications, since better connectivity means more cloud computing. It came with another key benefit: It had bipartisan appeal.</p><p>\"One of the great things about the broadband issue is we do get to work with everybody,\" Mr. Smith said.</p><p>Microsoft proposed using wireless frequencies that exist in the \"white space\" on unused broadcast channels. Television stations balked, saying the change would force broadcasters off the air.</p><p>Microsoft was undaunted. While initially adversarial, in early 2018 its lobbyists met with TV stations' representatives at the National Association of Broadcasters' Dupont Circle headquarters, hoping to find some common ground. Mr. Smith took the company's argument to regulators. In December 2018, he visited multiple members of the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>Many executives arrive for their meetings at the agency at the last possible minute, hoping to avoid attention. Mr. Smith instead showed up early and spent time in a waiting area schmoozing agency staff, according to two people who remembered the visit. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the visit.</p><p>Microsoft and the broadcasters reached an accord on several key points in 2019, and the F.C.C. has sought comment on some of Microsoft's proposals, making it possible they could turn them into reality in the coming months.</p><p>\"Over all, in the end, I think we got to a productive process,\" said Patrick McFadden, deputy general counsel at the National Association of Broadcasters.</p><p>Despite its more subdued approach, the company still sometimes attacks competitors. Early in the race for a $10 billion Pentagon cloud computing contract, Microsoft joined a coalition including Oracle to oppose a technological approach widely seen as favoring Amazon. Microsoft later dropped out of the Oracle alliance, but the influence campaign helped slow the contracting process, a delay that gave Microsoft more time to improve its technology.

So Brad Smith, the tech giant\u2019s president, went to work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He called two dozen lawmakers, telling them that TikTok would be safe in Microsoft\u2019s hands. Within 48 hours, he had what he needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/technology/tiktoks-microsoft-deal-soap-opera-trump.html\">saw a tweet</url> by Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the president and one of the people Mr. Smith talked to, calling a Microsoft deal \u201cwin-win.\u201d Soon, Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, was on the phone with Mr. Trump, and got his blessing to proceed with acquisition talks.</p><p>It was another win for Microsoft\u2019s quietly effective Washington influence operation.</p><p>The software giant was once a cautionary tale of an arrogant tech company caught off-guard by government scrutiny. But under the leadership of Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith, it has built one of the most potent forces in the nation\u2019s capital, one that could give it an advantage over the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/technology/tiktoks-microsoft-deal-soap-opera-trump.html\">several potential bidders for TikTok</url> if the company continues to pursue a deal.</p><p>It secured a coveted Pentagon contract widely expected to be awarded to Amazon. It has largely avoided antitrust scrutiny by Congress and federal regulators even though it is valued at more than $1.7 trillion, more than Google and Facebook, which are under investigation. And while it has disagreed publicly with the Trump administration on several issues, like immigration, it is one of the few big tech companies Mr. Trump and other politicians do not regularly denigrate.</p><p>The company does so despite spending less on lobbying than many of its peers. Last year, Microsoft spent $10.3 million on federal lobbying, several million less than Amazon, Facebook or Google, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. It currently has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/technology/tiktoks-microsoft-deal-soap-opera-trump.html\">100 in-house and outside federal lobbyists</url> registered to work on its behalf.</p><p>People who have worked with Microsoft and those on the receiving end of its lobbying say it is particularly adept at employing a focused, long-game approach, building relationships with lawmakers and other Washington insiders over noncontroversial issues, like when Melania Trump visited Microsoft\u2019s headquarters to discuss her Be Best campaign against online bullying. Its relationship with Mr. Graham extends back many years, with Microsoft supporting his push to ban forced arbitration in sexual harassment claims, and Mr. Graham backing a law granting law enforcement access to data that Microsoft had championed.</p><p>It also relies on a staff of policy experts rather than well-known public figures, contrasting with the approach taken by some of its peers. Amazon\u2019s top policy executive is Jay Carney, a former White House press secretary, and Susan Molinari, a Republican former congresswoman from New York, ran Google\u2019s federal lobbying <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/technology/tiktoks-microsoft-deal-soap-opera-trump.html\">for years</url>.</p><p>\u201cThey learned their lesson,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, the director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive group that tracks tech\u2019s influence. \u201cI think they now see themselves as best served by having a permanent, discreet presence in the halls of power.\u201d</p><p>Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder, proudly eschewed Washington even as his company grew into a giant and he became the world\u2019s richest man. The company didn\u2019t hire an in-house lobbyist until 1995, 20 years after its founding, when it faced an antitrust inquiry from the Justice Department. The lobbyist, Jack Krumholtz, was a one-man shop, often making calls on his car phone between meetings, giving him the name \u201cJack in the Jeep.\u201d</p><p>The lobbying effort grew quickly, but it did not hold the pressures at bay. Microsoft was sued by the government and pummeled in public. In 2002, a federal judge approved a five-year consent decree with the Justice Department that was extended twice.</p><p>By 2009, with its antitrust fights behind it and President Barack Obama taking office, Microsoft revamped its approach. It enlisted Fred Humphries, who had worked for Richard Gephardt, the former House majority leader, to run its Washington operations.</p><p>He pushed to open a big policy office on K Street, more than doubling the space for the same number of employees. One night it might <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/technology/tiktoks-microsoft-deal-soap-opera-trump.html\">host</url> a fund-raiser for Senator Ted Cruz; on another, a panel for a tech industry association.</p><p>But Microsoft\u2019s polite veneer was at times overshadowed by fights it picked with competitors, as with its aggressive campaign against Google led by the Democratic pollster Mark Penn. It dumped opposition research with journalists and lawmakers and ran alarmist ads on TV saying consumers were \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/technology/tiktoks-microsoft-deal-soap-opera-trump.html\">Scroogled</url>\u201d by the search company.</p><p>Publicly, Microsoft looked petty. It also got few results. In 2013, regulators decided not to bring antitrust charges against Google after a high-profile investigation.</p><p>In 2014, Mr. Nadella took over the reins as Microsoft\u2019s chief executive. The son of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/technology/tiktoks-microsoft-deal-soap-opera-trump.html\">an idealist civil servant</url> in India\u2019s first generation after colonial rule, Mr. Nadella did not see government as something to be gamed and insisted on a more \u201cprincipled\u201d approach, Mr. Smith said.</p><p>Soon, the company\u2019s Washington office got word that it was time to make nice. Scroogled was done. Mr. Penn left the company a year later.</p><p>Instead, the company methodically identified policies to pursue and then slowly ground through the interconnected power of lobbyists, regulators and lawmakers to make them happen. In 2015, Mr. Smith, then the general counsel, was also named Microsoft\u2019s president, bolstering his role as the company\u2019s chief statesman.</p><p>In 2017, Microsoft chose to push expanding broadband access in rural areas as a signature issue. The feel-good policy has business implications, since better connectivity means more cloud computing. It came with another key benefit: It had bipartisan appeal.</p><p>\u201cOne of the great things about the broadband issue is we do get to work with everybody,\u201d Mr. Smith said.</p><p>Microsoft proposed using wireless frequencies that exist in the \u201cwhite space\u201d on unused broadcast channels. Television stations balked, saying the change would force broadcasters off the air.</p><p>Microsoft was undaunted. While initially adversarial, in early 2018 its lobbyists met with TV stations\u2019 representatives at the National Association of Broadcasters\u2019 Dupont Circle headquarters, hoping to find some common ground. Mr. Smith took the company\u2019s argument to regulators. In December 2018, he visited multiple members of the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>Many executives arrive for their meetings at the agency at the last possible minute, hoping to avoid attention. Mr. Smith instead showed up early and spent time in a waiting area schmoozing agency staff, according to two people who remembered the visit. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the visit.</p><p>Microsoft and the broadcasters reached an accord on several key points in 2019, and the F.C.C. has sought comment on some of Microsoft\u2019s proposals, making it possible they could turn them into reality in the coming months.</p><p>\u201cOver all, in the end, I think we got to a productive process,\u201d said Patrick McFadden, deputy general counsel at the National Association of Broadcasters.</p><p>Despite its more subdued approach, the company still sometimes attacks competitors. Early in the race for a $10 billion Pentagon cloud computing contract, Microsoft joined a coalition including Oracle to oppose a technological approach widely seen as favoring Amazon. Microsoft later dropped out of the Oracle alliance, but the influence campaign helped slow the contracting process, a delay that gave Microsoft more time to improve its technology. Microsoft eventually won the contract, though the work is paused as part of Amazon\u2019s lawsuit challenging the award.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to say that we\u2019re candidates for some kind of sainthood,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWe will stand up and take on battles.\u201d</p><p>In July, Mr. Smith met with members of the House antitrust committee ahead of testimony from the chief executives of Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. Mr. Smith said he had spent most of his time telling them about Microsoft\u2019s own experience facing antitrust scrutiny two decades earlier. But he concedes he spent \u201cprobably 10 percent of my time\u201d with the committee saying the problems Microsoft had in the \u201990s most closely resemble the way app stores today control how developers can reach customers, putting Apple in particular in its cross hairs.</p><p>In mid-August, Mr. Smith got tested for Covid-19 before flying by private jet to Washington for meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill, trying to explain how Microsoft could address the security concerns related to TikTok\u2019s data collection.</p><p>If the company\u2019s bid is successful, Microsoft will face issues, like misinformation, that it has long avoided thanks to its focus on enterprise rather than consumer products.</p><p>\u201cI think it will require the right kind of ambition,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cBut also an appreciation that if these problems were easy to solve, others already would have done so.\u201d</p><p>Karen Weise reported from Seattle, and David McCabe from Washington.</p><p>PHOTOS: A Microsoft sign over Times Square, above.

But it rejected a related measure that would have given financial aid to workers who lose their jobs due to the trade agreement. The end result effectively blocks not only the president's ability to speed trade agreements through Congress but also the trade agreement with Pacific nations that the Obama administration has been negotiating for years in secret with 12 other countries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Consumer Electronics Association, a trade group representing many companies in the tech industry, decried the House's actions, saying that the fast-track authority, which gives the president the ability to negotiate trade deals and submit them for a simple up-or-down vote in Congress, was important to U.S. companies that export goods and would promote economic growth.</p><p>\"We are disappointed by the House's failure to pass (the fast-track) legislation,\" Gary Shapiro, the <person><nameText>CEA's </nameText></person>CEO, said in a statement. \"We are hopeful the House will reconsider its 'cut off your nose to spite your face' rejection of (the financial assistance measure) and move quickly toward passage.\"</p><p>The House's votes on Friday creates an impasse between it and the Senate, which last month passed a version of the trade legislation that includes both the fast-track authority and the financial aid. In order for the fast-track legislation to go forward , the Senate will either have to pass a version of the fast-track bill without the financial aid attached, which it is unlikely to do, or the House will have to try again to pass the financial aid assistance.</p><p>Many Democratic representatives, facing opposition among their constituencies to the trade legislation, intentionally voted against the financial aid package   something they would normally support   in order to block the fast-track bill.</p><p>Tech companies including Apple, Cisco, eBay and Microsoft have been lobbying in favor of the fast-track legislation and pushing for the subsequent passage of the trade deal, dubbed the Trans-Pacific Partnership , or TPP. The trade agreement, parts of which have been leaked to the press , but which remains largely secret , would reportedly lower trade barriers between countries, but would also increase protections for intellectual property, including patented drugs and copyrighted movies.</p><p>The fast-track legislation has drawn opposition from Republicans who oppose giving such authority to President Obama and from Democrats who want to block the TPP. Opponents of the trade pact have criticized the president for negotiating the deal alongside representatives of some of the nation's biggest corporations while at the same time refusing to release the text of the agreement to the public at large. Many have charged that passed trade deals have been sold on the idea that the would result in thousands of new jobs only to cost jobs instead.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has helped to lead the charge against the TPP and the fast-track legislation, has warned that the trade agreement could be used to undermine regulation in the United States including rules put in place to limit the effects of another financial crisis . Meanwhile other critics, including some in the tech community , fear the intellectual property provisions in the agreement will harm journalists and whistleblowers by making it a crime to reveal trade secrets, and would undermine consumer rights.</p><p>Locally, Democratic representatives Zoe Lofgren and Mike Honda voted against both the fast-track and trade-assistance measures. Fellow Democrat Anna Eshoo voted against fast track, but for financial assistance.</p><p>File photo by Olivier Douliery/Abaca Press/MCT.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-28304870</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANJOSEMNG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G6T-RX21-JCB3-41R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"666\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 12, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Institutional Assistance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUM4Q0U0OUQyNUNFNDZBQUJGMUVEOEY3RDI2RUY1MjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njk4RUMyMDg4ODMwNDIwNUI1NEQwMDE0OUU3REYyOTM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"75\"><className>Trade Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001741</classCode><className>TRADE DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001758</classCode><className>TREATIES &amp;

That increased production came as companies took steps to protect workers, such as adding plastic partitions between work stations and staggering shifts, that are essential but could slow down the work. The safety measures and bonuses to incentivize workers have increased costs.</p><p> And while worker advocates stress that companies must be vigilant to avoid more coronavirus infections, those steps will likely mean higher prices at grocery stores. Even if plants became more efficient, there is a lag of several weeks between when wholesale prices drop and when consumers start to see the change.</p><p> Grocery stores, which absorbed some of the meat price increases this spring, also may not pass along all the price cuts as they try to restore their profit margins.</p><p> TECHNOLOGY</p><p> Firms decline to sell police facial recognition software</p><p>Microsoft has become the third big tech company this week to say it won\u2019t sell its facial recognition software to police, following similar moves by Amazon and IBM.</p><p>Microsoft's president and chief counsel, Brad Smith, announced the decision and called on Congress to regulate the technology during a Washington Post video event on Thursday.</p><p> The trio of tech giants is stepping back from law-enforcement use of systems that have faced criticism for incorrectly identifying people with darker skin.

The executives provided bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China. The four CEOs were testifying remotely to lawmakers, most of whom were sitting, in masks, inside the hearing room in Washington. Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage. Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products. \"We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label busin ess,\" Bezos said in a response to a question from U.S Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat.</p><p>\"But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\"</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>U.S. to bring troops home from Germany</p><p>WASHINGTON - Spurred on by President Donald Trump's demand to pull troops out of Germany, the U.S. will bring about 6,400 forces home and shift about 5,600 to other countries in Europe, U.S. defense leaders said Wednesday, detailing a Pentagon plan that will cost billions of dollars and take years to complete. The decision fulfills Trump's announced desire to withdraw troops from Germany, largely due to its failure to spend enough on defense. A number of forces will go to Italy, and a major move would shift U.S. European Command headquarters and Special Operations Command Europe from Stuttgart, Germany, to Belgium.</p><p>The future of the plan is uncertain, at best, since it relies on support and funding from Congress, and a number of members have voiced opposition. And it may not survive at all if Trump isn't re-elected.</p><p>Lawmakers have condemned the troop cuts as a gift to Russia fueled by Trump's spite at Germany. But Defense Secretary Mark Esper defended the plan Wednesday, saying that while the decision was \"accelerate d\" by Trump's orders, the moves also promote larger strategic goals to deter Russia, reassure European allies and shift forces further east into the Black Sea and Baltic regions. \"We're moving forces out of central Europe, Germany, where they've been since the Cold War,\" Esper said, adding that it will shift U.S. forces east, closer to Russia, \"where our newest allies are.\" Trump, however, reasserted his very narrow reason Wednesday, telling reporters, \"We're reducing the force because they're not paying their bills. It's very simple. They're delinquent.\"</p><p>He added that he might rethink the decision to pull troops out of Germany \"if they start paying their bills.\" Trump has repeatedly accused Germany of failing to pay bills, which is a misstatement of the issue. NATO nations have pledged to dedicate 2% of their gross domestic product to defense spending by 2024, and Germany is still short of that goal, at about 1.4%.</p><p>Esper said the military moves will cost in the \"single digit\" billions of dollars, although bringing troops home could reap some future deployment savings. Some smaller units could move within months, and the plan leaves about 24,000 troops in Germany. Twenty-two Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee sent a letter to Trump saying a reduced U.S. commitment to Europe's defense would encourage Russian aggression. And Sen. Mitt Romney, RUtah, on Wednesday called the plan a \"grave error,\" saying it's a slap in Germany's face that will do lasting harm to American interests. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, meanwhile, welcomed the U.S. move and said Washington has been consulting allies on the matter recently.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>Gaps in federal oversight add to virus woes at vets homes</p><p>WASHINGTON - Big gaps in federal oversight of long-term care facilities for aging veterans may have contributed to rampant coronavirus infections and more than 200 deaths at state-run homes, according to a congressional watchdog agency. The Government Accountability Office found the U.S.</p><p>Department of Veterans Affairs failed for years to require robust inspections at over 150 state-run veterans homes nationwide and to make sure all deficiencies were rectified, even as it regularly doled out federal dollars for the care. That could have made a bad situation worse in places like the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke, Massachusetts, one of 50 veterans homes nationwide where VA is the only federal agency monitoring it, according to GAO. A recent investigation conducted for the state of Massachusetts found the superintendent there was not qualified to run a long-term care facility, and that officials with a state agency were aware of his \"shortcomings,\" but failed to do enough about it. By law, VA is barred from making federal payments until facilities meet standards of quality care. \"VA needs to continue to strengthen its oversight,\" Sharon Silas, director of health care at GAO, told a House panel Wednesday. Her team is conducting a wider investigation of VA's oversight into the facilities in light of surging coronavirus deaths.</p><p>She said infection control methods such as washing hands and isolating residents - a problem at Holyoke - have been among the most prevalent but also overlooked safeguards at nursing homes. \"It is imperative that VA ensure the health and safety of these veterans,\" Silas said. At least 158 residents of the 278-bed Massachusetts facility, or 57%, have tested positive for COVID-19. At least 76 residents have died. Similar outbreaks have occurred in New Jersey, where more than 80 have died due to COVID-19, as well as Pennsylvania, more than 40, and elsewhere.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>Israeli artist takes aim at Netanyahu with life-size statue</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel - Residents of Tel Aviv woke up Wednesday to a jarring sight: a pop-up exhibit of a life-sized statue of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enjoying a lavish meal by himself at a sprawling table, in a sendup of Leonardo da Vinci's \"The Last Supp er.\" The installation, displayed in Tel Aviv's central Rabin Square, is the latest twist in a summer of demonstrations against Netanyahu. In recent weeks, thousands of people have taken to the streets, calling on Netanyahu to resign, angry over what they say is his bungled response to an economic crisis caused by the coronavirus and depicting him as a hedonist out of touch with common people.</p><p>Many critics accuse him of trampling over Israel's democratic traditions as he clings to power while on trial for corruption charges and pushes for emergency powers under the guise of battling the coronavirus crisis. In an interview earlier this week from his studio outside Tel Aviv, artist Itay Zalait said the installation, made of polymer materials and painted in lively colors, is meant to symbolize the \"last supper of the Israeli democracy.\" In a Facebook post, Netanyahu denounced the display, saying there was no place for incitement and death threats against him, \"i n cl u ding the disgraceful threat of crucifixion today in Tel Aviv.\" The 11yard long table is filled with platters of juicy fruit, wads of cash, empty bottles of liquor and a cigar - a jab at the expensive gifts Netanyahu is accused of improperly accepting from wealthy associates. Netanyahu, appearing pudgy and disheveled in a dark suit and red tie, is seen digging into a large cake - alone amid 12 empty chairs.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>Pence urges in-person school during visit to North Carolina</p><p>APEX, N.C. - Vice President Mike Pence vowed Wednesday that schools around the country will have the resources they need to reopen for in-person learning as he visited a classroom of masked fourth graders at a North Carolina private school. The visit comes as President Donald Trump and U.S.</p><p>Education Secretary Betsy DeVos have threatened to withhold federal funding from K-12 schools that don't allow all of their students to return to physical classrooms. Critics including Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden have slammed Trump over the threats and argue that his administration hasn't provided enough resources or guidance to schools. Accompanied by DeVos, Pence visited a Raleigh-area campus of Thales Academy as part of a push to encourage more schools to reopen with in-person instruction. \"We're all gonna make sure schools across America have the support to open up and stay open,\" Pence said. He added that he was there \"to help states be able to have the resources and the guidance they need to reopen schools safely.\" Seated in front of a whiteboard that said \"Welcome Vice President Pence,\" Pence and DeVos removed their masks while the vice president took several questions from students.</p><p>The teacher and most of her 11 students had on masks, and desks were placed several feet apart.</p><p>- Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>An installation depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a mock \"Last Supper\" by Israeli artist Itay Zalait, is placed at Rabin square in Tel Aviv, Israel, Wednesday.

PHOTO: Loic Venance/AFP via Getty Images</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings reports rolling in from the world's biggest technology companies are providing vindication for stock market bulls who've been bidding their shares up furiously for five weeks. Alphabet's shares rose more than 9 percent after the company posted strong first quarter results, with a slowdown in ad sales offset by a 13 percent spike in revenue. Microsoft, Tesla and Facebook reported earnings after Wednesday's close. Microsoft beat revenue and earnings estimates and saw shares advance 1 percent in after-hours trading. </p><p>Facebook shares jumped 8 percent after hours after reporting an 18 percent increase in earnings. Other earnings reports: Boeing reported a $1.7 billion loss in the first quarter and said it would slash its 150,000-member workforce by 10 percent. The global halt in air travel is compounding the plane-maker's steep losses tied to the 737 Max crisis, which alone has cost the company $5 billion, it reported Wednesday. Tesla eked out a small first-quarter net profit just as the coronavirus started to affect the electric car and solar panel maker. The company said it made $16 million from January through March, or 8 cents per share. Yum Brands said Wednesday that same-store sales across its brands had dropped 7 percent in the first quarter. The restaurant giant said sales at KFC shrank 8 percent, while Pizza Hut sales dropped 11 percent. But sales at Taco Bell - which has been offering drive-thru service throughout the pandemic - rose 1 percent. General Electric said Wednesday that overall revenue fell 8 percent to $20.5 billion in the first quarter of the year. The coronavirus pandemic especially impacted the aviation division, which saw a 13 percent decline. But the health care sector of the business, which doubled its production of ventilators and increased its manufacturing of other medical equipment used in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, saw revenue increase by 7 percent to $5.3 billion. CABLE New York AG touts discounts for sports New York's attorney general is asking the biggest cable and satellite television providers to give customers discounts or some other financial relief because their sports channels are devoid of live sports. Costs for sports networks like ESPN, FS1 and regional channels like the Yankees' YES Network make up about $20 of customers' monthly cable bills. Sports leagues have postponed or canceled games and events because of the coronavirus pandemic, and it's not clear when they can return. Jobs U.N. raises estimate of job losses to 305M The United Nations' main labor body is again raising its prediction of job losses due to the pandemic. It is estimating the equivalent of 305 million full-time jobs could be lost in the second quarter, up from a prior estimate for the equivalent of 195 million full-time job losses. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. is furloughing about 20 percent of its workforce through the end of July after the coronavirus pandemic prompted the cruise industry to stop sailing. The furloughs affect shoreside U.S. workers and some international offices, according to an emailed statement Wednesday. Like Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Norwegian stopped new sailings in mid-March amid growing concerns about the safety of cruising during the pandemic. Volvo Cars will lay off 1,300 white-collar employees in Sweden, with the carmaker saying it needs to step up its shift to new products and business models amid the coronavirus pandemic. Volvo reopened its factories in Sweden last week after an almost monthlong shutdown. Juul Labs Inc. is preparing to cut 25 percent to 40 percent of its workforce, according to a person familiar with the matter, in the latest round of layoffs at the e-cigarette company. The San Francisco-based company currently employs about 3,000 people after slashing about 650 jobs late last year. It could cut between 800 to 950 people in the latest round, the person said. Juul is downsizing amid scrutiny from regulators and shrinking sales. TripAdvisor Inc. is cutting a quarter of its workforce and closing offices in San Francisco and Boston in a bid to shrink costs as the coronavirus pandemic decimates travel. The Massachusetts-based company is eliminating 600 positions in the U.S. and 300 people in other offices around the world. Most remaining employees will be forced to take a 20 percent salary cut and be reduced to four-day work weeks for three months starting June 1. Lyft Inc. plans to lay off 17 percent of its employees, the company said in a regulatory filing. The company told staff about the cuts in an email on Wednesday. Five percent of workers will be furloughed, and remaining employees will take a pay cut. Executive pay will be reduced by up to 30 percent; pay for other workers will be reduced 10 percent. Uber Chief Technology Officer Thuan Pham is stepping down after seven years at the company. Uber Technologies Inc. has been hit hard as global transportation has ground to a virtual standstill. The company may also be mulling job cuts of as much as 20 percent, according to tech news site the Information. Uber, which is unprofitable, cut more than 1,100 jobs last year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN78238871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT2-H5H1-DYRV-4358-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The White House on Thursday yanked its own regulation to ease the financial bite of costly medications for those on Medicare by letting them receive rebates that drugmakers now pay to insurers and middlemen. A congressional agency's estimate that the plan would have cost taxpayers $177 billion over 10 years seemed to seal its fate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier a federal judge ruled that the administration lacked the legal authority to require drugmakers to disclose list prices in their TV ads. The ruling Monday blocked a highly visible change expected to have started this week.</p><p>Both price disclosure and the rebate idea were part of a strategy on drug costs that Trump announced at the White House amid much fanfare last year.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>Trump accuses big tech of bias against conservatives</p><p>WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Thursday that big tech companies must not be allowed to censor the voices of the American people on social media, even as he hailed conservative critics for using the platforms to get around the \"fake news filter.\"</p><p>Trump has weaponized social media to eviscerate opponents and promote himself. He convened Thursday's White House \"social media summit\" of like-minded critics of Big Tech, excluding representatives from the very platforms he exploits.</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>Lawyers seek detention at home for Jeffrey Epstein</p><p>NEW YORK - Financier Jeffrey Epstein's lawyers, seeking bail for their client, said Thursday that he had long lived with the fear that federal prosecutors might pursue sexual abuse charges against him again - and yet had never sought to flee the countr y.</p><p>Epstein , 66, was arrested Saturday night in New Jersey as he arrived from Paris and now faces sex trafficking charges alleging he abused dozens of underage girls in Florida and New York in the early 2000s.</p><p>His lawyers have argued that a non-prosecution agreement made more than a decade ago with federal prosecutors covers the same ground as the new charges.</p><p>He pleaded not guilty Monday, and a judge asked defense lawyers and prosecutors to submit their bail arguments prior to a hearing next week.</p><p>His lawyers recommended house arrest in Epstein's $77 million Manhattan mansion and electronic monitoring as they countered what they described as a \"drastic demand\" by prosecutors that he be detained until trial.</p><p>They said their client was willing to offer the Manhattan property as collateral while he lives there, along with his private jet, which would be grounded, as he fights the charges.</p><p>- Associated Press</p><p>Hospital fires 23 in case of excessive doses, deaths</p><p>COLUMBUS, Ohio - The Ohio hospital system where excessive painkiller doses were given to dozens of patients who died fired 23 nurses, pharmacists and managers Thursday and said it is changing leadership, a sign that professional fallout from the scandal has expanded far beyond the intensive care doctor accused of ordering the drugs.</p><p>The announcement by the Columbus-area Mount Carmel Health System comes five weeks after that doctor, William Husel, pleaded not guilty to murder charges in 25 of the deaths, marking one of the biggest cases of its kind against an American health care professional.</p><p>The newly fired employees include five physician, nursing and pharmacy management team members, President and CEO Ed Lamb said in a statement.</p><p>- Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-071219A006art1xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897D7163BBD40 NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-32N1-JBCN-44SM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Record-Journal<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In past campaigns - her two elections to be attorney general, her successful run for the Senate and her failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination - she relied on Silicon Valley's tech elite for donations. And her network of family, friends and former political aides has fanned throughout the tech world. </p><p>                      Those close industry ties have coincided with a largely hands-off approach to companies that have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. As California's attorney general, critics say, Harris did little to curb the power of tech giants as they gobbled up rivals and muscled into new industries. As a senator, consumer advocacy groups said, she has often moved in lock step with tech interests. </p><p>                      Now that she is the running mate to Joe Biden, tech industry critics worry that a Biden administration with Harris would mean a return to the cozy relationship that Silicon Valley enjoyed with the White House under President Barack Obama. </p><p>                      Although vice presidents rarely set policy, as a former state attorney general, Harris is expected to have a say in Biden's political appointments at the Justice Department, including officials who oversee antitrust enforcement. She could also have a significant influence on tech policy in a Biden administration, since Biden has largely focused on other issues. </p><p>                      \"This is good news\" for tech companies, said Hal Singer, an economist who specializes in antitrust and a managing director at Econ One, a consulting firm. \"They probably feel like they have one of their own and that at the margin this is going to help push back against any reform.\" </p><p>                      A spokeswoman for Harris declined to comment for this story. </p><p>                      Silicon Valley's Democratic power brokers have been enthusiastic backers of Harris. In her first statewide campaign, she raised 36 percent more money than her Republican opponent with the help of large donations from prominent tech investors such as billionaire John Doerr, who was an early investor in Google, and Ron Conway, a venture capitalist who is active in Democratic politics. </p><p>                      In her reelection bid, donations poured in from big players in tech, such as Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer; Jony Ive, Apple's former top design executive; and Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce. </p><p>                      She also hobnobbed with Silicon Valley heavyweights. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs and an influential philanthropist, hosted a fundraiser for Harris in the backyard of her Palo Alto home in 2013. That same year, Harris attended the lavish wedding of Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive. </p><p>                      In addition, her family, friends, and former staff members are part of the revolving door between government and the tech industry. </p><p>                      Lartease Tiffith left his position as a senior counsel in Harris' Senate office in late 2018 and became an in-house lobbyist for Amazon, focusing on privacy and security issues. Rebecca Prozan, who ran Harris' first campaign for district attorney in San Francisco, is a top government affairs official for Google in California. Tony West, Harris' brother-in-law and a former Justice Department official, is the chief legal officer for Uber. </p><p>                      \"There are familial connections and a level of mutual affection with Silicon Valley that goes above and beyond the fact that she is a San Francisco politician,\" said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a left-leaning watchdog group that has criticized Harris' ties to Big Tech and other corporate interests. </p><p>                      Harris rarely challenged the major tech companies after she became California's attorney general. </p><p>                      Jamie Court, president of the California-based Consumer Watchdog, said his group lobbied Harris in 2011 to support legislation that would force companies to stop monitoring the online activity of users if they clearly stated that they did not want to be tracked. She refused to sponsor the bill or support it, he said. </p><p>                      Two years later, Harris sponsored - and California enacted - a less stringent law, requiring companies to post in privacy policies whether they abide by do-not-track requests and what personally identifiable information they collect. </p><p>                      \"She presided over this era of great consolidation and power in the hands of these tech giants and she didn't do a thing,\" Court said. </p><p>                      But Harris' supporters said that when she did act, her familiarity with the technology industry helped her prod the companies into action. Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University, said she saw that firsthand when she worked with Harris in early 2015 to fight so-called revenge pornography - a term for posting explicit images or videos of a person without their permission. </p><p>                      Harris pressured the companies to act without threatening legal action by calling a round table with top executives and policy advocates. Twitter and Reddit started to ban such photos and videos, and then Google agreed to remove explicit pictures from search results if a victim had made a request to do so. </p><p>                      \"She was not afraid to take them on,\" said Citron, who thinks the companies were more attentive because she \"was not some gadfly.\" </p><p>                      On the campaign trail, Biden has been critical of major technology companies. In a December interview with the editorial board of the New York Times, he attacked Facebook as \"totally irresponsible\" for its handling of misinformation and said liability protection for social media companies from what users post to their sites should be revoked. </p><p>                      But a crackdown on Big Tech is not a public pillar of his agenda. Of the 46 policy papers listed on the campaign's website, none directly addresses his plan for the industry. And employees and allies of the major technology companies are prominent within the nearly 700-person committee advising the campaign on tech policy. </p><p>                      When progressives such as Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for a breakup of big tech companies during a debate in October, Harris took a more moderate stance. She called for action from the Justice Department. </p><p>                      \"We need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies,\" Harris said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN80811384</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60N5-71N1-DYRV-42NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1204\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Today, Amazon, now a retail giant, remains obsessed with this issue, building its own fleet of drones, buying trailers for trucks and signing up drivers for on-demand deliveries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And nowhere is the company's push to become a logistics and delivery powerhouse more evident than here in the nation's capital. Amazon has emerged as one of the tech industry's most outspoken players in Washington, spending millions on this effort and meeting regularly with lawmakers and regulators. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Amazon has pushed officials to allow new uses for commercial drones, to extend the maximum length of trucks, to improve roads and bridges and to prop up a delivery partner, the United States Postal Service.</p><p>  The efforts are mostly in the early stages, but Amazon already has detractors, particularly for its drone efforts. Some drone makers argue that Amazon is pushing too hard, too fast. And airline and pilots groups have said opening the skies to more commercial drones, which are remote-controlled flying machines, could create safety risks.</p><p>  ''Amazon is disrupting huge industries; retail was a start, then the enterprise market with its cloud platform and now transportation logistics,'' said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst at Robert W. Baird. ''This is <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos's </nameText></person>playbook, and achieving it by influencing legislation would be consistent with that plan.''</p><p>  The money Amazon spent on lobbying in 2015 nearly doubled, to $9.4 million, compared with the year before, which helped to pay a bigger lobbying staff and pay for a new office to house them. The tally, compiled from public records by the Center for Responsive Politics, includes only the spending that Amazon must legally disclose.</p><p>  Amazon's figure still lags those of some companies that made camp in Washington long ago, like Boeing, which spent about $21 million in 2015. And it trails the leading tech lobbyist, Alphabet, Google's parent, by several million. But Amazon's spending grew at a faster pace than any other big tech company's.</p><p>  When Paul Misener, Amazon's global head of policy, took over the company's Washington office 15 years ago, he had a staff of two focused on retail tax laws and other technology-related issues. Amazon now has more than 60 people listed as its lobbyists -- both employees and contractors -- double what it had just two years ago, according to the data from the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p>  The lineup includes people as prominent as Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader, who helps persuade members of Congress. Representatives for Amazon have met with lawmakers dozens of times in the last year. The efforts also reached NASA, the postal commission and the Department of Transportation, among others.</p><p>  Amazon and Mr. Bezos, its chief executive, have other interests in Washington, too. Amazon is now a major government contractor with a $600 million cloud computing partnership with the C.I.A. And Mr. Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post, which he bought in 2013, gives him a foothold in the political and media circles of Washington.</p><p>  Amazon declined requests to comment for this article. But on a recent earnings call, Amazon's chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, explained why Amazon wanted to move more aggressively into delivery.</p><p>  ''To properly serve our customers at peak, we've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners,'' Mr. Olsavsky said. ''That's not meant to replace them.''</p><p>  In addition, the company's shipping costs rose 19 percent, to $5 billion, in 2015. The millions of members of its Prime annual subscription service, Amazon's most frequent customers, have helped feed the surge. Those customers receive free shipping for many products.</p><p>  Some analysts expect Amazon eventually to take over its entire logistics chain -- in some cases, from factory to doorstep. Just this month, Amazon signed a deal to lease 20 Boeing cargo planes.</p><p>  A few analysts got excited when Amazon referred to itself as a ''transportation service provider'' in a recent regulatory filing. The company, they suggested, could even become a competitor to UPS and FedEx.</p><p>  Mr. Olsavsky insisted on the call that UPS and FedEx would continue to be important partners. FedEx's chief executive, Fred Smith, also played down the possibility of Amazon becoming a rival. In a call with analysts and investors last week, he criticized ''fantastical'' reports about Amazon's challenge to logistics companies.</p><p>  Satish Jindel, founder of the SJ Consulting Group, which advises transportation and logistics firms, said, ''If my package doesn't get delivered to my expectations, most people don't think of FedEx or UPS.'' He added, ''They think of the retailer, so Amazon is getting into drones and delivery to enhance the customer experience and have a bigger influence over the customer.''</p><p>  Already, the company's drone push in Washington has had some success. Amazon has worked with NASA, for example, to create an air traffic system that would establish lanes in the sky for drones.</p><p>  Amazon has also urged Congress to adopt rules that would allow the retailer to fly drones beyond a pilot's line of sight, a crucial hurdle to Amazon's goal of operating drones from its warehouses. This effort is expected to face an important test soon. This month, the Senate Transportation Committee drafted a bill that would ensure rules for delivery drones within two years.</p><p>  Airline and pilot groups have resisted many of Amazon's proposed changes.</p><p>  ''The chances of a collision will go way up when you have more unmanned aircraft up,'' said Chris Dancy, a spokesman for the Helicopter Association International, a trade group.</p><p>  Some drone makers said in interviews that Amazon's bold statements may be generating too much public angst, helping the safety advocates.</p><p>  Amazon is arguing for changes in many other areas, too. Already, Mr. Misener, the lead lobbyist, has called for an overhaul of an arcane system of international delivery rates that he says give foreign e-commerce rivals an unfair advantage to deliver to American homes.</p><p>  He also urged the approval of legislation that aims to improve roads, bridges and railways. The bill was passed by Congress and signed into law in December.</p><p>  ''The private sector cannot make all the necessary improvements'' in transportation, Mr. Misener said in July during a Senate hearing, a message that he has repeated to members of Congress.

Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even among so-called unicorns - private start-ups worth $1 billion or more - de facto monopolies are already the norm. As the technology writer Om Malik argued in The New Yorker recently, ''Most competition in Silicon Valley now heads toward there being one monopolistic winner.'' Airbnb dominates the apartment rental market, Snapchat is the big player in ephemeral messaging, and Spotify stands out as the major streaming music library. And when it comes to on-demand ride services, Uber, the most valuable private technology company in the world, is the clear leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But while market dominance is hard to break, that does not stop companies from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.</p><p>On Jan. 4, Lyft raised an additional $1 billion from investors including General Motors, increasing its total fund-raising to $2 billion. At the same time, it announced it was developing software for self-driving cars and teaming up with G.M. to put more Lyft drivers on the road. These moves are part of Lyft's bid to distinguish itself and avoid being muscled aside by the runaway market leader, an all-too-common experience for technology companies.</p><p>''We're gaining share in the United States,'' said John Zimmer, Lyft's president and co-founder. ''That's not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.''</p><p>Regardless of whether Lyft and Uber can both thrive, or if there is only one big winner in the booming ride-hailing industry, dominance in and of itself is not illegal. Problems arise only when a company ''unreasonably restrains competition'' or gains and holds power ''through improper conduct,'' according to the Federal Trade Commission's definition of monopolization.</p><p>Indeed, there is a line of thinking that celebrates monopolies. In a unanimous decision from 2004, the Supreme Court said the ability to create a monopoly was a powerful incentive that should be protected.</p><p>''The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. ''The opportunity to charge monopoly prices - at least for a short period - is what attracts 'business acumen' in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.''</p><p>In the book ''Zero to One,'' which he wrote with Blake Masters, the investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel offers tips on how to create monopolies, arguing that once achieved, they lead to more innovation.</p><p>''Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate,'' he writes. ''Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can't dream of.''</p><p>And regulators have not been cracking down on Silicon Valley. Given how large many big technology companies loom in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against tech giants.</p><p>''This is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,'' Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.</p><p>Unlike United States Steel or Standard Oil, two of corporate history's biggest brutes, today's tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects - that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.</p><p>Network effects helped Google, Facebook and Amazon run away from their competitors, and are helping Uber today. Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social network and Amazon wasn't the first to sell goods online. There are still many other sites for search, social and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to the market leaders.</p><p>Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.</p><p>''The underlying problem here is that antitrust regulators are only looking at consumer welfare,'' Mr. Reich said. ''They aren't looking at the long-term potential for total dominance of a network, the possibility of predatory behavior once a technology giant becomes entrenched, or political power.'' (European antitrust laws are more expansive than those in the United States, resulting in continuing actions against Google and other big tech companies.)</p><p>Along with network effects, another hallmark of today's tech monopolies is that perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving-cars division and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming-media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.</p><p>This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of start-ups and venture capital, it isn't easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.</p><p>Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, makes the case that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Mr. Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.</p><p>''Once one of these companies gets a monopoly, it's easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,'' Mr. Reback said. ''You would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.''</p><p>While monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.</p><p>''Sun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,'' said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. ''Then the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.''</p><p>And of course, billions of people browse the web without Google, use other social networking apps besides Facebook, and shop on websites besides Amazon. Though no upstarts have replaced them yet, none are immune to disruption.</p><p>As for Uber, if it's not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)</p><p>As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users. Like Uber, the company is private, and neither shares much information about performance. But Mr. Zimmer said the company was quickly increasing market share in the United States. He also sees the on-demand ride business as different from search or social media and more like telecommunications companies, where several big competitors can compete on service.</p><p>''Just like AT&amp;T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,'' he said, ''we get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there's no difference in behavior between services. That's when you compete on experience.''</p><p>Still, Lyft will be hard pressed to unseat Uber.</p><p>''The network effects hold competition at stiff arm's length,'' said Steve Cheney, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Estimote, a micro-location platform for mobile developers.</p><p>Or perhaps the ride-hailing market is big enough for both Uber and Lyft. Monopolies don't necessarily mean there is no competition whatsoever. While a company like Uber may take a huge lead in market share, others, like Lyft, may still have room to profit and even prosper. Even Google has not managed to squash every other search engine.</p><p>''Microsoft has a decent search business. A lot of Yahoo's profits still come from searches on Yahoo properties,'' said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which has investments in WhatsApp and Airbnb. ''It's more of a 'winner takes most' than a 'winner takes all' phenomenon.''</p><p>Should that be the case in the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft may become something truly competitive by Silicon Valley standards: a duopoly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-2093584</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HTX-GMB1-JC85-N4H1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 12, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26 billion last year. And Apple is Apple, the most valuable company in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In most local markets, it would be a surprise if any one of these companies were floundering. But in China, the real shock is that their troubles no longer surprise anyone. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Just in the past few weeks, Facebook had one of its most popular apps blocked by the Chinese government. LinkedIn, the globe-spanning social network of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, job recommendations and management essays, had its local boss step down amid tepid results in the country. And Apple announced a billion-dollar investment to comply with local law as it continued to watch Chinese demand for its iPhones fade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  This summer of challenge for the three companies offers a broad illustration of just how varied the obstacles have become for foreign companies in China. They also show in stark terms why this vast market has been frustratingly difficult for outsiders.</p><p>  Tempted by the world's largest smartphone market and an increasingly wealthy population deeply intrigued by new technologies, just about every American tech company from Amazon to Zynga has taken a shot at China. But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.</p><p>  ''In general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,'' said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. ''It's the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.''</p><p>  Over the years, internet companies like Twitter, Google and Snapchat have been blocked by censors. EBay was outmaneuvered by the local internet giant Alibaba. Groupon failed to stay afloat in the flood of copycats it inspired. Uber cut its losses after establishing a foothold and sold its local business to a Chinese rival.</p><p>  Even LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. ''The big internet companies just don't have much of a hope here,'' said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.</p><p>  American start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.</p><p>  There are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China's internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.</p><p>  For those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don't normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.</p><p>  ''It's basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,'' Mr. Tian said. ''The Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There's no rules.''</p><p>  More so than the others, Facebook's problem in China is simple: Neither its website nor its app is accessible in the country. Both were blocked in 2009, shortly after ethnic rioting in western China. In the autumn of 2014, the umbrella protests in Hong Kong prompted the block of Instagram, which Facebook owns.</p><p>  Around the same time Instagram went down, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China's internet regulator to Facebook's offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.</p><p>  For all his efforts, just last week the company's last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it's not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.</p><p>  At least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.</p><p>  While Apple's position in China is about as different from Facebook's as possible -- it has built a hugely valuable retail business -- it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.</p><p>  An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company's most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was ''very enthusiastic'' about opportunities in China.</p><p>  Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company's sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company's revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company's sales, making it Apple's most important market after the United States.</p><p>  In a new tack for Apple in China, just last week it created a new position, general manager for greater China, and appointed a longtime manager, Isabel Ge Mahe, to the position. Ms. Ge Mahe was born in China, speaks Mandarin and has deep engineering experience. The company is also in search of a greater China policy head after its former head, Jun Ge, recently resigned, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><p>  If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.</p><p>  In 2014 the company agreed to start censoring -- much as Google had done almost a decade before it eventually left China -- and formed a partnership with two influential Chinese venture capital investment funds to create a separate China operation. While the self-censorship drew complaints from users, other technology companies looking to get into China came to see LinkedIn's approach as a model.</p><p>  By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China's smartphone-dependent population.</p><p>  Three years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn's local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China's smaller cities.</p><p>  While in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.</p><p>  In June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.</p><p>  Holding LinkedIn back wasn't so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.</p><p>  A business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.</p><p>  Also, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.</p><p>  As a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook's newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.</p><p>  With the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.</p><p>  ''It may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they're a foreign company,'' said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. ''It's more that they're having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.'' Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ -- another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers -- to connect for business instead, he added.</p><p>  That cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China's website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.</p><p>  A spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.</p><p>  Selling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn's best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.</p><p>  Xu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.</p><p>  As LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success -- underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.</p><p>  Although it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China's international professional class.</p><p>  In his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China's total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.</p><p>  ''So they haven't achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,'' Mr. Natkin said.</p><p>  Still, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn's ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.</p><p>  Simply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.</p><p>  Ultimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn's original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. ''The root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,'' she said.</p><p>  ''In China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website -- a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,'' she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.</p><p>  ''This has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: The Jiaming Center in Beijing, where LinkedIn has its Chinese offices.

But we forget that technology adoption is a two-way process.</p><p><br/><br/>I find that whether in the BFSI sector, or in any business where technology is driving change, the basic features are adopted first and the full functionality of a technology is rarely explored. Take ATMs (Automated Teller Machines). A regular customer will say ATMs are for drawing cash. How many people really know how to use its other features such as fund transfers?<br/><br/>In a country such as India, where Internet penetration is growing, but on a low base, technology will continue to play a significant role. People are already getting used to technology-enabled banking at various levels and in varying degrees.<br/><br/>It is not a question of technology capability in most cases. All banks have core banking solutions, yet success in getting a truly unified view of the customer-on both static and dynamic transaction analytics-is reflected in varying degrees.<br/><br/>It is about how integrated the technology platform is, the data quality, and above all, the last mile-the branch staff's skills in interpreting and communicating.<br/><br/>So when we talk about technologies to increase productivity, the challenge is not just about capabilities, but about inclination. True IT-led productivity change will happen when people are willing to go the extra mile to absorb and pay, with time or cost, for more than the basic features. Manual intervention still dominates many processes, even when a transaction is initiated or closed electronically.<br/><br/>The other important point in technology adoption is the need to create a wider understanding to maintain a certain minimum control for safe operations.<br/><br/>Banks spend a lot of time and money educating customers about protocol around PINs (personal identification numbers) and passwords.<br/><br/>Regulators have been instrumental in creating safe operating platforms around electronic banking and trading. The challenge is to expand this enabler. As youngsters will be the main drivers of emerging trends in electronic banking and other forms of financial management on the move, formal training may be introduced in colleges to embed an understanding of security in such financial dealings. They need to understand the difference between using the Internet or mobile phones for a Facebook update and for a banking transaction.<br/><br/>Published by HT Syndication with permission from HT Columnists.
