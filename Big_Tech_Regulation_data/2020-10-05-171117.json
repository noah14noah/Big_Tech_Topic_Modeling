The analogy between the largest tech platforms and banking is misguided, contends AAF's Director of Technology and Innovation Policy Jennifer Huddleston, and these proposals would likely increase regulation on data without any meaningful consumer benefits. Rather than looking at the financial services sector as a model for regulating the tech industry, policymakers should instead consider how the lighter regulatory approach to technology could spur innovation in other industries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An excerpt:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are important lessons to learn from financial regulation for the current policy conversation around Big Tech--just not the lessons that advocates of finance-style regulations might want.

Continuing to focus on clearly defined harms and creating targeted reforms to address problems is the approach that is most likely to balance the benefits of innovation with protecting and redressing potential harm.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Why Technology Should Not Be Regulated Like Finance</p><p>Jennifer Huddleston</p><p>Executive Summary</p><p>* A number of critics of Big Tech have called for new regulations modeled on the regulatory regime in the financial services sector, specifically Glass-Steagall and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).</p><p>* The analogy between the largest technology platforms and banking ultimately does not work, undermining calls for a Glass-Steagall for tech, and a specialized CFPB-like agency for digital platforms or data protection would likely lead to a dramatic increase in regulations on data without much in the way of consumer benefits.</p><p>* Instead of seeking to regulate technology like finance, policymakers should look at ways to implement in other industries the kinds of regulatory approaches found in the technology sector.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>In hearings and interviews, policymakers on both the left and the right have suggested that the regulatory approach to \"Big Tech\" companies and the technology sector more generally needs reconsideration. As the argument goes, continuing the hands-off approach to regulating technology as it becomes more influential in consumers' lives risks allowing Big Tech to exploit users or harm smaller competitors. While often praising the spirit of innovation that allowed the United States to be a leader in the technology sector, advocates for much stronger regulation also believe that tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon have too much power and are stifling future innovation and competition to the detriment of consumers and smaller players. To solve these problems, some policymakers have called for additional regulation of these companies, and in particular, they have called for new regulations modeled on those in the financial sector.</p><p>But shifting away from the more hands-off approach could cause more harm than good. The parallels that these advocates for changes to current tech policy regulation draw between finance and technology fail upon closer inspection in crucial ways, and the impact of these regulations on the financial sector indicate they likely would not solve the problems identified in the technology sector. The current regulatory standards balance well the twin concerns of encouraging innovation and mitigating possible risks, and rather than dramatic reforms and increased regulatory interventions, policymakers should consider ways to improve these existing tools. Instead of imposing finance-inspired regulations on the technology sector, policymakers should consider how such a hands-off approach might encourage more innovation, improve competition, and benefit consumers in industries beyond technology.</p><p>Glass-Steagall for Technology</p><p>House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) recently called for a Glass-Steagall-style regulation for online platforms. Glass-Steagall was a set of regulations passed in the wake of the stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. The law created separation between retail banking and investment banking and was intended to minimize risky behaviors at banks by preventing banks from speculating in the stock markets with client or depositor funds. In a recent podcast, Chairman Cicilline argued, not for the first time, that a similar legislative intervention is needed to prevent tech giants from both creating a marketplace and participating in it as a seller. This sort of division would likely prevent Amazon from selling AmazonBasics batteries or Apple from providing its own map app if they allow Duracell or Mapquest to offer the same products via their platforms. As Chairman Cicilline previously argued, he believes such a separation is needed because this behavior \"creates sort of an inherent conflict,\" when \"you're both a platform and a manufacturer of goods.\" These platforms, the argument goes, have an unfair competitive advantage by having access to data on the success of products and as a result are crushing small businesses or potential competitive products when they create their own products. With a report stemming from the House Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee's investigation into online platforms and market power expected soon, such statements signal that the chairman may be considering further action to change current competition policy and create such separation.</p><p>But such a shift would set up barriers in the current market and focus on the impact of these platforms' behavior on competitors rather than consumers, and the easiest way to see this impact is by examining a closer analogy: brick-and-mortar retail. The result could actually harm consumers by raising prices and limiting service options for small business rather than improving competition and better protecting consumers.</p><p>Increasing marketplace competition was not the primary purpose of Glass-Steagall, but advocates for a \"Glass-Steagall\" for technology see it as a way to correct what they view as anti-competitive behaviors. Such a separation between platforms and sellers on that platform is less akin to not allowing a bank to be in both the retail and investment sector, but more akin to not allowing Walmart and CVS to decide to sell their own products or where to place such products on their shelves. But the practice of offering such house brands based off of popular products has occurred in brick and mortar retailers for quite some time, and in many cases these house brands make up a far larger portion of brick-and-mortar retailers' sales than the own-brand apps or products of the Big Tech companies, the Progressive Policy Institute's Alec Stapp notes. As the International Center for Law and Economics' Sam Bowman notes, \"regardless of the propriety of Glass-Steagall in the banking sector, there's no real analogy with tech platforms here at all.\"</p><p>In fact, the burdensome and confusing regulation limited competition in the banking sector by raising the barriers to new entrants and limiting the markets in which they could compete. Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999, as critics from both sides of the aisle argued that the extensive carveouts had illustrated the measure had outlived any usefulness and had rendered it \"dead\" long prior. Further, the law's protections to consumers is doubtful: While some have contended that such separation is a necessary consumer protection to prevent risky practices, the regulation would not have affected many questionable practices such as those criticized in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>Placing regulatory barriers between different elements of tech companies as Glass-Steagall did in the banking industry could end up costing consumers rather than protecting them. Consumers benefit from lower-cost generic offerings, and small businesses benefit from more opportunities to offer their services via online platforms. In both cases, tech giants face a diverse range of growing competition for both products and services, not only from brick-and-mortar retail but from more targeted platforms such as Etsy and Shopify as well. Not only is the success of Glass-Steagall in the financial sector questionable, but to apply a similar separation onto the technology sector would likely reduce consumer benefit and not provide further protection.</p><p>A CFPB for Data?</p><p>Not only have there been calls to mirror regulations from the financial sector in order to change competition policy, a recent paper has proposed creating a new specialized regulatory agency to protect consumers and regulate data. As with calls for a Glass-Steagall for tech, this proposal also finds its inspiration in the financial sector, and specifically in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. This paper by former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, Phil Verveer, and Gene Kimmelman suggests the creation of a Digital Platform Agency to regulate a number of aspects of current technology platforms to promote consumer protection. The authors recognize that antitrust is a limited tool that should not be used to address policy concerns beyond its intended competition purposes. The lessons of the CFPB show, however, that creating a new agency to focus on a perceived crisis or focus on a sole industry may create new problems and result in over-regulation that deters beneficial uses of data.</p><p>The authors argue that while consumers have benefited from technologies, the current behaviors of Big Tech do not benefit consumers and \"there are inadequate public policy tools available to protect consumers and promote competition.\" Other advocates for creating such an agency have also pointed to data privacy incidents such as the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal as a reason to establish such an agency and take a more interventionalist approach.</p><p>Creating a new agency is an approach to data regulation taken by European regulators. This approach has tended to create regulatory burdens that are greater for smaller players and also to raise the cost of doing business more generally. More specific regulation on these issues also presumes that consumers' prefer the tradeoffs of heightened privacy and limited data usage and does not allow consumers to select products that fit their preferences. For example, as the Center for Data Innovation's Eline Chivot and Daniel Castro point out, this more regulatory approach and the differences in interpretations among European data protection authorities could increase costs and deter certain applications of algorithms and artificial intelligence. The more aggressive regulatory posture that could come from a new agency may dissuade innovators from considering new data practices by signaling the need to seek regulatory approval and increasing the compliance costs associated with pursuing new ideas.</p><p>To be sure, American consumers are not without protection when harm does occur. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been an engaged enforcer when needed for consumer harms caused by digital platforms such as data breaches or unfair and deceptive practices. While there are reforms that could provide greater certainty for consumers, innovators, and regulators (as previously discussed), the current FTC approach of mostly responsive actions balances the tradeoffs involved in many data issues while still protecting consumers when harm occurs. A new agency would likely shift this approach.</p><p>There are broader reasons to be concerned about a new data protection agency and the impact it could have. First, such an agency may not actually be as narrowly focused as advocates believe and could have influence over any number of industries well beyond Big Tech. The use of data continues to expand in almost every industry, from agriculture to retail. Thus, an agency focused on data protection could reach into nearly every sector of the American economy.</p><p>Even if the agency were able to retain a truly narrow focus on online digital platforms, this too could yield problems not seen in the current responsive approach. As former FTC chief technologist Neil Chilson has written, a single focused agency is more likely to be subject to \"industry capture,\" resulting in regulations that favor incumbents and make it more difficult for new entrants into the field. Creating a new regulatory body might only further entrench existing big players rather than allow new innovators to emerge in existing flexibility.</p><p>Rather than expanding the regulatory state with a new agency, policymakers should look at ways to improve existing consumer-protection enforcement from the FTC. This could include narrowly tailored expansions of rulemaking authority that could provide greater certainty for consumers and innovators in conjunction with an overall federal data privacy framework. In any event, any proposal modeled on the structure of the CFPB would be an especially questionable choice given that the Supreme Court recently deemed its governance structure unconstitutional.</p><p>Applying Lessons from Technology Regulation for Heavily Regulated Sectors</p><p>There are important lessons to learn from financial regulation for the current policy conversation around Big Tech--just not the lessons that advocates of finance-style regulations might want. The lessons policymakers should learn from past financial regulation is that even well-intentioned regulation can have consequences and tradeoffs as well as fail to solve the underlying concerns.</p><p>Rather than seeing the financial sector as a model for how to regulate the tech industry, the tech industry is a model for how a more flexible regulatory approach might help close current gaps or create incentives for innovation. One way this approach is apparent in the financial sector is in \"sandboxes,\" which have created ways to test new potential regulatory solutions and facilitated conversations between regulators and innovators about the burdens that may make certain innovations difficult to launch. This experimental approach allows policymakers to see if the less interventionist approach found in the technology sector might be applicable in certain other areas as well, and it could even lead to outright deregulation if it shows that certain regulations are more harmful than beneficial.</p><p>Instead of moving toward a regulatory approach similar to the financial sector, policymakers should seek smaller and more focused changes to technology's regulatory regime. Continuing to focus on clearly defined harms and creating targeted reforms to address problems is the approach that is most likely to balance the benefits of innovation with protecting and redressing potential harm.</p><p>[Category: Political]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7252325 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7252325</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YR-CG31-JC11-12RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2564\"/><timeReceived>9:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Nikkei under pressure. The economy in Japan contracting more than 6 percent at the end of last year. The shanghai composite however managing to rebound from coronavirus fears.</p><p>And speaking of that. That virus showing no signs of letting up. This as a group of U.S. passengers trapped on cruise ship are back at home in quarantine.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has top stories we are watching this morning -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That is right -- Dagen.</p><p>We've been watching this news unfold overnight. Two charter flights carrying American cruise ship passengers from Japan, arriving at military bases overnight in California and Texas. This happened just earlier this morning. They will start their quarantine period at those bases.</p><p>340 U.S. citizens were transferred with 14 evacuees with confirmed illnesses.</p><p>Now the virus has now affected more than 26 countries. There are 15 cases in the United States right now a cross seven states. And again those new cases, overnight confirmed.</p><p>A natural disaster in the making in Mississippi. Hundreds of residents in the capital of Jackson are leaving town ahead of what could be historic flooding of the Pearl River. That river expected to rise to nearly 38 feet today with more rain in the forecast.</p><p>Well, one stubborn building in Dallas refused to come down. An 11-story tower is still standing. It's tilting but it's still standing after a scheduled implosion failed to bring it totally down. And this is prompting onlookers to dub it the \"leaning tower of Dallas\". There's the attempted destruction of the building on your screen.</p><p>Officials say the area around the building is fenced off on the remnants, posing no threat to anybody. Once the tower's finally brought down land will be used for a new development. We will keep you posted on this one.</p><p>And then there is this story that is sure to warm your heart. Every girl at a high school in central Texas received a flower on Valentine's Day. Thanks to a very smart 16-year-old boy.</p><p>Jayme Wooley (ph) purchased 170 flowers and then delivered them to each and every girl at Axtell High School located just outside of Waco. When he was asked why he did it, he said to his mom he wanted to make every girl in his high school feel special.</p><p>I am thinking another motive because he's a smart kid and really dating is just a numbers game, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. A woman or women raised that young man properly.</p><p>CASONE: Well, he's got a lot of friends, now -- that's for sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Flowers go a long way -- gentlemen.</p><p>Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Allegations against Michael Bloomberg. \"The Washington Post\" over the weekend releasing an article entitled this, \"Mike Bloomberg for years has battled women's allegations of profane, sexist comments\", detailing allegations of inappropriate comments toward women for literally decades at his company.</p><p>Joining the conversation now: Mitch Roschelle, Lee Carter, Rob Smith.</p><p>Lee -- I start with you. I'm sure you read the article. What did you make of it? And how much do things in the past matter to his present?</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: I think the problem is when people try to make themselves out to be one way and stuff comes out that contradicts it, it becomes more of a problem.</p><p>Like President Trump never claimed to be a bastion of goodness through all of this other things. He was always who he was. Bloomberg in many ways is trying to present himself as somebody who is the logical choice, the rational choice, the good choice, the right-down-the-middle.</p><p>And when all of these things come up I think it's more harmful for someone like him than it would be to somebody who did not try to run on being the, you know, epitome of goodness, so to speak.</p><p>ROB SMITH, SPOKESPERSON, TURNING POINT USA: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: And that is really what he is trying to do. And in some ways be above reproach. And I just -- you know, I think that these kinds of things need to be addressed when that's who you are.</p><p>SMITH: I completely agree. And you have to understand Bloomberg is running as a Democrat. So he's running in the left wing which is pretty identity politics obsessed right now.</p><p>And so you have the #metoo movement. You have people talking about, you know, how to get women's votes, things like that. This article is very damaging to him. And more damaging is that there is this movement right now with #metoo movement.</p><p>They want to release people from the confidential settlements that they have already signed or they've already released. They want these people to speak out. Bloomberg has stated that these people that were under confidential settlements are not going to be released from that confidentiality.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: I think what's really interesting, is that -- sort of to your point, Lee -- the entire strategy of some of the candidates is right now we're the opposite of that guy. That guy being Trump.</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So if you are accused of some of the same things that Trump has been accused of, that completely diminishes that I am the opposite argument.</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I really wonder though what is behind the story and whether or not some of the candidates that Bloomberg is running against has something to do with the story getting in there, as their way of sort of you know knocking him down a peg or two.</p><p>CARTER: It is a fair enough question. You know, why is this story coming out now.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And to Dagen's point earlier, why now, right?</p><p>CARTER: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it should come out.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: No question. We're not suggesting --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, a lot of this has been written about before. And I don't want to say it's common knowledge but people living in New York probably are more familiar with some of these allegations.</p><p>Again, it was a lawsuit by a woman against Bloomberg personally as well as his company alleging work place discrimination. She alleged that Bloomberg told her to kill it when he learned that she was pregnant. Bloomberg denied the allegation under oath, reached a confidential settlement with that saleswoman.</p><p>But \"The Washington Post\" interviewed a former Bloomberg employee who said he witnessed the conversation with that saleswoman. He had not previously spoken about that matter before but he said quote, \"Bloomberg's behavior toward the woman was outrageous. I understood why she took offense.\"</p><p>And then there's this compendium -- for lack of a better word -- of jokes that he -- lines that he used to use. He's addressed that over the years in varying ways. About oh, I think he at one point referred to his borsch (ph) belt jokes</p><p>But \"The Post\" called the Bloomberg campaign about the booklet and the campaign spokesman said, \"Mike simply did not say the things somebody wrote in this gag gift which has been circulating for 30 years and has been quoted in every previous election Mike has been in.\" But the spokesman back in 2001 said some of the things he might have said.</p><p>So there's been varying response to this. But the issue is if there is any truth to this image of Bloomberg as laid out in \"The Washington Post\" story is it going to show up on the campaign trail even in small pieces? That is what the concern should be for him, and the whole campaign.</p><p>CARTER: There is no question that it is going to be showing up over and over and over again. These kinds of things have a way of repeating themselves. This is going to be a big problem for him. His stop and frisk quotes are going to be a big problem for him.</p><p>He's got a lot of issues. He's got Bernie Sanders going out there saying he is buying the election. He is going to have a lot of issues to contend with.</p><p>And this is a man who is running on a moral high ground. And when you do that, if you don't acknowledge the problems that people have with -- that - - his spokesman's comment there is very dismissive. He didn't even acknowledge why people might be so upset. He just dismissed it off hand said that is not what happened.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: But people need -- when you are in that kind of -- you have a responsibility to say we get why people are so outraged.</p><p>SMITH: And you're getting to the point -- he is going to be apologizing and doing mea culpas -- that's going to be the first thing that a lot of Americans see of him outside of these advertisements, he's going to be apologizing, mea culpa, it's not good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve Bannon was asked -- Maria asked Steve Bannon about some of this yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\". Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This article is bad for Michael Bloomberg. Are you sure this whole trial balloon of Hillary Clinton is just not to distract from this article?</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISERO: It's toing to test the core principles of the Democratic Party of whether they're going to have an oligarch come in and buy it. They're supposed to be about the #metoo movement and times up movement.</p><p>And here is what you have. Given President Trump's kind of off hand remarks, the locker room talk of President Trump would say -- (INAUDIBLE) went nuts. The problem with these Bloombergs (ph), it's premeditated and it's cruel. What he said to these women, it's over years and years and years. This is not off hand comments.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Reaction? Anybody?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I guess I have a question for Lee which is if you were advising the Bloomberg campaign what would you tell them to do right now?</p><p>CARTER: Look. I mean -- I actually would be telling them to pick somebody like Hillary Clinton. I would be telling them to pick a woman. I would be - - I think the very, very important thing that they need to be preparing for is the moment where he has to become a human candidate rather than the advertising candidate.</p><p>Because right now, all we've seen is advertisements. We don't know what he's going to be like when he's on the stage. We don't really know what he's going to be like when he's on the stump.</p><p>He needs to have somebody who's going to represent -- a female, a softer side of him which is not going to necessarily be Hillary Clinton but he certainly is going to need someone who's going to help him navigate politics in Washington, D.C. because he doesn't have that experience.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's what I have been saying all along. You can throw hundreds of millions of dollars at this online dating profile, using the presidential filter. But eventually you have to go on dates with the American people.</p><p>CARTER: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And they have got to see you in person. It is the same thing.</p><p>These -- so his behavior in the past -- the -- he ran, he turned a deficit into a surplus here in New York City and tried to reform the school system here. But he is not -- and then brought crime down even more than it had fallen but he's not running on those issues. He's disavowed stop and frisk among other things. So what are you running on other than, you know, gun safety, or taking guns away from people, anti-Second Amendment, what else?</p><p>Health care maybe? But, again he believes in not just taxing the rich, he believes in taxing every day people to try and change their behavior. That is what the soda tax was all about.</p><p>CARTER: That is right. And I think --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or not -- excuse me -- it wasn't a soda tax it was ban on large- size sodas that he pushed -- tried to push through.</p><p>CARTER: That is right.</p><p>And I think that the American people when they start to get to know him more, there's going to be a lot of things that's going to be widely unpopular I think in most of America. And then they're going to get to the lead areas. They're going to get to Boston, they're going to get to New York City, they're going to get to California and Chicago, even to a certain extent. You're going to find that his policies and his way of thinking is going to be something that's really resonant.</p><p>And I think a lot of people are going to be blinded in the media to what the truth is and what people really see him as.</p><p>SMITH: And I think with a lot of this stuff, he just strikes me as somebody who really doesn't like people when you listen to what he said to this -- this lady, Garrison, you know. He asked her -- why didn't they ask you to be in the picture, I guess they saw your face.</p><p>Like, who says that to somebody? You know. And when he has to get out there on a campaign trail and actually has to interact with voters, we're going to see more of these gaffes. If you thought Joe Biden had a lot of gaffes, you're going to see nothing yet when you see Bloomberg.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I said as a joke several weeks ago that before entering the race he should go and do a 30-day jerk cleanse. I'll leave it at that. It was a joke.</p><p>We've got a lot to talk about this morning. Coming up this hour the fight for 15 -- Democratic hopeful, Mike Bloomberg -- so again, we are talking a lot about this guy and he hasn't won the nomination yet, the latest to push the effort to raise minimum wage with an ambitious new labor plan.</p><p>And pedal to the metal, today may be the best day to snag a discount on a car at a dealership. Should you buy or lease?</p><p>And too many fish in the sea -- the fast food chicken wars might be simmering down but Arby's is frying up a new fight over fish. You don't want to miss it.</p><p>Coming up Democrats in disarray with less than a week to go until the Nevada caucus. Democrats are finding common ground by uniting against two candidates.</p><p>And restart your engines -- NASCAR postponing the Daytona 500 due to rain yesterday. But President Trump still revving up that crowd. We have the latest.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Infighting among Democrats. As Senator Bernie Sanders rises in the polls, a growing number of Democratic lawmakers, strategists and state leaders are said to be in agreement that he's a risky nominee in a matchup against President Trump.</p><p>But the party can't seem to find a moderate to put forward and a complicated math problem is emerging as the party tries to figure out what might happen if Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar end up -- well, on the sidelines.</p><p>Joining me now \"Washington Examiner\" chief political correspondent, Fox News contributor Byron York.</p><p>Byron -- I warned the Democrats -- the more that you try to push Bernie Sanders aside, dismiss him, the more energized his base his fans, his followers and people voting for him.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That is what is happening.</p><p>First of all, we should remember, that Bernie Sanders is the popular vote leader in this race. He got more votes than anybody else in Iowa and more votes than anybody else in New Hampshire.</p><p>Yes, according to the complicated formula used for delegate allocation in Iowa, Buttigieg got a tiny bit more but I think for most people, there is - - Bernie Sanders' standing very simple. He's got more votes than anybody else.</p><p>And the race is extraordinarily unsettled right now, you know. We're about to go on to Nevada and we have a no idea that is going on.</p><p>Nevada is notoriously hard to poll and it has been -- if you look at the RealClearPolitics average of polls, there's been exactly one poll this month in Nevada. So we have absolutely no idea what is going on.</p><p>And there appears to be a likelihood for Iowa-style chaos, just in the administration of the caucus out there, amazingly enough, Shadow, the same company that did -- that was responsible for some of the screw-ups in Iowa is active in this out in Nevada.</p><p>So then you go to South Carolina where Joe Biden is now pretending that he is not dead. I mean most people counted him out after New Hampshire but he is there. And he still has a substantial following. But, again, we've had one poll in February.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>YORK: So we really don't know where things stand.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to move on to this because we haven't talked about it yet, but Mike Bloomberg is under fire for some comments he made about farmers backing in 2016.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can teach anybody, even people in this room so no offense intended, to be a farmer. It is a process that you dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. Then you have -- you could learn that.</p><p>Then you have 300 years in the industrial society. You put the piece of metal in the (INAUDIBLE) you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs.</p><p>The information economy is fundamentally different because it is built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze. And that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set. You have to have a lot more gray matter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Byron.</p><p>YORK: Well, you know, that popped up on the Internet last night and within milliseconds the Republicans in Wisconsin, a big agricultural state, were getting that out on social media making sure everybody saw that.</p><p>If you look at some of the -- some of the critical states-- Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, I mean Pennsylvania -- they've all got significant agricultural businesses there.</p><p>And this was just extraordinary for Bloomberg to say, well you know, you got to be pretty dumb to be a farmer and by the way, he seems to have no knowledge at all of complexities of modern agriculture. But there it is.</p><p>And is one of thousands of videos and quotes from Bloomberg that we're going to be seeing not just involving this subject but involving all other aspects of society.</p><p>You were talking about this \"Washington Post\" poll, excuse me, this article where he said, allegedly said lots of very, very insensitive things in front of women at his company. You'll see a lot more of that too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Byron -- great to see you. I will keep rolling my eyes in the break.</p><p>Byron York.</p><p>Coming up, speaking out -- the woman who posted this alarming video from her flight.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Presidents' Day features some of the best car deals of the year. There's a new report out saying that some dealers might be giving potential buyers strange advice. Stop paying your car loan.</p><p>Grady Trimble is at a dealership in Elmhurst, Illinois -- not one of the dealers telling customers that but what do you know -- Grady?</p><p>GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, we'll get to that in a second but to start with the sales -- auto sales in general are down over the last few years, so dealerships are offering more incentives than ever to customers looking to buy cars.</p><p>That said though, February doesn't even crack the top five in terms of top sales months for dealerships. Those go to Christmas time, December when they're trying to get rid of old model years, and the summertime. It is worth noting though, February is a shorter month.</p><p>There are still good deals available, according to \"Consumer Reports\". The Chevy Bolt and Equinox are good ones to look for as well as the Toyota Avalon and the Corolla.</p><p>On a separate but related note, as you mentioned this alleged practice by dealers, according to \"The Wall Street Journal\". The \"Journal\" says that in some cases when someone can no longer afford their car loan, they are telling -- dealers are telling people they are not going to accept a trade- in so instead they should stop paying their loan according to the Journal, and voluntarily give up their car and have it repossessed and then the dealer goes and sells them a new car.</p><p>It is worth noting, I reached out to a trade organization, for dealerships, they say this isn't really happening. This is what they told me. There is simply no credible data, none that practice alleged in this \"Wall Street Journal\" story, systemic or prevalent in the marketplace.</p><p>And I should note, Dagen -- both the dealerships named in that \"Wall Street Journal\" article -- well they are no longer in business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you Grady. Grady Trimble -- thank you so much. Great to see you my friend.</p><p>Coming up -- the fight for 15. Democratic hopeful Michael Bloomberg, the latest to join the push to raise the minimum wage.</p><p>Then too many fish in the sea, the chicken wars might be simmering down, but Arby's is frying up a new fight over fish.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday February 17th. President's Day. I look at futures at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time and markets overseas. The markets here stock and bond are closed for the holiday. But futures are trading this morning with gains across the board here. This is after new record highs, the NASDAQ and S&amp;P on Friday.</p><p>Checking on global market action in Europe, you have gains across the board all those slight. In Asia overnight was a bit of a mixed story. The Nikkei under some pressure, the economy and Japan contracting more than six percent at the end of the year. The Shanghai Composite rebounding from coronavirus fears.</p><p>The Trump administration reportedly looking at new trade restrictions on China show. Cheryl Casone has the detail. Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: Yes, that's right, Dagen. So the Commerce Department is weighing changes and that limiting China's ability to use American chip making equipment. This is according to The Wall Street Journal. Sources say the restrictions under consideration are aimed at Huawei, which the Trump administration believes is used by China to spy on the U.S.</p><p>However, the Journal says the move could also disrupt the global supply chain for semiconductors. That would be an issue. Well, for the second time ever, a sitting U.S. President telling drivers at the Daytona 500 to start your engines. President Trump speaking the familiar phrase before leading drivers around the track for a lap and the presidential limousine known as The Beast and the crowd loved it.</p><p>The Daytona 500 set to resume today 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Fox after several rain delay. Dagen, don't miss that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. I got to get a tooth polls. I'm going to be right as rain to watch that race at 4:00. I am going to be --</p><p>CASONE: You'd be feeling good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: About six Advil, the glass of wine, watching some race --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER: I'm going to be watching.</p><p>CASONE: Please start texting for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Go ahead.</p><p>CASONE: I got one more. American Airlines passenger Wendi Williams joined the show earlier this morning recounting her turbulent flight that has sparked a fierce online debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WENDI WILLIAMS, AMERICAN AIRLINES PASSENGER: He started full on punching my seat to where I was falling forward, flying forward. And he continued and I was trying to get the flight attendant's attention. They were paying their mind and then he -- I just thought I have to deal with this on my own somehow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Wendi, are you really --</p><p>WILLIAMS: So I got my phone and start videoing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, Williams went to call out American for its response and did not roll out, take a legal action against the man in the video or for that matter the airline. Pretty interesting interview this morning, Dagen, that you conducted with her.</p><p>MCDOWELL: My only -- quiet -- we didn't really get to this and thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is that -- and let's keep it in play. What are your damages? You really have to prove damages other than just inconvenience for the actual damages to you?</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That would be -- that would be my pleasure.</p><p>CASONE: Lawyers up, we'll find out soon enough.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p>CARTER: Sure. And it's a sparked, a huge debate online. I mean, you see people who are saying, do you have a right to put your seat back or not? I want to know what people think.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The CEO of another airline weighed in on having to ask permission of the passenger behind you if you want to recline your seat</p><p>CARTER: About half the people of my company think that you do not have a right to put your seat back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They -- and side with this guy.</p><p>CARTER: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- lead. I don't know how you -- I just don't know how you justify him punching or --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: When it's man versus woman, and like it or not, there is that difference in the sexist.</p><p>ROB SMITH, SPOKESPERSON, TURNING POINT USA: Its aggressive and I was curious that she ever felt like she was in any kind of physical danger at the time. So --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the airlines have left you with no -- you can't -- you can't stand up and say anything because they yell at you.</p><p>SMITH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then they threatened to have you arrested and put the --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The zip ties.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Zip ties.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: Like I think the real loser in this whole thing is airline, they are just really not looking good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's -- you know what, it's not the airlines, it's the people on the planes that are the problem. I've said that all along. It's the behavior, it's horrible.</p><p>CARTER: It is horrible. Look at --</p><p>MCDOWELL: All my friends -- all my friends and family members every time they drop me at the airport, or they'll call me and say you better check that temporary at the curb. Because you're not walking in that airport not getting on a plane and being upset because you will get arrested.</p><p>SMITH: People don't know how to act anymore.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, they don't. Take their feet off and put their feet.</p><p>SMITH: Yes. The feet. Did you see the woman that she had her bare toe? She was swiping on the screen for the movies? Did you see that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH: That was the video that were viral --</p><p>CARTER: Toes on screen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: No.</p><p>SMITH: Her bare feet. She was using her toes to swipe through the movie options.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know -- I know of a real house -- a particular real housewife who did that, took her shoes and socks off and was swiping the screen with her bare feet.</p><p>SMITH: Whoa. I'll get that name during the break.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, you will. Meantime, the 2020 race really heating up, one big topic on the table. Minimum wage. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg pushing for $15.00 an hour. Tom Steyer, he's got a Trump everybody pun intended. $22.00 if he's elected. Joining us now former McDonald's USA CEO, former Famous Dave's BBQ CEO, Fat Brands International Chairman, Ed Rensi. Good morning, Ed, what do you say?</p><p>ED RENSI, INTERNATIONAL CHAIRMAN, FAT BRANDS: Good morning. I think some of these politicians are out of their minds. You would think by now that they understand that the entry level worker making minimum wage should progress through mentoring and training into other jobs. It's not a living wage, and $22.00 an hour is absurd. It will put small businesses out of business. It will be dilatory to job growth in every way possible.</p><p>Small businesses are the biggest generator of jobs in the United States on an ongoing basis. Why throttle them? Let's be realistic about what the minimum wage is. It's not a living wage. It's an entry-level wage for those with have -- that have very poor job skills and need to learn.</p><p>CARTER: But let's talk for a second about. What the impact of something like this if it were to happen $15.00 minimum wage, be on a company like McDonald's?</p><p>RENSI: Well, for all restaurants like McDonald's, labor costs are about 33 percent of the sales, it's a very high labor content business. And if you go to $22.00, you're going to increase 50 to 60 percent, the cost of labor, that means you have to raise prices three times the dollar amount to break even on the P&amp;L. And a $22.00 minimum Wage means your current $4.00 hamburger got to be nine to $10.00.</p><p>It's absurd. It just isn't work -- workable from an economic standpoint, it's inflationary. It's a job killer, and it's very depressing to small businesses.</p><p>SMITH: Yes. And I had a question. So do you think that the average person sometimes misses that some of the negative effects of raising the $15.00 minimum wage. I know here in New York City, we have a $15.00 minimum wage and I've seen less people on the floor at restaurants. I've seen less people there to help. So do you think that normal people kind of like miss that?</p><p>RENSI: Well, when you say average people and normal people, I think the citizens of the United States by and large, have a lot of common sense.</p><p>SMITH: Yes.</p><p>RENSI: They filter a lot of information coming from media, newspapers, magazines, what have you, but they see on the street, what's going on when their favorite coffee shop, their favorite pastry shop, their favorite pizza place, closes down because they can't afford to do business here, they know full well, the government is behind that tragedy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ed, there's some new numbers that came out late last week showing 6.1 million people have dropped off of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. This is a food stamps since President Trump took off. What do you make of this? This is just the strength in the economy, is it not?</p><p>RENSI: Yes. I believe it is actually. It's something that I find very hopeful in reality because most people really would prefer to work for a living and earn the food opportunities that they have, and to be able to enjoy the commerce of the United States like everyone else. There is no great joy and being required to be in SNAP. I saw back where I grew up in West Virginia and Eastern Ohio in the coal fields of steel mines.</p><p>There's -- coal mines in a steel industry where people were losing their jobs and people of great pride and dignity were forced onto the welfare rolls. It is crippling psychologically, it damages children. Are you feel hopeless and helpless? And I think what Trump's doing getting those people onto their feet, getting people back to work and allowing them to have their dignity is magnificent.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Ed, Mitch Roschelle. Good morning. One of the things I do worry about with the labor market, isn't the government imposed minimum wage because I agree with you on your position there. But is how tight the labor market is? So looking at your business, is it difficult to -- because I have -- I'm a big fast food fan and every restaurant that I go to seems to have a help wanted sign. How hard is it to find talent and is that something that's going to really hold back growth over time?</p><p>RENSI: Well, I -- frankly, I'm really excited about it because when those signs go up, that means we're pushing toward full employment. I particularly like it in minority communities where for the first time, we've got teenage unemployment dropping like crazy, I think it's a great sign for the economy overall. And sure, it makes it much more difficult for the franchisees but hike up your shorts, go to work, find new ways to recruit, develop new sources of talent, train people develop people, you know, look at -- you look at their turnover rate at McDonald's for their hourly employees.</p><p>It's extremely low because they pushed her people up into management, its elevation. So I love it. It is difficult, make no mistake about it. But I don't like easy labor markets because it's bad for the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm want to move on to the plant-based fast food craze. It might not be as hot as some people thought, Ed. Burger King is saying that sales growth did slow down in the fourth quarter despite introducing the world to the impossible Whopper. What are you seeing in terms of this -- the plant- based burgers that are being served, if you will?</p><p>RENSI: Well, I'm not in favor of digital food by and large. We've got a rising trend in veganism and vegetarianism. I think it's beautiful. I like that idea. It's a whole new customer base. I think every restaurant in United States ought to get smart about developing vegetarian options, vegan options, using plant-based materials without all the chemistry. Impossible burgers got its fans. I like it periodically, it's not my favorite thing in the world deed.</p><p>And when you rest too much on fads for your growth, you're going to be disappointed. It reminds me the gluten-free business where gluten-free products now, 139 percent more expensive than naturally occurring gluten- free products. So, I'm not a big fan of fads, I think we ought to embrace it, vegetarianism and veganism and develop high quality, great tasting products that are pure in nature.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I feel you, I hear you. But you know what is not a fad? The Filet-O-Fish. Arby's is now -- it's known for its moots. We have to say it like the ad, is trolling McDonald's with two new limited edition fish sandwiches. One crispy, the other fish and cheddar. Which you're not supposed to eat cheese with fish, but that's another story. They're making their debut right before Lent. Arby's looking to take on McDonald's again, the Filet-O-Fish.</p><p>What do you make of this because? Because the Filet-O-Fish is one of the best-selling sandwiches at McDonald's, is it not?</p><p>RENSI: Well, I've always confused. What I was -- in my 55 years working in and around McDonald's, I would never mention a competitor's name. For the life of me, I don't understand why Arby's and Burger King and Wendy's, troll McDonald's at all. Celebrate the quality of your product, celebrate your location, celebrate your employees, focus on yourself and not everybody else.</p><p>Look, McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich was developed by a McDonald's franchisee Lou Groen in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1968. Originally, it was North Atlantic cod, today, it's mostly North Pacific cold water Pollock. It is cut in block because that's where it comes out of the -- out of the factories to process to fish. I think it's very pure in its nature. It is Pollock, it's got a light reading on it. It's fried in good oil. It's a great sandwich with Epicurean tartar sauce. OK. By the way, we start talking about your own stuff instead of McDonald's?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ed, you're a Filet-O-Fish fan? Like when you go --</p><p>RENSI: I love it. In fact, I love a double Filet-O-Fish sandwich. Now don't tell anybody at McDonald's but I like ketchup on it too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ketchup and fish sticks. I mean, that's my childhood. Ketchup and --</p><p>RENSI: Here I am.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So there we go. See?</p><p>RENSI: I grew at Mrs. Paul's.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly. You're from West Virginia?</p><p>RENSI: Well, I'm right on the border near Steubenville, Ohio when wheeling.</p><p>SMITH: Hey, Ohio.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey, Rob is from Ohio, I'm from Virginia. So, you know, the elites in the big cities in the north. They all think we're from one big county anyway, and they're all related. So there you go. Ed, good to see you my friend.</p><p>RENSI: You got it, sister, I'm there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bye, Ed. Thank you. Coming up. Bloomberg backlash, the Democratic hopeful under fire for taking a dig at farmers. You just dig a hole and put a seed in. Don't forget to ask Maria, the table is always turn on Friday. She's going to be answering your questions from social media. You can submit them through Instagram, and Twitter. There's Maria and her sister and her beautiful mom. Stay with us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's have a head over to studio B where Charles Payne is preparing to host \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" Charles, what's on deck?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, you know, there's no shortage of things that we're going to be talking about. But the most important thing is we're -- we've got a day off right now and the markets going to be open tomorrow, we're going to open it record highs on the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ. And we're really gone now in the final stretch of this election. So we're going to be covering the Democratic debacle, where they go from here?</p><p>You've covered it very well this morning from Bloomberg to Bernie, the -- they seem to be in disarray. In the meantime, President Trump at the Daytona 500, everyday men and I don't think he would ever dis American farmers, Dagen. That's just a hunch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is the biggest mistake.</p><p>PAYNE: I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is just the biggest mistake but I'm a huge racing fan and I love the Daytona 500. Now, I've always told people to go down there and go to it if they could. And I just wish I'd seen Air Force One fly race that race track.</p><p>VARNEY: Wouldn't that be something? Oh my goodness, you know, I wanted to go this year too. Well, obviously I'm kind of glad I didn't but I'm going to go, it's high on my list of bucket list I have to go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You let me know, I'll hook you up.</p><p>PAYNE: All right, cool. I'm open to it</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. Top pass.</p><p>PAYNE: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And all that goes with it. Thank you, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: That's good. Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll see you in eight minutes. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" weekdays 9:00 a.m. to noon.</p><p>Coming up. Bloomberg backlash the Democratic hopefuls under fire for taking a dig at farmers and keeping big tech in check. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to ramp up regulation even if it -- if it takes a toll on this business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I could teach anybody, even people in this room so no offense intended to be a farmer, you -- it's a process, so you dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. Then we had 300, you could learn that.</p><p>The information economy is fundamentally different because it's built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze and that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set. You have to have a lot more gray matter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was 2020 Democratic hopeful Michael Bloomberg taking a dig at farmers back in 2016. Lee, your reaction to this? Again, the support for President Trump is strong among the farming community, even with the trade fight with China and other nations. Of course, Canada, Mexico trade deal got done. But what do you make of that?</p><p>CARTER: One of the challenges that so many of these candidates' face is that anything that they've ever said can be used against them. And Mayor Bloomberg is going to have a lot of things, they're going to be able to be used against him and they're going to show that he is not an every-man fan. I would even say he's condescending, he looks down on folks. And this is just one more example. I'm sure he's going to be watching this and saying, that's not what I meant, but it's what we heard.</p><p>We heard him say, it's -- people need to know how to think, analyze more gray matter, anybody could do that. And it's just not a good look. And it's going to be something that's going to be -- I think this kind of stuff is going to continue to play again, because you can imagine, we're just, you know, we're not that far into him really running now. We're already seeing this to stop frisk video, we're going to see more about how he treated women about these kinds of things. And more and more is going to be on tape.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And if his behavior when he is in front of actual real, live breathing Americans, if his behavior basically suggests these past tapes, if it isn't dramatically different than what we've seen in these videos or audio tapes, then that's a problem, right?</p><p>SMITH: Well, it's going to be a problem. And it's so funny. You know, you said this earlier that there's intent versus delivery. Because when you watch the clip, you know what the intent is. Andrew Yang before he dropped out, he was saying a lot about how we're transforming into, you know, a different economy. And there was an intention behind what he said, but Bloomberg's delivery was just awful.</p><p>And when you see him get out there on the campaign show more and more and more. This is somebody that obviously doesn't like dealing with people. We're going to see that and we're also going to see, like you said, a steady drip of more clips like this because we've got, you know, decades of Bloomberg being in public life. We had decades of these of this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER: And I think you're saying something else is really important, somebody who doesn't like people, you can always almost tell who's going to win the race by the person who seems to be having the most fun, by the person who really seems to like the people. And that is something that's going to be so, so important. One of the problems is none of the Democrats really seem to be that mo. Bernie Sanders and he really does enjoy getting out there meeting with his people.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch, I want to get to this real quick. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is written this piece, calling for new internet roles, it's an op-ed that's in the Financial Times. I believe good regulation may hurt Facebook's business in the near term, but it will be better for everyone including us over the long term. If we don't create standards that people fail or legitimate they won't trust institutions or technology. Your quick reaction to that?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Any organization or business that is going to be regulated and it's inevitable has to get ahead of it and he's doing exactly the right thing, getting ahead of the regulation. So you have a voice when the regulations are being pulled together.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Indeed. It was great to spend the morning with you.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Absolutely.</p><p>CARTER: Especially with you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I hope you have the rest of the day off. Rob, Lee and Mitch, always a pleasure. I really appreciate you all coming in today. But some markets are closed, but so much to talk about. Right, Charles Payne? He's in for Stuart Varney today. I don't --</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020021703cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7B-YSC1-DXH2-60SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7053\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001TIV</classCode><className>AMERICAN AIRLINES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Daytona 500</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>The Beast</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>American Airlines</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tom Steyer</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>McDonald's</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Burger King</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Whopper</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Filet-O-Fish</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Arby's</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wendy's</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lou Groen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mrs. Paul's</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Air Force One</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Our Hari Sreenivasan speaks with the directors of the new documentary \"The Great Hack.\"</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>American and Chinese negotiators head to Shanghai trying to end the yearlong escalating trade war that is biting at both their economies. President Trump began the standoff last year, slapping tariffs on some Chinese imports in an attempt to force Beijing to end what they call unfair trade practices. But few expected to end any time soon and the doubter in chief is the president himself now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think that China will probably say, \"Let's wait. It's 14 or 15 months until the election. Let's see if one of these people that give the United States away, let's see if one of them could possibly get elected.\" And I'll tell you what, when I win, like almost immediately, they're all going to sign deals and they're going to be phenomenal deals for the country. But -- so, I don't know that they're going to -- I don't know if they're going make a deal. Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. I don't care. Because we're taking it tens of billions of dollars' worth of tariffs. And the farmers are happy because I gave them $16 billion out of the tariffs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: He's referring to a $16 billion federal aid package which was announced on Thursday intended to help those farmers who produce things like soybeans and pork and who are hurt by Chinese's retaliatory tariffs. The farmers though are not all happy. The president of the American Farm Bureau Federation said last week, \"America's farmers ultimately want trade more than aid.\" So, what can they expect?</p><p>Peter Navarro is a senior advisor to the president focusing on trade policy. And he joins me now from Washington. For kind of a rare conversation.</p><p>Welcome to the program, Mr. Navarro.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, ASSISTANT TO THE U.S. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let's first take what the president himself says that he is already pouring cold water on these talks, which are due to open tomorrow in Shanghai. Doesn't necessarily think there will be a deal. Do you agree that it's not going happen?</p><p>NAVARRO: Here's what I can tell you. We have best United States trade representative in our history, Robert Lighthizer, on a plane with treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, on their way to Shanghai to negotiate for what I think will be at least the 12th meeting on this issue. My strong preference here is to let these negotiates take place behind closed doors, and if when a deal is reached, there will be full transparency.</p><p>The only thing I can tell you, Christiane, is this is not a trade deal in the traditional sense where one country lowers tariffs and the other country lowers some tariffs. The problem we have with China is structural. China engages in various forms of economic aggression. And let me just check off the list and see if we agree that is happening.</p><p>First of all, it's well known that China hacks our business computers to extract our trade secrets. China engages in what is called force technology transfer in exchange for market access into China. That's wrong. China steals our intellectual property to the tune of several hundred billion dollars a year. China dumps products into our markets with steel, aluminum, robotics, autos, whatever it is well below costs that is outside the balance of international trade.</p><p>The state-owned enterprises of China, unlike the capitalist enterprises in much of the rest of the world engage in various unfair subsidized practices. And China has a history of currency manipulation. Finally [13:05:00] and seriously, China is the major source of fentanyl in the United States, which is killing over 50,000 Americans a year. So, these are the things that will be discussed behind closed doors. I'm optimistic that we can continue to move forward on this, but that is all I will say about that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So that's interesting because you do list a long series of disputes you have with China, and many people would agree with you on the intellectual property and the other such things that you've mentioned.</p><p>So, do you believe that there's a possibility for some wins, even if it's not a whole trade deal that is struck?</p><p>NAVARRO: Well, let me -- the other thing I'll say is that there -- what President Trump has done in 2.5 years is truly remarkable and that he has brought together a consensus on the issue that we must deal with the China issue. If you look at polling on this, 8 out of 10 Republicans support the China tariffs and over half of Americans support the tariffs.</p><p>In a rare show of unanimity on Capitol Hill, both Democrats and Republicans, are strongly behind the president. I think it's important -- and I've been to this rodeo before after the meeting in Buenos Aires. It's really important now that there would be little discussion in the press about this because most it will be inaccurate and that we simply let the negotiators do their job.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right.</p><p>NAVARRO: If we are able to do that, then we may have a deal. And if we don't, we'll have tariffs. And as the president said, we're taking in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. And in the process, and this is the important thing, those tariffs defend American farmers, ranchers, manufacturing workers against these structural problems we face with China.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So --</p><p>NAVARRO: Let's be optimistic. I think -- I mean, the stock market is very bullish and the economy is very bullish. I think there's a lot of other things going on in the economic world such as the United States-Mexico- Canada Agreement that are important to --</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right.</p><p>NAVARRO: -- this administration. And I would be happy to talk about that. But let's move on from China, if we can.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, no. Let me ask you a couple of things because you've raised a huge number of issues. So, I want to ask you about this. Look, the president basically said trade wars are good and they're easy to win. But this has been going on for, you know, more than a year now and It's not won.</p><p>And, you know, you heard what the farmers said, they would much rather have trade deals than aid and some of them are bitterly complaining about how expensive things are becoming and how they're being hurt by retaliatory tariffs. So, I guess, do you think a change of tactic or strategy is required?</p><p>NAVARRO: I think that on the issue of trade, what we have in this country is a world where numerous countries, not just China, Japan, the European Union, engage in systemically unfair practices. And one of the problems we face, Christiane, is under the rules of the World Trade Organization, it's perfectly legal if not fair for other countries to charge us much higher tariffs and engage in nontariff barriers.</p><p>So, our philosophy in the administration with President Trump taking the lead on this is fair, balanced, reciprocal trade, and this is what defines the president's mission. And I think that it's important to look and see just how strong the economy is under his leadership and under this move, basically, to get this trading regime in a better place. And then, we've created over 6 million jobs. We got 7 million people off food stamps. We see historically low unemployment rates, Blacks, Hispanics, women, the disabled, veterans.</p><p>One of the things that I think is particularly interesting is that wages are rising disproportionately for those blue collared manufacturing workers. And One of my favorite statistics is the fact we've created over 500,000 manufacturing jobs compared to a loss of 200,000 manufacturing jobs --</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>NAVARRO: -- in the Obama/Biden administration.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>NAVARRO: So, this is what we're focused on. And my point here is that China is a small part of the bigger economic puzzle and we shouldn't get fixated and I'm not going to do that in this interview.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right. But, sir, you just talked about the American economy. And you know, I mean, you know, you said don't get fixated but you guys picked this fight with China and I'm trying to figure out whether you have an end game.</p><p>NAVARRO: No --</p><p>AMANPOUR: No, no. The trade tariffs, right. Just the tariff. You started the tariffs and that is, actually, a [13:10:00] tax which is hurting both Chinese and Americans, all the economists say that. But I would like to pick you up and ask you the bigger picture, as you want, and that is about the economy.</p><p>NAVARRO: Sure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, yes, the economy has been doing really well and many in the corporate and, I guess, higher income group have praised the tax cuts and the corporate sort of, you know, issues that have come forth. But we've seen on Friday the Commerce Department reporting that the economy grew 2.5 percent last year, which is down from the estimate of 3 percent. And people are saying that, \"Look, yes, it's bubbling along well but a lot like Obama's was, you know, sort of good, moderate, steady growth.\"</p><p>So, I'm wondering whether -- you know, whether you're concerned you might have a whole different aim with China, which is more of a defeated as a strategic rival than just take on these, in your view, legitimate economic issues and trade issues.</p><p>NAVARRO: So, let me give you some context here. I was on the campaign with the president and I'm one of the few, Kellyanne Conway calls us, the unbroken threads. And during the campaign, the president ran on four points of the policy compass. On the economy, it was tax cuts to stimulate investment, deregulation to lower the cost of business so they could compete globally. It was unleashing our energy sector. And today, we, incredibly, are the number one oil producer in the world.</p><p>And it was bringing about fair trade. And all of those things have allowed us to grow significantly faster than we saw in the Obama/Biden era. They were at around 2 or 2 percent or below. We hit 3 percent in 2018. We hit 3.1 percent in Q1.</p><p>Now, to your question, are we worried about this latest number? I think the biggest problem that we had that is reflected in that data is the federal reserve, which foolishly began back in March of 2018 to raise interest rates what would be a total of a hundred basis points. And what higher interest rates do, Christiane, is they depress investment and they depress our exports.</p><p>And if you look at the 2.1 percent growth rate that we hit in Q2, it was above expectations. That's good news. But where did we lose it? We lost a full point because of lower private sector investment, and we also lost two-thirds of a point to lower exports. And on top of that, we lost .4 of a point to the Boeing 737 Max problem.</p><p>So, we could have been north of 4 percent, if the fed hadn't raised interest rates and if Boeing had not had that problem. That's good news because this week, it's widely expected that the fed will lower interest rates. I hope they lower 50 basis points and a full hundred by at least June of 2020. If they do that, and if we pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, I can guarantee you we'll fly well past the dow 30,000 and we'll be over 3 percent growth rate.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. Let me just --</p><p>NAVARRO: This is what's at stake in this economy.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let me just jump in a little bit because I just want to ask --</p><p>NAVARRO: Sure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- you about reports on -- I mean, you're talking about exports and trying to make U.S. exports more attractive and try to boost the economy, et cetera. So, the reports, as you know, because you were focused of them, over the weekend that you had recommended last Tuesday that the president weaken the U.S. dollar by about 10 percent in order to make U.S. exports more attractive to foreign buyers. One person in the room, according to \"POLITICO\" said that you were, you know, barely begun your presentation and then \"before getting slaughtered by the president.\" Now, is that true? Did you recommend? Is the president against devaluing the dollar?</p><p>NAVARRO: What happens in the Oval stays in the Oval and I'm not going to be talking about what happened in the Oval that day.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right. Then let me ask you this, do you accept -- well, do you think the president wants to devalue the dollar? And do you agree with most economists who say it's critical that the world's reserve currency, which is the dollar, does not get devalued because that adds a whole another level of economic burden that being the reserve currency you have so many benefits and if you devalue, you lose those benefits?</p><p>NAVARRO: So, this discussion is basically fruit of the poison tree. That discussion in the Oval never should have went public, and I'm really not going to talk about currency. I do that in private with our trade team [13:15:00] and currency publicly is to province to the president and treasury secretary.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. But I guess I just want to ask your opinion on whether a strong dollar is important, if you want to continue to have the benefits of being the world's reserve currency.</p><p>NAVARRO: I think that the terminology of a strong versus weak dollar is counterproductive to understanding the macro forces that shape the U.S. economy, the world economy. It's not a question of the strong is a -- weak is a pejorative term in most people's minds. The issues is whether the dollar is overvalued. And I think it's fair to say that most economists believe that to be true.</p><p>An overvalued dollar will lead to fewer exports, more imports, higher trade deficit and slower growth. The question then becomes what do you do about that, if anything, and that discussion will happen when it involves me behind closed doors.</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK. So --</p><p>NAVARRO: Not publicly.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, look, I'm glad we have you here because you are quite a controversial fellow. I mean, you do draw a lot of slings and arrows from presidential advisors and economists and the media, so and so. So, let me run through a few of them for you and you can respond. So, the \"New York Times\" described you as being so far outside the main stream that you endorse few of the key tenants of the economic profession. \"The New Yorker\" says that your views on trade and China are so radical that even with your assistance, this writer was unable to find another economist who fully agrees with them.</p><p>Do you -- how do you react to that? Do you stop to consider what such a big section of the economic landscape thinks of you?</p><p>NAVARRO: So, can I ask you a question?</p><p>AMANPOUR: If you like, but this isn't really you asking me questions. I'm interviewing you.</p><p>NAVARRO: Just one question. Do you agree with the premise now that China and its economic model provides a negative effect on the global economy? Could we at least agree on that?</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, you know what, I'm not an economist. I certainly do understand the problems with intellectual property and all the other issues that you guys are dealing with.</p><p>NAVARRO: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I'm just looking at the facts that are happening right now. And I just want to know, just your reactions and for instance --</p><p>NAVARRO: Sure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- when Gary Cohen, a former colleague, said, you know, that you just make --</p><p>NAVARRO: I'll answer your question now. I'll answer your question.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- you know, SH blah, blah up.</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes, yes, yes. So, here is the thing, the great Wayne Gretzky, the hockey player, said he always try to skate to where the puck was going to be. I think right now it's conventional wisdom in Washington that China has basically adopted an economic model, which harms the United States after they join the WTO, we lost over 70,000 factories over 5 million manufacturing jobs. That's the conventional wisdom today in 2019.</p><p>I wrote a book about that in 2006, which basically today reads like any government report on the Chinese economy. So, at the time, I was widely ridiculed in newspapers like \"The Financial Times\" and was accused of hyperbole. And today, that book is quaint in terms of describing the problem.</p><p>So, do I worry about people who criticize me for not seeing the chess board correctly? No, I don't. I was accurate, for example, like what, on my macro forecaster by profession before I got into Washington, D.C. I forecast the housing bubble. I forecast the stock market crash in 2007. And so, no, I don't mind being ahead of the curve. Donald Trump was ahead of the curve on the trade back in the '80s and now, here we are.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right. Well, let's hope we have a resolution to this trade war. I want to ask you to wrap up something that is very, very important. You know, being a head of the curve and seeing these existential crises. Back in 2007, you were certainly of your time and maybe even ahead of the curve on global warming. You said it's a significant problem and carbon dioxide emissions are the principle cause of global warming. You also said economists correctly perennially argue that the most efficient and direct path to American energy independence and clean skies was simply be to tax oil imports and gasoline as well as carbon. And you actually supported President Obama's adoption of wind energy and carbon taxes to combat climate change.</p><p>I mean, now, you work for a president who thinks the opposite [13:20:00] and is busy rolling back all sorts of regulations and empowering the fossil fuel industry. I just want to know what you think of that. Does it keep you up at night? Do you still feel the same person on climate that you were in 2007 or have you changed?</p><p>NAVARRO: One of the things, I think, the president did that was absolute correct was getting out of the Paris Climate Accord. And the reason why I believe that was the correct thing to do is that was basically a free pass to other countries like India and China to pollute. And if we had gone into that agreement, the American economy would have suffered mightily.</p><p>This is not my lane. I'm the government official. I don't work on climate change. I haven't worked on that for a minute since I've been here. My mission, Christiane, and I take it very seriously, is to create good jobs and good wages for the men and women of America who work with their hands. And whether it's a shipyard in Marinette, Wisconsin or a combat vehicle plant in Lima, Ohio or an F-16 production line in Greenville, these are the kind of jobs that are reviving this country and helping people who wear blue collars, not white ones, take pride in what they do and be able to have strong families. And once again --</p><p>AMANPOUR: OK.</p><p>NAVARRO: -- enjoy the American dream here. And that's what my mission is. So, that's what I focus on every day, seven days a week, 60 hours a week. And I'm honored and privileged to serve this president.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right. Peter Navarro, thank you so much for joining us today.</p><p>And we are turning now to big developments concerning the United States with regard to Russia and Afghanistan. First, Moscow where police have returned opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, to jail today after he was hospitalized with a mysterious illness. His lawyer said he was \"poisoned.\" Navalny was detained before the weekend's big protest to demand fair election. A violent police crackdown on Saturday led to the detention of 1,074 people.</p><p>And less in the headlines but much more deadly, the war in Afghanistan. More than 20 are dead and at least 50 wounded after this weekend's attack on the office of President Ghani's running mate in upcoming elections.</p><p>At the same time, the former CIA director, Michael Morell, poured cold water all over the U.S. peace talks with the Taliban calling them a \"charade.\"</p><p>For more now, I'm joined by Julia Ioffe who has long covered Russia and is now correspondent for \"GQ\" magazine and by Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to the United States who is immersed in Afghanistan policy.</p><p>Welcome both of you to the program.</p><p>Can I just turn to you, first, Julia, and ask you about these protests? These are the most significant protests in a long time. Some are saying, you know, since President Putin's 2012 victory. Where do you think these are headed and how serious is it the Navalny may not have been hurt perhaps with chemicals according to his own lawyers in prison?</p><p>JULIA IOFFE, CORRESPONDENT, GQ MAGAZINE: You know, that's a great question, Christiane. These are certainly the biggest protests in Moscow we've seen in a while. But Navalny has been good at basically getting people out into the streets. He's done this a few times, including across all of Russia in March 2017, again, when over a thousand people were detained.</p><p>You know, the -- Putin's ratings are at their lowest point since they've been since those big protests in 2011, 2012. Russia's wealth gap is now the largest in the world. The mood is certainly shifting. People are getting tired of all the corruption. But the question is what happens? These are still -- this is still a tiny proportion of, not just the Russian population but the Moscow population. They're not out there for economic reasons but for kind of abstract political principles. They want to be represented on a very small largely and significant body, the Moscow City Council. They're not even allowed to be on the ballot, let alone, you know, run this city or their country.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Isn't that, Julia, the point? I mean, you raised the --</p><p>IOFFE: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- million-dollar question. If it's such an insignificant in a city council in Moscow, why the massive crack down by the police?</p><p>IOFFE: Well, it goes with Putin's zero-tolerance approach to these things. You know, you don't give these people an inch because if they're seen as in any way legitimate, in any way a real threat to him, then it kind of undermines the whole basis of his power.</p><p>At this point, he has been in charge for almost two decades, and the whole -- the -- his popularity such as [13:25:00] it is, rests on the idea there are no alternatives to him. That there is nobody that can take over for him. Therefore, he has to continue ruling the country. So, he cannot allow -- he doesn't even say -- Navalny is his, basically, biggest most organized threat. His name isn't even pronounced on TV, you know. These protests got no coverage on state TV or almost no coverage.</p><p>So, a lot of Russians don't know they happened, and that's on purpose.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let me --</p><p>IOFFE: It's like a very isolated marginal movement.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Husain Haqqani, let me turn to you, because, I mean, in sort of the election lane, so to speak, elections are underway or at least the campaign in Afghanistan. We had this massive attack on one of the candidates over the weekend. He survived but some 20 people were killed. At the same time, Husain, the United States is involved in talks with the Taliban, which are not peace talks. Tell me -- there seems to be a counterintuitive narrative going on, Husain. What do you read in the U.S. aims in Afghanistan now?</p><p>HUSAIN HAQQANI, FORMER PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Christiane, it seems that President Trump has decided that he wants to keep his promise to the American public, that he is going to withdraw from Afghanistan, and the talks are essentially withdrawal talks. The purpose is to try and give the impression that there was some kind of settlement before America left instead of leaving arbitrarily.</p><p>The American negotiating team has not been paying due attention to the Afghan government, which is America's ally and with which America has a bilateral security agreement. And the Taliban continue to mount attacks making it very clear that they haven't changed. So, all that these talks are intended for is to be able to provide a fig leaf for withdrawal.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And Husain Haqqani, that is similar to what the former CIA director, Michael Morell, has said, calling them a charade, a face-saving way for the United States to pull out of Afghanistan. So, I mean, that is -- it's pretty intense when the former CIA director says that.</p><p>HAQQANI: Well, he's not the only one. The former American ambassador to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Ryan Crocker, has said the same thing. There are several of us who have this opinion. And we base our opinion on history.</p><p>Let's be very clear, the Taliban are a totalitarian ideological movement. They have a particular world view. We know how they treated the people of Afghanistan when they wielded power. They got into power with the support of Pakistan. They still have that support. Even know, the negotiating process essentially has been facilitated by Pakistan for which the Pakistani prime minister was rewarded with a visit to Washington, D.C. But the Taliban have just simply not changed.</p><p>So, all they are doing is they are negotiating with the Americans so that the Americans can leave without looking like they are cutting and running, even though they are cunning and running.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And briefly, again, before I turn back to Julia. You have said that essentially the Taliban is smelling blood and you actually raise something that Donald Trump himself wrote in the art in the deal back in 1987. He says, \"The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guys smell blood and then you're dead.\" But, I mean, it looks like that's what you're saying the administration, the president is doing.</p><p>HAQQANI: Well, look, Christiane, all of us want peace. And if these were genuine peace talks, we would really all support them. I still think that a negotiator settlement is needed. The negotiator settlement should essentially be based on the premise that Pakistan will no longer support the Taliban, that the Taliban will not attack civilians and will give up some of the core elements of their ideology where it does not recognize contemporary concepts of human rights. That should be the basis of peace.</p><p>And then the Afghan government, which exists and which is a reality, should be an integral part of the process rather than just be a marginal actor as it has been reduced to. Unless all of those conditions are met, these will not be seen as peace talks. The Taliban are already saying in their own media that, \"We have won and we are about to be victorious.\"</p><p>And we must not forget that as recently as May, al-Qaeda counted the Taliban among its allies. So, essentially, these are just false premises on which America plans to withdraw from Afghanistan instead of a genuine peace deal. And that is why the Taliban sensed that there is desperation and I am pointing out that you should not negotiate with a sense of desperation hanging over you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And actually, Taliban spokespeople have listed all the conditions you just mentioned as fantasies.</p><p>So, let us move over to you, Julia, again, because you also have, if it's not going well for the U.S. there, it's not necessarily going well for the U.S. in Russia either. What is -- I mean, what can the United States do, if anything [13:30:00] at this point to encourage President Putin into the democratic space? Is that just - I mean, I see you just shaking your head that it's completely unlikely in the current dynamic.</p><p>JULIA IOFFE, CORRESPONDENT, GQ MAGAZINE: Well, you had Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, being asked about these protests and he basically shrugged it off which is such a departure from precedent on the - U.S. precedent on these things. And honestly, it's not surprising.</p><p>We are now headed by a president, Donald Trump, who openly admires men like Vladimir Putin, like Kim Jong-un where he said, you know, when Kim Jong-un talks his people sit up and listen, and that's what I want. He has asked Vladimir Putin for a device on how to deal with pesky journalists and the fake news as he called them.</p><p>I should add that this weekend, the independent TV station, the - basically one of the only ones left in Russia, Tvrain, had police show up at its headquarters, at its station, and the editor in chief, who's a friend of mine, was called in for hours and hours of questioning. The whole newsroom is on edge. More journalists are going to be called in for questioning potentially as - either as witnesses or as participants in a criminal case.</p><p>So you know, again, we've - it comes from the very top in the Untied States, and this is - we're led by a president who openly admires authoritarians and clearly wants to be like one. So I think until this president is out of office we're not going to see any kind of coaxing, as you said, of Russia or any other kind of authoritarian country into the democratic column.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But the very, very real impact of Russia on America's institutions continues, so like Putin or not, the American institutions are at risk. As Robert Mueller pointed out in his testimony before Congress last week about election interference, I just want to play a little bit of a sound byte and actually get both of you to weigh in on this important factor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROBERT MUELLER, U.S. SPECIAL COUNSEL: First our investigation found that the Russian government interfered in our election in sweeping and systematic fashion.</p><p>They're doing it as we sit here and they expect to do it during the next campaign.</p><p>(END VIDOECLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So Julia, I mean, yes. I mean, it looks like it's happening. It's underway. It's going to happen. Any light at the end of that tunnel in terms of U.S. efforts to protect against that?</p><p>IOFFE: Well, you also had the Senate report that said that Russia - which we did not know about this before, that Russia probed the election infrastructure in all 50 states in 2016. And from Russia's point of view if you do it, you succeed, and you don't really get punished, why not keep doing it if it works?</p><p>You had the Senate Republicans like Mitch McConnell block any laws that would strengthen election infrastructure. Donald Trump just basically pushed out Dan Coats, a very good director of national intelligence and is nominating basically a political operator of a Congressman who has decried the Mueller investigation and all these election security efforts to be the Director of National Intelligence I think in part because the Russian's helped him, and as he admitted to George Stephanopoulos from the Oval Office if a foreign country wants to help him win, he will take that help.</p><p>Again, this comes from the very top unfortunately in the Untied States, and we gave a president who doesn't seem to - you know, who's willing to win at all costs even if a foreign adversary helps him. So he is not interested in strengthening our election infrastructure,</p><p>So Husain, to go back to what you said, sort of pick up this thread about elections, about winning, President Trump, as you've pointed out, promised to bring the troops home. And, you know, we've got billions of dollars spent. We've got hundreds of aircraft and thousands of rounds of ammunition or multiple hundreds of thousands and nobody really to set up the proper Afghan security forces. So why shouldn't the president and the American people say, \"OK, enough already. We've been there since 9/11,\"?</p><p>HAQQANI: I think the president is right in saying enough already. The question is does that basically mean cutting down costs in Afghanistan for which the American government should be talking to the Afghan government? Should it be about reducing the expenses of the American forces in Afghanistan?</p><p>You must remember that everything from chewing gum to guns go from America rather than anything being procured locally. So if those costs can be cut and a smaller presence can actually do the job, why not?</p><p>My point, of course, is that a lot of this has to do with how American domestic politics is played. The president just wants to announce victory without having victory, and I don't think that that is fair to the American people and it certainly is not fair to the Afghan people who will be left at the mercy of the Taliban even through their government signed a bilateral security agreement with the United States under which the Americans were to provide assistance and support in building Afghan forces.</p><p>[13:35:00]</p><p>My point, of course, is that a lot of this has to do with how American domestic politics is played. The president just wants to announce victory without having victory, and I don't think that that is fair to the American people and it certainly is not fair to the Afghan people who will be left at the mercy of the Taliban even through their government signed a bilateral security agreement with the United States under which the Americans were to provide assistance and support in building Afghan forces.</p><p>Look, let's not get this wrong. The Afghans bought the Talibans long before the Americans showed up in Afghanistan. The Americans came after 9/11. There was a small group of Afghans fighting the Taliban even then and without any support from the outside.</p><p>The Afghan people will fight for their country. The question is does the United States want to be seen as the country that came in big and left without really protecting the gains of the last 17 years?</p><p>AMANPOUR: Massively important issues. Husain Haqqani and Julia Ioffe, thank you so much indeed. And as we've discussed, Russia poses a particular conundrum for the Trump administration given its election meddling. Last week, as we said, the former special counsel said that Moscow's still at it, ramping up for the election 2020. It's weapon, of course, is the Internet - a sometime lawless space where citizens' data is increasingly being collected without their knowledge or permission and for often alarming reasons.</p><p>The new Netflix film, The Great Hack, takes a hard look at the ethics of big tech data and how it's being used to drive wedges of fear and hate to win elections and to undermine our democracies. Co-directors, Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim, who made Control Room and The Square raise a red flag with our Hari Sreenivasan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN, AMANPOUR HOST: Thanks for joining us. First a quick refresher course. You know, in a way your whole movie does this, but for people who might not have been paying attention to every news headline about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, what did Cambridge Analytica do?</p><p>KARIM AMER, CO-DIRECTOR, \"THE GREAT HACK\": Cambridge Analytica realized that your phone is now listening in on you, but that that feeling of your phone listening in on your is evidence that you're lot more predictable and persuadable than you might thing. How? Because you're giving all of these digital footprint of yourself constantly into the system of surveillance capitalism.</p><p>There is a voodoo doll basically of you that is very predictable and it is guessing what you want to do next. And Cambridge Analytica being a behavior change agency used the most powerful behavior change agency - Facebook - to collect 5,000 data points on every American voter and use those data points to find the key persuadable audience in swing states and target them with customized advertisement.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: All right, let's take a look at a clip of your trailer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All of your interactions, your credit card swipes, web searches, locations, likes - they're all collected in real time into a trillion dollar a year industry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The real game changer was Cambridge Analytica. It worked for the Trump campaign and for the Brexit campaign. They started using information warfare.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cambridge Analytica claimed to have 5,000 data points on every American voter.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I started tracking down all these Cambridge Analytica ex-employees.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Someone else that you should be calling to committee is Brittany Kaiser.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Brittany Kaiser once a key player inside Cambridge Analytica casting herself as a whistleblower.</p><p>BRITTANY KAISER: The reason why Google and Facebook are the most powerful companies in the world is because last year data surpassed oil in value. Data's the most valuable asset on Earth.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Jehane, what makes us different than how campaigns have worked forever? They've had ways to target people. They've had negative ads against the opponents. How's this different?</p><p>JEHANE NOUJAIM, CO-DIRECTOR, \"THE GREAT HACK\": Well, in following Brittany, she talked a lot about working in the Obama campaign where this was kind of - it was very beginnings of using data, and the Obama campaign used data but in a very sort of remedial way at that point in time. This is different in that because of the technological advances people can be targeted. So people are no longer voting for issues. They are listening to ads that are targeted based on what the algorithm knows about you.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Let's take a look at a clip of Brittany describing how it worked.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>KAISER: Remember those Facebook quizzes that we used to form personality models for all voters in the U.S.? The truth is we didn't target every American voter equally. The bulk of our resources went into targeting those whose minds we thought we could change. We called them the persuadable.</p><p>They're everywhere in the country, but the persuadable that mattered were the ones in swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Now each of these states were broken down by precinct.</p><p>[13:40:00]</p><p>So you can say there are 22,000 persuadable voters in this precinct and if you targeted enough persuadable people in the right precincts, then those states would turn red instead of blue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SREENIVASAN: The same firm, Cambridge Analytica was also working on the lead campaign. What were they doing?</p><p>AMER: So, through the testimonies of Brittany Kaiser, who is one of the central characters in the film, and when we meet Brittany Kaiser, she's kind of in Thailand and she has fled from her former life as a key member of this company, Cambridge Analytica, which had worked on both Brexit and the Trump campaign, as well as many other elections around the world.</p><p>She finds evidence in her files that Cambridge Analytica worked on Brexit and she has evidence to prove that she provided that evidence to Parliament under parliamentary privilege in her testimony.</p><p>And she also, in that testimony, explained that the information system -- the information technologies that were used by Cambridge were classified by the British government as weapons grade information systems that were export controlled. That is -- that is what we're talking about here.</p><p>We're not talking about just, oh well, everybody can just send an ad or two. No, we're talking about taking military grade technologies and applying them on a domestic population without the domestic population having consent during an election cycle.</p><p>NOUJAIM: So, it's cyops. It's basically the kinds of tools and weapons grade tools that were used abroad, whether to try to change the minds of potential kids joining ISIS or change populations, instead those same tools were used on the British population .</p><p>AMER: And the American.</p><p>NOUJAIM: . and the American population.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Did they cheat? Is this cheating to use these technological tools today, to get your side to win a campaign?</p><p>NOUJAIM: Well if you -- when you watch the film, you'll see that that question is asked in Parliament and Christopher Wylie answers that, yes, this is cheating. And he says that -- well, the next question that's asked of him is, well, did it really work? Did it really cause Brexit? Did it really -- did it really help the Leave campaign? Did it really affect Trump being elected?</p><p>And his answer was, well, when you have doping, you don't say, well, if they guy -- would they guy have come in first place anyway? He cheated. And so, he should be eliminated.</p><p>So, yes, according to the people that we followed, this was cheating.</p><p>AMER: Yes, I mean, I think it's about understanding that -- it's about deciding what's for sale. What's happened in the advent of this new surveillance capitalism system that we live in, which is the term that Shoshana Zuboff, was the thought leader in this space, has coined, is that we have become the commodity, as David Carroll says in the film. And we, as commodities, we've accept -- we've allowed for all of our recordable behavior to be bough and sold and commoditized.</p><p>Now, what's happened when it goes into an election cycle is that, you have allowed for the commoditization of the Democratic process, because you can buy and sell nodes of peoples of personalities and behavior and influence it quite effectively. And the problem with all of that is that it's happening in darkness, there's not transparency. We have no ability to know where the ads -- what ads people saw, where -- who paid for them and we've had not understanding of that now.</p><p>Facebook has the answers, but under the way in which our data is currently regulated in this country, we have no rights to our data, right? Like, we live in a country where we've allowed for all of our e-mails to be read by technology platforms. We live in a country where minor's data can be transacted.</p><p>We have to start asking these questions about, how much of ourselves is for sale and what happens to the integrity of the Democratic process when so much of it becomes commoditized.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: The U.K. government said, the Parliament said, their election system is not fit for purpose, what does that mean?</p><p>NOUJAIM: It means that the election laws are not able to withstand the technological advances that have led to the tools that have been used by Cambridge Analyica and other companies to come in the elections.</p><p>AMER: I think that what we've -- what we're witnessing is a moment where the balance of power has shifted. And when you look at Facebook, for example, Facebook has over two billion constituents that it has access to so much of their detailed information, but Facebook is not a Democratic institution.</p><p>[13:45:00]</p><p>Facebook doesn't have any responsibility, necessarily, to all of us, the users. And Facebook has not taken any credit or responsibility, more importantly, for any of the wreckage sites that we're seeing, both in the United States and abroad, whether it's with the Rohyingya crisis, whether it's with information being used and weaponized in other locations around the world.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: What's a wreckage site, when you talk about it that way.</p><p>NOUJAIM: It's a term we kind of made up actually.</p><p>AMER: Yes.</p><p>NOUJAIM: Because when we started making this film, it was invisible. It was how do you make the invisible, visible. This is something that's happening in your brain and on the computer, but it wasn't the makings of a visual movie.</p><p>Well, we started to look for wreckage sites, and by wreckage sites we meant, this is what happened because of what's happening with microtargeting and we felt like the 2016 was a wreckage site and Brexit was wreckage site.</p><p>AMER: And the wreckage -- the purpose of the wreckage site is for to show this vulnerability, which is what a hack is. A hack is the exploitation of a vulnerability. I think the hack that we found to be interesting was the exploit -- the vulnerability of our own minds and how our, as moral creatures, increasingly being shaped by these a-moral algorithms, how it would effect ourselves and our societies, and ask -- leave with the question of who dictates the ethics of these algorithms.</p><p>I don't believe that anybody wakes up in Silicone Valley and says, hey, how am I going to wreck democracy today, right? I don't think that's an active conversation, just like I don't think any oil executive wakes up and says, hey, how am I going to pollute today.</p><p>But the reality is, is that we saw in the industrial age where oil was the main commodity, there was externalities and spill-over effects that had a major -- have had major societal costs. The same time, we are witnessing right now, the externalities that have been caused by this love affair we've had with technology, where we assume that move fast and break things can always lead to just growth and innovation. And now, we're at the reckoning point.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: There's a lot of people who watch this film and say, Brittany, what's going on with Brittany? Is she more contrite off camera? Because as someone who knows how campaigns work, how messaging works, it's also possible to see the film and say, you know what, she's playing these filmmakers, and by extension, us. That this really just part of a slick redemption tour.</p><p>At the very end, I kind of see her having regrets, but you guys spend a lot of time with her. What was going through her mind and why she wanted to speak to you and how that evolution happened, even while you were filming, because you were filming during an active story.</p><p>NOUJAIM: We didn't know what to think of here when we met her. Similar, I think, to an audience watching. And our goal was to follow her and see how this journey unfolded. It's incredible when you meet somebody who has been in the Obama campaign and then wrote the first contract for the Trump campaign.</p><p>SCEENIVASAN: And pitched Trump.</p><p>NOUJAIM: Pitched Trump, worked on Brexit, was -- had certain ties to Julian Assange. Was investigated by Mueller, so in that way we had a human being, in this invisible story we had this human being that was going to take us into rooms that we would never otherwise get access to.</p><p>And so, our job as filmmakers was to follow that journey, and she was -- she allowed to -- there was never a moment when she shut us out or asked us to turn of the camera. And that was -- that's such a gift as a filmmaker.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Yes.</p><p>NOUJAIM: But, it's a -- she's led a complicated life. And we -- we were excited to jump off the cliff with her, but she's been in complicated situations and made complicated decisions.</p><p>AMER: And I think that it's never been more important than in these times, these polarized times, that we have stories that allow us to see how redemption is possible.</p><p>And what redemption looks like is not -- is -- in our context for this film is about how people from different walks of life get together to tackle a problem like this. Here we have a film a -- David Carroll, a professor who decides to say, I'm not going to wait for the Mueller Report to figure out what did or didn't happen.</p><p>I'm going to start asking questions and I'm going to ask a very simple quest of, can -- do I have the right to have my own data? Do I have the right know what you know about me and how I was or wasn't targeted? Right? And goes on this quest where he decides to hold power accountable and ends up suing Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>SREEVISAN: Let's take a look at a clip of a -- the other characters from David Carroll.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was teaching digital media and developing apps, so I knew that the data from our online activity wasn't just evaporating. And as I dug deeper, I realized these digital traces or ourselves are being into a trillion dollar a year industry.</p><p>[13:50:00]</p><p>We are now the commodity, but we were so in love with the gift of this free connectivity that no one bothered to read the terms and conditions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You know, what you might call surveillance capitalism, Silicon Valley might just say, this is just the cost of innovation. What is the danger, what is the threat, in that bigger picture, when our data is transacted?</p><p>NOUJAIM: Well, it's a bad deal. We've made a bad deal, right? I mean we think that this stuff is free, but yet - and we've never - yes, we've never paid anything to Facebook or Google, but at the same time, they're the most successful companies that exist today. But it goes back to the question of what is for sale, and it goes back to the question of consent and what are we consenting to.</p><p>We're just clicking (ph) those user agreements, right, without even reading them. We would never do that with a written contract, but we do this, you know, many times a day in order to make our lives a little bit easier. So in a way, we're all complicit, but in that we are becoming the commodity. And we have to ask ourselves how much ourselves is - should be for sale.</p><p>AMER: I think there's two things that, to me, help understand this conversation. You know, we - one is the word consent, right, which has never been more debated and redefined than - in today's society than now, right? And currently, the relationship with Silicon Valley, whereby, you know, you give up all your privacy, as the admission feeds (ph) the connection world, is a non-consensual relationship. It is not a relationship where the user fully understands what is happening to them. It is an exploitative relationship, and the sooner we understand that the better.</p><p>The engineers of the future would not have the Valley without the open society, and we have to ask them, are they committed to building a world that allows for ethics and innovation to work hand in hand, or do we just say that, you know, we have to only have technology and forget ethics? The problem with that, in my opinion, is that as important as technology has been to innovate and expand our capacity, we have always needed ethics to preserve our humanity.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: You're taking a look at this specific use case, because it's been publicized and we know about it. What about all the other companies that are trafficking in our data? What about the next election and the companies that are probably selling to campaigns right now?</p><p>NOUJAIM: Absolutely. 2020 is around the corner, and both sides of the aisle will be using this technology.</p><p>AMER: But I think the movie's really about whether we can have a free and fair election ever again, which I think is important. I think why that's particularly important to us, and maybe why the urgency in the film feels quite sharp, is because we have - we come from Egypt. We've seen that Democracy is not some god-given right as some people may think in this country.</p><p>Democracy is fragile, and democracy can be taken just as easily as it's available. And when it - when the - when the core of the Democratic process is under assault, it should not be a partisan issue. This should be a rallying cry for people from all sides of the ally, and proof of that actually is that privacy is not a partisan issue.</p><p>Privacy, time and time again, has support from both Republican and Democrat lawmakers. So I think we are in a moment of new awareness where people are asking more difficult questions, as you - and there's beginning to be an accountability movement.</p><p>And I think we as citizens have to now take the opportunity to demand a new social contract, but I think that social contract is not going to be between us and the government as it used to be. In this era that we live in, it'll be between us, the government and the tech platforms.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Karim Amer, Jehane Noujaim, thanks so much for joining.</p><p>NOUJAIM: Thank you so much.</p><p>AMER: Thank you so much for having us.</p><p>NOUJAIM: Thank you for having us.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>[13:55:00] AMANPOUR: An incredible warning and perhaps the idea for data rights, as human rights couldn't come at a more important time. That's it for us now. Remember, you can listen to our podcast at any time and see us online at amanpour.com, and you can follow me on Instagram and Twitter.

Next up we have American Axle -- the largest maker of auto axle and drive train components here in North America, with growth opportunities overseas and in the commercial vehicle market; that's our opinion. It also is directly benefiting from the recovery in North America and the strength in GM trucks for now, and redeploying capital to diversify the business and improve the balance sheet here in the near-term.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today we are very happy to have David Dauch, Chairman of the Board and CEO; and Chris May, Vice President and CFO. We're going to kick it off and go straight into Q&amp;A here. If anybody in the audience has questions along the way, please certainly let us know.</p><p>David, the biggest question that we get from investors right now, not just on American Axle but on the whole industry, is where do you think we are in the cycle? And then also maybe specifically for American Axle, how do you think about the upside potential, particularly on GM trucks with the cycle, and potentially how you prepare and set up for a downturn?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CEO, AMERICAN AXLE &amp; MANUFACTURING HOLDINGS, INC.: Well, I mean, I think from a cycle standpoint, we are nearing the top or nearing the peak of a cycle but I don't think it's going to drop any time soon. I think we have a strong year in front of us with respect to volumes not only here in North America but globally around the world as well. I think next year sets up -- it sets itself up to be another strong year with consumer confidence being where it is, with pent-up vehicle demand still out there, the average age of the vehicle being 11, 11.5 years of age at this point in time.</p><p>Clearly, the market is now saying, with fuel prices where they are, that trucks, SUVs, crossover vehicles and luxury passenger cars are what's popular and in demand right now. And that's right in the heart of our sweet spot as it relates to products we produce.</p><p>And then with respect to the second half of your question with regards to GM and their capacity, I mean, we've said all along their straight-time capacity is 1.2 million units. They ran at a clip of a little bit over 1.235 million units last year. They are running at that clip or even higher. IHS has moved it up to 1.265 million. So, we've also said that they have a flex capacity growth up to 1.4 million units, and we have the capacity in place to support that as well. So, if they schedule it, we will be able to build it. And we are prepared to support that.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: And on the downside, which we don't think is happening any time soon, but I mean, if you were to think about sort of a standard 20%, 25% downturn that would occur over about a five-year period, I mean, how do you think you would react to that in the North American business at this point?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Well, I mean, we've demonstrated our discipline back in 2008, 2009, when we went through the soup with everybody else, but we also demonstrated discipline from 2010 all the way through where we are today. And if the market should turn -- whether it's 10%, 20% or 30%, we are prepared to manage in that situation.</p><p>The big thing that we've done is we've really made a lot of our cost structure variable over the last several years, so we can take things out and adjust things to the new market demand if that demand happens to be lower or, in other cases, if it happens to increase. But we're prepared to support any downturn that may take place. And we've got a proven management team that's still in place that managed during the tough times and we will manage -- you know, we're managing through the good times right now. And if it goes the other way because of the cycle, then we will manage that accordingly.</p><p>CHRIS MAY, VP AND CFO, AMERICAN AXLE &amp; MANUFACTURING HOLDINGS, INC.: And we continue to work away at our fixed cross structure. Our interest is down 20% over the past couple of years, is another element. And I would also point your attention -- look at Brazil for example -- half the size of it was for us just a couple of years ago. And we continue to run profitable in our Brazilian operation. So we can accommodate these markets. We can flex our cost structure, as David mentioned, to deal with whoever faces our direction.</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: I mean, I think that's really been the strength of our organization, has been our operational excellence, and our ability to manage from a conservative standpoint financially but with discipline, and make sure that we don't put ourselves in harm's way. And even when we got in a tough situation, we avoided bankruptcy and we managed our way through that.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: And if you think about some of the stuff that's going on at GM specifically right now on the truck side, near-term, the inventory is fairly tight and arguably maybe too tight. Their logic is to remain fairly lean, so, God forbid, we actually go into a downturn very quickly. They're set up so they don't need to cut production dramatically.</p><p>What are you seeing from your side sort of in the channel? And how do you think about this truck inventory and the production schedules relative to sales? I mean, it just seems like they are running the business very conservatively and tightly right now. I mean, what are you seeing from your standpoint?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Well, I mean I think part of it is just the value chain that they are managing as well. Right? They've got -- like I said, the straight-time and the flex capacity in place at their facility. The question is, does the full supply base have that in place? We certainly do. But I think there may be some restrictions that they are managing their way through, which has maybe limited them in some cases.</p><p>They are also being very disciplined in regards to transactional prices and what they are going after. And clearly, supply and demand plays into that case. They've been disciplined with regards to the incentives. So I actually like how GM is managing their truck platform at this point in time.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: Great. And if we think about the diversification of business which is key to -- well, we think is key to the long-term success, I think you guys are onboard with that. I mean, where do you think you are in diversification away from GM? And then also diversification in segmentation? Because crossovers are clearly exploding here in North America but also in China, and probably will be around the world. And you know, sort of how you play in that product set, having opportunities that help with diversification?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Yes. Just starting first with the customer diversification, when we started the business in 1994, GM was 98.5% of our business and we were doing $1.4 billion in sales. Today, we're doing -- we've guided $4 billion in sales. And last year, GM represented, what, 60 --?</p><p>CHRIS MAY: 66%.</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: -- 66% of our business. If you factor in our joint venture, which is not a consolidated joint venture, it's 63%. And based on our book business, I mean, 60% of our backlog of new business today is non-GM business. We are going to see further concentricity reduction with GM while protecting our business with GM that way.</p><p>And our goal is, we see them in the 50% or less range in that 2018 -- 2020 period of time. And that doesn't contemplate anything that we might do from a strategic activity going forward.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: Got it. And if you look at China, right, and the growth in China particularly on the crossover side -- and I want to get back to crossovers as well -- I mean, how do you see the business growing in China in the near-term on the commercial vehicle side, because you have a lot of efforts going on there? Then also with -- on the light vehicle side?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Yes. You know, first, starting on the commercial vehicle side, we put a joint venture together with a firm by the name of JC -- they are a large truck manufacturer in China. We've seen that business double since we put that joint venture into place. And quite honestly, we see positive growth for that moving forward in the future as well on the truck side, as far as the medium and the heavier truck applications.</p><p>So that was a great partnership arrangement for us, and we are running that and managing it effectively. They are very pleased we've expanded that joint venture, which has been very positive for both organizations.</p><p>On the light side of things, I mean, we really hit the sweet spot with where we are with the luxury passenger car. We are making all the C/D class axles for Mercedes in China today. That just continues to boom and escalate; new capacity programs going in to support that. We are also doing a significant amount of crossover vehicle work over there, because five-seat and seven-seat vehicle applications are exploding in China right now in a positive way, which we are right, again, in the sweet spot.</p><p>So, we have incremental capacity that we are actually putting in place to support the growth that's not only there today, but also what was forecasted in the future. So, we see crossovers, not only just in China but globally around the world, as being a big market and a big segment for us to support.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: And can you talk a little bit -- just a little bit about the technology on crossovers? Because I think a lot of people think about American Axle as axles and driveshafts. I mean, can you just talk a little bit about the technology and the solutions you are bringing to all-wheel-drive on crossovers?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Yes. We've got a plethora of product opportunities within the all-wheel-drive category. We have the conventional all-wheel-drive capability that's there. Unfortunately, the conventional all-wheel-drive capability adds mass and has degradation of fuel economy in that category.</p><p>And that's why I instructed the organization that I wanted a new technology that was leapfrogged to our competition; we came up with the disconnecting all-wheel-drive, which we call EcoTrac in the marketplace. We were the first ones to bring that to market.</p><p>It's much lighter than the conventional system. At the same time, the disconnected all-wheel-drive system allows the system to disengage when it's not needed and engage where the driver doesn't have to do anything. It does it because of our proprietary software controls capability. And you can get back about two-thirds to three-quarters of the fuel economy reduction that you would see because of the parasitic losses that exists with the conventional system.</p><p>We are actually working on Gen 2 designs for the popular EcoTrac today that will allow us to get 90% -- the 90-plus-percent back of that fuel economy loss. So, that's positive. And that's why you are seeing a tremendous shift in the marketplace towards disconnecting all-wheel-drives over conventional all-wheel-drive systems.</p><p>The other big thing that we're working on, the next generation of product beyond that, is all of our e-AAM activity, which is the hybridization and electrification of the E differential, but also the system in its entirety. And we just finished winter testing in our Northern Michigan facility as well as over in Sweden. We have a whole host of customers over there; rave reviews for our technology ranging from high-end luxury OEMs to international-based emerging market-type countries that are interested in electrification.</p><p>And our product portfolio is performing very well. So, we are now starting to see a lot more activity in regards to the quotation activity. Again, with where government regulation is with CAFE and CO2 emissions, each of the OEMs are going to have to elevate their game from a fuel economy standpoint. And I'm clear -- it's very clear to me that electrification is a part -- a growing part of their strategy as we move forward.</p><p>CHRIS MAY: And you clearly see the power of that in our topline revenue today, as well as in our backlog. For example, on the EcoTrac that David mentioned, zero dollars of revenue for us just a couple of years ago. When we complete our launch of our backlog, by 2018, it will be $600 million of revenue. So, it's a very powerful technology we've been able to leverage in the marketplace.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: David, you guys have always been a top-quality producer. As OEMs feel more pressure to lightweight their vehicles, get better fuel economy, are there different materials that you guys have investigated to use for your product? I mean, aluminum being one of them; I know you guys have entry into that. Just give us some color like what the future could look like for some of the lightweighting options.</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Yes, certainly. I mean, clearly, we are working with the current steel producers today to come up with various grades of material that still give us the PowerDense capabilities that we look for, but in a lighter capacity. So I'll start with some of the current materials that are available to us today.</p><p>Aluminum is already a big part of the marketplace today and only a growing part of the marketplace in the future. Many of our passenger car and our crossover vehicle applications, I'd say the majority -- 90-plus-percent are already aluminum-based. Our front axles for our truck applications, most of them are aluminum-based, although we do have some cast iron. The majority of our beam axle business, however, is still cast iron.</p><p>And we have made aluminum axles in the past. Based on customer requirements, we have the know-how, the capability, the NVH performance; we are probably the leader in that category. It's just a matter of what are the customer needs and the specific needs, and what are they willing to pay. Because aluminum tends to be a little bit more expensive than the cast iron.</p><p>But again, there's significant weight advantages, so it depends on if the vehicle has a weight issue or not, and then what type of credits are associated with that as it relates to cost per pound savings that are realized. But -- so we're doing a lot not only in the aluminum side; we are actually vertically integrated, in some cases, and are looking to possibly do more in that respect.</p><p>We have supplier partners around the world on the aluminum side. What it really allows us to do is design a smaller axle, a smaller power takeoff unit, smaller vehicle in a PowerDensity standpoint that still delivers the horsepower and the torque that the vehicle needs and the OEMs are asking for. So it -- we feel we are on the cutting edge in regards to some of the materials management things as well as lubricity, friction, parasitic losses, bearing applications, to allow us to still provide industry-leading product when it comes to fuel efficiency and lightweight.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: That's helpful. Thank you. As far as the diversification, there's another way to get there other than organically, and it's to do either an acquisition or M&amp;A or combination in some form. I mean, how are you guys thinking about that and exploring that, thinking about sort of the context of the balance sheet and the context of the business?</p><p>There's an idea that, even though your stock is wildly depressed and totally undervalued, at least in our opinion, that using stock would be a tough thing to do right now. But if you are going after another company that might -- or combining with another company that might be equally as depressed, there might be an opportunity to do a stock deal. I mean, just how do you sort of strategically think about this? And from a balance sheet, how do you kind of finagle it at this point?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Yes, let me first just come back to the priorities that we've really set from a capital-U standpoint going forward and just to level-set for everybody in the room, is our first priority was organic growth. We've demonstrated an ability to do that in a profitable way for the last 20 years, but especially the last five years.</p><p>The other was debt management. We clearly improved our leverage situation. We are under 2 times levered; we finished at 1.9 at the end of last year. We are still very focused on improving our balance sheet, strengthening our balance sheet going forward. Historically, we ran our business in that 1.5 times range for the most part, so we are still desirous of trying to get to that level.</p><p>But now, to your point, with our balance sheet being where it is, with our liquidity being where it is, with our operations performing the way they are, with the cash being generated from that business, it now opens up the opportunity for us to look at strategic activities and also look at shareholder-friendly activities.</p><p>So, we are going to balance those four things with respect to what we are trying to do and the use of our cash flow going forward. From a strategic standpoint, clearly we are active in that area before that playbook was closed for us. We're looking at what can we do there, especially in the area of technology advancement. Because technology is a differentiator and it sells. We are looking at geographic diversification, especially Europe and Asia, because we have a smaller concentricity of our business there today, and we see a growing opportunity there.</p><p>I also already mentioned the vertical integration side of things. We'll look at what we can do in that respect. And we want to stick to our knitting, especially if there's opportunities out there to consolidate the space we operate in today with driveline, drivetrain, and metal form; we'll look at that. But we also are looking into the electronics and the mechatronic side of our business, because there's more and more demand for that on our current products, let alone what the megatrends are with connectivity and electrification and autonomous vehicles in the future.</p><p>So, that kind of gives you an idea where we are looking and then how we are prioritizing things from a strategic standpoint. And from a balance sheet standpoint, if it makes sense to use stock or equity or raise equity, we'll look at that. And we will be disciplined just like we have in everything else we've done in managing our business.</p><p>And if it presents itself as the right opportunity that's good for us, then we'll look at it. If not, then we'll pursue other means and paths. But just rest assured we'll be very disciplined and not put ourselves in a position where we overleverage our business when we've worked too hard to get to where we are at today.</p><p>CHRIS MAY: For five years, we've been building to have this flexibility. We've achieved that. We are certainly proud of that fact. But prudence would certainly evaluate in through our processes as we look at any M&amp;A activity, for sure.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: Great. Do we have any questions in the audience? I've got a bunch more, so -- okay. Well, one of the things that we've heard from GM as they are looking at the truck program, the next generation truck program, is that they are insourcing 20%, 30% of the program on axles.</p><p>Do you think that's something they are actually going to execute and allocate and build to capacity? Or maybe they award that to another supplier? That's the first step. And then second step is we think about the gradation of that lower revenue. When does that actually come in? And does that come in all at once? Or is this sort of a multiyear wind-down and there's still a long tail of opportunity to backfill?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Yes, I mean, the first thing -- I don't really want to comment -- GM has made a decision; we have commented on that with respect to we're going to maintain 75% of the business that we enjoy today. They are going to make a sourcing decision on the -- other 25% on the light-duty side of the business.</p><p>So, they really need to tell you what they are going to do in that area. All I can say is that we are very proud to partner with them going forward not for one generation but two generations of product. We are the industry leader when it comes to truck axles from a fuel efficiently standpoint, lightweighting overall performance standpoint. They've clearly made a strategic decision from a commodity management standpoint; maybe from a product know-how standpoint, because they had so much reliance and dependence on American Axle that they felt that they needed to make a change.</p><p>I didn't like it; I still don't like it today. I don't think it's the right decision on their behalf, especially when you look at the requirements that are out there with respect to autonomous vehicles, connectivity and electrification, which is where I think most of the OEMs are going to be spending their money. But at the same time, that decision has been made.</p><p>And therefore, I'm not going to cry about it. We're just going to pick up ourselves and carry forward. And there's other customers out there that can leverage that capacity, leverage our know-how and our capability. But again, very proud and pleased with the relationship we have with GM. But ultimately, they made a decision that, unfortunately, negatively -- will negatively impact going forward.</p><p>To your second part of your question, it starts impacting us in the 2018 calendar-year period of time. We will feel more effect in the 2019 period of time. We should feel the full effect of their sourcing decision by the 2020 period of time. But it also gives us anywhere between three to five years to offset that, based on other new business that we are quoting on and working on with non-GM customers today. And we are highly confident that we can replace that business either organically and/or strategically, based on the things we just talked about earlier.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: And the margin return profile of the business that you're replacing it with, and as you diversify -- how do you think about that? I mean, in general, it seems hard to replace a program of this size and scale with the same margins. But if you could redeploy capital, the returns may be similar or may be potentially better, depending on what kind of global programs you ultimately win. How do you think of sort of the replacement business that could backfill for that?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Yes. What we've said all along is that we enjoy 30-plus-percent contribution margins in regards to the full-size truck business that we enjoy today. As we're bringing on new business -- we are bringing that in, in the 20% -- 25% range. So we're naturally going to see some degradation in regards to our profitability from an overall margin standpoint to begin with.</p><p>You touched on the fact -- I mean, the other thing is our cost structure is improving along the way. At the same time, we are generating significant cash. We are able to redeploy a lot of those assets and avoid future CapEx requirements going forward. So, we still feel that we are going to have a very meaningful and very profitable business going forward. And as you know right now, we are performing at the high end of the peer group with respect to margin performance and against our direct competitors, much higher than where they are at this point in time.</p><p>CHRIS MAY: And that lower capital intensity that we can leverage, when we are bidding for new business in that time period, will certainly improve our financial profile, but also allow us to be more competitive in our bids, where we haven't had that luxury before and we were still winning business in the past. So this is kind of a double win for us as it relates to that concept.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: I had a follow-up question on China and India.</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Sure.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: These are huge markets, and I think the investors that follow those sectors are pretty familiar with the competition on the OEM side and what OEMs are doing building vehicles there. But they are a little less, I think, knowledgeable on how the supplier universe works in those areas.</p><p>With the huge growth we are seeing in those two markets, what are some of the opportunities or challenges? Are OEMs vertically integrating axle product? Or are they looking for outside help? Because it seems like it's a huge untapped area.</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: In India and China specifically?</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: Yes.</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Well, it's very clear in China that the Western OEMs are looking to put axle production on the outside. Mercedes is a prime example, or Daimler. We are doing their C/D class axles for them in China, as I mentioned earlier. A lot of the Western OEMs that are coming to China -- again, putting their business on the outside. We are participating in many programs with respect to that.</p><p>Some of the domestic OEMs within China -- some have invested in axles. They don't have the capability that we have from a technology standpoint, so they are living with inferior designs. But at the same time, it's a matter of how you balance -- balancing cost versus technology, and how the market is shifting that more from a cost-based market more towards a technology-based market.</p><p>India is still a cost-based market. Many OEMs are doing axles in-house, but we've conquested business from Tata. So Tata has sourced work with us. Ashok Leyland has sourced work with us. Daimler on the truck side -- commercial truck side, has sourced work with us. Isuzu has sourced work with us. So there's a lot of work that's going to the outside as well in India. Because again, the capital demands that they have on their own business, and yet there's reputable suppliers, like American Axle, that can provide good product on time every time for them.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: Yes. So it's evolution of cost versus the content and quality?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Yes. Yes.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: And I have one question on the tech center. How's that going? What's the development -- what are the developments there? What's the game plan? I mean, this is sort of a whole new animal for you guys and actually for a lot of suppliers to put together a big tech center like this to develop technology as well as showcase it. I was just curious if you could talk about that.</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Yes. And what John is referring to is we made a commitment and publicly announced we are building an advanced technology development center in our Detroit campus. It's a 300,000 square foot facility that's going to be dedicated to working on all of our advanced technology from a product processing systems capability; a $20-million-plus investment.</p><p>We've already got 150 people already in the facility today, and that will only grow as we go forward. We're going to be doing all of our benchmarking of our competitive products, you know, for current business today. At the same time, we are proving out all of our products, so that when they do go to our facilities for production, we are not experiencing any launch issues. So we are much more disciplined from an operational standpoint that way.</p><p>We are also putting in things from a 3-D manufacturing standpoint. We are looking at material labs, gear labs, other things that, again, will leverage the technology that's available in the marketplace today that maybe wasn't there in the past or even there today, but in the future, with what can be done with the cloud, what can be done with some of the technology and the connectivity of machines-to-machines, and other things.</p><p>So I'm very, very excited about where we are today. At the same time, we are setting up a customer showcase place where we can demonstrate all of our technology to them on our current business as well as future technology that we are bringing out. And it's a three-year evolution. We are in the 1 1/2 years; we're halfway through it right now. So by the end of next year, we should be in great shape.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: Great. And then I've got -- I'm going to keep going. I mean, as you look at your cost base as it exists right now, I mean, you guys spearheaded some of the moves -- or on the earlier curve, I should say -- necessarily of moving some of your manufacturing base and labor to Mexico. Obviously a lot of your labor has moved to Eastern Europe.</p><p>Is there more for you to do in that direction as far as working on your cost base? Really what do you think that does for your cost or ongoing cost structure and your flexibility, and your ability to service your clients or your customers?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: I think we are very well-positioned today. Our business was predominantly in the Midwest in the past before. We had an OEM cost structure based on the way the business was bought and sold back in 1994. I think most of the people that have followed American Axle recognize that we had very difficult labor negotiations in 2008 with the UAW, and endured an 87-day work stoppage. But we did that because we didn't have a sustainable cost structure going forward, and we were carrying an OEM cost structure, not a Tier 1 automotive supplier.</p><p>Because of that strike, it resulted in incremental capacity being put in Mexico. So some of that work stayed in Mexico; did not come back. Most of our initiative in Mexico, most of our initiatives around the world, isn't to ship product back to the US. It's really to support the local markets for themselves.</p><p>But because of the strike situation, we had to not only protect ourselves, we had to protect our customers. And that's why some of the capacity was put into place in Mexico. We still have large axle operation in our Three Rivers, Michigan facility. We have good labor harmony there now, so that's very positive for us.</p><p>We've invested $150 million in taking the plant from 400 associates to 1,800 associates. So, the relationships there -- and it's got our latest technology with respect to disconnecting all-wheel-drive. So we don't see a lot more activity that we need to do from a geographic footprint standpoint. During the tough times of 2008, 2009, 2010, even during those tough times, we made strategic decision to invest in rounding out our global footprint.</p><p>And now we are in the process of filling up that global footprint, and -- but we are in a very cost-competitive situation, like you said, in Eastern Europe, in China, in India, in Brazil and Thailand, based on where the market is for us, and being in close proximity to our customer.</p><p>So we are not in Russia today; don't have any big plans to go there. We are evaluating South Africa as it relates to the market, but we will only go there if the right book of business prevents itself. Other than that, we're going to leverage the installed facilities and capacities that we have in place today.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: Over in raw materials, the steel prices have certainly been volatile and I know you probably have some sort of long-term contracts, but has that continued to be a tailwind? How do you kind of look at the next few years on the commodity front?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: No, I mean -- we're the largest forger in North America and one of the top forgers in the world. We are the largest buyer of what we call SBQ or Special Bar Quality steel. So we don't buy flat steel; we buy bar steel for our forging applications. So we have a lot of might and clout with the steel mills because of the buying -- what we are buying today.</p><p>But we also have outstanding relationships with our supplier partners. And we do have multiyear contracts. We have good visibility in regards to what our pricing is going to be. And because of our buying power and economy of scales, it benefits us, which helps our competitiveness in our metal form business, and not to mention our driveline business as well.</p><p>We don't see a lot of instability in the materials markets today or going forward. And at the same time, as we are globalizing our business, we are bringing new suppliers in and new markets that are more cost-competitive in some cases. At the same time, we are partnering with many of our suppliers to really -- that have the depth and the breadth and the financial wherewithal to really support us on a global basis and locate close to our facilities, so we can deliver things on a landed cost basis competitively.</p><p>CHRIS MAY: Right. Close.</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: I don't know if, Chris, anything you want to add?</p><p>CHRIS MAY: Yes. No, and just also I would remind you, keep in mind as it relates to some of the more highly variable elements of our material buys that are tied to indices, about 80% to 90% of those are passed through to the customer, whether in the form of a benefit or an increase. So, certainly in periods of declining prices, we get a select benefit, and in periods where the prices are rising, there is a slight decrement. But as you know, it's pretty stable as it looks right now.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: I just have one last question on labor. I mean, there's been a lot of press about -- I think it's Lear and Matt Simoncini who's been pushing this a little bit -- of trying to work with or publicize the fact that if there was cost-effective labor in the Detroit area, they would be willing to put investments in place and build a base of business there.</p><p>I think they are working on some facility downtown. They're starting to ramp up. Would you ever consider moving -- presuming it's cost-effective -- moving some of that capacity back north or putting more capital in place if you had a more friendly labor environment in Michigan or in the Detroit area? Or at this point, is everything kind of set the way it's set, and you would only do that to follow the customers, at this point?</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: No, to answer -- the short answer to your question is if the right opportunity presented itself to put the business back in Detroit, we would do that. Matt is working on some things, but his thought process is more of how can he bring work out of Mexico and bring it back? And he needs a certain competitive labor structure in order to do that. It's very hard to compare the US labor structure to the Mexican labor structure.</p><p>And what he's asking from the UAW -- I don't know is -- if it's really realistic. Okay? Otherwise you are going to have a lot of transition in that facility. I applaud his efforts. Matt and I are working on a Detroit task force team to bring jobs. We are probably the two suppliers that are spearheading and driving -- trying to bring jobs back to Detroit because of our commitment to Detroit.</p><p>On the other hand, as I said, we have a very good working relationship today with the UAW. We have worked through a difficult time in 2008 but very good working relationship with them. We've identified what we think is the right competitive cost structure to compete in Detroit. And it's -- you just can't have an entitlement mentality. And that's what existed in the past before.</p><p>We've explained to them what market competitive prices are for a Tier 1 automotive supplier in the driveline space, both wages and benefits. We can cut it any way, but it can't exceed a certain level in order to be competitive. So, I'm not looking at really moving the capacity and bringing it back from Mexico as much as I'm looking at making incremental investments if it made business sense, based on new business that's presented itself, because of the increased demand for truck capacity right now and crossover vehicle capacity, and possibly an electrification capacity in the future.</p><p>JOHN MURPHY: Great. And with that, I think we are running light on time. So we really appreciate you guys coming. It's great to have you here and good luck with the rest of the presentation.</p><p>DAVID DAUCH: Thanks, John.

But recent revelations that Zoom closed American accounts on demands from Beijing point to a worrying trend of American companies muting basic rights to accommodate autocrats abroad. When companies ride roughshod over American values overseas, their actions have tangible negative implications for American consumers at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month the video calling platform Zoom confirmed that it had suspended or terminated several accounts used to host public vigils for the Tiananmen Square massacre at the request of the Chinese government. Two of the now-reinstated accounts were based in the US, while another was based in Hong Kong. </p><p>Following public outcry, Zoom says it will unveil more sophisticated tools to only target accounts that are actually based in mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Zoom is not the only American company to grapple with balancing the economic opportunity of the Chinese market with Beijing\u2019s aversion to freedom of speech and privacy. Following a massive Chinese-based hacking attack in 2010 and a tense relationship with Beijing, Google began winding down its operations in the People\u2019s Republic. But by 2018 it was revealed that Google was developing a search engine that would comply with China\u2019s censorship demands, dubbed Project Dragonfly. The decision was met with swift backlash from rights advocates and Google\u2019s own employees, forcing the company to publicly abandon the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from the world of Big Tech, even the NBA has come under immense pressure to censor comments that the Chinese Communist Party dislikes. In October 2019, Houston Rockets Manager Daryl Morey tweeted an image that read, \u2018Stand for Freedom Stand with Hong Kong,\u2019 in support of then-ongoing protests. While the NBA quickly distanced itself from the comments, that move garnered backlash from politicians on both sides of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBA commissioner Adam Silver later clarified that the NBA would not regulate what players, employees, or owners would say. But almost all of the NBA\u2019s local Chinese sponsors suspended their partnerships with the league, and Lakers star LeBron James denounced Morey, saying that \u201che wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When American companies acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s crackdown on rights, their actions have tangible ripple effects for American consumers. Zoom\u2019s new censorship feature will only suspend Chinese accounts\u2014but it will also limit Americans\u2019 abilities to communicate with foreign counterparts in mainland China. Similarly, Beijing\u2019s pressure on sports figures risks reshaping what American players and managers will say to American fans on American soil. In an international marketplace, the effects of these censorship efforts do not stop at American borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not a new idea that companies shouldn\u2019t check their American values at the door when they operate abroad. The Kimberley Process and the Clean Diamond Trade Act (2003), for example, seek to stop blood diamonds from making their way into the American market. Similarly, the Treasury Department\u2019s expansive sanctions program limits the ability of American companies to do business with state-sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran. These programs recognize that the line between the American and international economy is thin, and American consumers have an interest in protecting basic rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a globalized world, American companies will continue to face the challenge of balancing their own values with the demands of unscrupulous actors abroad. But yielding to crackdowns on basic rights like freedom of speech and privacy abroad also effects American consumers. As the costs associated with appeasing the Chinese Communist Party become increasingly apparent, American businesses should consider hanging up on their demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=\"related_post_title\"&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"related_post wp_rp\"&gt;&lt;li data-position=\"0\" data-poid=\"in-13613\" data-post-type=\"none\" &gt;Inside Sources: Federal Ban on Huawei Protects Both National Security and Consumers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-position=\"1\" data-poid=\"in-12274\" data-post-type=\"none\" &gt;China\u2019s Plague of Cyber Breaches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-position=\"2\" data-poid=\"in-13245\" data-post-type=\"none\" &gt;China Plays the Rare Earth Card, Again&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-position=\"3\" data-poid=\"in-13008\" data-post-type=\"none\" &gt;China\u2019s Internet Propaganda Seeks to Manage U.S. Consumer Perceptions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-position=\"4\" data-poid=\"in-12246\" data-post-type=\"none\" &gt;Huawei and Its Reputational Challenges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-position=\"5\" data-poid=\"in-14528\" data-post-type=\"none\" &gt;Emergency Small Business Loans are Leaving Out Local Media Outlets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

So hang in there with us. Have a good weekend. We'll see you then.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Say what you want about the 2020 presidential race, it's not what they used to call a managerial election. It's not a contest to determine which branch of the establishment gets a turn of the wheel. This isn't a Clinton-Dole '96 kind of race where you're pretty sure that no matter who wins, things aren't really going to change very much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year, the one thing you can be certain of is that things could be very different when it's over. The issues at stake are bigger than just the economy or even our foreign policy commitments. 2020 is about the broadest possible questions. What kind of country should we have? Who should live here? What will America look like 50 years from now?</p><p>There are a lot of possible answers to those questions, but leading Democrats appear to have settled on their position. America, they're telling us should be a lot more like California.</p><p>Listen to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg explain his vision for the country he is hoping to lead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think that California can serve as a great example for the rest of this country. You have led the way on climate change, on fighting gun violence and on criminal justice, and you have as importantly, opened immigrants with open arms.</p><p>California is part of this country that is something the rest of the country looks up to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So Michael Bloomberg graduated from high school, almost 60 years ago. And at that time, a lot of what he just said was true. The rest of the country really did look up to California. Millions of Americans moved to California in search of a better life. It had the nation's best public schools, you know, a world class universities that essentially were free.</p><p>Graduates from those universities created Silicon Valley, among other things, the birthplace of the Digital Age. Compared to the rest of America, poverty in California then was low, and opportunity was virtually unlimited.</p><p>The people who moved here in 1960 when Bloomberg graduated high school found their American dream.</p><p>But things have changed. Now, the children and grandchildren of those people are fleeing California.</p><p>We spent the last week here in Los Angeles for the show, and in some ways, it's still a very beautiful place. The western parts of the city are some of the richest neighborhoods in the world. You'd want to live there. They're immaculate, nice people.</p><p>But huge swaths of modern Los Angeles shock the conscience of anyone who drives by. Filth and disorder and clusters of homeless addicts. Tent cities continue for block after block. This is footage from one of our producers, Charlie Cougar, shot yesterday.</p><p>California has 12 percent of the world's population, but it has a quarter of this country's homeless. Adjusted for the cost of living, California has the highest poverty rate of any state in America. Nearly a quarter of its people are poor. Why?</p><p>Well, there are a lot of reasons, but here are some. The state has the most expensive housing in the continental United States. It has the most expensive gasoline, thanks to the taxes. The free world class universities, those are long gone.</p><p>The University of California system has some of the highest in-state tuition rates in the country. As we chronicled last week in our series, \"American Dystopia,\" no city more accurately represents the implosion of California than San Francisco.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get the [bleep] out of here.

I'll [bleep] kill you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm scared for my safety.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You never know what's coming around the corner.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, film me, mother [bleep].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bit into my arm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I live a block away. [Bleep] you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This city is messed up. It is very messed up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not forcing him to move, but I talk to him and encourage him to get to move.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think you'll be homeless for the rest of your life?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You put them out and in what state?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's messed up, really messed up. That's right. And so finally normal people are leaving California. For decades, the state led the nation in attracting migrants from other states. Now, the flow has reversed.</p><p>Every year, the number of people leaving California for other places exceeds the number of people moving in by more than a hundred thousand. If it weren't for the constant stream of immigrants from abroad, California's population would be falling and fast.</p><p>The middle class utopia of old has evaporated. The state is in crisis. Now, that's obvious to everyone who lives here, certainly, but not to the people who run California.</p><p>Instead of fixing the problems that are forcing people to flee, politicians here have spent the last few years on policies that are frivolous and counterproductive: Banning plastic straws, requiring background checks to buy shotgun shells, legalizing the intentional transmission of HIV.</p><p>Governor Gavin Newsom's most recent budget proposes $80 million in additional funding to provide free healthcare for illegal immigrant seniors. Who wants that?</p><p>This is the state the Democrats are calling the model for America. The state they want your state to be more like, at least you know what the election is about.</p><p>Ethan Bearman is a California radio host. He joins us tonight. Ethan, thanks so much for coming on. It's great to be back in the state where I'm from. It's beautiful. The rich areas are nicer than ever.</p><p>But in the last four nights, I've had four dinners and every person has said I love California and I'm preparing to leave because it's falling apart. How can this be a model that Democrats point to?</p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN, RADIO HOST: Well, it's still the fifth biggest economy in the entire world. We have a strong economic engine. We have Hollywood. We have Silicon Valley. We grow a third of the food for the entire United States. There are huge opportunities.</p><p>One out of seven jobs created during the Trump tenure were actually created here in California even though we're only one eighth the population, so there's a lot still happening here.</p><p>We have a brand new governor who is finally, finally taking bold action on the two biggest issues that everything relates back to that you are talking about: Housing and homelessness. And he is finally going to take a strong lead on that.</p><p>CARLSON: You know, he said he was going to take a strong lead on it when he was the Mayor of San Francisco, and he did absolutely nothing, and in fact, it got even worse. And that's been true of the past five mayors of San Francisco, the past three governors of the state. It is a one-party state. The State Senate has been controlled by Democrats for 50 years.</p><p>There hasn't been a Republican mayor of San Francisco in 56 years. So this is a Democratic problem. And it's getting worse, not better. I don't know why nationally, Democrats aren't ashamed of it.</p><p>BEARMAN: Well, here's the issue. So while you're right in terms of those data points, we've had Republican governors through that whole process. But the issue with the housing problem which is a core issue that's happening here, we're short three and a half million units of housing. That's why it's so expensive, simple supply and demand.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BEARMAN: If you're short that many.</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>BEARMAN: And it's been a combination of people on the left and the right at the local level, at the county level, at the state level. Nimbies who say I don't want this environmentalist on the left, as well, absolutely, who say we have to be careful of how we build. It's expensive. We need to streamline that process. We have SB-50 that's happening in the legislature right now.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, can I just ask a question that I've been wondering about a week -- why is no one pointing to the cause of the overcrowding, which is immigration? The state is too crowded. You can't get anywhere.</p><p>The infrastructure is clogged, it's choked and that's because there are too many people and so the very people who say we're going to fix the housing problem are saying, we're going to invite in millions of new people and give them free healthcare. Is there -- I mean, has logic been suspended, or am I missing something?</p><p>BEARMAN: I don't think that people are inviting millions of people to California.</p><p>CARLSON: By offering free healthcare to illegal aliens?</p><p>BEARMAN: I don't believe that invites people whatsoever.</p><p>CARLSON: Are you being serious?</p><p>BEARMAN: Yes, absolutely. We've talked about this before. If I have kids and I'm living in a country in Central America and a gang threatens to kill them if I don't do their bidding in the cartels, I'm going to flee as well.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, wait a second. If you're walking down the street and you -- and you're not that hungry and you pass a restaurant that says free pizza. Would you go in? Of course, you would. Because there's free pizza.</p><p>BEARMAN: I like pizza.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. Who doesn't? I do, too, as you can tell. So if you say to the rest of the world, your single biggest problem is healthcare. We're going to give it to you for free and not kick you out. Why wouldn't you be invited by that?</p><p>BEARMAN: Because these people are already here. They're already our neighbors. They're part of our communities. They're already going to emergency rooms, which is far more expensive than preventative care.</p><p>CARLSON: But wait, wait, wait a second. You've got -- we just read you the numbers. You've got thousands of native-born Californians leaving every year primarily for Texas, but also Idaho and the contiguous states -- Oregon, Arizona. Why wouldn't you be worried about them?</p><p>BEARMAN: Oh, we are worried about them.</p><p>CARLSON: Really? Because I don't see the governor doing anything about their flight.</p><p>BEARMAN: And that's what goes back to the things like SB-50, to work on the housing issue. We have local cities, Republican-leaning cities who refuse to build housing, and when that is -- what's happening is that's what's killing the supply and the demand.</p><p>CARLSON: So the homelessness in the state which is controlled wholly by the Democratic Party, they've got a super majority in the legislature, you're telling me with a straight face is being caused by Republicans. Is that what you're saying?</p><p>BEARMAN: No, I am saying that it is definitely being contributed to. That's not exclusively a Democratic issue. But what is --</p><p>CARLSON: Will you concede that if you have a lot more people in a confined area, it's more crowded, there's more traffic and the housing is more expensive.</p><p>BEARMAN: As long as people are having more than two kids, that is going to be the case.</p><p>CARLSON: No, actually native born people in California are leaving. It's a hundred percent an immigration problem. Will you at least concede that inviting people from other countries, I'm sure they're all great people, it doesn't matter, makes the state poorer and more crowded? I mean, what else has happened?</p><p>BEARMAN: Well, I don't fully agree with that either. It depends on who the immigrants are and where they're coming from. We know that we have immigrants coming from wealthy European nations.</p><p>CARLSON: Absolutely. And I'm not -- this is not about ethnicity. It's about numbers. The state is too crowded, will you concede to that or no?</p><p>BEARMAN: So I don't. I don't. I don't agree with that. And the reason why is because we can address that, we can build housing. We do have processes in place that --</p><p>CARLSON: We could make it Hong Kong. Why would we want to do that?</p><p>BEARMAN: Or Singapore, but why not? Why not have more people? People are continuing -- as long as people have kids and our entire economy is based on growth which in the United States it is, otherwise, our system starts collapsing if we're not growing. Look at what happened with Japan.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BEARMAN: Then we need to build --</p><p>CARLSON: Right. I get it. That's just not actually working. I mean, it's one of those theories that at the Chicago School they tell us is true, but it turns out isn't. Ethan, great to see you.</p><p>BEARMAN: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Los Angeles' homeless population is estimated at 59,000 people. So if all of those got together and became a city, they'd rank as the 31st of LA counties 88 cities. If you move them to Vermont, they'd be the largest city in the state, just the homeless, just here.</p><p>The surging homeless population in LA combined with the toleration of garbage and feces and used needles they produce is becoming an absolute health hazard, for real, not a talking point.</p><p>Last year, the city suffered outbreak of typhus, thanks for the surging rat population feasting on garbage on city streets. Last year, we profiled a victim of that on the show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But far away from Skid Row, through rats and fleas, typhus traveled through the streets and the Deputy City Attorney who works way up on the sixth floor at City Hall got infected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH GREENWOOD, DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY: I felt like I was going to die.</p><p>The homeless population has moved closer and closer. They surround the building. So as folks walk to work and back, they're walking through rotting food, raw sewage.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it's not the medieval period. It's just a one party state. Dr. Drew Pinsky hosts \"The Dr. Drew Podcast.\" He joins us tonight. Doctor, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>DR. DREW PINSKY, HOST, \"THE DR. DREW PODCAST\": Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Typhus?</p><p>PINSKY: Typhus, my own home became overrun with rats, and when I saw that I thought, oh, we're going to have a typhus outbreak. I practice Medicine against the foothills here long enough to know that's what coming.</p><p>What scares me is they've done nothing to reduce the rodent population. And what is endemic in this area after typhus, is something called Yersinia. You may know it as plague. So I'm worried that we're going to have that next.</p><p>The city you talked about, 60,000 people on the streets defecating, feces flowing into the LA River bypassing sewage treatment, a city the size almost of Pasadena is bypassing sewage treatment. We're having mammalian -- sea mammal die off, we're worried about turtled straws. It's unbelievable.</p><p>CARLSON: So why isn't the -- and as somebody who cares about --</p><p>PINSKY: Where are the environmentalists? Where are they? I need them.</p><p>CARLSON: You know that's it. That's it right there. Where are they?</p><p>PINSKY: Where are they? I don't understand it. We are literally -- we have seen bird and sea mammal die off. We have 60,000 people's excrement going directly to the ocean. I can understand it. We have such a massive problem here.</p><p>Listen, the other thing you were talking about, I've got so much to say, I'm sorry, Tucker, I'm having like a, you know, a rush of ideas.</p><p>CARLSON: You've been here all your life.</p><p>PINSKY: And I am upset about it. You mentioned the undocumented immigrants that are here. We've absorbed one million conservatively in Los Angeles, one million undocumented immigrants. Where's the housing problem?</p><p>They got here with without a job, without money, without a family, without a passport. They find a place to live. Where's the housing problem?</p><p>CARLSON: Can I just pause and say, as you drive around Los Angeles you don't ever see. I've just noticed this, any Mexican immigrants almost. I haven't seen a single one.</p><p>PINSKY: But you will. But they are in certain areas, but they're not on the street. They're not homeless. The homeless is the mentally ill and until they start talking about that, this is not going to get better.</p><p>Gavin Newsom, who is now going to --</p><p>CARLSON: So that's the core of the problem.</p><p>PINSKY: That is the core of the problem. What's remaining on the street, so they're chronically homeless, and that is due to addiction and mental illness. Look, all of those people you put in that video, they're not going to get better when you put them in a housing. They're going to continue to deteriorate.</p><p>Gavin Newsom is going to put up -- sprung tents that I've been asking for, for a long time. I'm grateful that he is going to do that. There are no laws that allow us to get these people and put them in those tents.</p><p>In fact, the laws prevent us from even approaching these people. That's why you saw law enforcement saying, well, I'm encouraging them with the law, but I can't really do anything. The laws prevent us from treating the mental illness.</p><p>CARLSON: So it sounds like we're missing the point completely.</p><p>PINSKY: Completely. The problem is the mental illness and the need to take resistant patients which is what we have in the street. I've been working in a psychiatric hospital for over 30 years. I know what these patients are. I see them. I know exactly what's going on. I know exactly what we can do and I know they will thrive in treatment and they will look back and they will be pissed. They'll be pissed the people let them deteriorate on the street.</p><p>Weirdly, similar symptoms in the setting of dementia, if we don't rush in and treat that we're considered inhuman. That's a progressive illness that has no treatment. Schizophrenia, bipolar addiction, fatal illnesses, that if you let go untreated long enough, they are irretrievable. But early, you can change the course of the illness.</p><p>We're not doing it. And we're murdering people as a result. Three a day are dying in the streets of Los Angeles. Three a day.</p><p>So my question and I'll ask this of your audience as well. What does the body count need to be? As a physician, I'm incensed. What does the body count need to be before they will change their rhetoric? It's out of control. Thousands of people are dying. What does it need to be? 10,000? Hundred thousand? Then you're going to go, oh, maybe we should help these people.</p><p>Housing is not the issue. Housing is part of it. Of course, they need a place to go. But you've got to address the mental illness and addiction that's underlying this and get them to the facilities and we have no ability to do that. So all these sprung tents that Gavin Newson is going to open, my prediction in six months, they'll be relatively empty, then what are we going to do?</p><p>CARLSON: The cruelty of this.</p><p>CARLSON: Beyond. Beyond.</p><p>CARLSON: So we just interviewed your old friend, Adam Carolla. The whole interview airs next week. We want to show you this bit where he brings you up while discussing politics. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN: And I loved what Ricky Gervais did. And I've said that -- Dr. Drew has always said to me, when is the pendulum going to start swinging back? We're so politically correct. Everyone's woke. We're getting everyone fired for the thought police are out there.</p><p>I said, the comedians. The comedians are always the tip of the spear. The comedians are going to bring the pendulum back. Ricky Gervais did a great job as the tip of the comedic spear of bringing it back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PINSKY: He also told me the Dave Chappelle Netflix comedy special, he said that was the moment. He said that's the moment that the comedian started becoming able to speak again.</p><p>I always go to Adam and I ask him. He's got a crystal brain, don't you know?</p><p>CARLSON: I do.</p><p>PINSKY: He has got a crystal brain. And I asked him, how do you think this is going to go? Because I'm so disturbed by the situation where it's just rolling into -- it looks like we're rolling into disaster particularly in this state. How Bloomberg, a smart guy like that can say that this is a model for the country? It is deeply disturbing, deeply disturbing. You will not meet a person out here who doesn't have a plan to leave. You want me to --</p><p>CARLSON: And you won't meet a prettier place. You really won't. You won't find it --</p><p>PINSKY: I've lived here my whole life.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I mean --</p><p>PINSKY: And it breaks my heart and it kills me that my patients are dying on the street. It kills me.</p><p>CARLSON: Dr. Drew, that was -- that was remarkable. Thank you.</p><p>PINSKY: Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: We have important creepy porn lawyer news breaking. Just before the show, CPL has left jail in California. He is now in New York. Specifically, he's been transferred to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. You may have heard of it. We're not making this up. That's the exact same rat-infested jail that Jeffrey Epstein was in when he allegedly committed suicide.</p><p>Of course with this transfer, it's more important than ever that we monitor CPL's wellbeing, our offer of a jailhouse interview still stands. We will continue to track this story and tell you if he accepts.</p><p>Well Beto O'Rourke hoped that by getting a nickname, people would believe that he was running as the first Latino President. He didn't fool any voters, of course, and had to drop out. But he didn't convince Joe Biden. Wait until you see this tape.</p><p>Plus, Hillary Clinton's documentary seems perfectly timed for a last minute presidential bid, not to be cynical, but could she be planning one? We will tell you just ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, in a recent interview with the \"Dallas Morning News,\" Joe Biden was asked if he'd be willing to pick Beto O'Rourke or Julian Castro as his running mate for President. Biden was asked that of course because both O'Rourke and Castro are from the State of Texas and that's the state of the second most electoral votes in the country, obviously.</p><p>And yet somehow Biden missed the point completely. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE Yes, I would. I would consider either both of them. But -- and look, I've spoken to each of them and spent some time talking to them, and my plea to both of them is that they stay engaged. They are talented, talented people.</p><p>I can guarantee you that there's going to be Latinos in my cabinet. I can guarantee you, there's going to be Latinos in my White House and both of them are qualified.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Biden, consider Beto O'Rourke, one of the most talented Latinos in our country. Really an impressive young Latino man with a future that's sure to be -- what's the word again? Callente.</p><p>Joe Biden regards Beto O'Rourke as a tribute to the fine people of Guadalajara, as well as living proof that their immigration system works like it should. There's only one problem, Beto or Robert Francis, \"Rob\" to his friends isn't Latino. He is whiter than Elizabeth Warren. He went to boarding school in Virginia then Rhode crew at Columbia. He likes Pearl Jam. He writes poetry about milk.</p><p>Here's a sample stanza. Notice, it's in English, \"Oh sacred cow. I thirst for you. Provide milk.\" Now Rob did have a chalupa once on the way back from rugby practice, but no, he's not even a tiny bit Hispanic. Beto was just a nickname. Until now, it never fooled anyone.</p><p>Hillary Clinton has a Hulu documentary about her life coming out in a month and a half. She hasn't been covered enough. A trailer for that documentary is here already. Here is a portion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is a set of expectations for the First Lady. I violated them from the very beginning.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We decided and asked Hillary to become Secretary of State. it surprised people.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hillary is polarizing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: E-mail.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: E-mail.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: E-mails blew up.</p><p>H. CLINTON: Bang.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It played into all of the suspicion, she is so sketchy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Cold and calculating.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: She could actually be crazy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is this sense that she knows that she is an ethical and moral person and that can blind anyone.</p><p>H. CLINTON: You know, you get scarred up a little bit.</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It wasn't like I thought. How can think about the most stupid thing I could possibly do and do it.</p><p>H. CLINTON: I didn't want anything to do with him. You want to make a difference? You want to have an impact. Well, then you've got to get in the arena.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Not even subtle. You've got to get in the arena, Hillary says staring meaningfully off into the distance.</p><p>It's possible this might encourage rumors that she's getting in the race. The documentary's release is perfectly timed to serve as in fact, a de facto campaign ad, even Democratic pundits openly discuss the weakness of this year's field with Joe Biden and the guy with the ear hair.</p><p>So maybe the stage is being set for Clinton's late entry into the race. Could it happen? Buck Sexton hosts \"The Buck Sexton Show.\" He joins us. Buck, I just one thing, politics aside, I'm just glad someone's finally giving this woman the attention she deserves.</p><p>BUCK SEXTON, HOST, \"THE BUCK SEXTON SHOW\": Yes, I think this is probably going to be more interesting than the 15 or so books she's had ghostwritten for her.</p><p>CARLSON: Or the 27 previous bio pics about Hillary Clinton. Like I don't know enough about her at this point.</p><p>SEXTON: But you have to look at this and think there are a few reasons why Hillary Clinton cannot be entirely discounted. One, is you get the sense that she has a hole in her soul that will only be filled -- and this is only on the personal level for her -- by becoming President of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SEXTON: Nothing else will ever suffice. It will never be acceptable. Then you also look at the Clinton political industrial complex. You know, they are still -- I know you know a lot of them in D.C., a lot of folks who Hillary's presidency was going to be the crowning achievement of their professional lives and they haven't given up on that idea yet.</p><p>They really, you know, Hillary was the person they were hoping they're going to ride her coattails to whatever White House job and they're still very much in place, all of those consultants. You know, they might have got another Democratic jobs, but they would all lead back on the Hillary train if they could.</p><p>And then, of course, the weakness of this Democratic field, which I mean, Bernie Sanders has to be taken seriously now as a as a presidential contender, as the possible nominee for the Democrats, and he is a socialist. We can call him a Democrat socialist.</p><p>But a lot of the country still is going to have a problem with that, and some Democrats, I think, are savvy enough to understand that's an issue. And with Hillary, I guess, there's no such thing as overexposure because we need to see more of what Hillary Clinton's life was all about. For some reason, we don't know why because Hillary thinks we do.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, because I honestly can't imagine someone who has been overexposed to the point that, like all the ink has faded. I mean, there's nothing about Hillary that you don't know. There's nothing interesting there. There's nothing that hasn't been chewed over repeatedly. You've got to think that this is just like an explicit campaign ad, I mean, I just don't see another explanation.</p><p>SEXTON: It definitely feels that way. And also, there is a narrative that makes some sense for a lot of Democrats that you'll talk to, if they really believe the election was stolen by Russia in 2016, which, despite all the investigations and everything, there are still people that believe that it was stolen.</p><p>You can't really get them to explain why, but they'll tell you that the only way to set that right, there is this narrative, you can see it's implicit in all of this would be for Hillary to come back as a unity candidate in a brokered convention and be the person to set right what was made wrong in 2016 and effectively be the true counter revolution against Trumpism.</p><p>Hillary, in a sense, is still a better place for that than any of these other candidates. I mean, certainly not Joe Biden, who Obama even knows, I'm not going to endorse this guy.</p><p>CARLSON: I wonder, though, I mean, clearly, she is the first choice. You're absolutely right, with the Samantha Powers of the world, sort of there's no way they are going to be Secretary of State --</p><p>SEXTON: The apparatus still looks --</p><p>CARLSON: I get it, exactly. But you wonder if the average Democratic voter is really going to want to hire Hillary Clinton to run the Democratic Party again?</p><p>SEXTON: Well, this would test out -- the question is, is it possible to want it too much and try too often to be President?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SEXTON: I think everybody has to look at this and say that this would be record setting in the sense that she's never giving up. She's never going to go away entirely. But it also is dependent on what ends up happening in the Democratic primary coming up.</p><p>We'll have to see if somebody finally emerges, although, you'd think who could really even emerge? We know it's Biden. Maybe Bernie. Bernie has got the socialist issue. Biden wasn't able to get more than two or three percent as a candidate on his own back in the day in the Democratic primary before he was Obama's VP. So why would somebody be an inspiring choice all of a sudden?</p><p>I mean, quite honestly, I think if they're going to pull somebody out of the stands, so to speak, somebody from the sidelines. Michelle Obama would make more sense than Hillary Clinton, but Hillary Clinton, I think wants it a whole lot more than Michelle Obama ever would.</p><p>CARLSON: Which is why Michelle Obama is far more likely to be the break glass in case of emergency candidate. I'm totally --</p><p>SEXTON: True.</p><p>CARLSON: I totally agree with that. Buck Sexton, great to see you tonight. Thank you.</p><p>SEXTON: Thank you. Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the \"Harvard Law Review\" has come up with a plan to give the left permanent unbreakable control of America. They won't have to fiddle around with these dumb elections anymore. How would it work? We'll start by turning the City of Washington, D.C. into 127 states. More than 250 new senators, not joking. They want this. We will explain the plan after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Virtually every institution in this country is controlled by the left, the academic world is a one party state in effect. Leftwing ideologues dominate the Federal bureaucracy. The media, big tech.</p><p>About the only power center remaining in America that has resisted total domination is the electoral system. People still get to vote here and about half the time they vote Republican. This is the last remaining check on the left's power, and it enrages them and that's why they're constantly looking for new ways to make voting irrelevant.</p><p>Consider their latest plan. It comes from the \"Harvard Law Review.\" That's America's most prestigious legal journal. It's a publication that Barack Obama once edited. The articles \"The Review\" publishes influence America's law professors, its political thinkers, our highest courts. It matters.</p><p>In a recent piece written by an anonymous author, the \"Harvard Law Review\" proposes a strategy for giving the left permanent unbreakable control of this country, the strategy, admit more states.</p><p>Now, it's not a plan to bring in Puerto Rico in D.C., you've seen that before. It's far more ambitious than that. The author calls for making every one of Washington, D.C.'s 127 neighborhoods, its own state.</p><p>That would mean 127 new House members. It would mean 254 new senators, all of them taken from tiny slices of America's most democratic city.</p><p>Now, that's not just enough new blue states to ensure permanent control of Congress though, of course it is that. It's enough to amend the Constitution at will, which of course is the point of it.</p><p>The article calls for using this power to emasculate the U.S. Senate, abolish the Electoral College, expand the size of the House of Representatives, but that's just the beginning.</p><p>With the opinions of the population now relevant, the left could abolish the Second Amendment. Get rid of free speech, ban private home ownership -- all ideas they have called for.</p><p>They can do whatever they want, in fact, which is now and always their goal. Sound terrifying? It should. But liberals love the idea. Vox.com praise the Harvard plan as brilliant and much needed. The website called it, \"An entirely constitutional way to unrig American democracy.\" Unrig? Of course, the proposal is exactly the opposite of unrigging. It's a coup.</p><p>Its purpose is to subvert our democratic system, to destroy our Constitution permanently in order to give a small group of rich liberal total control over everything. That's their plan, just so you know.</p><p>As we told you repeatedly on this program and showed you with reporting, Big Tech fought hard to boost Hillary Clinton in the last election cycle, and they've worked hard to undermine the Trump administration ever since.</p><p>With the 2020 election approaching right now, they have no intention of letting votes go against them a second time. They mean it. According to VOX, a secretive group of Silicon Valley donors called Mind the Gap is plotting to spend $140 million in an effort to defeat Donald Trump.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Facebook, only a single employee has donated money to the Trump campaign so far, just one. At Twitter, none, not a single Twitter employee, and that's just how Big Tech is spending its money.</p><p>Google and others tried to use their monopoly power to sway the 2016 results, and you can expect them to be even more aggressive this time.</p><p>Blake Harris is the author of \"The History of the Future,\" and he joins us tonight. Blake, thanks -- thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>BLAKE HARRIS, AUTHOR: Thanks for having me, Tucker.</p><p>HARRIS: So Mind the Gap, $140 million within the context of recent American presidential campaigns, that's an extraordinarily aggressive posture.</p><p>HARRIS: Yes, the scope is extraordinary and their method, their raison d'etre is really -- what makes us unique, you know? Mind the Gap is a data driven organization. That's not unusual.</p><p>You know, Trump and Brad Parscale used data driven analytics to help win the 2016 election and more power to them. But the problem here is really the secrecy.</p><p>Like the first thing I thought, learning about the story is that there's so many times in modern day journalism where you use the word secret or secretly or secretive, to sort of imbue a sense, an ominous nature to ordinary things like Blake Harris appears on TUCKER CARLSON secretly, even though just because I didn't issue a press release.</p><p>But here, this is actually -- I was like, wow, this is actually the word secretly applied. This is an organization, one of their members said their raison d'etre is stealth. That is what they're all about, and going back to what you said earlier, the scope of it is just incredible. The minimum suggested donation is $40,000.00, so this is not small potatoes we're talking about here.</p><p>CARLSON: But isn't this exactly what the left wonders about for -- I don't know, about 40 years? The democracy would corrode in the face of a small group of rich people, exerting undue influence in elections. I mean, they said they hated this, and now they've kind of cornered the market on it.</p><p>HARRIS: Right. Because they're doing it for the right reasons in their mind. You know, I spent few years speaking with Facebook executives in working on this book, and there wasn't a single person that seemed to have any doubt about their mission. They were so certain of it and you know, when you have a mission in mind, everything that helps you achieve that mission is, you know, for the \"greater good.\" And that's really what the problem is here.</p><p>You said there's only one person in all of 2019 that donated to Trump. I think maybe the second or the last quarter, there was another person, but two people out of a company that has 35,000 fulltime employees. That's insane.</p><p>I mean, two of anything out of 35,000 is insane. And these, you know, it really is a mission driven organization like many of those companies in Silicon Valley, and they believe that they're doing the right thing. And there is a by any means possible sort of asterisk to all of it.</p><p>CARLSON: So a company of 35,000 that has two Republican donors lectures the rest of us about diversity. Everything is irony. So I wonder, I mean, I'm skeptical that the President can prevail against forces this big and well organized. I think this is a challenge to our democracy. I wonder if Republicans understand what they're up against here.</p><p>HARRIS: I mean, again, I sort of -- I tip my cap to their data driven market analysis aspect to it. You know, one of the things that they did was they said they suggested putting money on underdogs instead of candidates who are likely to win because that money wasn't really going to help make an actual difference.</p><p>But the real problem is just the secrecy, the not knowing where it's going and you know, for Silicon Valley, whose ethos is always so much based on transparency and openness, why the stealth?</p><p>CARLSON: So they often tell us that the first thing they would do is overturn the Democratic candidates and say, it's the Supreme Court decision that made all of this possible. It made these dark money contributions possible, classifying them as political speech, protected speech. Have they changed their view on that? Are they not for campaign finance reform anymore?</p><p>HARRIS: I think that you could sum it down into like, what a second grader would say, they did it first. So anything they want to do to any bad behavior, it is justified because the other side did it first. We're just balancing the scales.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well, I think Republicans should be worried about this. I really do. I think people should be worried about. It's too much power for too a small group.</p><p>HARRIS: For sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Blake, great to see you tonight. Thank you.</p><p>HARRIS: Thanks for having on, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: The Democrats are going all out to get rid of the Second Amendment in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Now, they're trying to suppress public protests against them. We'll have a live news update to that.</p><p>Plus, the left knows that ridicule is sometimes the most effective weapon against tyranny. So of course, they're trying to destroy a humor website. The CEO of \"Babylon Bee\" joins us after the break, and we're happy to have him.</p><p>CARLSON: Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, the guy in blackface, one thing we know he believes in, guns. That's why his bodyguards carry guns. But doesn't want you to carry a gun to protect yourself. His administration is trying to prevent you from doing that, trying to pass new gun control bills.</p><p>Now, he is using executive fiat to ban protesters from bringing firearms to the state capitol. Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher has more on this unfolding story. Hey, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. Monday as Martin Luther King, Jr. Day which in the Virginia Capital of Richmond is also Lobby Day where groups on both sides of various political issues including gun rights traditionally show up to lobby their state lawmakers.</p><p>But for the first time in 25 years, Democrats control both chambers of the legislature and have already introduced a number of gun control bills. And some on the left, including \"The Washington Post\" and \"New York Times\" are reporting that gun rights activists and others may be looking to stir up trouble quoting, \"A sense of crisis enveloped the capital of Virginia on Thursday, with the police on heightened alert and Richmond bracing for possible violence ahead of a gun rally next week that is expected to draw white supremacist and other anti-government extremists.\"</p><p>But gun rights activists called that alarmist saying that except for a few obscure Facebook posts from out-of-state residents, reporters for \"The Times\" and \"The Post\" have no evidence of an impending Civil War. But Democratic Governor Ralph Northam saying that nobody wants another Charlottesville has temporarily banned weapons at the Capitol saying that some activists are not planning to be peaceful. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. RALPH NORTHAM (D-VA): We have received credible Intelligence from our law enforcement agencies that there are groups with malicious plans for the rally that is planned for Monday.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: The governor cited dark webs used by violent groups in the arrest of suspected white supremacist in other states, but many gun rights groups have told their members to be on their best behavior and say they are not nearly as concerned about violence as they are about finding a place to park -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Not surprising. Trace Gallagher, thanks so much.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of all the good things and bad things the internet has brought us, one thing we're celebrating is the renaissance in satire and comedy online. No website represents that Renaissance better than \"The Babylon Bee.\" Here's some recent headlines they've run, \"Democrats grasping at straws to impeach Trump now regret banning straws.\" Or this, \"El Paso man comes down from insane acid trip where he hallucinated that he ran for President.\"</p><p>Or how about this one, \"CNN attacks Babylon Bee: The internet is only big enough for one fake news site.\" Those headlines are all amusing, but they're also satirical. It's obvious they are, they're not real.</p><p>But as the left has grown steadily more radical, it's also lost its sense of humor -- completely, in case you haven't noticed -- and become far more tyrannical. CNN bullying high schoolers from Kentucky, that's fine. A website poking fun at America's most powerful media figures must be destroyed.</p><p>And so the left has set out to crush \"The Babylon Bee.\" \"The New York Times\" suggested that when the right pokes fun at the left, it's not satire, it's \"deceit.\" A CNN reported recently accused \"Babylon Bee\" of spreading \"clickbait and misinformation.\" In other words, Facebook, better censor it and fast.</p><p>Seth Dillon is the CEO of \"The Babylon Bee\" and we're happy to have him on tonight. Seth, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>SETH DILLON, CEO, \"THE BABYLON BEE\": Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Why do you -- and by the way, I think your site is hilarious and a lot of people think that is doing well.</p><p>DILLON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: CNN doesn't think it's funny at all, and they're trying to get Facebook to ban you. Why are they doing that?</p><p>DILLON: Everything is irony. You said that earlier, right? I mean, how funny is it that, you know, CNN is coming after us for spreading disinformation? I find that rich.</p><p>CARLSON: It did occur to me, absolutely. But -- and you're right, it's hilarious on one level, but on another, it's ominous. The idea that a \"news organization\" could try and put you out of business because it doesn't like your jokes. I mean that's not a world you want to live in, is it?</p><p>DILLON: Well, you have that clip of Adam Carolla earlier saying, you know the pendulum if it's going to swing back the other way that could be driven by you know, humor and comedy. If that is true, and they see it as a threat, and you know, we're aiming at the wrong targets and they don't like that, you know, personally they like to smear and denigrate people they disagree with, right?</p><p>And so while they're not actively and openly calling for us to be de- platformed, it's implicit when they say these guys are spreading misinformation. They just call themselves a satire site to get on Facebook's rules and things like that. Those suggestions. I mean, what's the solution there? If that's what we're really doing, if it's true if they're not spreading fake news about us and they're really being honest, then Facebook should shut us down. Right?</p><p>I mean, that would be the proper response to a site that's just misinforming people on purpose. So that seems to be their goal, and they just don't like the targets we're aiming at.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, it's clearly true. They're building the predicate for censorship. They're essentially saying that you shouldn't be allowed to continue doing what you're doing. And, and the baffling thing to me is there are a lot of hard-end sites on the internet, but there's a kind of sweetness to, I would say, \"The Babylon Bee.\" It's not a cruel sight at all.</p><p>You always sort of pull back a little bit, at the end, I think, as a reader of it. It's kind of the last site that you'd think the left would want to squelch because, you know, there are other targets. What is it about you that they really don't like?</p><p>DILLON: That's a good question. I mean, we do -- the interesting thing is that we don't just target the wrong targets, right? I think one of the things that's really refreshing about the Babylon be is that we -- there's a lot of self-deprecating humor, you know. We poke at Trump a lot.</p><p>The right is not off limits. You know, we're a Christian satire site. Christians aren't off limits. We often, you know, we throw things with a projector up on the wall that are our own issues that we try to deal with and say, are we comfortable with this?</p><p>So, you know, it's very interesting to us that rather than recognizing the fact that, you know, we kind of hit all sides, we're pretty balanced with it. Like you said, we're not vicious. What's the real reason for trying to take us out?</p><p>CARLSON: Are you worried about it?</p><p>DILLON: I'm not. I'm not because every single time this type of thing happens, and it's happened repeatedly. It happened with \"Snopes.\" We've had a couple of different CNN personalities now come out and call us a fake satire site. We're not really doing satire, they put satire in scare quotes, right?</p><p>CARLSON: A fake satire. What's that? That's so mad, I can't even -- I don't even know what that means. What does it mean to be fake satire site?</p><p>DILLON: Right. It's redundant.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, right.</p><p>DILLON: Now, I mean, I'm not worried about it because the response we get is incredible. I mean, look, I wouldn't be talking to you if they weren't doing this. Our fans are really loyal. They rally behind us. We get a lot of support. And the pushback is really tremendous.</p><p>And so I think it backfires on them, and it only amplifies our voice when they try to silence it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I don't think it's going to work. I mean, I must get a text today of one of your headlines. So Godspeed. I think you're doing great.</p><p>DILLON: That's great.</p><p>CARLSON: A great thing, making America a little bit lighter is really a virtuous thing to do in my opinion. So thank you for doing it.</p><p>DILLON: All right, thanks for having me on.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, this country narrowly avoided a war with Iran last week, how to American voters feel about that? It's interesting. We've got brand new polling on this subject.</p><p>Plus the EPA has announced a new policy that helps some, but it might not be good for you at all. We don't do a ton of environmental stories on this show. This one is worth doing, so stick around.</p><p>CARLSON: Despite its name, the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't just exist to protect the environment. It also exists to protect you by policing against the many pollutants that are generated by modern life.</p><p>But soon, the EPA will be doing a little bit less to protect you and a little bit more to protect big agriculture. Atrazine is a pesticide. It's the second most common one in the United States. Half of America's corn crop is treated with it.</p><p>Atrazine is banned in the European Union and here's why. When administered to male frogs, atrazine chemically castrates them and even causes some to change their sex entirely.</p><p>In humans atrazine is an endocrine disrupter. That means it causes changes to your natural hormonal balance. For newborn boys, atrazine exposure in utero is correlated with lower birth weight, undescended testicles and deformities to sex organs.</p><p>Now, it may be that atrazine's risk is low enough and its value is high enough that we don't need to ban it. But the EPA isn't just keeping atrazine legal, it's decided to stop closely monitoring its use.</p><p>Buried within a recent 60-page regulatory document, the EPA has announced it will soon end its Atrazine Monitoring Program, which tests drinking water to make certain that atrazine levels are safe.</p><p>According to the EPA, the risk is simply so low that it's not worth even checking to make sure the situation is under control. In fact, it's so low they're allowing 50 percent more atrazine to enter America's waterways.</p><p>Now, that's despite the fact that in 2017, the year with the most recent data are public, 30 million Americans had measurable amounts of atrazine in their tap water.</p><p>Now, according to researchers at Purdue University, a single part per billion of atrazine may be linked to low birth weights. In Evansville, Illinois, the water is already testing at 22 parts per billion. For the EPA, that's not a concern. Their concern is corn.</p><p>When President Trump ran in 2016 on keeping America out of Middle Eastern quagmires, we came close to getting in one last week after the assassination of Qasem Soleimani and then Iran's retaliatory missile strikes. It looks like we're on the brink there for a minute. In the end, of course, we avoided it.</p><p>The question is, what does the public think of the whole thing? Well, a new Morning Consult poll finds this -- fascinating -- 71 percent of voters approved have not attacking Iran. Just 14 percent disapprove.</p><p>Imagine that. Avoiding far off wars is popular. You could win an election on that. We will be back Monday. Have a great night. Sean Hannity is next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But almost. They're old. </p><p>And they have staffers who type for them. Play Video[2]Ro Khanna, the progressive congressman who represents Silicon Valley was dismayed[3]-- \"less\" wrote Alex Nazaryan for Newsweek \"because of what the Facebook co-founder and chairman did say-- for the most part, bromides about privacy, security and censorship-- than because of what the lawmakers arrayed before him didn't.\" Ro is a calm and composed fella. One can only imagine if Hawaii state Rep-- and congressional candidate-- Kaniela Ing was sitting next to him. 'This was a missed opportunity,' Khanna lamented later that evening in a text message. 'The hearing revealed a knowledge gap in Congress about technology.' Many of the men and women questioning Zuckerberg were about twice his age, and some were quite a bit older than that. They knew that adversaries like Russia had weaponized social media networks like Facebook and Twitter, but the particulars of the problem clearly eluded them. The 44 legislators who took turns quizzing Zuckerberg showed only a cursory understanding of data collection and encryption, and the lengthy hearing quickly devolved into the kind of exasperating technology tutorial one dreads having to give aging relatives.It was an amusing day for the purveyors of humorous internet memes. But anyone anxious about the obviously uneasy marriage between democracy and digital technology would not have been reassured. Zuckerberg left Capitol Hill without having to explain in any appreciable detail the failure that brought him there in the first place: the improper use of data belonging to 87 million Facebook users by data research firm Cambridge Analytica, which was conducting microtargeting work for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. He did offer apologies and reassurances, but these were vague enough to not be especially reassuring.Only eight years older than Zuckerberg, Khanna has been called 'Silicon Valley's ambassador to Middle America.' California's 17th congressional district, which he has represented since 2017, is home to some of the most successful corporations in the world: Apple (market value: $892 billion, as of April 16), Intel ($245 billion), Yahoo (now part of Verizon, whose market capitalization stands at $197 billion) and Tesla ($50 billion). Alphabet ($726 billion), with its Googleplex, is one district over, as is Facebook ($480 billion), with its thumbs-up icon announcing its Menlo Park Headquarters, at 1 Hacker Way.That address captures the mood of Silicon Valley a decade ago: whimsical, cheeky, maybe even hubristic. This was before anyone had ever heard of the Internet Research Agency, where Vladimir Putin's minions were waging a new kind of war. Psychographic data, of the kind Cambridge Analytica supposedly collected, was not yet for sale to politicians looking for an edge. Trolls were the stuff of medieval legend. And coding savants could not have expected to be lectured by the likes of Senators Chuck Grassley and Dean Heller, as Zuckerberg was earlier this month. The thumb is still there, at 1 Hacker Way, but the joke is no longer funny.'I believe representing Silicon Valley is one of the most important jobs in American politics,' Khanna says. To represent Silicon Valley is to speak and account for a techno elite given far more to self-celebration than introspection. Aware of the region's surpassingly good fortunes, and of its closely related tendency to hubris, Khanna has tried to export the former while arguing that it is necessary to tame the latter. He believes that the success of the tech sector is replicable and could serve as economic balm for other parts of the nation, particularly those where mining or manufacturing can no longer vault blue-collar workers into the middle class. Despite troubling disclosures about Facebook and its peers, he believes that most any community would welcome Zuckerberg, along with his Cambridge Analytica problem.The same week that Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi selected Khanna to draft an Internet Bill of Rights. It was a significant show of confidence in the House freshman by Pelosi, a veteran of the chamber renowned for her political acumen. Although it is impossible to say what an Internet Bill of Rights will look like, Khanna has long proposed such a measure to give Internet users clarity over the data they share as they click through Facebook photos or shop on Amazon.The Internet Bill of Rights would, in turn, prove a major test of just how much regulation Silicon Valley is willing to countenance. Big Tech has been a remarkably cagey industry, in part because it knows it gives us what nobody else can. It knows that even as we complain about hegemony, we order diapers on Amazon, instead of walking to the corner store. World leaders spar on Twitter, while chefs who once wanted to impress critics now think about what will look good on Instagram. At the same time, Reddit trolls disseminate fake news, which Google algorithms uncritically promote, while terrorists talk freely on WhatsApp, protected by the messaging service's encryption. Silicon Valley is becoming a victim of its own explosive growth, like the too-big-to-fail Wall Street banks that failed in 2008, plunging the nation into a recession.Khanna is aware of souring public opinion and has tried to both acknowledge it and reshape it. 'You can't be an island of success,' he says of the district he represents. 'We have to answer the nation's call.' If Silicon Valley can answer that call with 'humility,' Khanna says, the tech behemoths can avoid the kind of onerous regulation other liberal legislators are calling for, such as the General Data Protection Regulation that will go into effect in Europe in 2018.Khanna's indefatigable optimism has positioned him as a potential leader in a Democratic Party unable to reconcile its progressive and centrist elements and desperate for new faces. As a member of the Progressive Caucus, Khanna has advocated for liberal policies such as expansion of the earned-income tax credit. But his corporate past\u2014- and corporate constituency\u2014- keep him from veering too far into the sort of political fantasy for which Northern California is sometimes known. He may be just what the party needs, a moderate by temperament but by no means a centrist.'You can have a bold progressive vision coming from Silicon Valley, rooted in patriotism,' Khanna says. 'And I guess the case study is they elected me.'...\"This is a huge opportunity for tech leaders to work with Congress,' Khanna says. Otherwise, he warns, the regulatory power will fall to 'a bunch of bureaucrats who, frankly, don't know much about tech,' intellectual siblings of the senators who haplessly interrogated Zuckerberg. If regulation is inevitable, better that regulation be informed by the industry in question.<url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RJRRAoiJd9U/WtuwSlm8pkI/AAAAAAABYfs/0NCrKVv_f9EDIKkBkCLkXUllnSwzBwc8ACLcBGAs/s1600/ing_850_444.jpgBack\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RJRRAoiJd9U/WtuwSlm8pkI/AAAAAAABYfs/0NCrKVv_f9EDIKkBkCLkXUllnSwzBwc8ACLcBGAs/s1600/ing_850_444.jpgBack</url> to Kaniela for a moment. He's already taken on Zuckerberg... and won[4]. Kate Arnoff, writing for In These Times explained how in 2014, \"Zuckerberg purchased 700 acres of beachfront property on land Native Hawaiians have gathering rights to. Then he built a wall around it, and sued local families to keep them out. Ing helped lead the charge from the state legislature for Native Hawaiians to reclaim their rights to that land, and Zuckerberg eventually dropped the lawsuits. Now, Ing, a Native Hawaiian, is running to represent Hawaii's first congressional district, with a critique of Facebook and other corporations that extends well beyond their CEOs' real estate investments. In Washington, Ing hopes to curtail corporate power, and regulate Facebook and other major tech firms like utilities.\" Kaniela: We know what it's like to be up against oligarchy in Hawaii. We've lived in a feudal society and a really unequal capitalist society throughout history. Now we're seeing that repeat. We have three men in American who hold more wealth than the bottom half-- than 50 percent of the entire nation. And 82 percent of new wealth generated in 2017 went to the top 1 percent. It's more stark than ever. Mark Zuckerberg is one of today's oligarchs, just like on the mainland with Standard Oil and some of the other oligarchs in the past. Except now these guys have control over commerce, like Amazon, and communications, like Facebook. And that's where it gets really dangerous for a democracy. It's important that Congress act now and not rely on self-regulation by these monopolists.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/blueamerica18?refcode=thermometer...Zuckerberg\">https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/blueamerica18?refcode=thermometer...Zuckerberg</url> calls Facebook a social utility. And if he's admitting it's a utility he should agree that it should be treated like one. The same goes for the internet in general, not just social networks but broadband connection. It's a necessity now in the modern world, the way electricity was almost a century ago. There was way too much control by a few corporations that actually didn't benefit the majority of the public. So the government took over lines and-- at the very least-- heavily regulated these monopolies to make sure that everybody had equal access to electricity. We're going to have to do that for broadband generally, and we're going to have to do that for social networks. Right now there's nothing stopping someone like Zuckerberg from adjusting their algorithms to punish people with certain political views or certain companies. Arguably it's already happening. A lot of independent news sources don't have the same ability to reach their own followers that more corporate news sources do. That's unfair.If you'd like to help Kaniela win his race-- against 3 conservative barely Dems from the Republican wing of the Democratic Party-- please click on the thermometer above and contribute what you can to his campaign. You want to see real change in Congress? There's no one who's out to do that, and ready to do that, like Kaniela.

If anybody else shows up late, well, they showed up late.  They can just barge through that door. </p><p>Morning.  I'm Jim Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute, and this fantastic event you've chosen to attend, watch online, or view on C-SPAN is, should we reform Section 230?  I'd like to start things off with an interpretive reading of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications and Decency Act. </p><p>It is not a long section.  It is brief but important, and it states as follows, \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as a publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"  Now, for more than 20 years since the birth of the internet age as we know it, Section 230 has provided websites with immunity from liability from what their users post. </p><p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes the importance of Section 230 this way, \"This legal and policy framework has allowed for YouTube to upload their own videos, Amazon, and Yelp to offer countless user reviews. Craigslist to host classified ads, and Facebook and Twitter to offer social networking to billions of internet users.\" </p><p>Given the sheer size of user-generated websites, it would be impossible and unfeasible for online intermediaries to prevent objectionable content from cropping up on their site.  In short, Section 230 is perhaps the most influential law to protect the kind of innovation that has allowed the internet to thrive since 1996. </p><p>And yet over the past few years, Section 230 has faced heightened criticism from both the left and the right.  Many critics on the left argue that social media giants enjoy special protection without any responsibility.  They allow speech without worrying about its consequences, resulting in harassments and the increased prevalence of hate speech online. </p><p>Then other critics on the right have argued that these companies have gone too far in policing for these devices, or at least have too far in policing conservative voices, and enacted a biased double standard when it comes to content moderation. </p><p>In light of these criticisms and in line with a bipartisan political backlash against big tech, we've seen calls to reform Section 230.  And it is these calls in this debate that we are going to discuss today.  And I often use the phrase all-star panel.  This time I mean it especially.  This is an all-star panel. </p><p>Immediately to my right is Danielle Citron, author of the 2014 book, Hate Crimes in Cyberspace.  She is also a professor of Law at Boston University School of Law where she teaches rights about privacy and free speech. </p><p>Next to Danielle is Jim Harper, a visiting fellow at AEI, where he focuses on privacy issues and select legal and constitutional law issues.  And over on the end there is Jeff Kosseff, assistant professor of Cyber Security Law at the Naval Academy's Cyber Science Department and author of the recently released book, The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet, also a podcast guest on the AEI Political Economy podcast.  Welcome all. </p><p>Let me start with--let me start with Jeff.  What do we know for sure--we know reasonably for sure--was the intent behind Section 230?  Why-why did legislators feel the need to bring it into being? </p><p>KOSSEFF: So, there were two main reasons when you look at the legislative history and when you talk with the people who were involved in drafting and advocating for Section 230.  The first was there was really a concern at the time about --which, it's kind of quaint--legal pornography that was available to children online.  That was the biggest concern about the Internet at the time. </p><p>And there was a series of court rulings under the common law and the First Amendment, which basically stood for the proposition that if you did not moderate content, you could actually increase your chances of being protected from liability for all user content.  But if you started to moderate, then you could expose yourself to liability for defamation and other types of harm.  So, there was really a concern, then, that this system was giving an incentive for platforms not to moderate.  So, that was one driver of Section of 230. </p><p>The other was you have to think about the time.  It was 1995.  The modern internet was really at its infancy, and Congress wanted to get regulation and lawsuits out of the way of the development of this new technology.  So, between those two reasons--those were really the driving forces behind Section 230. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: So, is there--I sense--and, again, everyone can sort of jump in.  You don't need me to call on you.  I should have mentioned that earlier.  There seems to be confusion about that original intent, I think what you've tried to dispel with your book and other appearances.  What is--what is the confusion?  That seems fairly straightforward.  And I know that you've also--you've talked to the people involved--staffers and legislators.  There seems to be confusion about that original intent. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Do we have all day?  There's a lot of confusion. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: In fact, we do not. </p><p>KOSSEFF: So--and I'll say I'm only speaking on my own behalf. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: There's a lot of myths around this. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: We don't have to hit them all, but just in that sort of narrow issue of, what was the point of this to begin with? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Okay, so speaking just on my own behalf, not on behalf of DoD or the Navy-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Sorry, I should have mentioned that-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --I should say that.  There's a lot of confusion.  I'd say the biggest bit of confusion right now is that Section 230 is conditioned on neutrality, that it only applies to neutral platforms, whatever those might be, rather than publishers. </p><p>The point of Section 230 was to eliminate that distinction and allow platforms--or really online services at the time--to exercise discretion, figure out what their users should or should not be exposed to, and not face the liability.  So, I would say that's probably the biggest myth. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And--but, again, the issues that were sort of foremost at the time were issues, again, about pornography and defamation.  They weren't so much about politics and political views, were they? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Not at the time.  I mean, there was a statement in the findings for the bill that said something along the lines of wanting to foster political discourse.  So, I mean, there was a recognition that there would be free speech online.  And so to that extent there was.  But, there was no conditioning of neutrality on Section 230's protections. </p><p>CITRON: But, I think we're forgetting the title of Section 230 (c), which is protecting--the idea was it would apply to Good Samaritans who were protecting against--who were blocking and filtering offensive speech.  So, absolutely the idea was to incentivize self-monitoring, to provide protection for those who were blocking and filtering offensive speech--offensive speech, which is completely legally protected speech.  But, we wanted to incentivize-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --But that word offensive, what would--how--what-- </p><p>CITRON: --That is in the subtitle of the-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --But what did people think they meant by offensive back then? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Well, it's also--so--so, you quoted (c) (1)-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah, surely-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --Which are the 26 words. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, yeah. </p><p>KOSSEFF: (C) (2) allows good faith efforts to block access to a list of types of content, including other objectionable content. </p><p>CITRON: Harassing, right? </p><p>KOSSEFF: So, yeah.  So, I mean, they-- </p><p>CITRON: --They had harassment in mind, right? </p><p>KOSSEFF: But--yeah, exactly.  I mean, Congress wanted to give a very wide range of discretion to these platforms to feel free to block content and not be exposed to liability. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And--and--and just kind of a brief legal point, were they not already protected under the First Amendment?  I hear--I get that a lot, \"What about the First Amendment, that does not protect these companies?\" </p><p>KOSSEFF: Well-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Why do they need this sort of extra protection? </p><p>KOSSEFF: So, that was the problem that led to Section 230 in the first place is that--there's a lot of different First Amendment protections, but one is for distributors of content that others create.  And the rule there is if you're a distributor, you can only be liable for other people's content if you either knew or had reason to know. </p><p>But, the problem became that the court start saying, \"If you start to moderate, you don't even receive that protection, and you become strictly liable just like a newspaper would be for its letters to the editor.\"  And that was--that was the weird system that was created by the First Amendment. </p><p>HARPER: And it wasn't so much First Amendment as it was Common Law development. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>HARPER: That is, the courts were looking at this new medium and coming out different places, whether a platform provider was a publisher or was a speaker.  And in my opinion the law kind of jumped ahead to what I think was the right result.  But, it's unfortunate that we got there through legislation rather than through continued Common Law development. </p><p>I think if it had--if it had--it would have--it would have taken years, but then again years later, we're here talking about it.  If the rule had been generated from the bottom up, through experience, I think it might have been a stronger rule and a better understood rule and one that's based more deeply in practice rather than getting us over the top with legislation, which I think was pretty good but maybe not perfect.  So, we'll see. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And given that--just--just a little bit on the history, how controversial was it, or did this just kind of slip through and people--classic case where people kind of didn't know--understand all the consequences that would sort of flow out from it?  Or was--was there much real debate at some point in the process? </p><p>KOSSEFF: So, there was a little bit of floor discussion.  There was no real opposition on the floor.  It passed.  It was attached to the Telecom bill in a 420 to 4 vote because this was part of the much broader overhaul of telecom laws in 1996. </p><p>And Section 230 was really seen as an alternative to the Communications Decency Act, which ended up--both of those ended up being put in the Telecom Act.  The Communications Decency Act imposed all sorts of prohibitions for--for speech that was indecent.  And the Supreme Court struck that down. </p><p>So, Section 230 received barely any media coverage at the time.  And when it did receive media coverage, there was no coverage of the fact that it was going to shield platforms from liability for most types of user content.  So, it was really an afterthought at the time. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Yeah, I'm curious.  So, we have this law that shields internet companies, big platforms.  How does it work in other--Western Europe, for instance?  Do they have their own version of Section 230? </p><p>KOSSEFF: So, they have rules.  And, I mean, Europe has a number of different rules.  I write about one of the cases in the book.  But, it varies a little bit, and it gets into the classification, whether it's a conduit or some other type of service. </p><p>But, there are some cases where the courts have said, \"Not only do you have to take down user content, if you get a notice complaining about it, you also might have a duty to actively patrol for user content that might violate not just defamation laws but hate speech laws and things like that.\"  So, it's much more restrictive in really most other jurisdictions than it is in the United States.  We're very unique in that respect. </p><p>HARPER: Maybe unintentionally, Jim, you said it protects big platforms, but it also protects small platforms. </p><p>CITRON: Everybody, yeah. </p><p>HARPER: And my thinking on 230 is animated by operating a very small platform for a number of years.  I ran a site called WashingtonWatch.com, which was a government transparency site.  Don't go look there now.  There's nothing but broken dreams. </p><p>The--the--and when Web 2.0 came along, I changed Washington Watch to Web 2.0 style. You'll remember that phraseology.  That's when people actually started being able to comment and vote and add their own material. </p><p>So, we had a comment section.  I had a little success.  It was--there was a bill to extend welfare benefits, unemployment benefits, and it had something like 200,000 comments.  And I was the only guy in my spare time watching what was going on on the site. </p><p>And of course, there were people behaving horribly to try to undermine the conversation.  There were people who were telling me that someone else was using their name, and I was called on to moderate the situation. </p><p>I wasn't consciously using Section 230.  I was just trying to do my very best to create a good environment.  But, it's extraordinary the length that people will go to--to, in my case, undermine the site because they thought I was in favor of this legislation when, in fact, it was a neutral--neutral platform--or meant to be. </p><p>Unfortunately the internet, for all its blessings, allows people to be truly wicked from behind that anonymity.  And they will take every effort to upset each other, they'll take every effort to undercut the platform itself.  So, it's an area that's fraught, and 230 is a very important protection, given what people do. </p><p>CITRON: But, it's not just to make them upset, right?  People will use network tools to destroy people's lives, to post nude photos of them, to ensure that they can't get a date, keep their jobs, get a new one. </p><p>They will threaten death and rape, right?  They post defamatory information that one can never sort of respond to, which is, \"I'm not a prostitute, I don't have a sexually transmitted infection,\" right, so that the kind of mischief that we've seen isn't just like hurt--things that hurt people's feelings, not just offensive speech.  It is speech that we would say isn't even legally protected, that we can criminalize and ensure liability for. </p><p>And there are sites that make a business out of hosting non-consensual pornography, right?  And they get to, with glee, say, \"I can encourage people to post others' nude photos.  Sue me, good luck.  I'm immune from liability.\"  And so--and people's lives are ruined. </p><p>So, I think its just important to note that the mischief isn't--and I'm with you because I--I help run Concurring Opinions.  And so, we were busy filtering crazy comments, too, right, on our sort of legal theory blog.  But, we--it's far more than that, right?  Like any wonderful tools for great things and also for L (SP), we see a whole lot of illegality and destruction of people's lives. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And I--indeed, so we have this--we have this piece of legislation, not particularly controversial--now very controversial.  As I--as I alluded in my remarks, for different reasons from different perspectives--but just one second before we get to that--it should be mentioned that perhaps we could--some of these protections could have evolved sort of more organically rather than legislation. </p><p>But given sort of again how the internet has sort of developed, if that Section 230 had not happened, what sort of--what might the internet look like today?  And how might it have evolved without it, since now we're so interested in changing it and reforming it?  If we didn't have it right now, what does the internet look like? </p><p>HARPER: You have an argument on that, I think.  It's the title of your book. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah, yeah.  So, I think--I'm a little skeptical that the common law would have developed to the extent of the protection that 230 provides.  I think some of the early court cases were not very well reasoned or well decided that really imposed significant liability.  But I don't think that the really broad protection that Section 230 provides for third-party content would have been the same under common law. </p><p>I think there probably would be more of a notice and take down-type system, where if you get notification of potentially illegal content, your choice is either take it down or you have to stand in the shoes of the person who posted it and then defend it, which most rational platforms are not going to want to do because they don't want to litigate all these defamation cases.  So, I think you wouldn't see necessarily the same extent of social media, of Yelp, all of these services that really not coincidentally are based in the United States. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: People will offer wonder why, \"Gee, where are all--where are all these sort of social media giants in Europe?  I mean, do you think 230 is a big reason, again, why we have them and they don't? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Very much so.  I mean, I think that they were able to develop in the way that they currently are because of Section 230.  We would probably have different types of services, but they wouldn't have the same sort of rules that they have right now without Section 230. </p><p>CITRON: There are big social media companies like in China. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yes. </p><p>CITRON: But, it's complete censorship and control. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yes. </p><p>CITRON: So, it's not like we wouldn't have these companies.  They would just look--you're right--so sorry. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And people would just be, what-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah, go ahead, Jim-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --posting dog videos and their kids. </p><p>CITRON: Dog videos, looking pretty benign, right, yeah. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Right, right. </p><p>HARPER: I think--I think it's right that we got the big social media industry we did because of 230.  Is that right or wrong? </p><p>CITRON: Yeah. </p><p>HARPER: You could also conceive of 230 as a sort of subsidy-- </p><p>CITRON: --Absolutely-- </p><p>HARPER: --liability, free subsidy, same way the corporate form of organization and the subsidy to businesses-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah-- </p><p>HARPER: --that comes at a cost to consumers in some degree because there's a little bit less liability for corporations.  A little bit less liability for social media platforms meant we have a huge social media industry.  It came at a cost, though, in victimization of select people in some cases that are very sympathetic.  So-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah.  And some of those negative externalities include speech.  So when you are targeted with harassment online, you are silenced so often.  And we forget that those negative externalities aren't just lost jobs and potential physical violence but also speech.  Yeah. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And the--and sort of the externality, I mean, it seems like it's suddenly a very controversial topic right now.  We're talking about different ways to regulate big tech.  But, those are externalities and sort of victims.  They were there really from the very beginning.  And I know in the book you write, there's several interesting cases of people who were actually hurt after--extremely sympathetic stories.  But yet, were there any calls back then, \"Listen, this is generating victims, we need to do something?\"  Or did it pretty much continue to its present state, sort of ignored by policymakers? </p><p>KOSSEFF: I think for the first decade it was not really a hot-button issue, and even into its second decade it wasn't.  And there were some tough cases. </p><p>CITRON: But what about like Senator Lieberman, like the idea that he wanted to pressure Google and YouTube to take down terrorist videos.  This was, what, like 2004? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>CITRON: And that just gets ignored, right? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>CITRON: And so, there weren't--or is that--was that (INAUDIBLE), Jeff, like the--because I only knew about those efforts at the time. </p><p>KOSSEFF: I don't--I guess what I'm saying is the public attention to it was not nearly the same. </p><p>CITRON: Oh, yeah. </p><p>KOSSEFF: And there were really tough cases in the beginning.  So, there's a lot of people who argue, \"Well, there have only been difficult cases in the past few years.\"  The second case ever litigated under Section 230 is a case called \"Doe versus AOL,\" where a mother sued AOL because there was child pornography with her son--her teenage son--and that AOL was being marketed in an AOL chat room. </p><p>And she kept contacting AOL, and they wouldn't prevent it.  That's a difficult case.  And so, it's not just like they were only defamation--easy defamation cases in the early stages.  There were tough cases all the way from the early days of Section 230.  So-- </p><p>CITRON: --Even though it's child porn, so that it falls outside of 230?  Federal criminal law isn't--doesn't enjoy that immunity. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah, but she-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --she was suing for negligence. </p><p>CITRON: Ah,  Okay, I got you. </p><p>KOSSEFF: So, yes. </p><p>CITRON: But important to clarify for everybody. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yes. </p><p>HARPER: Another important dimension of the problem is the changing technology over time.  In the early days of CDA 230 maybe you had manual processes entirely.  Nowadays, a thing like child porn you can kind of automate tracking.  And those systems are in place where you get a hash of known child porn files, and you can review anything. </p><p>There's a case in the Tenth Circuit where AOL found child porn and delivered it to NCMEC, which was a government actor for those purposes.  It's called Ackerman.  Justice Gorsuch--now Justice Gorsuch--wrote the opinion.  It's a very--very good and interesting opinion on its own.  But, automated review for things that are self-evidently criminal seems like an area where you might be able to hold platforms liable. </p><p>Self-evident, though, is important, I think, because if you're taking defamation or stalking or something like that, it's really hard for a person coming in for the first time to a conversation to figure out whether someone is defaming another.  What's the reality of it?  I did have a person contact me and say, \"Someone else is using my name.\" </p><p>I've written a book on identity, and I know that names--even rare ones--are repeated many times around the world, so I was dubious of the--the argument.  And I couldn't bring myself to take something down as identity fraud, if you will, because the same name was being used as another person out there in the world. </p><p>I don't think that the people in--who are faced with these decisions, like myriad different kinds of problems and stories coming to them in the bowels of the social media organizations, are going to be able to negotiate and navigate those kinds of determinations very readily.  So, self-evident wrong-- </p><p>CITRON: --Automation (INAUDIBLE) for lots of these problems. </p><p>HARPER: You might--you might have liability appropriately attached. </p><p>CITRON: Totally. </p><p>HARPER: But, things that aren't self-evidently wrong, I think you probably shouldn't have liability for those platforms. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: So, these cases would come up, and there would be these stories.  But, generally this is sort of left alone, it sounds like, by legislators--sort of not anymore.  Is it the case just that--that you have these sort of big-platform companies which have been in the news? </p><p>And sort of why--sort of why now?  Why is it now this incredibly controversial issue?  Was there a triggering event?  Or is it just that it is also big--intrusive in our lives--we're just taking a closer look at all these companies and the sort of--and what regulations and laws apply to them? </p><p>CITRON: I think it's like a couple things coming together all at once. </p><p>HARPER: Yes. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yes. </p><p>CITRON: I feel like we could all probably take-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --Yes-- </p><p>CITRON: --each thread and bring it together, right? </p><p>KOSSEFF: I mean, people don't like the tech companies as much as they used to. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, here we are. </p><p>KOSSEFF: And that's not a controversial-- </p><p>CITRON: --Cambridge Analytica, right? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Right. </p><p>CITRON: Mark Zuckerberg is-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Quite a biggie, yeah-- </p><p>CITRON: --Dorsey, Sandberg, they are getting pummeled.  It's a wonderful opportunity for every senator and congressperson to sort of hop on the bandwagon and say, \"You are the antichrist.\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>\"You bear,\" sorry, forgive me, I transgressed religious norms, \"You bear full responsibility of all mischief online.\" </p><p>UNKNOWN: Right, right. </p><p>CITRON: And it was sort of an easy pot shot.  And then--so, what else can we throw in the mix?  We have Cambridge Analytica, and they talk in our country from Russia--and disinformation--and then, therefore, blaming the platforms, \"We're not doing anything about it,\" when they were caught unawares and off-guard--the advent of deepfakes.  We have--I don't want to take up the thunder.  I feel like we all want to pitch in something. </p><p>KOSSEFF: I mean, I would also say that one thing I've observed is that the traditional news media perhaps is not very happy with the business models of some of the large platforms. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Because of what they have--yeah. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: It certainly seems like one criticism is that this enables those very business models and that it's not just--it's not just about moderating and shielding these companies, but it's a key part of why they are--why these companies are worth $500 billion or a trillion dollars. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>CITRON: And they are not nascent.  They are engaged in surveillance that earns them a tremendous amount of money, right?  And they are stealing the business of news companies, right, Jeff, is what you're saying? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah, or that it's-- </p><p>CITRON: --Or in the minds of big (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>HARPER: Yeah.  One problem which is familiar to students of regulation is that if you were to deeply undercut Section 230 protections, the biggies would be able to navigate the new law. </p><p>CITRON: Right. </p><p>HARPER: And the little competitors that are coming up to try to challenge them would not be able to navigate the new law cost effectively.  And so, like regulation typically does, it would lock in the status quo in the marketplace.  And so, Facebook's natural decline would be--would be delayed, if not foreclosed, by doing away with 230 or deeply undercutting the protections of 230.  It's there as much for the small competitors as it is for the big platforms. </p><p>CITRON: I have an approach that wouldn't do that, but we can talk about that later, about what that might be-- </p><p>HARPER: --Sure-- </p><p>CITRON: --that would treat the big platforms and the smaller platforms differently.  We don't have to get there yet, but-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --I would also say that the larger platforms have lacked some transparency over the years.  They have started to change, but, I mean, it was often like a black box to figure out what--what's going on in there. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And to me-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --How are they making-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --That's particularly a complaint-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --Yeah-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --among conservatives who think that these companies are biased against them.  They don't see.  \"Well, I don't see why that person is being taken down or demonetizing or shadow--and why not that person?  And if that has happened to me, I--do I call an 800 number?  What do I do?\" </p><p>I think transparency--they don't understand the process.  But, when I went on, of course, Twitter to discuss this, there was a statement that Section 230 is terrible.  Basically what it does, it enables hate.  It enables hate and harassment, so-- </p><p>CITRON: --But, it also enables great things, too, right, so-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --but, you've written about many of these problems. </p><p>CITRON: I have.  And that's right that the free pass-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --in your fine 2014 book again. </p><p>CITRON: Yes. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Hate crimes and-- </p><p>CITRON: --Oh, thank you so much--and in work that I've done with Ben Wittes in the (INAUDIBLE) of law review (SP) in 2017 we sort of proposed a way in which we can fix the statute without doing too much violence to all the great things that is done, right, because on the one hand, Section 230 provides this safe harbor, which isn't conditioned on any good behavior or good faith when it comes to under-filtering. </p><p>When it comes to over-filtering, we condition that on good faith, right?  But, for under-filtering, the part of the statute that you read aloud is 230 (c) (1).  It doesn't condition that immunity on any good behavior, right?  It just says you have this immunity, we're not going to treat you as a publisher or speaker of somebody else's content. </p><p>And what that has done and been interpreted really broadly to mean that even websites that encourage non-consensual pornography, that entire business model is abuse essentially, right?  Sites that cater in deepfake sex videos, they get to enjoy this immunity from liability, even though they are not engaged in any kind of content moderation and, in fact, are encouraging it and making money off of it. </p><p>And so, can I talk about my proposal? </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Not yet. </p><p>CITRON: Not yet.  No, that's why I'm thinking-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --This is like-- </p><p>CITRON: --I want to make sure. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: This is like a stay-tuned moment. </p><p>CITRON: Hey. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: So no one tunes out because the big proposals are coming. </p><p>HARPER: Isn't that censorship? </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: But, I mean, I think people-- </p><p>CITRON: --I don't want to get rid of it, needless to say. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Right. </p><p>CITRON: I think Section 230 has been incredibly important.  It was incredibly important for these early years in which we do have the Yelps, we do have Facebooks, we do have incredibly pro-social activity online.  It is now-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --That's not what you're hearing, though. </p><p>CITRON: Right. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: I mean, it seems--it seems like-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --All these positive things that--most of the stories that you hear are about-- </p><p>CITRON: --we have Wikipedia, let's say.  That's pretty damn pro-social, right? </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: But, you hear about--again, whether it's--whether it's actual harassment-- </p><p>CITRON: --Right-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Whether it's hate speech, whether it's people being--uploading really violent videos, that these companies have been given a lot of power.  And they've gotten very big.  They show absolutely no responsibility.  That's the criticism.  There's no-- </p><p>CITRON: --and that's, a, not true-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --the classic, \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" where's the-- </p><p>CITRON: --right.  No, it's power without responsibility. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Yeah, yes. </p><p>CITRON: But, what's interesting is that, where are those people when the folks I was writing about who were victims of cyber stalking, non-consensual pornography--where were they?  Companies were actually--there's all these politicians that are now so worried about hate and harassment.  They don't really care.  Let's be honest.  All these years that I've been writing about it, no one says a word. </p><p>And it's only when it's sort of like when it's your ox that's being gored that they care about it, when they think, \"Oh, political speech is being marginalized,\" which, empirically speaking, I'm doubting is true.  But, the companies actually--the largest platforms--have been working on these issues.  And I've been working with them--Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft--for years, right? </p><p>They haven't done a terrific job.  They have been trying.  They have gotten better at it as it's been bad for business.  Why does Twitter take a stand against stalking and threats and non-consensual pornography in 2014?  We had Gamergate.  And advertisers started pulling their money--same with Facebook.  If it's bad for business--they have long tried.  They haven't done a great job, but they are making efforts. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: These are not new companies. </p><p>CITRON: No. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: I mean--no, they have been around for a while.  And I think a lot of people would think they would have better policies, more aggressive policies at this point, and that speaking--that maybe the politicians really didn't care, but that maybe they just didn't really care that much-- </p><p>CITRON: --Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's like a-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --until it became really a big issue in the public consciousness. </p><p>HARPER: One of the things that I think is important to highlight is that a lot of the worst wrongdoing that happens online has a wrongdoer who is on the other side of the platform doing the wrong thing.  You take something like revenge porn or something like that. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, they're perpetrators. </p><p>HARPER: You know exactly who the perpetrator is.  And they are the one who is the actual wrongdoer.  And maybe you can divide it up in percentage terms.  But, if they hadn't done what they did, the platform wouldn't have any of--any of that material on it.  There is a case that I think got dealt with in the Second Circuit recently, where it's unclear that they--that they actually sought--this is the Grindr case. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, yeah. </p><p>HARPER: You probably know it better than I do. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, of course. </p><p>HARPER: It's unclear that they did very much to try to stop the actual bad actor. </p><p>CITRON: And Grindr did literally nothing and designed their site so they made it impossible. </p><p>HARPER: Very well. </p><p>CITRON: So, they said to-- </p><p>HARPER: --Very well and good-- </p><p>CITRON: --find his perpetrator. </p><p>HARPER: But-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Maybe spend 30 seconds saying what that--what that issue is, what that case was. </p><p>HARPER: So, Grindr is a hookup site, and a jilted ex-lover adopted the identity of the other and invited, I think, something like thousands of men to come-- </p><p>CITRON: --A thousand-plus men to his house-- </p><p>HARPER: --to his house. </p><p>CITRON: Because he posted fake ads saying that he was interested in anal rape and provided-- </p><p>HARPER: --Really awful behavior-- </p><p>CITRON: --the victim's home address.  And so, over a thousand men came to this man's house because-- </p><p>HARPER: --really, really awful behavior-- </p><p>CITRON: --right-- </p><p>HARPER: --on the part of a known individual. </p><p>CITRON: But, Grindr says we can't-- </p><p>HARPER: --and Grindr-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah-- </p><p>HARPER: --opted not to do anything.  But the known individual, was he--I think there was a protective order against him? </p><p>CITRON: Law enforcement--that's right. </p><p>HARPER: Very little else. </p><p>CITRON: Was not enforced.  And law enforcement-- </p><p>HARPER: --Yeah-- </p><p>CITRON: --I'm not the lawyer in the case. </p><p>HARPER: I think-- </p><p>CITRON: --But I have written about the case, and know the lawyer well-- </p><p>HARPER: --Sure, sure, yeah-- </p><p>CITRON: --Who represents the victim. </p><p>HARPER: And I think law enforcement failed to act. </p><p>CITRON: And law enforcement says nothing, right. </p><p>HARPER: But, I think that's a law enforcement story more than a Grindr story.  The attractive defendant, of course is Grindr and not the probably penniless perpetrator's wrongful acts. </p><p>CITRON: But, I'm not sure we should feel so badly for Grindr because Grindr tells Michael Herrick that it has no capacity to identify anyone on their site, and they cannot prevent people from reappearing, which is nonsense.  Let's talk about--as a technical matter, right, its inability to trace-- </p><p>HARPER: --I think it might be-- </p><p>CITRON: --IP addresses is a design choice. </p><p>HARPER: Right, the people's ability to avoid IP tracking is pretty readily used.  I think if you were--if you were required to figure out when and where a person was making fake accounts on your own platform, you would have a hard time doing it, it would take a lot of resources.  And so, this is dedicated to defeating you.  You've got to put a full-time employee against any individual that's trying to do wrongdoing on your site. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: So, you think it's fundamentally a 230 issue? </p><p>CITRON: Oh, but it was. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Yeah. </p><p>CITRON: Because the client sues 230. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Where it's lacking, yeah, so where 230 is not doing the job. </p><p>CITRON: Right.  I mean, because I think ultimately Grindr says like, \"We chose not to design our site in a way that would make it at all easy to block people who are doing mischief.\"  And you know what?  Twitter--they can block mischief makers.  Facebook, it's not that technically difficult.  They design--Jeff, you join me if I'm wrong about this--but Grindr's business model, they said, would be disserved by changing the architecture of their site.  And I just think that is--given what has--how it has been misused--strikes me as-- </p><p>HARPER: --Yes-- </p><p>CITRON: --they have created something that is ultra-hazardous. </p><p>HARPER: Well--yes. </p><p>CITRON: And they walk away and don't care. </p><p>HARPER: I'll go quickly here.  A lot of us in the privacy community want surveillance to be pretty hard, even for the corporations that run the sites. </p><p>CITRON: Right. </p><p>HARPER: So, it's not necessarily a bad thing-- </p><p>CITRON: --Right-- </p><p>HARPER: --that there is a platform that makes it hard to figure out who is who.  So, this is a tough balance to strike.  And I'm not sure that-- </p><p>CITRON: --Right-- </p><p>HARPER: --Grindr was wrong when the actual perpetrator of the wrongdoing was not entirely left alone but not pursued as readily as the platform. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Well, and I--so, I read the sur/petition in the case, which is I think going to conference in October at the Supreme Court to-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --I think it probably has the best chance of getting granted of any Section 230 sur/petition because it makes a really unique argument about product liability-- </p><p>CITRON: --Liability-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --rather than the--because, I mean, Section 230 is really clear, treating as a publisher or speaker.  I think there is a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court would take its first-ever Section 230 case.  And that's a really big deal because the section--because in Section 230, we rely on a Fourth Circuit case, which was the first opinion to ever interpret Section 230.  And everyone has kind of taken that as how you interpret Section 230.  And I think this--this, I think, is the biggest challenge that I've seen yet to getting it to the Supreme Court. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: So, one reason this is sort of in the news or we have sort of more high-profile examples of harassment, we have hate speech online.  And the companies just--they have been given this ability to moderate, and they are not--you said that you've worked with some of these companies.  Do they feel like they are being treated sort of poorly by the media, that they are--that all their good efforts-- </p><p>CITRON: --Right-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Is just kind of--that it's a lot harder than what you think?  All these policymakers--they understand the technology, they understand how difficult it is.  You just can't come up with a better AI or hire 5, 000 more moderators in the policies.  They feel like they just--people just don't get the difficulty of kind of moderating at scale. </p><p>CITRON: Scale is a huge problem, right?  So, for any given grievance, it's really hard at scale to get it right all the time.  But, I think there's some recognition that Twitter knows that.  And this is just speaking from--I think from not confidential information--that up until 2014, it wasn't doing the right thing, right, that it had a very hands-off approach when it came to threats and stalking and non-consensual pornography. </p><p>And it sort of changed its direction.  Facebook has long banned harassment and stalking and bullying.  And I would like them to be more transparent.  They have incredibly complex roles internally.  So, inward-facing, they have guidelines that are--I mean, would take days to read all of it, right, but not public facing. </p><p>So that while they say they ban hate speech, they don't define hate speech.  They say they ban harassment and stalking.  Define it for us.  Explain to us why you ban it, and give us examples and tell users why you are banning them and give them a chance to respond.  So, are they doing better since 2014?  They are, right?  Are they doing a great job?  I don't think so, right? </p><p>I'm on Twitter Stress and Safety Task Force, and I've been working with Facebook on their non-consensual intimate imagery--and with them for 10 years.  But, I do it in a way I don't get paid, so that I can be honest with them, and I can talk about it publicly, right, not based on confidential information.  But, it's important to--you don't get paid, and you can be as an academic.  You're free to say like, \"I can criticize you, and you're not doing a perfect job.\" </p><p>But, by my lights, Facebook and Twitter are like virtuous compared to the revenge pornographers, right?  So, as we think of these things as a scale, bless Twitter and Facebook, Microsoft and Google and YouTube for at least trying a little bit, right, because you have sites whose business model is abuse and who--their entire ability to make money is contingent on encouraging users to engage in non-consensual pornography (INAUDIBLE) definitions. </p><p>KOSSEFF: And I would also just add that moderation is really hard at the scale that they are having to moderate.  So, we can talk about, what's a hate speech policy for a large platform?  But, when you're getting this flood of hate speech or other potential violations all the time, and you have contract moderators--I encourage everyone to read the Verge--just had a great series of stories about what the life of social media moderators is like--it's not very good. </p><p>CITRON: And Sarah Roberts' new book, let's plug that. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yes, absolutely. </p><p>CITRON: Behind the scenes. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>CITRON: Always happy to plug my friends' books.  Yeah. </p><p>KOSSEFF: So, I mean, when you have people, I think they make $30,000 a year, and they are being exposed to the worst possible aspects of humanity-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --having to apply these detailed policies, there are going to be mistakes that are made, even in terms of whether it violates the policy.  And there are subjective judgment calls.  So, there's no easy solution here.  We're not--nothing that Congress does or doesn't do is going to solve the problem that we have right now. </p><p>CITRON: And it's not just the United States, right? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>CITRON: The European Union--so, I have written a lot about the pressure that EU Commission has brought to bear against the major platforms, bullying them into taking down hate speech within 24 hours.  And it leads to sincere and serious censorship creep because their terms of service--they use them globally, right? </p><p>So, if we're seeing censorship creep due to pressure from Europe, it ends up here.  So, it's not just conversations within the United States.  We're seeing pressure come from Europe as well.  So--these companies are global. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Something we sort of touched on in the beginning, sort of outlining the problems is you have people on the right who are absolutely convinced that these platforms are--are--speaking of censorship--censoring political viewpoints that they disagree with.  And as part of that argument they have said, \"Listen, Section 230 was established with the intent that platforms would be neutral, and there's no difference between platforms--and there's a difference between platforms and publishers.\" </p><p>CITRON: That's true. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: When I went on Twitter again to read about this.  Some said, \"Listen, they have to choose.  Are they a platform, are they a publisher?  They need to fulfill their 230 responsibilities.\"  That's one of the nits (SP) that--so, I guess two questions that all can answer.  One, do they think that--that the--especially the big platform companies--are suppressing conservative/Republican speech?  And sort of, two, what about that platform versus publishers distinction? </p><p>KOSSEFF: I mean, I could just answer no, there's not one. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But, I think to get a little more detailed here, there is not a distinction in Section 230.  But, this is also a law that Congress passed.  So, whether there is and whether there should be is a different question. </p><p>So, I mean, Congress could very easily say that there is going to be a neutrality requirement, and then we can debate the merits of that.  And I think that's--that's a debate that we can have.  But, I think some of the debate has gotten conflated in terms of what Section 230 does say and what some people think it should say. </p><p>HARPER: I'll open the debate on whether there should be neutrality.  There is no such thing. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>HARPER: You can't administer a neutrality rule, so don't even try. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Well, again, there has been-- </p><p>CITRON: --The telephone, no, like you're a conduit, so like there's no monitoring. </p><p>KOSSEFF: I mean, you could have no moderation at all. </p><p>CITRON: No?  Just asking. </p><p>HARPER: So, yeah, electric wires--electric wires are neutral.  Platforms are not.  They have the way they work and the way their users use them, and that's not neutral in any administrable sense. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Well, you're referring perhaps to a piece of legislation by Senator Josh Hawley, Missouri, where the commissioners from the FDC would be appointed.  They would have to certify that these platforms were politically neutral if they wanted to get those Section 230 protections that would apply, most of the things specifically the very largest platforms. </p><p>One--I guess you sort of indicated already--one, is that a good idea?  And if you did think it was a good idea, could you actually do it, like how would that actually work if you wanted to certify these platforms as being politically neutral? </p><p>HARPER: You'd have to have a federal speech agency.  Does that--that concludes my answer. </p><p>CITRON: No, keep going, right? </p><p>HARPER: It's absurd on its face, given our traditions and our constitution, to try to have any kind of federal body determine whether a platform or any speaker is neutral and fair.  We had a Fairness Doctrine at the FCC, RIP--RIP for a very long time, hopefully.  I think that debate is over.  That ship has sailed.  It's come and gone.  Yes, of course Congress will talk about it like it could happen, but it would die in the courts if it got through--got through the legislature. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Is it unconstitutional?  I mean, I think it would have to be tested.  I think it probably would be.  And I also think--even beyond the constitutional issue--practically, I mean, the FTC, even with their native advertising--I mean, they are not very comfortable in making editorial judgments on things.  So, I think there is constitutional issues, practical issues, and there also is a requirement for a super majority on the FTC. </p><p>So, that would mean that even a minority party could block Section 230 from some of the large--for the large platforms if they wanted to.  So, I think there are a lot of logistical issues as well as the constitutional issues. </p><p>CITRON: But, it might be helpful to explain why it's a constitutional issue.  It goes back, Jim, to your point about like the First Amendment, and who are the First Amendment actors?  Whose speech would be controlled by government and compelled?  It would be private actors.  Platforms are speakers, too, right?  They are private actors. </p><p>They are not the government.  So, they are not First Amendment actors that owe us freedom from regulation.  They would argue--we can sort of channel Eugene Volokh--but they would argue that they are speakers--the platforms--and its their speech, and that they should be free from government regulation.  So, I just thought it might be worth--this is the teacher in me--sort of circling back to your-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Well, that--well, that brings up what I call my woke Facebook scenario-- </p><p>CITRON: --Okay-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --which I think we may have mentioned. </p><p>CITRON: Okay. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: One day Mark Zuckerberg who--at one point he was touring the country, people wondered if he was going to run for president. </p><p>CITRON: Oh, yeah. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: What if he says one day, \"Listen, I'm very concerned about the direction of this country.  So from now on, on Facebook, you can feel free to post about your family, funny pictures, what's going on in your life, and you can--you can post about issues of racism and gender--but no Trump posts.  We don't want to hear posts about the Trump agenda, we don't want to hear about--we're going to be woke Facebook.\" </p><p>Is that not a government issue at that point--with this massive platform, so influential in our lives--could change the debate?  They may be a private actor, but they certainly have a tremendous public role. </p><p>CITRON: They have tremendous power, but they are not a public forum, and they are certainly not a-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --So that would be okay to have woke Facebook? </p><p>CITRON: Sure.  Guess what?  Go to Gab, go somewhere else, right?  Go to Twitter. </p><p>KOSSEFF: And there was a knitting forum--an online knitting forum--that made that very same choice. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Obviously Facebook-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Somewhat less than 3 billion. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yes, exactly. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: I'm not sure. </p><p>KOSSEFF: And, I mean, I think that we--we had a recent Supreme Court decision a few months ago that Justice Kavanaugh wrote, which found that there's--that a cable access station did not have the First Amendment requirement.  So, I think that really gives you an idea of the direction the Supreme Court is going with that. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: In fact, I was reading an interview with Senator Hawley, and he said--because I think--I think there were a lot of perceptions about what Section 230 called for about the--in fact, there wasn't some grand bargain decades ago about how these would operate. </p><p>And I think now, hey, times have changed.  When--when this--when this regulation was instituted, we didn't have these big platforms.  The internet was not as big, we did not have these business models.  So now it's sort of time--time for a change.  And they are tremendously influential in speech.  So, I guess we're getting to sort of the reform part of our conversation. </p><p>But just to be clear, their role in political speech, even though that may have not been sort of the topline issue back in 1996, that's certainly covered in this idea that the--of--that they can--they can choose to be neutral or not neutral.  It's not just defamation, and it's not just pornography. </p><p>HARPER: Look, Professor Citron said that Facebook is powerful, but I think you'd quickly understand the limits of Facebook's power-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah-- </p><p>HARPER: --if Mark Zuckerberg-- </p><p>CITRON: --did that-- </p><p>HARPER: --tried to declare it a no-Trump zone or something like that. </p><p>CITRON: People would leave, 100 percent.  Don't you think people would be like, \"You're kidding me, why?\" </p><p>HARPER: Well, it would likely play into Trump's hands to have-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah, yeah-- </p><p>HARPER: --this kid in Palo Alto trying to play presidential politics. </p><p>CITRON: They would have Trump (INAUDIBLE), like no?   We'd have--totally we'd have an alternate social media site that would pop up pretty fast. </p><p>HARPER: They're already out there waiting. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, sure.  Yeah. </p><p>HARPER: So--so, I don't--I don't--I mean, Congress has these concerns, but I don't think they're real.  The capacity to control the country via marionette strings is long believed but never very well demonstrated. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: I think, though, it's certainly--and I get--and as I sort of discuss this issue either on social media or elsewhere, certainly there are a lot of Republicans who are absolutely convinced that--they see that there's 20 Twitter accounts that are suspended by Republicans for every 1 that might be on the other side.  Have there been--have there been--have there been actual empirical studies or analyses looking at any of these issues? </p><p>KOSSEFF: There has been a lot of anecdotal discussion for a variety of concerns about platforms, which--can we talk about potential solutions now?  Okay. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, because-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --So, this is probably the most sort of D.C.-based-- </p><p>CITRON: --shall we just say that it's anecdotes.  And if you dig in a bit, it seems completely overblown and untrue that if you--I can come up with 10 stories about Black Lives Matter protesters who were removed from Facebook and Twitter.  And so, does that make sense?  It's like we all have our examples we can trot out. I think, empirically speaking, it seems to be pretty false.  But, let's--I welcome the studies. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: The audience may have questions on this very issue.  And we will reserve time--which I should have mentioned earlier--15 or 20 minutes if people have--and I will even ask--even look all the way over on the other side here--have questions so sort of if you want to sort of be mentally putting them together. </p><p>And--but I'm--again, to get to the issue, I'm just wondering if people grasp the difficulty of the content moderation.  At the same time, I don't want to let these companies off the hook--that they have been doing a fantastic job with content moderation, when it's clear that it is a work in progress, at best. </p><p>CITRON: I think it's going to always be a work in progress, just given the scale and given the types of problems, given the challenges and pressures from outside the United States. </p><p>What I would like to see companies do, though--and I think we've seen some of it at least with the largest actors--is to be constantly thinking and iterating and experimenting, whether it's addressing a deepfake problem by coming up with technical solutions, which is going to be very hard to do--but with new types of policies and thoughts that, if there is pressure on companies to do something and to act reasonably, then they will iterate, they will experiment.  There's no one solution. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Do you think--do you think there's a political space for that iteration because when they iterate badly--wrongly-- </p><p>CITRON: --I do-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --It seems like--at least right now--that the response is ferocious, that they cannot get it right.  And there's not like, \"Well, that was an interesting experiment that went wrong, let's see what they come up with next week.\" </p><p>CITRON: Right. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: I'm not sure that it's currently-- </p><p>HARPER: --Jim, I want to challenge your premise a little bit-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --challenge away-- </p><p>CITRON: --they are doing it-- </p><p>HARPER: --that they are not doing--they are not doing that good a job. </p><p>CITRON: Oh, yeah. </p><p>HARPER: Because we happily aren't in a position to see what it would be like if they weren't doing the job they're doing. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, we don't know.  Yes. </p><p>HARPER: The articles you referred to earlier--what's the publication, Vice? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Verge. </p><p>HARPER: Verge.  Read those articles about what the moderators are seeing-- </p><p>CITRON: --They're doing, yeah-- </p><p>HARPER: --and what they're preventing you all from seeing, and you have a little bit of respect for what they are doing.  It's one of those things.  The things we're not seeing are really, really horrible-- </p><p>CITRON: --a world without moderation is scary-- </p><p>HARPER: --and might make you--might make you think that they're doing a better job than it looks like from-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Well, indeed, some people are--criticize these content moderation policies, say, \"Let a thousand, let a million, let a billion flowers bloom.\"  Let's just put it up there, and people can decide for themselves who they want to follow or not follow. </p><p>KOSSEFF: I would throw my computers and devices out the window if that was the case. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, I wouldn't use it, right? </p><p>KOSSEFF: I would--yeah.  I mean, it would be terrible. </p><p>HARPER: Let me--I want to riff on that to talk about some future scenarios that we might have in mind now.  No technology talk would be complete without blockchain, right? </p><p>CITRON: Oh, shh, stop.  Every conference? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Literally, the answer is not blockchain. </p><p>HARPER: I've just got to get-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Listen, this is not-- </p><p>CITRON: --I'm just laying this out. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: This is not actionable investment advice. </p><p>HARPER: There are--there are future blockchain-based social networks where you can't remove content, right?  Somebody could--somebody could post it, and it's going to be there forever.  There's no corporation to ask to take it down.  It's distributed across--across the world, and it would be mathematically impossible to remove content. </p><p>So, if it's coming--it might be coming--you might be aware that you could solve this problem right now, sprinkle your magic legislative dust on this problem, and the bad actors go right over to this other place where things are uncensorable.  So, that means--that's--that means challenges to the existence or utility of defamation law.  That means that revenge porn, once up, is permanently up and can't be taken down again. </p><p>So, there's a whole world out there that could emerge and can't really be altered that I can imagine.  So, we can--we should think about--all the expectations and all the law that emerged in the past might be deeply challenged by--by future technology. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: So, 230 emerged in the past.  I think--I think the people who say things are very different now, I think that's a--that's a completely valid point.  And I think, looking at what this--what's happening now, whether this law needs to be reformed--perfectly valid.  I don't think anyone is an absolutist.  But, keeping in mind the downsides that you've mentioned of getting this sort of wrong, it's been wildly successful. </p><p>People say, \"What can government do?\"  Well, this is something government did that seemed to have worked out really well--don't want to screw it up--so being very careful, I think, about reforms.  What do those reforms look like?  And we can just sort of go down the line right here.  So, how would you go about reforming Section 230?  And feel free to comment on each other's reforms. </p><p>CITRON: And you can absolutely throw tomatoes at me, just figuratively-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--not literally.  How's that?  I think we should preserve Section 230, but it shouldn't be a free pass.  That is, Section 230 (c) (1)--we should make it conditional.  That is, we're not going to treat an interactive service, we're not going to treat online service providers as publishers or speakers, if they engage in reasonable content moderation practices, right? </p><p>And that's not looking at any given decision.  It is looking at their practices writ large.  The premise of 230--let's go back to the original purpose--was to incentivize self-monitoring.  We should go back to that purpose and condition the immunity on engaging in reasonable content moderation practices in the face of known illegality. </p><p>And it's a proposal that I have the language at the ready.  Ben Wittes and I have offered it.  I have been talking to a bunch of different senate offices.  Maybe they will be interested.  There are-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --So what--in practice, what would that do? </p><p>CITRON: It would literally--what it would do--it would mean that you get to enjoy Section 230 immunity, but it would not let the revenge pornographers off the hook, right, the sites that engage in no content moderation knowing that there's deepfake sex videos on the site. </p><p>So, if you do nothing in the face of known illegality and mischief, then you shouldn't enjoy the immunity from liability.  You haven't earned it.  But, I would say the Facebooks, the Twitters--they have extensive speech rules, they have extensive speech moderation practices with staff of--I think there are like 30,000 people at Facebook at this point.  They are engaging in reasonable content moderation practices. </p><p>It would depend on the type of speech, like if we're talking about non-consensual pornography, what's reasonable is different from what's reasonable for threats and defamation.  Maybe a hash program that Facebook is increasingly engaged in is a really good idea. </p><p>But, hashing content and using AI for threats--it's impossible because threats--how we know it's a threat?  It's contextual, right?  Stalking is as well.  Stalking is not one of those things that's inherently illegal.  You've got to look at the whole picture and context.  And so, what's reasonable in one content and approach--and we should--what reasonableness would do is incentivize experimentation--and moving with the times and with the technologies. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And is there a moderation at scale issue with that proposal, though?  I mean, it's a lot of-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yes, it would-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --It seems like it could be really hard-- </p><p>CITRON: --reasonable content.  But it's the--it's aimed at not the--any specific decision vis-a-vis content but at scale, the speech rules and practices and design.  So, it's looking at a company's approach to content moderation, the design of the site, how they writ large response to certain types of speech and problems--known problems. </p><p>And so, it--the idea is to look at it.  How are they doing it at scale?  And what is reasonable for Yelp, what's reasonable for Facebook, is certainly different from what's reasonable from Jim's--can we revive your blog for a second? </p><p>HARPER: Sure, WashingtonWatch.com. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, hey, there we go. </p><p>HARPER: There is nothing there. </p><p>CITRON: But--and my old blog, Concurring Opinions.  Like what was reasonable for five law profs running concurring opinions 10 years ago--we have like something like 300 commentators on any given day--is different if--unless--if we were the Volokh Conspiracy when it was doing its thing.  It had thousands of commentators.  So, it's--and they were like six people running it.  So, it would matter, the size of the company, who was participating in it, what kind of activity they were hosting, reasonableness, the idea of the premise of it--it's tailored to the circumstances. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: I think those--I think these are reasonable reforms. </p><p>KOSSEFF: So--well, it's about reasonableness.  But I--yeah, like--I share the concern about some of the bad actors.  I mean, there are some bad actors that--we need to figure out how to solve the problem with them.  But, my concern about a reasonableness standard--and this comes from having practiced cybersecurity law where a lot of the regulations just come down to reasonableness--is the lack of certainty as to what would be reasonable when ultimately there could be federal appellate judges who perhaps don't necessarily understand the technology. </p><p>CITRON: Could we ever have specific rules for cybersecurity?  They would get outmoded in five seconds. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Well, but we do.  We have standard--we have NIST standards, and we have some state laws that have incorporated the NIST standards. </p><p>CITRON: But, they are broad--they are standards.  They are broad. </p><p>KOSSEFF: But, they give some controls, and they give specific controls.  And I think that without any certainty at all, just having reasonableness--and when you're conditioning other people's speech on this reasonableness, that's what I struggle with, with having just reasonableness for Section 230.  I wonder how much of the free speech benefit there would be. </p><p>And perhaps we don't want that.  But, I do really worry about the lack of certainty if you just have reasonableness.  I think in other areas of the law, there are--isn't speech that's dependent on it.  But, for this, there is.  So, that's what--that would be my concern with just having reasonableness. </p><p>HARPER: So, reasonableness is really hard to administer, but it's probably the only--only thing to do.  The problem is that you've got this legislation in place that has this language.  And you've got a Congress that you can't rely on to do the careful little cut and pruning.  So, my solution-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --Very skeptical, very cynical-- </p><p>HARPER: --is to--you think--yeah, I've been here a couple years.  My solution is to go back in time, not have Section 230, and just let common law develop up to today.  You'd have the closest thing we can approximate to reasonableness. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, you'd have reasonableness.  I mean, we'd have negligence, right, Jim?  I mean, in that world, reasonableness would be so litigated, we'd have negligence (INAUDIBLE), right? </p><p>HARPER: I think we'd actually--I think we'd actually know better what was reasonable than we do now because we've had a flat rule against liability, and it's been mostly-- </p><p>CITRON: --Right-- </p><p>HARPER: --people getting booted out of court-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --cannot go back in time. </p><p>HARPER: And it can't go back in time. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: I have that (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>HARPER: So, we have this piece of legislation. </p><p>CITRON: No time-- </p><p>HARPER: --I don't trust Congress to change it.  And you do have courts.  As Professor Citron has pointed out, you do have courts hemming back on it in places, back to pure publisher-type protections on liability and not where a site is kind of in the business of procuring trafficking, or whatever it may be, so, yes, reasonableness.  But, the immediate proposal I have is to keep 230 in place and let judicial opinions continue to work over the law. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And let the companies continue to innovate and iterate. </p><p>HARPER: Absolutely. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: This often comes up, before we get to Jeff.  But, can't we just give people--let people just post on these sites but let people handle the filters?  Why can't there be just more filters that, \"Here's the kind of content I like to see,\" and that's all I will see.  That seems like-- </p><p>HARPER: --I built that on WashingtonWatch.com.  You could blank out of the users, you could blank out particular words. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Why doesn't that happen with these platforms today?  Why isn't there just a lot more tools available to people? </p><p>HARPER: I don't know. </p><p>CITRON: They have some block lists, like Twitter enables at least (INAUDIBLE) with block lists. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: It's very crude, right? </p><p>CITRON: Yeah.  No, I think they should better on that. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: What about--any reforms? </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah.  So, I have two.  One is a fairly specific one, and one is broader.  The specific one is I think a lot of the sites that we're all concerned about I don't think should be entitled to Section 230 protections.  The problem is Section 230 is often decided at a very early stage, so there's no discovery to determine whether the platform has contributed to the development of the content, in which case it doesn't receive Section 230 protection. </p><p>So, I'd like to see some sort of standard where in cases where the judge believes there's reasonable cause that the platform has contributed to the content, to allow limited discovery on that issue.  We do that for personal jurisdiction.  I think that would be a way to go after the bad actors that never should be getting protected by Section 230, while still preserving protections for the sites that really are not contributing to the material.  So, that's one thing. </p><p>The second is--I mean, I hear from people on all sides about various issues with 230, ranging from there shouldn't be any moderation to there shouldn't be any protection at all, and they should be moderating everything.  And this is all anecdotal.  And it's all, \"I have this specific story.\"  We do not have good empirical evidence, and it is such an important issue.  I mean, it affects the speech of everyone in the United States essentially and the ability to receive information. </p><p>And so, I would like to see a commission--a congressionally created commission--to really gather a good factual basis for this before even proposing specific solutions because we don't have that right now.  And I'm really worried when I hear all these different stories, which are really opposed to one another.  And I don't--I don't know whether any of the solutions will actually pass.  But, I would like to get a much better factual record before we make any decisions on what to do with platforms or 230. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: What is--what--upside, downside risk?  What is sort of the upside of smart legislation, and what is sort of the downside of getting it wrong?  Again, we've seen--I don't think there's any debate that Section 230 has been one of the growth--legislative foundations of the entire internet economy--obviously, handle with care. </p><p>So, what--so what is the--what's the upside of getting these reforms right?  What does the internet look like?  And what is sort of the downside of just, \"Boy, we got it wrong.  What does this all look like?\"  So, a little speculation, whoever wants to take a crack at that. </p><p>CITRON: Look, what the upside is, that if we crafted it well, right, I think if we conditioned the immunity on reasonable content moderation practices or denied really bad actors the ability to enjoy that immunity, we'd have a lot more speech online, right?  We would not have stalking, harassment and threats, and non-consensual pornography, which drives people offline.  And more often, those people are women and people from marginalized communities.  So, there is an upside.  There's actually a speech upside. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Any other upsides, or there is just downsides and getting it wrong?  How could it be better? </p><p>HARPER: I see far more downsides than upsides to any changes--and because of the practical problem of getting it through Congress.  I just don't trust Congress to do--we could craft something brilliant, the four of us up here or all the folks in the room, and get together, and we could put together a perfect legislative history and send it down the street.  And what we get back might be something radically different.  So, I don't--I would be very hesitant to open up 230 to Congress right now. </p><p>KOSSEFF: I mean, the decisions are being made by lawyers.  I assume there are a number of lawyers in this room. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Yes. </p><p>KOSSEFF: We're all risk-averse people.  And so, decisions about moderation have to at least get cleared by the lawyers.  And you see what happened after the sex trafficking amendment.  Craigslist, days before it was signed into law, got rid of its personal section because they said it's just too much risk.  And that's going to--I mean, I think changes to Section 230--and we might decide it's a good thing. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Were you surprised at that outcome? </p><p>KOSSEFF: No, no. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Yeah. </p><p>KOSSEFF: I mean-- </p><p>CITRON: We worked on it, like with different offices.  It was depressing what came out of the sausage factory, like we tried. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yeah, I mean, I-- </p><p>CITRON: --What comes out of committee was depressing, and what was signed was depressing. </p><p>KOSSEFF: I testified in the House Judiciary Committee-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --in support of the limited exception for intentionally facilitating sex trafficking. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah. </p><p>KOSSEFF: What ended up--it's a standard that is-- </p><p>CITRON: --No-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --yeah, you really can't comprehend it.  So, the lawyers basically will just be risk-averse.  So, I mean, I think that I'm definitely not opposed to Section 230 changes.  I just think they need to be really, really carefully crafted and deliberate and not just sort of some legislative compromise that gets attached to an Appropriations bill right before the December recess.  I mean, that's not what we want. </p><p>HARPER: That's everything these days. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yes, exactly. </p><p>CITRON: And that's--so, FOSTA and SESTA is Jim's proof of concept, like your worry, Jim, is FOSTA and SESTA. </p><p>HARPER: It's been validated already, yeah. </p><p>CITRON: No, and I'm a Pollyanna, so I'm always engaged and happy to help offices.  So, I'm not going to give up on the enterprise.  But, that--FOSTA and SESTA--is what you're talking about, like-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --I'm going to ask one more question, and then wanted to (INAUDIBLE) for them with a great panel, then I'm going to ask questions.  So whether you're a Pollyanna, pessimist, be prepared.  I think we'll bring mics around.  So, I--so, if 230 was eliminated, what does that world look like? </p><p>Do we--again, do we still have--do we still have these platforms?  Does it destroy their business models?  Is it something--is it something radically different, or is it just a--what does that world look like if we did real harm in the effort of reforming to this provision? </p><p>KOSSEFF: So, I don't think we know for sure because for the entire modern internet, we've had Section 230.  So, I mean, there are a bunch of different outcomes.  Platforms could take the approach that, \"Okay, well, the Common Law and First Amendment give me more protections if I don't do any moderation,\" which--I think most of us would say that's not a great outcome. </p><p>They could also become risk-averse and just say we're not going to allow user content because that just exposes us to too much risk.  Or perhaps it will be somewhere in between.  But, I can't say with any certainty what would happen because that would really be new territory for us. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And perhaps because you would have thrown your computer out the window. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Yes, exactly. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: So, you would just not know what was going on on the internet. </p><p>KOSSEFF: Exactly. </p><p>HARPER: Brent Skorop and Jennifer Huddleston at the Mercatus Center have a good article on the common law developments that they saw coming along when 2030 was passed--a trend--because publishing has changed--a trend toward treating platforms as conduits, that aren't and can't be responsible for what appears on their sites. </p><p>So, that gives me confidence that the long-term outcome--I know it's debatable--but it gives me confidence that the long-term outcome would probably be good.  We'd get a good result, where the economically efficient and free-speech, protective result would pertain. </p><p>But, in the short term, there would be a stampede against the platforms of litigation.  If the repeal of 230 were to signal that the federal law is opposed to protections for liability, then that could actually undercut the proper common law development.  So, I don't know how you get--I don't know how you get there from here.  But if you ask the question in the abstract, what happens if 2030 goes away, I think common law and First Amendment protections for platforms would arrive at about the place where 2030 has gone. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Over time, over time. </p><p>HARPER: Perhaps with some narrow tweaks so that the worst examples of egregious behavior that's supported by platforms would be impinged upon and would go away, so-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Lots (INAUDIBLE) go to questions. </p><p>CITRON: We can go-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --We'll go to questions.  Fantastic.  All right, if you have a question, raise your hand, and we will send the mic over to you.  I will start with that table right there, the gentleman with the laptop.  If you care to say where you're from, feel free. </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah, Carl Szabo with NetChoice.  James, you asked about the value of Section 230.  Mike Niznik (SP) actually has a really good paper that came out, $440 billion over the next decade is the value.  You asked about content moderation.  We actually at NetChoice have a report coming out shortly that aggregates all the transparency reports from Facebook, Google, and Twitter.  They removed in six months 5 billion accounts and posts, so there is active content moderation. </p><p>But, I do want to hit on something that you brought up at the end.  What happens if we get rid of Section 230?  And Section 230, Jeff, you point out in your book, goes to encourage content moderation.  And 8chan, it doesn't really matter if they lose Section 230, right, because they don't engage in content moderation.  Danielle, you brought up Grindr, which seems to not engage in a lot of content moderation, do you expect to see a rise in hate and offensive and terrorist content as platforms move away from the risky content moderation towards a, \"Well, we achieve total immunity if we do nothing?\" </p><p>CITRON: That's just not true, though.  They don't risk it by engaging in content moderation.  You're saying if we change Section 230? </p><p>QUESTION: Yeah. </p><p>CITRON: Is that--oh, so sorry.  I just wanted to make sure I understood the premise of the question.  So, we wipe out Section 230, you're saying?  And then, we wipe out Section 230, and we live in a world which--prodigy.  We're afraid of being treated as publishers.  And so, we engage in no moderation--content moderation.  And I think that's in part what Quinta Jurecic and I worried about in a paper that we wrote about FOSTA and SESTA, that we would have either both bad silincryptus (SP) of no moderation or too much moderation. </p><p>So, I share your concern, right, that we're going to end up looking like either 8chan--it's like the Wild West--or that it's family friendly--that it's just overly censored, just what we thought 25-whatever years ago. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: I'm jumping back in.  I mean, do you think that (INAUDIBLE) companies, they would just love to be out of this business, they would love to be out of-- </p><p>CITRON: --I don't (SP) think so-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --They would love to be out of the figuring out what is hate speech, what is not hate speech? </p><p>CITRON: Spam?  Like--oh, yeah, they would like Europe off their backs, </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>but that's not because of us.  Does that make sense?  Like the hate speech conversation, that is because of Europe.  Truly that pressure is less coming from-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --But I would also just say that they would love to be out of this business, but they need to be in this business. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, well-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --This is--this is a product that--and a service they're making a lot of money off of.  They--this is part of the job. </p><p>HARPER: It should be said, at least once in this event, that the users out there are a little bit responsible, too. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: We're crazy. </p><p>CITRON: Totally. </p><p>HARPER: When it comes to fake news, what ever happened to, \"Don't believe everything you read,\" right? </p><p>CITRON: Oh, man, it's a bummer. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Another question.  On that side--you're very quiet over there, and I'll come--I'll get back to you.  That table right there--right next to Mike.  How convenient. </p><p>QUESTION: My name is Roger Cocceti (SP), and during the 1990s, I was the IBM executive responsible for worldwide internet policy and thus had a front-row seat in the development of Section 230.  There was an important piece of the puzzle the panel hasn't discussed, and it leads me to think of what might be a blunderbuss way to deal with the issue. </p><p>One of the elements that went into the assumptions that we all made at that time was that the future would be very much like the past.  And most of us had in mind, at the time 230 was approved, computer bulletin boards.  That's what we thought of as content.  How could a--and some day most--the thinking was that some day there would be a 100 million people on the internet, and there would be 100,000 websites. </p><p>And everyone really assumed that there would be Facebook in the future, in fact there would be thousands of Facebooks, and none of them would have more than like 2 percent market share.  And everyone assumed there would be a Google in the future, in fact there would be hundreds of Googles, and none of them would have more than 1 percent market share.  There would be a distributed system like the internet itself is distributed.  So, there was never any expectation of enormity that we see today. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: And your question, sir? </p><p>QUESTION: And the question is, perhaps that assumption that went into thinking--and because of that, it was assumed that the internet was going to be made up of thousands and thousands of small businesses that could never possibly monitor 100 million people posting on their bulletin boards. </p><p>The question, then, is if we--and I realize this is a blunderbuss solution--but think about it for a moment.  Suppose we went as far as to say any network that has a billion users or a market value of a trillion dollars is by definition a publisher with the same rights and duty to care that the Northwest Current and the Georgetowner Today have when they post want ads--or they have to look at it and make a judgment.  And at that scale, you are a publisher, and no gray area.  You have the same responsibility that a call-in radio program or a neighborhood newspaper has of duty of care when you reach that size. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: All right.  Do you want to jump in on that one? </p><p>HARPER: I might think too abstractly about most things, but I have a hard time thinking that justice changes--the terms of justice in the world change--if the size of your network goes above 999,999,999.  So, I want--I want the rules to be rooted in justice and not administrative stuff that keeps the lawyers working. </p><p>Either it's--either there's--either you're doing it right, or you're doing it wrong.  There's reasonable, and there's unreasonable, and the law should hew as closely as possible to that, not, \"You've got to be reasonable once you've reached a certain threshold of users or market capitalization,\" or whatever the case may be. </p><p>So, that type of rule exists all over the place.  And you see lots of small businesses staying small, so they don't have to provide health insurance to their employees.  And I don't want more of that, not in this area. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: All right, unless--gentleman right--right in front of me. </p><p>QUESTION: Good morning.  Thank you for doing this.  I'm Jeff Jarvis from the Newmark School of Journalism at CUNY.  And I'm also a member of a--pardon for the long title--Transatlantic Working Group on Content Moderation and Freedom of Expression organized by Susan Ness sitting two people from the left of me. </p><p>And I've learned a lot.  I just want to just throw two quick ideas out to get your response.  One from that group that I've learned is that maybe we should concentrate not on content but on behaviors.  You're trying to get rid of behaviors, and that's a different--that's what law does.  And there's a suggestion coming from one member of the group that there ought to be national internet courts where matters of legality should go to a court where we negotiate legal norms in public with due process. </p><p>And in terms of the legal but irritating--which is what the UK wants to go after--now we have Facebook's oversight board, where they're trying to establish that.  And we'll see how that goes.  So, I wonder about your views of these kinds of efforts to, in essence, come up with new common law through different paths as we negotiate this very new landscape. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Danielle, you've written about this quite a bit. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah.  No, in 2014 in my book, Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, I argue that we should--a company should engage in what I call a different venue--technological due process--that they should be transparent and accountable for their content moderation practices, that is--it could be as a matter of law--but that they should. </p><p>And I'm not sure if I see--and maybe Jeff and Jim can join me on this--the difference, conduct and speech, the line is really blurry.  And so, the difference between content and conduct, yes, it's true, I think we should be more careful to realize that some speech actually is tantamount to conduct in that stalking, harassment, workplace sexual harassment, we can make--there are some moments where we can say, that's truly like a bludgeon, an instrument rather than conveying a message or a viewpoint. </p><p>But, largely it's really hard.  So, I'm not sure if that would be--I feel like I have my speech friends with me here--that would be--conduct and speech are one and the same.  I'm going to channel Katy McKinnon here a little bit, like they are--a lot of conduct is expressive and vice versa. </p><p>HARPER: Yeah, but I don't want to talk about that. </p><p>CITRON: No, no, you talk about what you want to talk about.  Yeah. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Free speech. </p><p>CITRON: Right. </p><p>HARPER: A national internet court. </p><p>CITRON: Oh, yeah. </p><p>HARPER: It sounds like a thing you'll get if you just wait around for a couple years, and the older judges move out, and the younger judges move in.  So, I don't know about a specialized court for this.  And I actually want to challenge--because you mentioned it a second time now--the idea that companies should be providing due process and transparency.  I'm a big, big fan of transparency. </p><p>CITRON: And not (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>HARPER: --In the governmental context, right. </p><p>CITRON: But, just that we could require-- </p><p>HARPER: --But true transparency in your content moderation would be a huge gift to your adversary because over on 4chan--or is it 8chan now, I'm a fuddy-duddy, I think of 4chan--they would go and figure out how to game the rules you've just published-- </p><p>CITRON: --Yeah, but just say we can't-- </p><p>HARPER: --And do the thing that falls right on the line between the two. </p><p>CITRON: That's nonsense, no. </p><p>HARPER: It is not nonsense. </p><p>CITRON: It's nonsense. </p><p>HARPER: They work hard, smart people-- </p><p>CITRON: --Of course-- </p><p>HARPER: --unfortunately socially maladapted smart people-- </p><p>CITRON: --platforms are smart, too.  You can't game us-- </p><p>HARPER: --working very hard to game published--published rules.  That's a gift, I think, to them. </p><p>CITRON: That's law. </p><p>HARPER: Right. </p><p>CITRON: Like so you're saying we shouldn't have law that's published, and we can game? </p><p>HARPER: No, no, but it's gameable, and you have to have laws that are--are--that don't have too many nooks and crannies because people will game them rather than just live right. </p><p>KOSSEFF: So, I would say there has to be more transparency than there is right now.  And we're getting better.  I think today compared to three or four years ago, there is much more transparency, but we have a long way to go.  And this is one thing that I really stress to the tech companies, is that Section 230 is not a constitutional right. </p><p>This is something that Congress has provided.  And there are some people who will say Section 230 isn't a benefit to the tech companies, and I think that's nonsense.  Of course, it's a benefit to the tech companies.  It's a benefit to the public as well for free speech platforms.  But, tech companies do receive--I mean, they have been able to structure business models around this. </p><p>And I have no problem with some sort of transparency basically being a premise of Section 230 because we need to have a better idea of what's going on.  We haven't, and now you see what's going on now with the debate, which is chaotic, so I-- </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: --Where is the transparency--so when someone--an accountant gets suspended.  It's not a mystery.  You're like, \"Oh, that makes sense, I get why that happened.\"  And the person should have that kind of expectation if they engage in that behavior.  They will understand it's a likely result. </p><p>KOSSEFF: I think that--and I think that can maybe help improve user behavior compared to where it is now but also more transparency about the broader policies.  I mean, every--the platforms have policies posted, but they are fairly broad.  And I think getting more specificity as to how the decisions are made, I see that as being a benefit overall. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: Shorter and clearer policies.  The group over here--reluctant to ask a question, but--one straight and then sort of rudely pointing with my red pen right there. </p><p>QUESTION: Elizabeth Banker.  I'm with Internet Association.  I have a question about Professor Citron's proposal.  As many commentators have noted, one of the advantages of Section 230 is that it does allow companies that are sued to get rid of the cases fairly quickly through a motion to dismiss, asserting the 230 immunity. </p><p>It sounds like your proposal would require litigation before being able to get to that stage.  And I'm just wondering about the impact on smaller companies.  We did talk about how, without Section 230, the bigger companies would have the resources to do more litigation while smaller companies wouldn't necessarily have the same resources.  So, is there a way that your idea kind of takes into account that small business impact? </p><p>CITRON: So, reasonableness itself would.  What is reasonable is different from a small--but it doesn't address your excellent point about the cost of litigation, right?  What's reasonable we can adjudicate, and it would be very different from what's reasonable for small than--versus big, right? </p><p>And it's true that there would be costs.  At the same time, we shouldn't forget that there are costs of the current system.  There's no expense.  There is dismissals.  And what happens is we lose a lot.  We lose a lot in terms of speech of victims who go offline.  We have a lot of harm that is now externalized and borne only by individuals and not by the revenge porn operator. </p><p>So, I guess what I would say is I recognize that that would be true, would be more challenging and expensive for the small company to face litigation than it would Facebook and even if it cashes out that you have less onerous rules for small than big, that there would be the expense, of course.  You might have more censorship creep and collateral censorship for the small versus the big because they can't litigate. </p><p>At the same time, some of those small actors are the folks running revenge porn sites.  And so, I think we can't overlook that there are meaningful trade-offs, and it's not all trade-offs in speech in one direction, which is just that poor provider, right?  There is also a lot of trade-offs for victims who--without any change they will be driven offline. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: A question over here, maybe the gentleman right directly-- </p><p>QUESTION: --Hi, thank you.  I just wanted to pry into something Jim brought up at the end that I think is a really important point.  And I was wondering kind of what the panel would think about this.  The question posed at today's event is, should we reform Section 230?  And I think that there's two halves to that, right?  We have our academic question of, well, is there possible ways that 230 can be improved?  And then, there's the other side, which is, should we kick off that process here in D.C. and in Congress? </p><p>And I think there seems to be complete agreement on the panel that 230 has been very beneficial--is very important to the internet that we all enjoy today.  So, my fairly quick question is, with Congress not necessarily being trusted with a lot of tech policy--or even policy more generally to get things through in a way that really gives us what we want--would you kick off that process?  Would you take that risk that potentially Congress could undermine Section 230 fatally just to get through potentially reforms that you see as beneficial? </p><p>KOSSEFF: I mean, we have Article 1, which pretty much says they have to.  I mean, they are the ones who are charged with it.  And I think looking at it is one thing.  And, I mean, one of the jobs of Congress is to look at the laws that they've passed.  So, I think just--I would agree there are some challenges that Congress has with understanding technology, and I'll just be as broad a possible in saying that.  But, that's not a reason to not look at laws.  I think there are efforts to revive OTA, for example, which would help inform that and is absolutely essential when we're dealing with-- </p><p>HARPER: --The Office of Technology Assessment-- </p><p>KOSSEFF: --Yes.  Yeah, which basically was Congress's in-house technology think tank.  And that sort of thing--so, yeah, I think Congress has to look at laws.  Whether they should do anything is something different.  I'd like my commission to help inform that. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah. </p><p>KOSSEFF: But, yeah, I mean, we have no other choice. </p><p>HARPER: Your question, I think, helps--helps show that we're kind of talking about two different types of governmental bodies.  Do we trust the Legislature, or do we trust the Judiciary more?  The talk of the common law is over on the judiciary side.  It might be handled better there.  No question that the world of litigation could be reformed quite a bit itself, so the costs that the earlier question referred to are serious and not to be forgotten. </p><p>Maybe familiarity breeds contempt, but I worked in Congress, and I have been a Congress watcher for a lot of years, and I don't think I would try to run anything through there.  We're much better off keeping 230 where it is and letting case by case perhaps trim it back where appropriate. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: We have time for only one more question.  It needs to be concise, powerful--so, if you're going to raise your hand--if you raise your hand, there's going to be a--okay, all right, this is a biggie.  Wait for the mic. </p><p>HARPER: Wait for the mic. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah. </p><p>HARPER: Everybody needs to hear you. </p><p>QUESTION: Will Duffield, Cato Institute.  These private moderation systems that these platforms manage are essentially private legal systems, and in order for them to work--to get buy-in--they need to be legitimate in someone's eyes.  In whose eyes should they attempt to legitimate themselves--users, states, the population at large?  What renders these private governance systems legitimate or not? </p><p>HARPER: The market. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah. </p><p>HARPER: Cato Institute, I had to--you teed it right up. </p><p>CITRON: Crazy response. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: You do not know the answer to that question. </p><p>HARPER: But, the question allows me to put an important gloss on what I said about transparency.  Transparency I do think would be a gift to people who are trying to game your system.  But, if transparency will give your users and your governmental overseers confidence that what you are doing is right, then, okay, go ahead.  But, you're going to have problems with your--with your adversaries because of that transparency, too. </p><p>PETHOKOUKIS: All right.  I think that will have to be it.  All-star panel, all-star audience, thank you very much for coming. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1J-M351-F15W-H32T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

PIERRE, ANALYST, SANFORD C BERNSTEIN: All right, I think we will get started. Good morning everyone. I'm Kevin St. Pierre. I cover consumer finance and mid-cap banks for Bernstein. I'm pleased to have with us today <person><nameText>Ken Chenault, </nameText></person>Chairman and CEO of American ExpressI'm sure most of you know. Ken, thank you very much for joining us. So, the plan is I'll moderate a discussion for about 30 minutes or so with Ken covering the company's strategic vision and industry controversies and then I'll start mixing in some questions from the audience. So, as questions arise, please fill out the cards and we'll be going around collecting them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, Ken maybe we could start out with one of the big issues that's on investors' minds and right before this presentation in this room was Citiand talking about the Costco relationship and how they felt it was going to be ROA, ROE accretive for them. Maybe you could talk to us a bit about the decision to let that relationship and you've said that they were looking for a credit utility, but maybe update us and give us your view on that.</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMERICAN EXPRESS: Sure. I think what's important first is to put in a little bit of context how we think about the business, what we were trying to do. And so around 15 to 18 months ago, I thought it was very important that we get some visibility of what was happening in the Co-Brand space, because clearly the Co-Brand environment was not going to get more benign. It has certainly become more competitive. And my view was whether than wait until the agreement was up, in fact was to negotiate with a range of major Co-Brand partners that we had like Delta, like Starwood, like Cathay Pacific, Iberia and renew early, so we would have visibility on what we would do in the Co-Brand space.</p><p>And also very importantly because we have a range of opportunities in our proprietary businesses and in our GNS business, that we achieve very good returns. And so, it was critical that we have that type of perspective, so we approach Costco proactively and said that we wanted to negotiate early with them. What I would point out is, with every other Co-Brand partner, Delta, Starwood, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Iberia; we were able to sign them. With Costco, what became very clear as I've said pretty consistently, is their position to change to that they were focused more on a credit utility, and I think what's that's very critical with American Expressis that we are very focused on delivering differentiated value. And if you look at the fact and anyone who understands Costco knows that they are frequently negotiating with their suppliers. We had a 16-year agreement with Costco and that 16-year agreement was really based on the creativity, the innovation, the differentiation that we brought to Costco, and I am frankly very proud about what we delivered to Costco over those 16 years.</p><p>But the reality is their priority is the exchange, which they are certainly entitled to change their priorities. But, I think what's very, very important is that our business model is really built on offering differentiated products and services, and obviously we're a disciplined buyer, and we want to make sure that we are in relationships and partnerships in businesses where we can deliver appropriate shareholder returns over the moderate to long term. And as I've been very, very clear, the numbers just did not add up.</p><p>What was also important is there were certain terms in the contract that would have been more restrictive on us. There were certain terms in the contract from a credit standpoint that I did not think would be appropriate relative to our economics and our risk profile. And I think what is critical is that we had the opportunity, even though we knew there would be some short-term pain that we knew we had a range of growth initiatives that had a long runway for growth that would deliver better economics for our shareholders. Now I think what is critical here is that I think as a number of you know, and I know Ajay Banga spoke today, and made this point and his CFO made this point several weeks ago is I think they're also a disciplined buyer, and what his CFO said, I don't know exactly what Ajay said, but what I understand is that they were very challenged from a shareholder standpoint to make the economics work.</p><p>And so at the end of the day as a disciplined buyer, I don't think you do deals where you can't make money over the moderate long term, and I don't think you do deals where you reallocate your funding sources to a situation in the very long-term, where you're not going to be able to generate the appropriate level of the economics, particularly when you have a wide range of alternatives to generate that growth. The other point that I would make is that we were able to demonstrate with the signing of Charles Schwab that we have the capacity to do Co-Brand deals, they're going to be a range as you know of Co-Brand deals that will be coming up over the next 12 to 18 months. I think it's very positive that we have visibility and we understand where we stand with our existing Co-Brand partners that we were able to renew those deals except for Costco.</p><p>And so what I would say is that, I think that we delivered and raised the bar each year in the 16 years with Costco, but I don't believe in doing a deal that is not going to generate appropriate economic returns for our shareholders in the moderate long term. And I also feel that we have a range of opportunities that will allow us to grow and achieve the appropriate financial objectives for our company. And the other thing that I think is critical as a result of not having the Costco deal; it also allows us to do a range of partnerships with other retailers, not just Co-Brand, but other types of marketing partnerships as we go forward.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: So the follow-up question that I get from investors is, isn't this -- is Costco a one-off, is it a unique situation or isn't this indicative of a trend that's likely to continue perhaps snowball with retailers, merchants looking for better terms for themselves, and won't that continue to be a trend and invite into profitability as we go forward?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Look, I think the reality is that we've been very clear that the Co-Brand space has become more competitive. As I said earlier, we were able to negotiate renewals with all of the Co-Brand partners that I listed at appropriate economic terms that I think are in the strong interest of our shareholders. And I think it really depends on the Co-Brand partner, and if someone in fact, which is always the case, is just focused on price alone.</p><p>I think, it might be useful just a little bit of history on Costcos starting off from the beginning is, we called on Costco for several years before we actually did a deal with them; and it's very simple what they said to us, which was basically a cost play is, the discount rate is too high. And then we said, look, we're going to change our approach and I think this was creative when we said at that time to the CEO Jim Sinegal, what are your most important levers that you want to pull in your business? And he said, I want to retain warehouse club memberships and want to gain more warehouse club memberships. I said what if we could put together a business proposition that would allow you to gain more warehouse club memberships, and in fact increase your retention level? And so we structured a very innovative deal.</p><p>And so I think what's incumbent upon us, which is true in the overall marketplace is to come up with creative ideas that offer a differentiated model that allow us to generate attractive ideas. Now, the reality is someone can always at a point of time say; I, in fact, want to get the money in the short term. The question is going to be what happens over the moderate to long term, and the ability of the provider to in fact continue to differentiate the product.</p><p>And what we've seen in some Co-Brand situations where it's just about the money is the sustainability has really not been there. And so what we are focused on is moderate to long term. And I think that we'll continue to selectively go after Co-Brands. That was our position before that is our position now. We said we didn't want to do hundreds of Co-Brands; we wanted to do selective Co-Brands. That's why I feel very good about the Charles Schwab Co-Brand.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Stepping up from Co-Brand, card issuance consumer cards in general, what do you say to people who question the sustainability over profitability when you're competing against other issuers who are earning much lower returns are satisfied happy with much lower returns than American Express? How are you able to maintain your profitability when you're competing against others who can accept lower?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Yes, so here's our -- I'd answer that in several ways. First, I think it's really positive. Last quarter, we had a 29% ROE. Our target is a 25% ROE. I'm not embarrassed about that. I think that's good. I think that gives us a range of optionality in our business. I'm glad we have a range of businesses with growth opportunities that generate attractive returns. But as I have been very, very clear, our floor is not -- we're not going to do a deal unless it generates 25% ROE, what I would say is it gives us a range of flexibility. Now, I don't want to do things that lose money, but I want to be very, very clear that we're going to do deals that are in the moderate-to-long term interest of our company even though some of those deals maybe below and substantially below a 25% ROE. However, the target of a 25%. We believe, when we look at the range of businesses we are in, the growth opportunities, that we can achieve that. So I don't see that as a disadvantage; and as I said before, with Costco the numbers did not add up, and I don't really see that as the issue for us in my view is, I want to continue to grow in businesses that generate very attractive returns.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Shifting away from the industry competition, one topic that you've highlighted consistently over the past few years is the impact of digitization on the payments business. How will the convergence of online and offline commerce play out over the next few years and what role will American Expressplay?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Yes, I think one of the most profound developments, not just in payments and commerce, but in a range of industries is the convergence of online and offline. And I think what's very, very important is that American ExpressI think is better positioned in the digital transformation and will be even more relevant, because we have the largest integrated payments platform in the world.</p><p>Now what's critical about that is that if you go through our business we in fact have relationships with millions of end user card members. We have relationships with millions of merchants. If we look at what's happening in commerce and with digital companies and payments companies, talk about convergence of online, offline, there is an increase in convergence between commerce and payments of commerce companies that are getting involved in aspects of payments and payments companies getting involved in aspects of commerce. But what's central to that is the information and the data. And so this close loop that we talk about of information of the end user, information from the merchant, and understanding of what purchases took place online and offline, what time those purchases were made, become increasingly important.</p><p>And so you find a number of digital companies trying to figure out ways that they're going to have access to online information and to offline information, as well as online information because that becomes very, very important going forward. So I think having that opportunity -- I think what's also critical is that if you look at what we've done over the years, American Expresswas the first company to securely connect a card member's account to a social media platform as we did with Foursquare, as we are doing with Twitter, as we've done with Facebook. I think the deals we've done with Uber, the deals we've done with Amazon and Shop with Points. So I think what is very, very important is that convergence is changing.</p><p>Now there are a few other points I'd make from a broad industry perspective is Forrester Research, I believe -- I think I've got this number close to right says that 8% of retail spending is online, 30% of that is mobile; projected to grow by 2018 to 11%. But, I think there is a very important point that people miss. What's also projected is that 75% of the retail sales that are offline will be web enabled, meaning they will touch at some point in the commerce journey with a digital device. That means it's very important that American Expressis where our customers are. And so the opportunity impact with an integrated payments platform to give people the opportunity to connect. And then one of the capability we have is our credit authorizations platform, which actually integrates the data from the end user customer and the merchant. So, we literally when you're using your card, we actually are running a model on -- every time you use your card what's the level of spending that you can do and that's personalized. Well, we're also able to use that close loop information for the environment that we're in to manage our credit or frauds. Our fraud rates are 50% lower than Visa and MasterCard to provide targeted marketing offers. So, I think that this integrated payments platform is going to be very, very important going forward. And I think it's critical that they're going to be some payment companies that are going to stay in the payments space, and I think they run a risk if they don't understand the value that customers are looking for that there are commerce companies that can provide certain types of value that are similar to payments companies and vice versa going forward.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: At the onset of the mobile revolution, there were some who feared that the big tech companies whether it's Apple, Google, Samsung would seek to disintermediate the credit card, and that's sort of given way that this cautious optimism as they've partnered with the card issuers essentially, there are still some who fear that over time, those companies will seek a greater piece of the economics, what do you say to that.</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Look, I think it's always prudent to be very focused on what are all the different scenarios. But I'd remind you wasn't that long ago, five years or six years ago, where the questions I would get is would mobile wallets disintermediate payment networks. That was the view; that was a question at these types of meetings that I would get constantly. What's happened is that in fact there is an understanding that the payments infrastructure to people who really want to get involved in credit and in fraud, it is complex and I think what is important for Apple and important in general.</p><p>As I said before we're agnostic relative to form factor. I don't care if plastic goes away. That's not what the relevant point is. If you look at the Apple Wallet, which I'm excited about Apple, I'm excited about what we're doing. I'm excited about the implementation of Apple, even though it's in its early stages what is very critical and it's one of the signposts, that I think you want to look at as you see companies navigate through this digital transformation, is what are some of the core attributes that have to be retained. For us, it's the closed loop. And so the Apple Wallet really acts as a pass-through wallet, where I have the direct relationship with the merchant and the end-user customer, and my closed loop information is preserved.</p><p>And I think you will see in any deals that we do, that's what you should look for. When you see announcements of different mobile wallets coming out is our closed loop being preserved, are we having direct relationships with the end user, because that becomes very, very important, that direct relationship because that gives us the continuing ability to differentiate our products and services.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Beyond technology, some of the new initiatives that you've launched, a common theme is the concept of AmEx being a more inclusive brand with things like every day serving and plenty, maybe you could describe some what you're seeing in some of those initiatives and have you been successful in changing the perception of your brand?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Yes, I think what's very, very important just from a little bit of a history lesson over a 165 years, and it's something I remind people in the Company is American Expressstarted off as freight forwarding company. And the reality is our Travelers Cheque business did not have any income requirement at all. The attributes that really have driven our brand and I think will be, as I said even more relevant in this digital transformation, very importantly our trust, security and service. So, if we think right now about all that's going on with personal information and financial data, I think the trust that American Expresshas built in the marketplace, and the infrastructure and the capabilities we have in the end-to-end process give us a major advantage.</p><p>What we're seeing is increasing levels of digital engagement from younger customers in our products and services. AmEx every day that we launched in March 2014, last year alone was 10% of our new card acquisitions. As I said, what we've been able to do with Uber, what we've been able to do with Facebook, our philosophy is that we want to be where our card members want to be.</p><p>As we've seen with Serve, but what's important there is that 44% of those customers are under 35, and what we've seen in our brand research is our brand value has actually increased year-over-year as you look at -- into brand and other brand valuation sources, and I think it was two years ago we had John Hayes, our Chief Marketing Officer, at an investor presentation go through certain measurements and how the brand is valued. And one of things we saw is that when AmEx Card Members who were aware of Serve or Bluebird, they actually had a 30% higher view of the brand than those who didn't.</p><p>And I think part of it goes to two or three reasons. One is, I think people are turned on by innovation that they see in the marketplace. We're doing a lot of digital innovation in the marketplace. And second, I think that they like to be affiliated with a company and a brand that stand for something. So our core attributes, I think they like, but the fact that we're offering products to people who traditionally have not had access to those products has been very helpful to our brand building.</p><p>And the other point, I would make is that we have seen improvements from a brand inventory standpoint in our higher-end products. So, if we look at Platinum, we have a 70% share of wallet with our Platinum card members, 55% share of wallet with our gold card members. So, I think that what's critical in a brand, is you've got to transform and transition the brand. When a brand is not relevant it's when in fact the value proposition that you're offering the specific customer segment is not relevant, but what we found is that when we offer a product that has the right rationale value proposition coupled with the emotional attributes of our brand, it's very powerful.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Maybe we could step up to some of the growth targets, the financial targets. You've maintained your long-term on-average over time 12% to 15% EPS growth target, and getting back to that in 2017. Can you walk us through the drivers of that, and help what makes you confident you can get there?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Yes, so let me first start, again with the foundation one, I think of having the largest integrated global payments platform helps us tremendously. And then, the foundation that we have to build on, if we look at leadership in terms of billings, which I think that's the ultimate output is where the billings, that you're able to drive. We're the number one issuer in terms of consumer. We're the number one issuer in terms of small business. We're the number one issuer in corporate payments. We represent, we have clients 63% of the Fortune 500. We're the number one merchant that we acquire, the billings volume. So we're number one there. We're the number one US Company from an international billings standpoint. So, I think we're starting off with a very strong foundation.</p><p>Now what's critical if you look at the three core drivers for growth for us, and I'll go through some of the growth opportunities that we have is obviously we want to continue to grow revenues through a range of very diverse opportunities. We need to continue the improvements, and I've been very pleased with what we've done in operating expense leverage over the last few years. Our capital strength is very strong along with our share buybacks, and so what I have emphasized is that the most important financial metric, Kevin, to your point is the 12% to 15% earnings per share.</p><p>Now just to give you some examples of different opportunities is we are fortunate that across the entire portfolio. We are in businesses that have a long runway for growth; albeit, we've got competition in those businesses at varying levels, and those businesses also can generate very strong returns for our shareholders. If you think about small business for example, which we have been in for decades and are clearly the leader, $4.8 trillion in spending only and small business -- so I can define it for people is $10 million in revenues and below.</p><p>10% of that $4.8 trillion is on plastic, so that's a long runway for growth. We've been in this business for a while. That's a business that in fact has over the last several years performed well from a billings growth standpoint and a revenue growth standpoint. Middle market is a very attractive business and that covers a category of $10 million, up to $500 million and the penetration level there is also very low.</p><p>With both small business and middle market, we've invested more in -- we have focused not only in the US but expanding in a variety of international markets and we see that as a very strong opportunity. I think what we're doing in merchant acceptance with OptBlue is going to benefit all of our card products and that's really a program where we have worked with third parties and we've given them the pricing and other terms and we've gotten off to a great start 2014.</p><p>Through OptBlue we brought in 400,000 merchants, and what we said is that starting in 2015, each year we would expect to bring in 500 -- between 500,000 to 800,000 small merchants going forward. So, we're feeling good about what that will do for growth both of the reality of welcome acceptance and also the perception of coverage.</p><p>I think in consumer, you'll see over the next few months, changes that we're making to the value proposition, and I think we'll improve it. I think we are very pleased with AmEx every day. We're making improvements in Platinum, Centurion, Gold, GNS our bank partnership business has been one of our fastest growing businesses over the last decade. And I think we're still in the early stages. I think that has a very long runway for growth. International, we have seen in 11 of our key markets, we've grown in all those markets, and in eight of those 11, we've grown faster than the market. So, I want to emphasize, we've done this in a situation of strong competition, but I think we have a range of opportunities, Serve is in its early stages.</p><p>There was a Nielsen report I think that came out prepaid is still relatively small for the industry overall, but had growth, I think they said today of 200%. We've had growth in the last year or two, 300% in billings early days. So I don't want to overhype it. Loyalty Partner, I think is a very exciting business for us and gets back to this convergence between payments and commerce, so the way loyalty works is that our loyalty coalition program in international, we call payback, we have a range of what we call founding sponsors, and you want to get large companies in everyday spending categories.</p><p>We manage the platform, we get fees on that platform, we provide insights, we provide more business for merchants who use it and what's very important is any payment product can be used. Cash, checks, MasterCard, Visa, AmEx, it's a closed loop. It has SKU level data, and we operate in five markets around the world. We just launched it very recently in the last month and a half in the US, it is early stages, but you had the CFO of Macy's, who said in the first week of Plenti they had 2 million enrollees, which far exceeded the objectives that they had set. So again, very, very early stages, but I think we have the balance between the existing businesses in the new.</p><p>Now, I think what's also important is that, we'll just go back to presentation that I made two years ago when I went through a range of scenarios. They basically said could we achieve 12% to 15% growth without achieving 8% revenue growth, and there were a lot of variables in there that we went through, but I think they were reasonable. If we then looked at the reality of how we have performed, it actually played out pretty close to those scenarios, and we were able with a range of 4% to 6% revenue growth over the last four years to be within the range of 12% to 15%, and I could tell you, I think in this economic environment, which has been slow to moderate growth. 4% to 6% revenue growth is pretty darn good when you compare it to the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow.</p><p>And so I think we have the growth initiatives that I talked about, I think you have seen different levers, and so this is not me speculating, which I did two years ago of here's how some different scenarios could play out. You actually saw how we dealt with those different levers, and what we were able to achieve. So I think what's critical is I have a firm belief in the growth initiatives that we put in place, that it will allow us to generate appropriate revenue growth. I have confidence that we're going to be able to continue to achieve the operating leverage. And third, I think the capital strength that we have along with the share buybacks give us the opportunity to achieve that 12% to 15%. So that's the pathway.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: I like that presentation from two years ago. I tweaked it a bit and said all I AmEx to do is turn the 643, I am a big baseball fan. So, if you can get 6% revenue growth, control expenses at 4% annual growth, 3% annual share repurchase, I get you to 14%. So, just turn the 643.</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: I sort of like that. It has a nice ring in.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: I'm going to start mixing in some of the questions from the audience. So there's and I'm going to try and organize them as best I can, but couple of questions on the potential sale of the Costco portfolio, and what will be done with the proceeds, will that be buybacks? In the past we've seen where there have been some gains and again reinvested, what would be the plan for the proceeds to the Costco portfolio?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Yes, it's premature. I mean, one thing I actually should have said, which I think you all know is that the new Costco deal is subject to Citibuying the portfolio that has to happen. So that is a very important assumption. Obviously, we can't go into a lot of detail or any detail on what's happening in the conversations that we're having. But what I can say Kevin and this would go -- let me make a broader point is we recognize what the reset that we're doing this year where we're going to be in 2016 and then as we said, our objective is to get back to 12% to 15% growth.</p><p>What I would say to people is that you've really got to focus on the underlying business performance. So you need to focus on the metrics that you have historically focused on. We need to do our best in fact to clarify for you how the underlying business is performing excluding some of the discrete items like the Costco, the fact that we signed other Co-Brands that we've talked about; FX, and then the incremental investments that we're making in growth. So we will need to do that, but from a contractual standpoint, I really cannot share what's going on in the conversations we're having except to say that what's fundamental to the deal is that the portfolio has to be sold for the deal to happen. And that's critical to understand our view is that I think we have demonstrated a willingness both to invest in those growth opportunities, I think, I've outlined a range of growth opportunities out there. But I don't think I can speculate on what's going to happen with the portfolio. So, I wish I could say more but I can't.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Several other questions about something else you might not be able to say a lot about, but the DOJ case and an update where we are in the process?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Yes, I can't say a lot except to say I think as many of you know, we have begun the appeal process on this day. I think we have a strong case. The only thing I can say as with any situation, we are prepared for different scenarios. But it wouldn't be appropriate for me to go into details or give further comment there.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Couple of questions. You alluded to this, but maybe you can either re-answer or give a little more information. Couple questions saying are you diluting the brand right by going down market, are you concerned about brand erosion of your high-end customers?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Yes -- you know what, just to go back, I think what's very important is in the 1990s, I put together three operating principles that Harvey Golub, the then CEO adopted for the entire company. And these are principles that I really adhere to and that is we want to provide superior value to the customers and clients we serve.</p><p>Second, we want to do it in a way that will allow us to achieve best-in-class economics and third, everything we do must support and enhance the brand. And I view myself as in fact the brand steward of the Company. And the reality is that we are not going to do anything to dilute the brand. But, I go back to the fact that it's something that this company is very, very focused on and one of the ways this brand was built -- one of the businesses that was built on was a Travelers Cheque product that has had no income requirement that was available to everyone. But because of the service, because of the trust, because of the value proposition that enabled us to in fact enter into the card business with the level of trust and commitment to service.</p><p>And what we've seen is that when we can construct a value proposition that is meaningful to customers that the brand is enhanced. When that value proposition is in fact not meaningful to customers and let's not go back to foreign time when we embarked on a very ill-advised financial supermarket strategy. It wasn't that those businesses were horrible businesses, but the question is that those businesses enhanced the brand? There we did see some brand dilution and not just for economic reasons but for brand reasons and for strategic focus reasons, we divested out of those businesses.</p><p>And I think now we're a more focused competitor, but the other point that I think is critical to understand with the digital transformation is that scale has been redefined and it is important that you are relevant to a range of customer segments, but in that relevance, I can assure you that we're very focused on making sure we have an alignment of the value proposition with the principles and the attributes of our brand. We follow brand value very consistently and we in fact have seen improvement in the brand value not dilution and that's something that we don't take for granted, but I'm confident that will be our continued focus.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Few questions about the merchant discount rate and the sort of steady erosion or steady decline, put it that way, I know there's some mix and some competitive forces there, but maybe if you could characterize what inning we're in, in terms of the merchant discount rate declining, do we see that stabilize over the next few years?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: I think the reality is you've got a number of forces. I mean you've got regulatory forces. I mean what's happening in Europe, what's happening in other parts of the world, what's happening in the US. There's clearly going to be impacts on the overall discount rate, what our job is and I think really the focus needs to be on value as well as price.</p><p>And one of the points that I think is really critical and goes with what we are trying to do with our business portfolio is we bring a higher spending card member to our merchants because of the breadth and depth of the most diverse portfolio in the industry. And our merchants still find that compelling, and it's our job to prove that value and our value to both merchants and card members every day. And so I am not going to sit here and predict what's going to happen to the discount rate over time.</p><p>The reality is, I think people have been saying really over the last two decades, in most cases that the discount rate would move down a lot faster than it actually has. So I think we'll have to see what happens there, but what's most important for us is that we are demonstrating the value that we can provide to merchants and the fact that spending on our cards is three to four times that of MasterCard and Visa. I think it is very, very important and that's something that we'll continue to demonstrate.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Couple of related questions here at the Berkshire Hathaway meeting Charlie Munger characterized returns of AmEx is coming down permanently versus the past due to competition; another question saying what are you doing to make your mode wider and deeper?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Yes, I think what's important because I was actually at that meeting. Warren Buffett asked if I would come because it was their 50th Anniversary and obviously we're a big holding of Berkshire Hathaway. And my recollection and I have been in all the forums Charlie has spoken at is the mode as strong as it once was. And I think that was a reference to a question on Costco and the competition that's out there.</p><p>What we're doing to continue to strengthen the mode is to leverage this integrated payments platform that we have and the data and the information and the focus on leveraging those assets in our digital transformation so that we can provide increased value both in spending and insights and improve performance in more business, the merchants more personalized value. If we've looked at what we've done for example with our membership rewards program, the reality is we have a mobile app where you basically can access those points for almost any purchase.</p><p>So the way to build the mode is in fact to reinforce what are the fundamental advantages and the fundamental advantages are the fact that the brand really stands for something, Trust security and service, that's something that Warren really is aligned with. Second is the closed loop. That's really critical and to continue to innovate and I think we're doing that with the closed loop. And then, in fact to make sure that we are providing differentiated value propositions and that's why I go back to your first question that we have to make sure that we are working on businesses that will differentiate our model and that we're not just so coming to becoming a credit utility.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Great. I think we have time for one more. Question about Costco retention. Maybe you could describe the efforts you are going through to try and retain some of that Costco spend and anything you can share with us about initial success?</p><p><person><nameText>KEN CHENAULT</nameText></person>: Yes, so Kevin, what I would say here are two things. One, I can't go into specifics obviously for competitive reasons. I've outlined what our tactical plans are. But we're very focused on things we need to do to retain the spend, and as we've said 70% of the spend in Costco in the US is outside.</p><p>I would say Canada is a very different situation because you didn't have a sale of a portfolio in Canada and there are clear differences there. As we've said over the last few months, we've been encouraged by what's happened in Canada. But I think it would be wrong to extrapolate what happened in Canada exactly to what's going on in the US because there are more uncertainties relative to what's going to happen with the overall portfolio.</p><p>What I would emphasize is I go back to the fundamental reason why we decided not to renew with Costco and that's because we have the range of opportunities across the business overall that will generate growth and that is the really important point that Costco is not the \"be all and end all\" of the company, and the reality is that we would not have decided to discontinue our relationship with Costco if in fact we said we don't have better alternatives. But the point is we had better alternatives and so the focus very much needs to be on, okay, prove it to us that's absolutely the appropriate that you're growing in the businesses that you've identified and that the call you've made is the right call in the moderate term, because that's really the basis of our action.</p><p>So, yes, we're going to clearly focus on retaining as much volume, but what's also important is what we want to do is also make sure that we are retaining the profitabilities, the profits, the focus is not volume. I just want to get volume because the economics on that volume both inside and outside is different. I also have to compare that to what I can do in my existing businesses, and my new businesses, and where I am going to allocate those dollars. So, you got to look at this in a very holistic way and the focus really needs to be on what we're doing to grow our franchise overall.</p><p>KEVIN ST. PIERRE: Great, Ken.

American Express is no stranger to the \"challenge of staying active and relevant in the digital age,\" explains <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Orti, CEO</emphasis> of the US multinational in Spain, a country that has gained weight in the company following the decision to move its legal headquarters for continental Europe from the UK to Spain to Brexit.</p><p><br/>The historic financial firm has designed a strategy based on three pillars: technology development, partnerships and the purchase or taking of innovative start-up stakes. An approach that pursues it, among other objectives, \"to be essential in the digital life\" of its customers, highlights the executive.<br/><br/>More than half of customers who access online accounts do so via mobile<br/><br/>\"Technology <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>is necessary because consumer habits are becoming more digital.\" For example, Orti indicates that more than half of the users who access American Express online accounts do so on mobile. However, the executive nuances that \"technology is a tool for a purpose, which is to provide the best experience and value beyond the transaction\".<br/>Orti explains that the sum of digitization and regulation translates into a \"commitization of the means of payment\". The role of American Express, however, goes beyond ensuring safe and easy payment. \"This is necessary but not enough for our business model, which rests on giving <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">additional value</emphasis> to the stakeholders in the transaction through assets such as rewards, relevant marketing, access to experiences, etc., actions whose scope is even greater thanks to technology,\" he says.<br/>For example, artificial intelligence allows American Express to recommend via mobile to a cardholder a restaurant according to their tastes when visiting a city, making it easier for them to book; or suggest when geolocating the customer at an airport the best lounge based on their loyalty programs. \"Technology doesn't just make transactions easier and safer. The use of big data or artificial intelligence allows us to bring that customer experience that sets us apart from other players,\" he says.<br/>End of card?<br/>Orti recognizes that we are witnessing a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">change in consumers' payment habits. </emphasis> Are we at the end of cash and plastic cards? \"It's bold to write down what's going to happen. Metallicis is still widely used in Spain, rather than in other assimilable neighbouring countries, but everything points to it disappearing, the question is when. And the same with plastic. What matters to us is not the form factor but to give value, regardless of the medium,\" he says.<br/><br/>The drag on technology and alliances has caused mobile payment to accelerate<br/><br/>One of the formulas American Express is employing to squeeze the possibilities of the digital age is the development of its own technology. For example, the company has a mobile app where it has incorporated \"differential factors like payment with points\", says Orti.<br/>Another novelty is the possibility for the user to create a list of trusted online stores that prevents American Express from having to send authentication notifications on each purchase, without compromising security.<br/>Apple and Google<br/>The company also does nothas turned its back on business alliances, an area in which agreements with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple Pay and Android Pay (Google)</emphasis> stand out. \"More than half of our customers have their American Express cards in these wallets. These agreements provide us with differential technology in this payment chain link,\" he says. \"The drag effect of these tech companies, the safe and very simple use experience, and the partnerships they have reached with companies like ours have caused mobile payment to accelerate,\" the executive stresses.<br/>The company has also announced an extension of its agreement with PayPal in the United States, which for years allowed users to associate this payment system with their American Express cards. It now also offers options such as instantly splitting charges across multiple people (Transaction P2P), splitting and deferring the charge, or paying with points, for example.<br/><br/>\"We are looking for companies with technology and models with a disruptor and accelerator element\"<br/><br/>The third leg of the digital strategy goes through innovative start-up buying and taking part through <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amex Ventures,</emphasis>the venture capital arm that created the company in 2011 with $100 million of funds, and which accumulates 64 investments according to Crunchbase. \"We're looking for companies that have technology and business models with that disruptive and accelerator element that allows American Express to move forward and complete its proposal. The criterion is that your input is relevant, scalable and complementary.\"<br/>Investments<br/>The company has invested in technologies that strengthen its capabilities as well as leisure, gastronomy and travel apps. For example, it acquired <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Accertify,</emphasis>with state-of-the-art technology for the prevention of fraud in cyber-purchases. The company has an operational hub in American Express offices in Madrid, from where it serves international online establishments.<br/>He is also in the stock of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BioCatch,</emphasis>a company that uses biometrics to prevent cyberattacks, analyzing the actions of hackers to identify malicious behaviors and stop them in real time.<br/>In April, Amex Ventures acquired <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LoungeBuddy,</emphasis>a digital platform that allows travelers to discover, book and access airport lounges around the world. This summer, it was made with the Resy restaurant booking platform.<br/>  \"We are aware that competition is not just traditional players\"<br/>The media industry has seen new players break into new players, both 'fintech' and big tech like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple or Google,</emphasis>not to mention the strength of companies like Alipay (Alibaba) or Tencent (owner of WeChat) in China. \"Payment methods are not the most profitable industry. Why are you coming in? Fundamentally, by linking users, which provides data, a very valuable element of attraction. We are aware that competition is not just traditional players and that the PSD2 regulation requires you to cooperate,\" says Juan Orti. In this sense, the company looks at new categories such as the payment initiators, where it moves token. \"In England we have launched a product that allows the consumer to pay in online stores through their bank account. It is a very important strategic movement because to some extent we compete with ourselves but it allows us to reach customers who do not want additional value, they only seek immediacy and security\".<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10660866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4R-P5Y1-JBJN-M4GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1115\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00023A6</classCode><className>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6141 PERSONAL CREDIT INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>AXP (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Econom\u00eda Digital</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Compa\u00f1ias</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Protagonistas</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp;

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILLOW BAY, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight, a possible drug combination with powerful side effects: American Home Products and Warner-Lambert in talks to merge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STUART VARNEY, CNN ANCHOR: Four sessions, four records set as the tech high fliers help the Nasdaq finally close above 3,000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BAY: If you think the stock market's on fire, try the housing market.  We'll look at the hottest regions and ask: Can it last?</p><p>VARNEY: And from the frat house vision of Wall Street in \"Liar's Poker\" to the freewheeling entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, author Michael Lewis on his \"New New Thing.\"</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.  Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay and Stuart Varney.</p><p>VARNEY: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE.  It was the talk of Wall Street and the entire drug industry.</p><p>BAY: The prospect of one of the biggest deals ever.  American Home Products and Warner-Lambert today confirmed that they're in talks to join forces in what investors expect will be a merger of equals with power shared 50/50.  If the two drug giants reach an agreement, it could unleash a new wave of industry deal-making.  The estimated value of the deal is $65 billion, which would eclipse all other drug mergers to date.  It is expected to be announced tomorrow.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, a merger would bring together blockbuster prescription drugs and over-the-counter staples.  AHP produces the most prescribed drug in America: the estrogen replacer Premarin as well as Advil and Anacin.  Warner-Lambert makes the bestselling cholesterol fighter, Lipitor, along with Listerine, Certs and other pharmacy mainstays.</p><p>BAY: If AHP does complete a deal with Warner-Lambert, it will come after two aborted merger attempts with other drug giants.  Early last year, SmithKline Beecham broke off talks with AHP on management differences over who would run the company.  Months later, AHP and Monsanto called off their $34 billion merger plans: the biggest deal ever to fall apart.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, Wall Street's reaction to news of a possible merger was nothing short of electric.  Both American Home Products and Warner-Lambert jumped more than 5 1/2 points and both were among the most active stocks on the \"Big Board.\"</p><p>The rally must have been a relief to AHP's long-suffering shareholders.  The stock fell off a cliff back in April as the legal battle heated up over Fen-Phen.  And even with recent gains, AHP is still off 20 percent from its high.</p><p>Meanwhile, Warner-Lambert shares were on fire even before word of merger talks.  The stock is up more than 20 points this past month alone, and today, it hit a new 52-week high.</p><p>BAY: That merger news lifted the mood of the overall market. But the real fireworks were on the Nasdaq, which crossed the 3,000 level and stayed there for the first time today.  The index jumped 46 points to end at 3,028, its fourth-straight record close.</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler has more on that milestone and those hot drug stocks in today's \"Street Sweep.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Prospects for the biggest drug merger ever and continued buying in high-tech issues combined to send stocks higher today.</p><p>Drug stocks soared on word that American Home Products and Warner--Lambert might merge.  Both Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson helped lead the Dow higher.  The Dow closed up 27 points at 10,609.  And the Nasdaq composite again hit 3,000, and this time stayed there, closing up 46 points to 3,028.</p><p>The index has more than doubled from last October, and some say 3,000 is just the beginning.</p><p>STUART FREEMAN, A.G. EDWARDS: You're starting to see slower economic news on a variety of fronts, and bonds are finally responding to that, and equities are responding to the bonds.  And I think, you know, that 3,000 -- that 3,000 mark is something we're going to move above and well over as we move in to next year.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: The day's big tech winners included on the big boardAOL, up more than five after announcing it took a stake in Blockbuster; Oracle, which surged after (UNINTELLIGIBLE).  And chip- related stocks were higher after a trade group reported late yesterday of a surge in orders.</p><p>Some are wondering whether a tech-led rally is a good thing.</p><p>RICHARD MCCABE, MERRILL LYNCH: My concern is that either some new leadership comes along, some new driving force, or these extended, somewhat maybe tired technologies may need a break.  And that might be that last pullback we get sometime in the winter.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: While there are more stocks participating in the market's advance, financial stocks again failed to join in. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCHAFFLER: One group of lagging stocks didn't dampen sentiment here, though.  Traders were encouraged by the broad-based buying we've seen lately.  Even small-cap stocks are back in favor -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Rhonda.  Rhonda Schaffler from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>VARNEY: There is no doubt this is the year for the Nasdaq composite.  It's by far the best-performing major index.</p><p>Since breaking the 2,000 barrier 15 months ago, the Nasdaq has soared 49 percent.  That's almost four times the gain of the S&amp;P 500 during the same period and the Dow industrials as well.  The only other time the Nasdaq composite has outperformed the Dow and S&amp;P by this much was in 1991 when the economy was recovering from a recession.</p><p>Keep in mind, the Nasdaq has only been around since 1971.</p><p>BAY: The stock market's incredible bull run has helped drive what is shaping up to be the economy's best peacetime expansion ever. But today, a report showed that supertanker USA may finally be slowing down to the point where the Federal Reserve may be able to stop raising interest rates.</p><p>From Chicago, here's Ceci Rodgers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Signs the economy might be cooling off a bit are raising hopes that the sharp rise in interest rates this year may be largely over.  A recent slowdown in housing and construction showed up in the Federal Reserve's \"Beige Book\" survey, a region-by region snapshot of economic conditions.</p><p>JOHN STILES, IDEA: I think \"The Beige Book\" this afternoon, which is the report that will go to the FOMC meeting in the middle of November, said it pretty well.  The economy is still experiencing strong growth, but some slowing is seen.</p><p>RODGERS: Still, the survey noted a rebound in manufacturing and tight labor markets that are boosting wages.  So far, those wage costs are not being passed along to consumers thanks to rising productivity.</p><p>But some economists are worried .</p><p>PAUL KASRIEL, NORTHERN TRUST CO.: District after district reported tight labor markets, difficulty in finding staff.  Turnover is -- is moving up in a very rate, and that's got to hurt productivity.</p><p>RODGERS: The bond market has factored in about a 50 percent chance of a third hike in short-term interest rates when the Fed meets later this month. MICHELLE GIRARD, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: As long as the Fed is being viewed as pre-emptive, I also don't think it has to mean dramatically higher bond yields, because again this idea that the Fed is doing the right thing to keep inflation low will help to keep long- term interest rates in check.</p><p>RODGERS: The next big inflation test comes Friday with October's employment report.  It's the last official look at payrolls and wages before the Greenspan Fed sits down to set interest rate policy in less than two weeks.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers, CNN Financial News, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: The bond market did not show much reaction to today's economic news: the 30-year Treasury edged up 2/32 of a point in price. The yield tonight at 6.13 percent.</p><p>VARNEY: Tobacco stocks joined technology as the big winners today.  They rallied on potentially favorable news out of that landmark trial in Florida.</p><p>The Florida Supreme Court is asking plaintiffs to respond to a petition by cigarette makers.  It asks the court to prevent punitive damages, which could cost the companies billions of dollars.  The court did not say it would formally review the petition, but investors viewed it as a step in the right direction.</p><p>Shares of Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds, Loews, UST, BAT, all moving sharply higher on the day's trading.  We will have more on this story later on MONEYLINE.</p><p>BAY: Much more ahead, and for a preview of some of it, we turn now to some of MONEYLINE's other reporters, beginning with Fred Katayama -- Fred.</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Willow.  Much more on the AHP/Warner-Lambert merger talks.  If it happens, it would combine two of the bestselling drugs in America under one roof.  But is bigger really better?</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Bruce Francis.  It calls itself the market for the next century, but it crossed another millennium mark today.  And I'll tell you why most Nasdaq stocks, though, had little to celebrate.</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And I'm Peter Viles.  You wouldn't know it from the way the stock market dominates the news, but more Americans are making money in real estate than on Wall Street. Ahead, the hidden wealth effect of the housing market -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Peter.  Much more still ahead on MONEYLINE.  In the wake of the EgyptAir crash, Boeing's chief executive comes out fighting for the 767.  But do the safety stats make his case?</p><p>VARNEY: And Qualcomm dials up a stock surge.  But are tougher times about to come calling?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: A major legal offensive by the government today against some leading utilities in the East and Midwest.  The Clinton administration filed suits alleging the companies caused massive air pollution.</p><p>Bob Beard has our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB BEARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Seven electric utilities holding companies were hit with federal lawsuits, accusing them of spewing millions of tons of harmful pollutants into the air from older coal-burning power plants.</p><p>CAROL BROWNER, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: We will not allow these companies to pollute our air, our water.  We will not allow them to disregard the requirements of the Clean Air Act.</p><p>BEARD: The lawsuits come after a two-year EPA investigation. The companies sued American Electric Power, Cinergy, FirstEnergy, Illinois Power, Southern Indiana Gas &amp; Electric, Southern Company and Tampa Electric.  The EPA says they spent hundreds of millions of dollars putting new burners and furnaces on 32 old power plants, but not anti-pollution equipment, ignoring a 1970 law requiring them to install such equipment when making upgrades.</p><p>BROWNER: They made these modifications to stay in business longer, because it was profitable.  They could have made a modest investment in the public's health.  They could have easily put these pollution control technologies on.</p><p>BEARD: In response, one lawyer who represents the industry trade group contends the plants meets all clean air standards, and the EPA's lawsuit is changing the rules.</p><p>HENRY NICKLE, UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP: It could have a devastating effect on the economy, because of the fact you could not undertake any project that's needed to improve efficiency, improve reliability.</p><p>BEARD: Doug Fisher, who follows the utility industry at A.G. Edwards, says the seven utilities may be forced to spend more on new equipment.</p><p>DOUG FISHER, A.G. EDWARDS: It's going to result in, over the long term, some kind of compromise, we believe, that will require that some of these plants eventually put on more pollution-control equipment.</p><p>BEARD (on camera): For now though, the utilities could face EPA fines of up to $27,000 per plant, per day.</p><p>Bob Beard, for CNN Financial News, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Boeing's chief executive today defended his company's safety record.  It was a Boeing 767 that crashed off Nantucket Island Sunday, killing all 217 aboard EgyptAir flight 990.  Phil Condit spoke to reporters in Washington, saying that people should feel safe flying a jetliner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL CONDIT, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, BOEING: If you look at 18 years, we've had a total of three crashes.  One of them was a result of a hijacker.  The Lauda Air crash, and now the EgyptAir crash; that's really two crashes if I take out the hijacking, two in 18 years.</p><p>There's no airplane that has a better safety record over that length of time, period.</p><p>So should there be confidence?  Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAY: Investigators still do not know what caused the crash.  Bad weather today stalled the recovery effort and the search for the flight recorders.  U.S. investigators are looking into whether a deactivated engine part played a role in the disaster.  A full interview with Boeing's Bill Condit will air at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time tonight on \"THE WORLD TODAY\" right here on CNN.</p><p>Boeing's stock, meanwhile, fell for third straight day, closing at 43 1/4.</p><p>VARNEY: Echostar Communications tops tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers.\" It was up 6 1/4.  PaineWebber raised its price target to $76 a share.  It cited strong subscriber growth at the satellite TV company, and said ti expects continued strong performance at the strong quarter of next year.</p><p>Xilinx up 4 1/2.  The chipmakers joins the S&amp;P 500 on Friday.  It will replace communications equipment company Harris.  Appnet soared nearly 8 1/2.  It will develop technologies for NASA to help scientists monitor and control satellites from a secured Internet site.  And TMP Worldwide, up almost 10 points.  It beat third-quarter estimates by a nickel.  It cited strong performance at its monster.com employment Web site.</p><p>BAY: It was quite a day for Qualcomm.  The stock soared after it reported a strong fourth quarter, thanks to record sales of its mobile phone products.  Qualcomm beat estimates by 3 cents a shares and announced a 4-for-1 stock flit yesterday, Today, its stock rocketed more than 25 percent, adding to its incredible gains this past year.</p><p>But as Steve Young reports in today's \"Leading Edge\" report, some are raising the red flag.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A one-day spurt of more than $35 in Qualcomm's stock gives a good measure of the company's stratospheric projectory.  Qualcomm has more than quintupled in just the last eight months.</p><p>Qualcomm owns patents on one of the dominant cellphone transmission companies, known as CDMA, and it makes chips that go into the phones.</p><p>But some question how long the boom can continue.  Cellphone makers pay a royalty to Qualcomm, but they're engaged in a price war. The cheaper the cellphones, the smaller the royalty.</p><p>On top of that, Qualcomm faces new chip competition.  Intel, the biggest chipmaker, just bought DSP Communications which also makes CDMA chips, and Motorola is getting into the market, too.</p><p>EDWARD SNYDER, HAMBRECHT &amp; QUIST: If you look into 2000, I mean, you see a lot of competitive problems, I think, for Qualcomm.  Any one of those, if it comes to fruition, is going to cause a maybe flattening of earnings and that will, in our opinion, tank the stock.</p><p>YOUNG: But Qualcomm chairman Irwin Jacobs says his competitors won't catch up.</p><p>IRWIN JACOBS, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, QUALCOMM: We're ahead of the market now, of the other manufacturers.  We intend to stay there.  And so we're bringing out chips that have a significant data capability, and we will continue to make them smaller, require less power.  We think we're well positioned.</p><p>YOUNG: Most analyst say, even homemakers using different technical standards will have to pay royalties to use Qualcomm's patents for their next-generation cell phones.</p><p>ALEX CENA, SALOMONSMITH BARNEY: Well, one piece that a lot of investors and analysts have missed on Qualcomm is, in their minds, it's irrelevant who wins -- Nokia, Motorola, Intel, in the future, Lucent -- all of those companies are Qualcomm licensees.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: Analysts are also encouraged that Qualcomm intends to sell off its unprofitable unit that makes phones and stick to selling the chip technology where it dominates -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Steve, thank you.</p><p>Steve Young reporting.</p><p>Coming up on MONEYLINE: the Nasdaq spends its first night above 3,000.  Is this a surge of tech enthusiasm or the rise of a new economy?</p><p>VARNEY: Well, we'll speak live with top Morgan Stanley strategist Leah Modigliani.  That interview and more after this break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Checking some of the stocks that hit new 52-week highs today: Duetsche Telekom, Gateway, Kenneth Cole Productions, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Applied Materials.</p><p>VARNEY: Now some of the day's top stories outside the world of business.  A day after the man accused of killing seven at a Xerox building in Hawaii surrendered, another workplace shooting, this time in Seattle.  Two are dead, two wounded, after a gunmen opened fire at a Seattle shipyard.  The unidentified attacker escaped on foot and remains at large at this hour.</p><p>A guilty verdict today in the case against the Wyoming man accused of killing gay college student Matthew Shepard.  Twenty-two- year-old Aaron McKinney was found guilty of felony murder and could face the death penalty.  The sentencing phase begins tomorrow.</p><p>BAY: Turning back to Wall Street's big moment, the victory lap for the Nasdaq: covering 3,000 for the first time.</p><p>Our guest tonight is an up and coming strategist who has the business in her blood.  Her grandfather was the 1985 Nobel laureate in economics. Leah Modigliani of Dean Witter joins us.</p><p>Welcome.</p><p>LEAH MODIGLIANI, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: So of course the big news of the day was the Nasdaq.  Is this climb sustainable?  Is there anything that you see on the horizon standing in the Nasdaq's way?</p><p>MODIGLIANI: A lot of these stocks are priced for perfection, and so if something goes wrong, I think these stocks will feel it.  These milestones have been hard to achieve.  When the Dow Reached the 10,000 point, really had some struggles before it could cross it, most certainly.  So I would think that we'd see a similar situation here, that some of the tech stocks will struggle around this level.  They're at very high levels.</p><p>But I think that technology is what America does best, and these companies are really the world's technology companies.</p><p>BAY: Do you still think, as you did this summer, that the markets are overvalued?</p><p>MODIGLIANI: I do.</p><p>BAY: By how much?</p><p>MODIGLIANI: It's in the range of 25 percent to 30 percent at this point.</p><p>BAY: Still, even after the correction that we've just gone through? MODIGLIANI: Even after the correction.  And also, interest rates have come down, which has helped.  But the P/E ratios are still very high.</p><p>BAY: So is this across the board, or are certain stocks heightening that affect?</p><p>MODIGLIANI: No, certain stocks are definitely heightening that affect.  The technology stocks are really very hot, still.  But there are still stocks that are affordable.  There are still stocks that are cheaper, and that's where we're looking to put new money to work.</p><p>BAY: Let's go through your fresh money buy list.  You have stocks like AOL, Cisco, AMR, Warner-Lambert.  Cisco -- still headed higher, even at 71?</p><p>MODIGLIANI: Cisco has been an amazing stock, and we still like it. It is just something that we think is going to be a winner in this new economy and in the Internet.  So we're sticking with Cisco, even though it's had a great run here.</p><p>BAY: How about Warner-Lambert?  They've confirmed they're in talks. Will consolidation, in this industry, improve performance?</p><p>MODIGLIANI: That's debatable.  I think that the pharmaceuticals have seen some slowing in their growth recently, and I think they're turning to mergers and acquisitions as a way to keep the growth in earnings and cut costs and really, you know, improve their profits.</p><p>BAY: Real quickly on your list, Circuit City -- why?</p><p>MODIGLIANI: Circuit City -- I love Circuit City.  Circuit City is really play on digital equipment.  We think that they have some exciting new products, and for Christmas people are going to be buying digital cameras and DVDs and, eventually in the future, digital TVs.</p><p>BAY: Still buy what you recommend?</p><p>MODIGLIANI: We really like it.</p><p>BAY: Still buy what you recommend?</p><p>MODIGLIANI: Absolutely.  I absolutely buy the stocks I recommend.</p><p>BAY: Leah Modigliani, thanks for joining us tonight on MONEYLINE.</p><p>MODIGLIANI: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Thanks, Willow.</p><p>Still to come on MONEYLINE: the stock upset.  What makes them tick? What makes them succeed?  Michael Lewis, the author of \"The New New Thing,\" takes us inside the entrepreneurial roots of two Silicon Valley success stories.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: We have already brought you one list of stocks hitting new highs today.  There are so many of them, we're going to bring you another list, topped by Broadcom, then comes KLA-Tencor, Lam Research, and look at this, Oracle, another new high there, and Novellus Systems again, too.</p><p>BAY: And there's still a lot more to come on MONEYLINE tonight. A huge cheer on Wall Street for what could be the drug industry's biggest merger ever.  We've got the details.</p><p>VARNEY: And the second time is a charm, for Nasdaq 3000 that is. Today it climbed there, and it stayed there.</p><p>BAY: And the wealth affect -- it doesn't just come from the stock market anymore.  We'll go inside the boom in home prices.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's headlines, a crowning achievement for the index of the year, Nasdaq 3,000.  Tonight, a look at the road to 3K and the enormous wealth it's created.</p><p>From one boom to another, more Americans are making money in real estate than on Wall Street, and Alan Greenspan is paying attention.</p><p>And the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley: What kind of people are they and how do they operate?  There's a new book on that, and we'll talk to the author.  He's the man who wrote \"Liar's Poker\": Michael Lewis.</p><p>BAY: First, our top story: the prospect of another blockbuster merger in the drug business.  American Home Products and Warner- Lambert are talking about a deal that could be worth as much as $65 billion.  It would be one of the biggest corporate tie-ups ever, certainly the largest of its kind.</p><p>American Home Products has been looking for a partner, but talks fell through with Monsanto and SmithKline Beecham.  Investors are betting the third time's a charm, sending AHP stock up more than 5 1/2.  Warner-Lambert jumped by the same amount.</p><p>Fred Katayama has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATAYAMA (voice-over): A union between the maker of Advil: American Home Products, and its rival, Warner-Lambert, would produce the biggest drug merger in history, more than double that of the biggest to date.</p><p>BOB KIRBY, EDWARD JONES: In this industry, bigger is better, given the pricetag of developing a new drug to the tune of $500 million.  In order to take advantage of these projects as they come along, you really need to have the right size to be able to do that.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Analysts say the two companies complement each other. American Home is strong in women's health products, especially with its Estrogen tablet, Premarin.  Warner-Lambert's expertise lies in diabetes and cholesterol drugs like Lipitor.</p><p>A merger would also create a leader in consumer products, marrying AHP's Anacin pain reliever and Robitussin cough syrup with Warner-Lambert's Schick razors.</p><p>Together, the two would create a company with nearly $24 billion in revenue and prescription drug sales of almost $14 billion: scale that could give rivals migraines.  It could control more than 5 percent of the global prescription drug market.  Many analysts predict it will pass muster with antitrust regulators, because there's little overlap of product lines.</p><p>HERMAN SAFTLAS, STANDARD AND POOR'S: None of these companies account for a significant part of the market.  They only account for, you know, 1 or 2 percent of any given class.</p><p>No. 2, if there is a problem, it usually involves a divestiture of one or two minor products.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The companies could also trim overlapping sales and marketing forces, which one analyst estimates could produce savings of more than a billion dollars.</p><p>Drug stocks rose as investors bet that merger fever would spread to others.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATAYAMA: AHP's stock could use an antidepressant.  A series of legal problems had weighed on the stock.  American Home recently struck a multibillion dollar settlement over its diet drugs, known as Fen-Phen: a move analysts say makes it a more attractive merger candidate and removes some of the uncertainty hanging over its stock.</p><p>BAY: Fred, do you expect we'll hear an announcement tomorrow?</p><p>KATAYAMA: That's the rumor mill on Wall Street.  The companies won't comment.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Fred.  Fred Katayama reporting.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, the run-up in drug stocks gave the Dow its first winning session of the week.  The blue chip index up 27, to finish at 10,609.  The volume, 914 million shares.</p><p>But the true standout today was the Nasdaq composite.  That tech- heavy index blew past the 3,000 level and it stayed there for the first time ever.  It was up 46 points to close at 3,028.</p><p>Now, that is a fourth-straight record and the Nasdaq's first close above 3,000: a milestone not all market watchers are celebrating.</p><p>Bruce Francis reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS (voice-over): As the Nasdaq closes above 3,000 for the first time, there's no champagne on ice at Muriel Siebert &amp; Company. And the first lady of Wall Street is not terribly impressed.</p><p>MURIEL SIEBERT, CEO, MURIEL SIEBERT &amp; CO.: I think this milestone is a great round number.  But it does not mean that the whole market has hit -- that every stock has hit a new high.  It's specific stocks.  They're very heavily weighted in the indexes and the averages.  But it's a great time because it shows that people are willing to put money into the stocks again.</p><p>FRANCIS: The Nasdaq composite is dominated by stocks with huge market values.  So as the biggest stocks get bigger, so does the composite.</p><p>Today, for example, the top five of the most active stocks accounted for about a third of the index and half of today's point gain.  Big gains in Nasdaq stalwarts, like Sun Microsystems and Cisco, helped propel the composite.  And gains from some of the Nasdaq's other large-cap stocks have boosted the index during the 16-month ride from 2,000 to 3,000.</p><p>But some big stocks have dwindled in value during the same period.  And so far this year, most Nasdaq stocks are actually down.</p><p>So while another millennium milestone may sound impressive for a system that calls itself the stock market for the next century, analysts who watch key numbers for a living aren't celebrating.</p><p>GREG NIE, FIRST UNION SECURITIES: 3,000 is not a particularly important number technically in our work.  If you look at it from the standpoint of whether the market is extended or not, the Nasdaq composite chart moving averages, trend lines and so forth, it's not shaping up as a key number.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: Technical analysts would like to see rallies like today's to be broader, but some say that small cap stocks can't take off until this tidal wave of IPOs slows down -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, Bruce, does Wall Street have a collective opinion about where the Nasdaq goes from here?</p><p>FRANCIS: It's hard to say.  There's great demand out there, Stuart.  The latest thing, though, a tamer inflation outlook is great for these stocks, since they have so many of their earnings way out in the future and inflation eats into those like crazy.  That's much better for these stocks.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, indeed.  Bruce Francis reporting.  Thank you, Bruce.</p><p>BAY: A closer look behind today's modest rally shows it was pretty broad-based.  Gainers on the big board ran ahead of losers by a 16-to-13 margin.  The number of new 52-week highs, 55 versus the number of new lows, 95.</p><p>Among today's winners: General Electric, up nearly 2 1/2, its second day of gains.  Tyco International rose 1 1/2, again one of the most active stocks on the big board.  Texas Instruments added 2 3/4, and Oxford Health Care rallied 1 5/8 after reporting much-better-than- expected earnings late yesterday.</p><p>In the bond market, an early rally fizzled, even after several inflation-friendly economic reports.  The 30-year Treasury up 2/32; the yield at 6.13 percent.</p><p>VARNEY: The stock market's great bull run of the 1990s has had economists watching the so-called \"wealth effect\": the idea that Americans are more inclined to spend money if stocks are doing well. But this week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan offered his thoughts on the subject, pointing out the many for many Americans the bigger wealth effect is in the one they live in.</p><p>Peter Viles takes a special MONEYLINE look at the benefits of the housing boom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES (voice-over): The bull market of the '90s, one of the great wealth machines of all time, but many Americans are getting rich a lot closer to home.</p><p>Housing prices have been climbing steadily for years, and not just in wealthy suburbs.  The hottest housing markets over the past four years: Detroit, where median prices are up 46 percent, New Orleans, San Francisco, Houston, and yes, Saginaw, Michigan.</p><p>(on camera): A few years ago, you could find a house in this Long Island neighborhood for $400,000.  But since then, prices have spiked: 600,000 is not unusual.  And if you see a house you like, you'd better be ready to put a bid down on it the same day.</p><p>EMMA MCMAHON, COLDWELL BANDER SAMMIS: From January to June it was absolute bedlam.  But still, we're putting a house on the market in Flower Hill priced at 649, coming on the market Friday.  I don't think it'll go through the weekend.  We still have more buyers than there are homes.</p><p>VILES (voice-over): The economic impact is significant.  Alan Greenspan argues, and many economists agree, money gained from selling a house is more likely to be spent than money gained in the stock market.  That's partly because stock market gains are concentrated among the wealthy and partly because people believe housing prices are less likely to fall.</p><p>DELOS SMITH, THE CONFERENCE BOARD: The family probably thinks that 25,000 from the housing, yes, we've made it.  You know, that's the -- that really becomes so important to them.  But on the equities, he'll say, well, Microsoft can go up and down and I can lose it.  The 25,000, it's in his pocket.  He got it.</p><p>VILES: And bear in mind, even after the incredible bull market we've seen, real estate is a more common investment than stocks: 67 percent of American families own houses, only 48 percent own stocks.</p><p>Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, Manhasset, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Coming up, some of the day's biggest stock movers.  Plus, score one for the tobacco industry.</p><p>VARNEY: The Florida Supreme Court makes a surprising decision in the landmark class-action case and lights a fire under tobacco stocks. The details when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Commerce One tops tonight's other movers.  It soared nearly 47.  The e-commerce service firm will help General Motors create an Internet marketplace that will link GM's suppliers and dealers.  Real Networks up 10 1/8 on speculation Yahoo! could make a takeover bid. Yahoo! would not comment on the rumors, and one analyst said the CFO of Real Networks was unaware of the speculation.</p><p>Apple Computer up 1 1/4.  Bear Stearns raised its price target based on confidence in its near-term outlook.</p><p>And Qualcomm soared nearly 35 3/4.  Two analysts raised their price target after Qualcomm reporter better-than-expected earnings late yesterday.  Qualcomm also announced a four for one stock split. Its shares up more than 900 percent for the year.</p><p>VARNEY: A potential break in a Florida class-action case that threatens to overwhelm the tobacco industry.  And as Susan Lisovicz reports, the surprising news gave a big boost to tobacco shares.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In July, a Florida jury found cigarette makers liable for smoking-related illnesses in potentially hundreds of thousands of smokers.  Now, a four-sentence order from the state's highest court has the potential to limit the damages the tobacco industry might have to pay out.</p><p>Cigarette makers appealed to the Florida state supreme court just last Friday on the potentially devastating issue of whether punitive damages could be awarded in a lump sum to the entire class of smokers.</p><p>JACK COFFEE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL: It indicates that the Florida Supreme Court is taking very seriously the defendants' objections to any attempt to assess punitive damages at this second phase of the trial.  And punitive damages is where the bottom line is for the industry, because they could be potentially liable for as much as $300 billion.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Wall Street had not expected the state's highest court to take jurisdiction in a case that is still being argued before the lower courts.  Tobacco stocks soared on the news, led by industry leader Philip Morris, though the Dow component is still down nearly 50 percent for the year.</p><p>Some analysts say the Florida Supreme Court's involvement at this early stage may be a turning point.</p><p>MARTIN FELDMAN, SALOMONSMITH BARNEY: It could be the beginning of the start of real difficulties for the plaintiffs' case, and of course, that's pretty good news for the tobacco industry.  But it's my speculation that eventually punitive damages will not be allowed to be assessed on a class-wide basis in this case.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ: The Florida Supreme Court has ordered the plaintiffs' lawyers to respond by November 15th.  Wall Street is encouraged not only by the court's rapid response to the tobacco industry's appeal, but the speed in which it's trying to resolve the issue -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Susan Lisovicz reporting.  Thank you, Susan.</p><p>BAY: 58 days until Y2K and news tonight that software companies are beginning to staff up.  In anticipation of heavy call volume on help lines, Microsoft will have about 3,000 people on hand for the changeover.  And Computer Associates is contemplating spending $6 million for extra staffing to make sure clients can find human beings at the end of the Y2K help line.</p><p>VARNEY: That would be nice.</p><p>BAY: Coming up next on MONEYLINE, a new book on how to make a billion dollars '90s style: turning \"The New New Thing\" into a \".com\" sensation.</p><p>VARNEY: We'll hear from author Michael Lewis on his dispatch from inside the world of the digital elite.  Stay with us please.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's MONEYLINE \"Focus\": \"The New New Thing\" from author Michael Lewis.  He wrote the 1980s bestseller \"Liar's Poker,\" a scathing insider account of the brash bond traders at Salomon.</p><p>Now, he's out with \"The New New Thing,\" a 1990s account of maverick entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.</p><p>I began by asking Mr. Lewis how the digital elite compares with the Wall Street stars of the '80s.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHAEL LEWIS, AUTHOR, \"THE NEW NEW THING\": One is much bigger and more powerful that the other, I think.  The Silicon Valley people are just, you know -- they make the Wall Street people look like they're playing in a low-stakes poker table.</p><p>VARNEY (on camera): Is it just that much money on the table?</p><p>LEWIS: Oh, it's that much bigger.  Yes, it's that much bigger.</p><p>They're also, you know -- historically, Wall Street people have sat on top of the food chain.  You know, there's nothing new about Wall Street people running the economy.</p><p>These guys who are now sitting on top of the food chain, they've never been there before, you know.  It's like the New Orleans Saints having a winning season, a group of people who you didn't really expect to do well doing as well as they are.</p><p>VARNEY: Would you make the value judgment that they deserve to be sitting where they're sitting?</p><p>LEWIS: I think they're more deserving of it than the Wall Street people were.  I think there's a question of whether anybody deserves to have that kind of economic power.  But they're unquestionably producing wealth, you know, that the society has come to a consensus that wealth is change, that technological change is really the source of wealth.  And that's what these people specialize in: foisting change upon other people.</p><p>VARNEY: Jim Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics, founder of Netscape, the visionary behind Healtheon -- now, you write extensively about him and you say that he doesn't go to the office, he doesn't take meetings, he doesn't execute.  The man doesn't manage.  Is he typical of the Silicon Valley elite?  A totally different lifestyle.</p><p>LEWIS: He's typical of a certain type of Silicon Valley person, and that's the person who starts things.  And that person is sort of the catalyst for the whole place.  He's the prime mover.  He's the one who stands up and says behold the new new thing.</p><p>VARNEY: But he doesn't implement?</p><p>LEWIS: But he doesn't implement, that's right.</p><p>VARNEY: And he wouldn't be any good at implementing.</p><p>LEWIS: And he wouldn't be any good at it.  He's a -- a -- you know, I refer to him as a disorganization man, that what he really does is thrive on chaos.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, there's a great deal of wealth that's being created here.  And currently, it's on paper.  It's the new wealth of the new economy.  Do you ever feel that it's perhaps a house of cards that could come crashing down?  Any chance of that?</p><p>LEWIS: Oh, sure.  But you know, this is one of those situations where perceptions create their own reality, that I think people believe so strongly that this is all working out that it will work out.</p><p>It's very funny.  If you throw enough capital and brains at problems, the problems tend to get solved.  And that's what's going on: massive amounts of capital, and you know, the best brains in the society are working on changing the society, laying a whole new infrastructure, a whole new distribution system.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, do you see any downside to all this wealth creation?</p><p>LEWIS: Well, I think the downside is -- I mean, it creates a wealthier society, but it creates a lot of disruption in the society. And the question is -- how much change can a society withstand, I think is the great question I ask?</p><p>Industries have been thrown in turmoil.  You know, people are being asked to adapt to things in ways they haven't had to before, and that's, you know -- how much ruthlessness and shiftlessness can a society take?</p><p>Now, Silicon Valley people, they can take a lot of it.  They're very good at it.  But people outside of Silicon Valley have problems with it.</p><p>VARNEY: The elite of the '80s was one type type.  The elite in Silicon Valley of the '90s was another type, a different type.  Would you care to specify on what the elite of the next decade will be, where it will be located, and how it will makes its money?</p><p>LEWIS: I don't think the Silicon Valley thing has legs.  I don't think it's going to be over anytime soon.  I think that we're seeing the beginning of something that is going to last for awhile.</p><p>VARNEY: Is it uniquely American?</p><p>LEWIS: It's uniquely American in a lot of ways.  It's uniquely American in that it depends on the capacity for social change that other societies don't have.  No societies could have thrown the capital at this problem, that, you know, nobody can walk into a venture capitalist on Sam Hill Road in Silicon Valley and get $3 million just on the strength of an idea.  That doesn't happen anywhere else.</p><p>VARNEY: That's very true.  There you have it.  A true believer in the Internet.  \"The New New Thing\" from Michael Lewis.</p><p>BAY: Stay with us.  We'll be back right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: A new market may be opening up for Prozac.  An FDA panel today approved the use of the top selling antidepressant to treat a severe form of premenstrual syndrome.  The FDA OK may be good news for Eli Lily, which has seen growth in Prozac sales slow.  Lily's stock up 3 points, but it is still down more than 25 percent from its 52-week high. BAY: A boost for Blockbuster, after the video retailer struck a deal with America Online.  AOL will invest $30 million in Blockbuster's online business.  Under the three-year deal, Blockbuster will become the premier home video provider on AOL's Entertainment Channel.  Earlier on CNN, AOL's president said deals like this help it stand out from other Internet service providers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT PITTMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; COO, AMERICA ONLINE: I think at the end of the day, what we've wound up being is a service which is unique, very valuable to members.  We invest a lot of our money making AOL different than all the other services.  We do things you can't get anywhere else, and we think at the end of the day, our members are looking for that high quality, high-priced service.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAY: Shares of AOL ended up 6-3/8.  Blockbuster, a publicly traded unit of Viacom, up 1 3/8, though still below its IPO price of $15 a share.</p><p>VARNEY: Up next: Well, we've already told you about \"The New New Thing.\" Now we're going to tell you about the new new rich.</p><p>BAY: And \"Ahead of the Curve,\" some of what you need to know tonight, before the markets open tomorrow.  You are watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Health care stocks have staged an impressive recovery this week.  Tomorrow we'll find out how some of those companies fared in the third quarter, when Foundation Health and Humana report earnings. Also look for results from Starwood Hotels and Royal Dutch Petroleum. And keep an eye on shares of Scient.  The stock jumped $8 in after- hours trading, after the company announced a two-for-one stock split. And the woman who has been known to move markets, Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs, speaks at the annual meeting of the Securities Industry Association.</p><p>VARNEY: And now a final note on one of our top stories: Nasdaq 3,000. The road from 2K to 3K has certainly made some of the world's richest men richer, ballooning the billionaire status of the likes of Bill Gates and Michael Dell, But the \".com\" stock craze over the past 15 months has created a new social class: the new new rich.  Pierre Omidyar, eBay's founder and chairman, was making $121,000 before the online auctioneer went public last year.  Tonight, he's worth -- get this -- $4.7 billion, on paper that is.  Jay Walker, the co-founder of Priceline.com, made $250,000 last year.  Now he's worth $3.5 billion. And here's a pay raise worth repeating: Gary Winnick earned nothing from his work with Global Crossing last year, tonight, his stake is valued at $3.4 billion.</p><p>BAY: And this important note before we close: We're pleased to be able to announce that Shelby Coffey will become the new president of CNN Financial News and CNNfn.  In making the official announcement today, CNN news group chairman Tom Johnson said, \"We're fortunate to be joined by one of the finest and most accomplished journalists in the nation today.\" Coffey comes to us from ABC News, where he served as executive vice president.  Prior to that, he was executive editor of \"The Los Angeles Times.\" And we welcome him.</p><p>VARNEY: Indeed.</p><p>BAY: That is MONEYLINE for this Wednesday.

Bottom line: America has dominated innovation in the world for 100 years based on our patent system and protection of risk-takers. Innovation is the one thing we still dominate in the world economy. It is our job engine.  The first rule of governing should apply here: If it aint broke don't \"fix\" it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sponsors, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, worked extremely hard and were well-meaning, but the big lobbyists hijacked the process.  The bill was conceived to solve the problem of truly frivolous lawsuits in the technology and banking industries. That problem was solved in five minutes, and then the big companies got ahold of the Bill and added all their bells and whistles and it passed based on sheer inertia.  Few in Congress like this law, but they went along because big companies have more power than true innovators.  Many will cheer it just to suck up to their representatives.   Not me.  Few, like Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington state, had the courage to call the bill what it is and that it \"tramples the rights of small inventors.\"</p><p>We gave some real competitive advantage to Europe and China with our \"first-to-file\" from first to invent. Now big companies and foreign firms with fleets of patent lawyers can \"scoop\" university professors and independent inventors by filing first. Our national investment in research and development has been devalued.</p><p>A lot of the reform was driven by the fat and happy tech companies like Intel, Cisco, Google and large New York banks.  I call them the \"infringers lobby\" because their overt goal is to use their market power to steal other's ideas without paying.  That is what this bill does with its business methods section and also the new \"post grant review\" provisions.</p><p>These poor companies, most with market caps over $100 billion, whine loudly about how they are being harassed by the little guy.  Never a larger load of horse manure have I heard in my 25 years of starting companies.  They have forgotten their roots as venture capital-funded companies who relied on patents to get their funding in the first place.  Now that they are less innovative, bloated bureaucracies, they want to repress the innovations of the little guy.</p><p>These technology companies and big pharmaceutical companies and others will use the new post-grant review clause to slow the patent process down, and to bleed small companies dry. It happens now, and will be much worse in the future, by big companies filing objections to the true innovations over and over, drying up small inventors' ability to raise capital.</p><p>We have inadvertently put another nail in the coffin of American competitiveness.  Our future, and the only way we can compete with China, is our unique ability to invent. It is the core American ideal. We can find our way out of any problem, and the little guy, be he Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Steve Jobs,  Jonas Salk, or Gordon Moore, can dream big and invent new industries. All protected in their infancy by a strong patent system.</p><p>Not a single job will be created by this bill. Just happy smiles from big oil, big tech, and big pharma, lawyers and lobbyists, and with downright glee in China and the EU.</p><p>The most alarming fact is this law is just part of an even larger assault on innovation in the USA. Everywhere you turn, there is less capital available, higher taxes proposed on small business investors, more regulations on IPO companies and investors, an FDA gone wild, and crazy immigration and border policies that drive the best and brightest from our shores.   The talk in Washington seems to be all about innovation saving us, and the policies seem to be all about killing it.</p><p>  Comments (9) | Reprints  | Share:</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-XCNY10782213155847124255091800</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">XCNY-6604</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53RX-JXD1-JBF5-T118-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><timeReceived>2:55 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Newstex LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2011 Xconomy</copyright><publicationName>Xconomy</publicationName><aggregationName>Newstex Web Blogs</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>September 11, 2011 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Madara, executive vice president and CEO of the American Medical Association, Chicago, Illinois, has issued a public comment on the Federal Trade Commission proposed rule entitled \"Health Breach Notification\". The comment was written on Aug. 20, 2020, and posted on Aug. 21, 2020:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>On behalf of the physician and medical student members of the American Medical Association (AMA), I appreciate the opportunity to submit comments in response to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) request for public comment on its Health Breach Notification (HBN) Rule (\"HBN Rule\" or \"Rule\"). The FTC seeks to ensure the Rule has \"kept up with changes in the marketplace, technology, and business models,\" noting that \"as consumers turn towards direct-to-consumer technologies for health information services (such as mobile health applications, virtual assistants, and platforms' health tools), more companies may be covered by the FTC's Rule.\" The AMA greatly appreciates the FTC's recognition of shifts in the technologies patients use to manage their health care and information, particularly following the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act/1 (Cures) and its implementing regulations promulgated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology/2 (ONC) and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services/3 (CMS) earlier this year. As health information is increasingly exchanged outside of the protections of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the FTC must continue to serve a critical role in preserving and strengthening the privacy and security protections of consumers' health information. The Rule is more important now than ever and we strongly urge the FTC to expand its scope and enforcement.</p><p>The first step of any ultimately successful privacy framework, legislative or regulatory, places the patient first. Each entity seeking access to patients' most confidential medical information must pass the stringent test of showing why its professed need should override individuals' most basic right in keeping their own information private. Moreover, citizens deserve a full and open discussion of exactly who wants their private medical information and for what purpose. The AMA's approach to privacy is governed by our Code of Medical Ethics and long-standing policies adopted by our policymaking body, the House of Delegates, which support strong protections for patient privacy. These policies and ethical opinions are designed not only to protect patient privacy, but also to preserve the trust inherent in the patient-physician relationship. Patient trust in the health care system can only be assured when all entities that maintain a patient's health information have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of that information and when patients truly have autonomy and control over decisions to disclose or retain their personal information. The AMA's recommendations for how to strengthen privacy guardrails and foster greater trust are included below.</p><p>The FTC Should Expand the Scope of the HBN Rule Beyond Traditional Personal Health Records (PHRs)</p><p>Currently, the Rule's breach notification obligations extend to PHRs, defined as electronic records of identifiable health information that can be drawn from multiple sources and that are managed, shared, and controlled by or primarily for the individual. These obligations stem from Congress' recognition in 2009 that certain entities--namely, vendors of PHRs and PHR-related entities such as those that offer products and services through PHR websites, access information held by PHRs, or send information to PHRs-- collected individuals' health information yet were not subject to HIPAA. Generally speaking, the HBN Rule requires PHRs and PHR-related entities to provide notice to consumers whose unsecured individually identifiable health information has been breached, in addition to providing notice to the FTC and, in some cases, the media. The Rule also requires third-party service vendors to provide notice to PHR vendors and PHR-related entities of breach discoveries.</p><p>U.S. health care has gradually shifted over the last 10 years toward digital record-keeping in the professional health care realm--the world of hospitals, health plans, and physician practices. That transition occurred under the umbrella of privacy and security rules rooted in HIPAA, a law which predates most modern online and mobile services, and explicitly excludes health information created or managed by patients themselves or by third-party applications (apps)--the very content the Rule seeks to protect. The rapid growth in the range and volume of digital patient data beyond the confines of the HIPAA framework--and exchanged using technologies and platforms beyond PHRs--merits serious attention. For many patients, the mobile nature and ease of use of third-party apps make them more attractive than traditional PHRs as a way to manage their health records. The AMA expects patients will continue to shift from PHRs to mobile health apps or PHR-health app hybrids going forward. Absent clear guardrails around how entities like app developers use data, public trust will crumble in the face of repeated scandals and undermine the potential for digital health to facilitate an era of more accessible, coordinated, and personalized care.</p><p>We learn more each day that personal health information is no longer private. Social media platforms, wearable fitness trackers, and apps allowing patients to download health records from EHRs and manage health conditions all collect data that are not protected by HIPAA. That means these data can be shared for a wide range of purposes, including advertising and marketing. Sharing that health information with data brokers, who can combine it with other consumer information (such as credit score, level of education, and even something as simple as a zip code), creates the perfect recipe for harmful profiling and discrimination./4</p><p>Data mining by insurers and employers leads to the creation of health or \"risk\" scores, which can result in harmful profiling and discrimination. Social media platforms, Internet search engines, wearable fitness trackers, and apps to manage pregnancy and mental health all pool personal data, turning it into a valuable commodity.</p><p>Indeed, there is growing awareness of how companies monetize individuals' health and other personal information. A 2019 Morning Consult national survey showed that 94 percent of people feel privacy and security of their medical information is important,/5 while a 2019 study by Rock Health and Stanford's Center for Digital Health shows consumers have become more reticent to share their health data./6</p><p>Among health care stakeholders, consumers are most willing to share their health data with physicians, but that sentiment has slipped since 2017, possibly due to spillover from privacy and security breaches in other sectors and general distrust of \"big tech.\"/7</p><p>A 2017 Black Book survey reports that:</p><p>* 87 percent of patients were unwilling to comprehensively share all of their health information with their physicians;</p><p>* 89 percent of consumers who had visited a health care provider in 2016 said they had withheld some information during their visits;</p><p>* 81 percent were concerned that information about chronic conditions was being shared without their knowledge; and</p><p>* 99 percent were concerned about the sharing of mental health notes./8</p><p>In other words, carelessness and lack of transparency in how consumer information is handled and used by technology has likely influenced what information a patient shares with his or her physician. This should serve as a warning to policymakers that consumers take privacy very seriously and that privacy safeguards for consumer-facing technology is critical to preserving patient health and safety./9</p><p>Recent events have highlighted not only how critical it is to have clear rules of the road with respect to data use, but also the lost opportunities for progress absent such rules. For example, we are currently experiencing unprecedented reliance on remote care technologies like telehealth to help people avoid leaving their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. But both patients and clinicians are justified in questioning how platforms will secure and protect the information exchanged during the virtual visits.</p><p>Similarly, many private and public efforts are underway to collect, use, and disseminate public health surveillance data to help inform public health officials and policymakers about the spread of the novel coronavirus. These efforts are critically necessary but have thus far provided unsatisfactory answers to questions about how best to handle the data, both during collection and once the pandemic has subsided.</p><p>In fact, a poll from the Washington Post and the University of Maryland demonstrate the American public's deep privacy concerns about using tech-enabled COVID-19 tracking and tracing systems that could help limit the pandemic's deadly toll./10</p><p>The lack of reliable assurances of how entities will collect, use, and exchange data has fostered reticence from the public to use technologies like public health contact tracing apps.</p><p>Finally, HHS' recently finalized interoperability and information blocking rules are poised to drastically impact the exchange, access, and use of electronic medical records. While the AMA wholeheartedly supports the intent of the rules to make it easier for patients to access their electronic health information, the rules lack safeguards to help ensure that patients understand what they are consenting to when they grant permission to an app to access their medical records. The AMA advocated strongly and regularly for HHS to include controls in the final rule to promote transparency on how apps use health information, whom apps share health information with, and how patients could prevent the apps from profiteering off of their data. Unfortunately, HHS failed to take meaningful action in its final rule to promote this type of transparency. As a result, patients may be less willing to share information with physicians for fear that technology companies and data brokers will gain access to and have unrestricted use of their indelible health data.</p><p>The AMA believes that mobile health apps and associated devices, trackers, and sensors must better address the privacy and security of patients' medical information. The AMA encourages the mobile app industry and other relevant stakeholders to conduct industry-wide outreach and provide necessary educational materials to patients to promote increased awareness of the varying levels of privacy and security of their information and data afforded by mobile health apps, and how their information and data can potentially be collected and used. The FTC has a valuable opportunity to help foster public trust by strengthening its rules for how apps may use and disclose an individual's health information and should, at a minimum, expand the HBN Rule's coverage to specifically include direct-to-consumer technologies and services such as mobile health apps, virtual assistants, and platforms' health tools (collectively referred to as \"entities\" in this letter).</p><p>The FTC Should Redefine \"Unauthorized Access\" To Promote Individuals' Understanding of Data Collection and Sharing Practices</p><p>Section 13407 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act),/11 which is the basis for the HBN Rule, and the HBN Rule regulations require PHRs to report the acquisition of unsecured PHR identifiable health information without the authorization of an individual. This definition highlights a pressing question in contemporary discussions around privacy: whether individuals truly understand what information they are authorizing a PHR (or other entity) to acquire, use, and share, simply by clicking \"accept\" through a series of terms and conditions. Society is increasingly recognizing that a consumer cannot truly, properly authorize the exchange of information without clearly knowing who is receiving the information. The moment a consumer installs an app, it begins searching for that person's data. Even the most vigilant consumer may unwittingly install an app mining for their personal information as nearly every app comes packaged with a range of Software Development Kits (SDKs). As companies have abused SDKs to siphon up personal user data even when they are not supposed to, SDKs have evolved as loopholes in our privacy. Accordingly, we strongly urge the FTC to redefine the term \"unauthorized access\" as described below to inject greater transparency into the PHR and related-entities ecosystem by incorporating the following recommendations in its HBN Rule.</p><p>The FTC should define \"unauthorized access\" as presumed when entities fail to disclose to individuals how they access, use, process, and disclose their data and for how long data are retained. Specifically, an entity should disclose to individuals exactly what data elements it is collecting and the purpose for their collection. Such information should not be used for a materially different purpose than those disclosed in the notice at the point of collection of such information. For example, an entity that collects location data to provide weather should not use that data for advertising.</p><p>Entities should only collect the minimum amount of information needed for a particular purpose, in accordance with regulation and/or federal guidance. For example, a weather app may need general location data (e.g., zip code), but not precise location data (e.g., GPS coordinates). Entities should also make public their data retention policy stipulating which data will be used and for how long. For example, an entity should disclose a policy stating which data elements are retained for operational or regulatory compliance needs. The policy should also explain who is responsible for each category of data and that data are disposed of if no longer needed. Absent this level of specificity, individuals are not truly providing entities with authorized data access.</p><p>Furthermore, the FTC should define \"unauthorized access\" as presumed when an entity fails to disclose to an individual the specific secondary recipients of the individual's data. The Wall Street Journal has reported on how much is at stake when patients share their personal health information with apps. Several apps feed users' personal health information to Facebook even if the individual does not have Facebook installed on his or her phone, or even possess a Facebook account./12</p><p>A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that many health apps created to track a user's progress in battling depression or quitting smoking are sharing the personal details they collect about an individual with third parties--like Google and Facebook--without the individual's knowledge or informed consent:</p><p>Transmission of data to third-party entities was prevalent, occurring in 33 of 36 top-ranked apps (92%) for depression and smoking cessation, but most apps failed to provide transparent disclosure of such practices. Commonly observed issues included the lack of a written privacy policy, the omission of policy text describing third-party transmission (or for such transmissions to be declared in a nonspecific manner), or a failure to describe the legal jurisdictions that would handle data. In a smaller number of cases, data transmissions were observed that were contrary to the stated privacy policies./13</p><p>Social media companies are not the only recipients of this information; apps are also being used as a powerful monitoring tool for employers and payers. Couched in corporate wellness, employers and payers have aggressively pushed to gather more data about their employees' lives than ever before:</p><p>Experts worry that companies could use the data to bump up the cost or scale back the coverage of health care benefits, or that women's intimate information could be exposed in data breaches or security risks. Although the data is made anonymous, experts also fear that the companies could identify women based on information relayed in confidence, particularly in workplaces where few women are pregnant at any given time./14</p><p>Lastly, the FTC should clarify that \"unauthorized access\" will be presumed if an entity's privacy policy is not written to promote understanding by those with elementary school levels of reading comprehension. There is an alarming lack of attention on consumer education and patient control over the use of their information once his or her information has been downloaded onto a smartphone. Apps often do not provide patients with clear terms describing how his or her data will be used. An app's terms can be 6,000+ words in length and can shield a developer's activities by permitting a \"royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable license, throughout the universe\" to \"utilize and exploit\" an individual's deidentified personal information for scientific research and \"marketing purposes.\" The terms may also permit a developer to \"sell, lease or lend aggregated Personal Information to third parties.\"/15</p><p>These facts reveal a significant failing in fundamental concepts of equity. Rather than permitting this industry practice to continue, the FTC should require entities to use clearly defined and unambiguous terms in their privacy policies. For example, statements such as, \"We may share this data with our partners to improve quality\" are vague and should not be permitted. Rather, clear and specific statements such as, \"We will share your name, date of birth, and lab results with your employer because you have signed up for their workplace wellness program\" should be promoted.</p><p>The FTC should Require Entities to Make Their De-Identification Processes and Techniques Publicly Available</p><p>The FTC asks whether the definition of \"PHR identifiable health information\" should be modified in light of technological advances in methods of de-identification and re-identification. Rather than opining on the most appropriate method of de-identification, we first note that there is disagreement among stakeholders over whether information can ever be truly de-identified./16</p><p>Additionally, some data historically not considered \"personal\" or \"identifying\" (e.g., IP addresses, advertising identifiers from mobile phones) may in fact be both. For example, many apps, particularly free apps, use advertisements to generate revenue. The advertisements collect and share an individual's advertising ID--a string of numbers and letters that identify an individual and keep a log of his or her clicks, searches, purchases, and sometimes geographic location as he or she moves through various apps./17</p><p>This information can be \"shockingly easy to de-anonymize\" and \"hundreds of apps collect 'anonymous' real-time location data that needs only the slimmest additional context clues to tie to an individual person.\"/18</p><p>As National Public Radio and ProPublica report, \"it isn't hard to understand the appeal of all of this data to insurers:\"</p><p>Merging information from data brokers with people's clinical and payment records is a no-brainer if you overlook potential patient concerns. Electronic medical records now make it easy for insurers to analyze massive amounts of information and combine it with the personal details scooped up by data brokers...allow[ing] insurers to deny coverage to sick patients./19</p><p>Accordingly, we urge the FTC to require greater accountability and transparency from entities claiming that they have de-identified an individual's PHR health information. Specifically, the FTC should revise the definitions section of its HBN Rule to clarify that entities must make their de-identification processes and techniques publicly available.</p><p>Decrease the Threshold for Immediate Reporting to the FTC</p><p>The FTC notes in its request for comment that the FTC's website lists only two breaches of the HBN Rule, \"because the Commission has predominantly received notices about breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals.\"/20</p><p>The AMA believes that the public may be better served by the HBN Rule if it requires public reporting of breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals. Strengthening the FTC's enforcement activity in this way would lead to an increased level of transparency and more accurate reporting of those individuals whose information has been improperly disclosed. Accordingly, the AMA urges the FTC to provide additional information to the public regarding the notices it received that impacted fewer than 500 individuals. For example, if the FTC received numerous notices that impacted 300-499 individuals, perhaps the 500+ standard should be revised to require reporting for breaches impacting 300 or more individuals. Again, this emphasis on increased transparency would help to build confidence in the use of technologies such as mobile health apps and encourage the public to regard the FTC as a reliable resource to consult when evaluating which platforms they should entrust with their health data.</p><p>In conclusion, the AMA believes that the FTC should continue to serve as the nation's leading consumer protection agency and use its authority to bring enforcement actions against any non-HIPAA covered entity that undermines consumer trust by sharing information, be it health or other pertinent personal data, without consumer knowledge. The AMA believes that the FTC's review of the HBN Rule is significant in light of the dramatic surge in consumer use of cloud-based PHRs and other technologies that assist individuals in managing their health conditions and we appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments.</p><p>If you have questions, please contact Laura Hoffman, Assistant Director, Federal Affairs at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:laura.hoffman@ama-assn.org\">laura.hoffman@ama-assn.org</email> or 202-789-7414.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>James L.

It's more unpopular right now because like the stimulus it hasn't lived up to the president's billing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The stimulus, the president said, would keep unemployment from rising above 8%. Of course it's gone up to 9.6%. The new healthcare law, the president claimed, would keep healthcare costs in check but as we all know insurance premiums have been going way up over the past few months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The insurance companies say it's because the new law forces them to cover more, but the administration says it's just because the insurers are a bunch of greedy bastards and they better stop raising the rates or else.</p><p>We can only assume the or else part would mean even more government intervention. Now we've seen this before, whenever the administration gets upset about the way the market reacts to government intervention they react with even more government intervention. It's sort of like the president thinks things like medicine and bank loans are too important to be left up to the market that the government's got is to be in control.</p><p>Well, the president may not like it but medicine is a business. And because it's a business and not a government service, it works pretty well. Our doctors, who are mostly small business folks, are the best in the world. Our hospitals compared to all the others around the world with all our glitches are top-notch.</p><p>Now, unless the president wants to completely transform healthcare into a public service, something he claims he doesn't want and the American people certainly don't want, he's got to expect that more government intervention will lead to higher costs. That's just the way the market works. Something that our next guest understands very well as a doctor, as a businessman and as a candidate running for congress in November.</p><p>Dr. Rob Steele joins us now from Ann Arbor, Michigan. Doctor, thank you for coming.</p><p>First of all I heard you were up practically all the night with an emergency care situation, right?</p><p>DR. ROB STEELE, (R) CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Yeah, that's right Dave. In fact last night about 2:45 I had to get out of bed and rush into the heart cath lab and see a 64-year-old woman who was having a heart attack and had to open up her artery and put in a stent.</p><p>ASMAN: Wow, so you are not only a doctor from profession in the past but you're a practicing doctor now. You have a medical group. Describe your medical group by the way, how many people you employ and exactly what it does.</p><p>STEELE: Well, I work with a wonderful group of do, about 30-some cardiologists and we have multiple location. We've got approximately 300 employees and provide outstanding healthcare services to a wide geographic area here in the District and just outside the District.</p><p>ASMAN: Doctor, how has it been affected so far by the new medical law?</p><p>STEELE: Well, most of the stuff hasn't really kicked in yet but as you were discussing this your lead-in the healthcare costs will clearly explode when you get the government involved that's what happens. And Thompson Reuters right here in Ann Arbor had a big white paper about a year ago talking about healthcare costs and the waste and they said number one thing was excessive testing due to defensive medicine approximately 38% of all the waste in healthcare.</p><p>And what we've seen here with this bill, of course, is that there's no tort reform.</p><p>ASMAN: None at all.</p><p>STEELE: What they did on tort reform is they threw in some demonstration projects that would go to the states to show what difference tort reform would make, but that's completely unnecessary.</p><p>You know our government was founded to have the states as the laboratories and of course there's been many, many states that have had tort reform, including here in Michigan and what we've seen is a marked reduction in medical malpractice premiums, but much more importantly actually is the provision of emergency services and substantial high risk services that have come back into places that didn't have them anymore because of these high risk situations until there was tort reform.</p><p>So the current healthcare reform does nothing for tort reform. And also it's like crack-cocaine. They have these federal mandates, they have 16 million new people that will be insured under this healthcare program but they're all going to be on Medicaid. And so they go - this is a state program of course and for a couple years the federal government kicks in but after that the states are on their own and the states can't afford this. They're having to figure out how to do all these things. And of course Medicaid they pay so little - in the state of Michigan it's approximately 18 cents on the dollar. And so there's very few doctors that accept Medicaid.</p><p>Now in our practice, of course, we take all comers. We provide a lot of emergency services and we don't check insurance or any of that sort of thing but the cost will clearly go up. One of the worst situations that we have in healthcare right now is that there's so much insulation between the people using the service and the people who are paying for it.</p><p>Right now average user pays 13 cents on the dollar for every dollar of healthcare consumed. And all you have to do is think - I mean, I know how much money I'd spend if got a free Lowe's or Home Depot card and I only had to pay 13 cents I'd be buying left and right.</p><p>ASMAN: You put your finger on it, which is the fact that medical care is a business like other businesses. I mentioned in my opening statement. That's exactly why it is so good here is because it does respond to incentives to incentives from the customer and from the marketplace but to the extent that this new law deprives medicine of a lot of the incentives means it is going to lose ha cutting-edge not only will we see prices go up, costs go up but chances are, we're going to see the quality go down. No?</p><p>STEELE: Well that's certainly possible. The more people are insulated the accountability goes away. Business owners are accountable to their customers and physicians are accountable to their patients and that sort of thing and now what's going to happen is everything's going to run through the government. And of course in our healthcare in our business of healthcare with our employees we provide excellent benefits because we have to compete with the university for our highly educated and technically trained employees.</p><p>ASMAN: Right.</p><p>STEELE: And what we've seen from 2005-2010 is our healthcare costs have actually gone down, are really flat and we've done that using market innovations that are available in our state with high deductible policies.</p><p>ASMAN Let me hold you on that point doctor. Are any of the market oriented means that you've used to bring down the costs, are any of them counteracted by this new healthcare law?</p><p>STEELE: Well, absolutely. I mean, one of the main things in healthcare thing, healthcare bill. They talk about you know you get to keep your plan. And that's absolutely false. First off, if you have Medicare Advantage that's going to go away.</p><p>But the key thing is there's unelected bureaucrats that will be running this whole thing. There's going to be an insurance commissioner which is going to lay out the program for every insurance company. So what you'll have is you'll have a, you know, there's going to be a gold, silver and bronze plans and that just changes slightly the deductible.</p><p>But for all of these things what they will have in common is they're going to be the classic kind of \"gold plated plans\" that are available now and these are by far the most expensive. That's where all the cost is when you have low deductibles because it costs as much to push a piece of paper through an insurance company for a $10 bill and there's lots of them in the under $5,000 range than when you start above $5,000.</p><p>ASMAN: OK. Now doctor. Hold on a second doctor. You're giving us so much information for us to wrap our head around.</p><p>STEELE: Sorry.</p><p>ASMAN: I want to get to the political part of the issue because you are running against John Dingell, a guy who himself I believe has been in congress longer than you have been alive. His father named John Dingell was also in congress. This is a political legacy that goes back I believe to 1933 or thereabouts.</p><p>How do you plan - I know incumbents are doing badly but an individual who has his roots that deep in your district it's going to be hard to pull him out. no?</p><p>STEELE: Well, it's obviously a challenge. And he's a long-standing career politician. Washington wants him back. He gets all of his money from the pacts and friends in Washington, D.C.. And all I can say is in the office I've never heard anything in the office from my patients like I've heard in the last year. They are upset with what's going on. They feel they're not being represented and they think it is time for a change.</p><p>They want someone who has had to live by the laws and operate under the regulations rather than a career member of Congress who is pretty much exempt from the idea of having to be right under the thumb of everything that happens to the average citizen in the district.</p><p>ASMAN: Doctor, stay with us. We want to bring in our FOX panel here. We have FOX News contributor Andrea Tantaros, from the FOX medical team, Dr. Mark Siegel and entrepreneur Jen Groover.</p><p>Dr. Siegel, let me go to you first, because you understand the business side of medicine very well. To what extent do you think that the president and his economic team are missing the fact that the reason why our medical system is as good as it is is because it's a business and it operates as a business and the only way it will continue to be good is if it continues to on operate as a business.</p><p>DR. MARK SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL TEAM: David the reason they're missing it is because they're not going into any doctor's offices. The more I hear them, the more abstract they sound. This physician who is running for congress talked about going in in the middle of the night last night and saving somebody with a cardiac stent. I did a study around the time Clinton was getting his stent and I found that in Canada he wouldn't have gotten it unless he was Clinton. He'd end up waiting to three months in Canada to get a stent. Four times as many stents are given here in the United States to save live. Why? Because of the entrepreneurial aspect of this, because people are excited, because there's research going on.</p><p>If the government gets involved, that's going get squashed.</p><p>ASMAN: Wait, hold on a second. The government's already deeply involved in that, because of Medicaid and Medicare, even before this health care law.</p><p>SIEGEL: It's a great point. The latest Census figures show that 30% of our patients are already on government insurance the highest on record.</p><p>My office doesn't represent what he is even talking about, the president. I mean, my patients are already worried because their premiums are going up. Services are going down. They're out of a job, they don't have any insurance at all. Deductibles are very, very high right now but you he what is going to happen as Obamacare hits more and more, the draft regulations are not going to even allow those policies.</p><p>ASMAN: And Jen, the more potential physician hear about the this the fewer likely to go to medical school and become physicians. It's long a long slog to go through medical school and internship and everything else.</p><p>JEN GROOVER, ENTREPRENEUR: It's expensive. And they want to come out and be able to at least be able to pay their loans back.</p><p>ASMAN: It's an investment. It's an investment in their future. And they're not willing to make the investment if they don't think they'll get paid back.</p><p>GROOVER: And our future as well in terms of health care. And it takes down the competition. We have nonbusiness people trying to make some of the biggest decisions in our country. And the thing that makes me most upset about hearing the story is, these doctor groups are trying go out and trying be innovative in how they run their companies, create these marketing tactics and - create these different techniques and they're getting blockaded every time by all these new regulations which is unfortunate.</p><p>And by the way, I also believe in an incentive-driven economy and incentive-driven health care system. And we need to be taking a large chunk of this money and starting with the children changing - putting more money into education, nutritional education, health care education to children so they're making healthy choices throughout their life to prevent all of this...</p><p>ASMAN: But Andrea, I'm just wondering if the president doesn't think medicine like a lot of other things is a public service more than a business. It's public service. Health care is a right as we've now been told not a privilege and therefore as a right health care itself is a public service so eventually we will have the government take over more and more and more of health care. We'll have the government pay for health care education and such.</p><p>ANDREA TONTAROS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, exactly. And they'll implement price control as they did in Massachusetts and then you'll find insurance companies will start to pull back on the products. It is about control. And I think Democrats approach this the wrong way. They approached it with that moral imperative that we need to cover the uninsured instead of looking at costs.</p><p>And right now there's a lot of different proposals on the table. You hear the option of defunding it. You hear partially repealing it. A couple of these things and I addressed this in my column tomorrow, the issues with all of those different things and the best option we have David is a full repeal I advocate for, but it's got to be coupled with some really pro-growth initiatives like opening up insurance getting insurance over state lines tort reform.</p><p>ASMAN: But Dr. Rob Steele, the momentum so far in this country, when you look at Medicare, when you look at Medicaid, when you look at this new health care law, I mean the attempt to get the market back in to health care seems Herculean if not an impossible task.</p><p>STEELE: Well, we've seen it with a lot of the regulations that are coming in. Part of the health care bill outlawed doctor-owned hospitals. And what's been shown in the states where this is available, and it's not in every state, because this many of these things are state by state cases, but in these places the doctor owned hospitals for example Heart Hospitals they've been shown to provide the highest quality care, have the highest patient satisfaction and have the lowest costs.</p><p>And so in the states where they have these things, and a lot of them where row take the top 10 rankings, they dominate 7 to 8 spots out of the top 10. They're clearly the cheapest, and the most cost effective and patient satisfaction driven.</p><p>ASMAN: But do you think they can survive given the current law of the land which we have to deal with as long as it is the law of the land?</p><p>STEELE: Well, they're going to do everything they can to stop it because of course that's the nature of big government and large businesses. you know, the major organizations trying to be in business with the government to stomp out and squash the competition from the innovative service providers who can do it cheaper or better and with higher quality and better satisfaction.</p><p>They'd rather have their own guaranteed situation where they don't have to compete with these up starts.</p><p>ASMAN: Dr. Rob Steele, thank you for coming in doctor. Appreciate it. Please come back and see us again.</p><p>We'll see more of our panel in a moment. Coming up on deck looks like the Democrats are going to punt on the Bush tax cuts when the administration does a good thing for business by doing nothing. Does that mean a November victor for Tea Partiers? Means a real economic recovery? Well stick around to find out.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, just 40 days until the midterms and Democrats looking to get out of Washington and return home to campaign. Senate Democrats most likely won't act on the expiring Bush tax cuts or any tax hikes. This could push a vote back until after election day. Now, there's a stand still inside the beltway but not here on \"Scoreboard\" where your vote counts.</p><p>Political paralysis as we're seeing in D.C. is that good for business? Is that statement a buy, sell or hold? Text 369249.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: We just had a poll issued today that three-fourths of all the U.S. investors view President Obama as anti-business and think that we have this sort of bias against business from the government. How do you change that perception around?</p><p>PAUL VOLCKER, FORMER FED CHAIRMAN: don't know because I think the perception is wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: Is it wrong or is it right? President adviser, former fed chairman Paul Volcker telling me today the critics have it all wrong. He says the president is not a far left anti-capitalist hater of business. But still those three-quarter investors a lot of small business owners even Intel CEO Paul Otellini begged to differ. That's why some folks are wondering whether the past three weeks of market gains are perhaps because the president's agenda's been stalled by political gridlock inside the beltway.</p><p>Joining us now for more on this for the D.C. View. We have Washington Examiner's Tim Carney and Wayne Rodgers from the investment point of view from the investment firm named after Wayne Rogers. Good to see you both.</p><p>Tim I saw a \"Washington Post\" piece today by Dana Milbank who is no friend of the Tea Partiers but he says Democrats have succumbed to paralysis, his words, in the closing days of the legislative session. Is that true? There will be nothing done before the elections?</p><p>TIM CARNEY, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: I wouldn't count that out. Tomorrow morning there will be a Democratic caucus meeting. And at that meeting who knows what's going to come out. We know that Nancy Pelosi had wanted to have a vote on these taxes before the election, a lot of members who are in competitive races which frankly is a lot of Democratic members, a lot of them don't want it and if Dana Milbank was already counting out the vote I think he's counting too early.</p><p>ASMAN: OK. So may be something.</p><p>CARNEY: ...a little less. They want to do as little as politically possible is what they're trying to do.</p><p>ASMAN: Right. I mean, that is the point that there is very little going on and with the views of investors about the administration so pessimistic Wayne about whether they are anti-capitalist or not is it any wonder the market has been doing pretty well these past three weeks as it's clear that the folks in D.C. are not going to be doing much?</p><p>WAYNE ROGERS, CEO WAYNE ROGERS &amp; COMPANY: Well, David, I actually think that the market far long time they was out of sync with the economy. The economy has been improving, it has been improving enormously. In fact...</p><p>ASMAN: Enormously?</p><p>ROGERS: Yes. Yes. Absolutely.</p><p>ASMAN: Even with an unemployment rate that's been doing nothing but going up?</p><p>ROGERS: Hold on. Let me explain. All you - everybody wants to talk about unemployment and they want to talk about those figures and remember, that's a lagging indicator. And they don't necessarily talk about what is happening in the economy</p><p>I sit on a board of a company in which our book to bill ratio in electronics company is the highest it's ever in the history of the company. I have a retail business as you know there in New York, Kleinfeld's, which we're up 18% this year over last year.</p><p>Our business is much better than the market itself is indicating. So the market has caught up with that to a certain extent now.</p><p>As far as the Democrats going, I agree they're not going to do anything. Nobody is going to do anything to upset anything before the vote. They are terrified of that and everybody, every business guy is saying gee, I can't trust anybody because I don't know what the future is going to be.</p><p>So naturally there is this stagnation that's going to take place until after the election.</p><p>ASMAN: But Wayne, you have to admit that so much, I understand that unemployment is a lagging indicator, but frankly, every time we get a new report, it goes up and up and up. And without people secure about their jobs, they're not going to be buying houses. They're not going to be going out and buying things in the stores. And a lot of companies who are sitting on all of this cash, trillions of dollars of cash that big companies are sitting on. Banks are sitting on a lot of cash, they're not going to loan it out. The companies aren't going to be using it until they're sure about the job situation, right?</p><p>ROGERS: Well, no, no. I disagree. Let me tell you why.</p><p>ASMAN: Why are they sitting on it then?</p><p>ROGERS: I'm about to tell you. Because the federal, the FDIC will not let them make the loans. In other words, when the FDIC comes in and looks at a bank, goes through an examination, what they call the CAMEL system, what used to be a CAMEL two they downgrade to CAMEL three or CAMEL four now. The FDIC is not letting these banks and all of these examination make loans. They are downgrading they're loan portfolio, re-evaluating it, and then come back and say oh, by the way you're under capitalized.</p><p>And if you see the number of foreclosures they're being somewhat arbitrary about this. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. Obama is speaking out of one side of his mouth while the FDIC is doing something totally different. The bureaucrats...</p><p>ASMAN: Hold on a second. Let me bring Tim back into the situation here.</p><p>Tim, it is perception of at least Republicans in Congress that this economy is having trouble gaining traction. All the comments of my good friends Wayne Rogers notwithstanding. It is that feeling that seems to be pushing not only Republicans but the Tea Party movement and frankly the Democratic paralysis. No?</p><p>CARNEY: I do think, and Wayne had a good point there about the bank not lending out for various reasons but if profits are going up a lot of that is because companies are trimming back. They're trimming back their investments and trimming back their employment. So that's why profits and employment would be going in different directions.</p><p>And politically, all that matters in the economy is whether somebody is unemployed or is afraid of getting unemployed. That is 90% of what people care about with the economy. And so that is a huge part of what is driving the Republican insurgents.</p><p>But also the fact there are corporate profits and big businesses are able to get capital by selling their own bonds but small businesses can't. Combine that with the bailouts and the Democrats now are sort of trying to brag about the bailouts. I think there's some populist energy on the right driving the Republicans.</p><p>ASMAN: All right guys we have to leave it at that. Wayne we may disagree but I'm very happy your businesses are doing well buddy. Particularly because you very often reach into your generous pockets and pay for my dinner when we get together here in New York.</p><p>We'll see you soon Wayne. Thank you very much for coming in. Tim Carney, good to see you as well.</p><p>Coming up on deck, if the Tea Party movement is so dangerous, why is it the hottest thing in Rome? Yeah, Rome, Italy.</p><p>And the White House kicking up the hype on Obamacare. Are they bending the truth? We'll report, let you decide.</p><p>And we want to know what you think, political paralysis of which we just spoke is good for business. Is that statement a buy, a sell or a hold? Text 369249.</p><p>ASMAN: Some Democrats planning new attacks on business. That story topping tonight's Drill.</p><p>Let's welcome back our panel - Andrea Tantaros, Jen Groover and Mark Siegel. Let's fire up the clock.</p><p>Chances are increasing that lawmakers won't deal with tax cuts before they leave to campaign for mid-terms. It might happen, but probably not.</p><p>But in anticipation of the election so-called progressive Democrats are going to specifically target companies that have moved offshore. So, will this anti-business strategy help Dems in November?</p><p>Jen, I bet you are saying no, right?</p><p>GROOVER: No, it won't. But I think they're going to try to avoid it because they see where it is going with the Tea Parties and all the excitement and desire for change. But going after companies who are moving offshore, you don't go after them, you create incentives for them to stay here and to manufacture here.</p><p>Paul Volcker talks about we have to bring the country back by manufacturing. Where are the incentives for people to stay and keep their companies here and grow through manufacturing.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, and Andrea, it's - those companies that make their money offshore, it's actually cheaper for them, like Microsoft for example, to borrow money here that they need to use rather than repatriate their money from abroad because of the new taxes they had to pay.</p><p>So even for the big companies, there are all these penalties for doing business.</p><p>TANTAROS: Why wouldn't they just cut the corporate tax, bring the businesses home. And I'll tell you why they're not voting on these tax bills, David. I got the whip count, Pelosi is not going to bring this bill to the floor, she doesn't have the votes. She wouldn't pass it. And the reason she's sending her members home early is because of - yes, is because of fundraising money.</p><p>ASMAN: The magic number is 39, by the way. So there are at least 39 Democratic defections?</p><p>TANTAROS: That's right.</p><p>ASMAN: Wow.</p><p>TANTAROS: She will not - David, you know this better than anyone, politics, she's not going to bring a vote to the floor that she's going to lose. That's why we're not seeing a vote on tax cuts, because she knows she's going to lose. And they're sending them home, because there's money coming in to Republicans.</p><p>SIEGEL: David, if there's one thing the American public dislikes almost as much as all of this excess government regulation stifling business, it's this attitude of targeting companies for destruction, saying you don't agree with us, we don't like you.</p><p>ASMAN: It might work when you target specific companies like greedy Wall Street bankers but when you try group everybody, the whole of American business community.</p><p>All right, the White House launching a website highlighting what it calls \"milestones in Obamacare.\" It's only six months old. The site using videos of people thanking the president for his efforts. Score the new video, Jen. Good PR or not?</p><p>GROOVER: It's trying to build a brand for the PR tactic. I can see somebody else coming out the anti, here's my problem, here's what I'm losing, here's the cost of it. They are hoping that doesn't happen. I am waiting to see someone taking that initiative. And it's going to be a group of small business owners being burned right now and people who are not getting employed because people are not going to be able to afford to employ them.</p><p>ASMAN: Doctor, there are so many cases you have that doctors can bring to their patients. Doctors don't keep their mouth shut. They tell their patients what they think of all this.</p><p>SIEGEL: I think this website should take direction from a novelist, because it is becoming more and more fictional what is going on. Go to a real doctor's office. Patients are angry and doctors are angry. Obamacare as it starts to fit in is not working.</p><p>ASMAN: I have been hearing reports of doctors discontinuing their work with Medicare patients because they are worried. Already you see --</p><p>TANTAROS: We don't need to wait for a video. You see the Tea party movement. It is already happening. And I doubt a video will be able to stop this. If the White House thinks that will stop the criticism then they are seriously disturbed.</p><p>But they left out one milestone, a new high, 61 percent, according to Rasmussen, disapprove of Obamacare. They didn't put that in the video.</p><p>ASMAN: The Tea Party going global. It's strange enough that Britain has a Tea Party, but now it is spreading to Australia and even Italy. Tea Party Italia planning events this weekend focusing on lower taxes and limited government. So could be Tea Party ideals of limited government spread even to Europe?</p><p>GROOVER: Absolutely. This whole libertarian thought process of let people do business, they are seeing a voice and there's a reaction to this voice and momentum behind this. And so they are seeing their own problems which have been enormous. So they are hoping if they take a page out of what we're doing, advocacy, it will affect change.</p><p>ASMAN: And you are seeing countries like Germany that have downsized the government doing pretty well, at least better than the others.</p><p>GROOVER: Or Greece, which will be forced downsize the government. In Europe it is hand in glove situation. We see what excess government control does. It stifles private interests, and I think the Tea Party will fit in perfectly over there.</p><p>ASMAN: The difference is thought that over there the unions have maintained their strength. Here in the United States over the past 40 years we have seen union membership go down exit for the public sector unions. The power of unions is not as strong. You look at these Greek protests, mostly are unionized.</p><p>TANTAROS: The violent Greek protests were anarchist groups and it was the unions that were more peaceful. I predict if we get an immigration bill you will see a deal that a lot of these illegal immigrants will be funneled into the unions, and that is why the unions are quiet.</p><p>So I predict more unions will rise up and be strong. But I do like the story little bit because Europe gives us the trends. We're following what they do. It is about time they follow the Americans.</p><p>ASMAN: Follow the American revolution, folks.</p><p>Coming up on deck, get rich quick by snitching -- a good way to be greedy on Wall Street or is this more big government crud? We will let you decide.</p><p>Also, don't forget to vote. Political paralysis is good for business. Is that a buy, sell, or hold? Text 369249.</p><p>ASMAN: Wall Street specializes in finding ways to profit from new regulation, but a different kind of greedy individual can profit from the new finreg law. You can find about at the premiere of Fox's Wall Street sequel.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STUART MEISSNER, SECSNITCH.COM: Report whistleblower violation of security laws to the SEC and be awarded up to 30 percent total recovery. They have successfully represented many employees in whistleblower actions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: That's the gist of it -- get rich by snitching. It's the brainchild of Stewart Miser, a securities lawyer with years of experience with the New York attorney general's office. He worked with Bob Morgenthau as well, our local attorney here who is one of the best in the business.</p><p>But a lot of people this strikes as snitching. It rubs people for wrong way, lawyers, a little bit ambulance chasing going on. How do you defend this?</p><p>MEISSNER: Well, \"snitch\" is a derogatory term, but if you look up, it just means informant. And prosecutors have used informants for an eternity, since Eliot Ness.</p><p>So this is basically turning capitalism in its best form to assist Wall Street. And what is the best way to assist Wall Street is by giving financial incentives to the good guys to come forward and give information that will prevent the next Madoff.</p><p>ASMAN: Let's be specific about what this stems from. The financial regulation law has within it -- it was passed in July -- has within it a provision that you can get if you were a whistleblower and you find out some dirty business going on in your financial firm, you report it to the SEC.</p><p>If the prosecution is successful and the company has to pay a fine, you get up to 30 percent of that fine.</p><p>MEISSNER: That's correct. And by the way, it's not limited to employees. It could be business associates, ex wives, or anyone.</p><p>ASMAN: In the case of Goldman Sachs that would amount to $100 billion.</p><p>MEISSNER: Over $160 million.</p><p>ASMAN: Nothing like that happened as of yet, though, right? It is a new law. They are testing territory.</p><p>MEISSNER: Actually, I am meeting tomorrow with the senior adviser of the SEC to assist in implementation of rules for that statute which they are putting into effect over the next couple of months.</p><p>ASMAN: And we should mention, you have already filed for these claims.</p><p>MEISSNER: I believe now five.</p><p>ASMAN: And these are individuals within the company that say they spotted dirty business?</p><p>MEISSNER: Both former employees, business associates -- and we have several we are looking into right now, including an ex-wife.</p><p>ASMAN: Frivolous claims. This worries a lot of people. There are a lot of frivolous lawsuits in the court and there may be a lot of people looking to get rich who make things up, try to plant evidence. That has been known to happen in the case of bounty hunters. Is that a danger here?</p><p>MEISSNER: In my practice, we carefully screen each case. We don't take on every case that comes into the door, both to maintain my credibility with the SEC. And it doesn't serve anyone's purpose to bring frivolous claims that don't go anywhere.</p><p>ASMAN: It doesn't. But I'll tell you, if $100 million was hanging out, that is a big incentive.</p><p>MEISSNER: That's true, but the SEC won't pursue a case unless it's real. And it doesn't just start --</p><p>ASMAN: They missed a lot of cases that are real.</p><p>MEISSNER: That's correct, and this is all dependent on whether the SEC follows up on submissions.</p><p>ASMAN: How are they investigating? How do they take the information you get and apply it to the situation?</p><p>MEISSNER: I can tell you, so far two matters we filed, one has been filed up by the FBI and attorney's office, and the other by enforcement, the SRO in the securities industry that refers matters to the SEC. We have already seen reaction, and presumably they will take that further. We hope to see reaction to the other ones as well.</p><p>The ones that I have seen and filed are significant with major ramifications to the industry.</p><p>ASMAN: I have to ask. What is your cut?</p><p>MEISSNER: We do these on a contingency fee basis, and it varies.</p><p>ASMAN: Let's say somebody hits the jackpot, $100 million. What would your take be?</p><p>MEISSNER: It depends on the case. Every case is different. There is a lot of work involved. What we expect going forward as far as assisting with the SEC --</p><p>ASMAN: Like 10 percent to 20 percent?</p><p>MEISSNER: I'd say 20 percent to 30 percent.</p><p>ASMAN: And your job is, first of all, vetting the claim, looking at the evidence the individual has, making sure they are not trying to plant evidence, and then presenting that whole package to the SEC and following through?</p><p>MEISSNER: Yes. And the whistleblower law makes provisions to allow for anonymous claims. And in order to do that you have to go through an attorney who is the mouthpiece. So in theory, filing and anonymous claim, we have to be the mouthpiece going forward with the SEC.</p><p>ASMAN: Incentives work. And if this works it is great. It does still concern me a little bit that somebody might slip through. As good as you are as a former prosecutor, someone might slip through with planting evidence, but we will see how it checks out.</p><p>By the way, any names as of yet, or are you still waiting? Names of companies that are being looked at?</p><p>MEISSNER: Yes. One, like I said, is not an anonymous claim. It involves Wells Fargo. Another one is Bank of America Investments. And there are other major names as well as that.</p><p>ASMAN: Stuart Miser, best of luck to you. Thank you for coming in. Appreciate it.</p><p>MEISSNER: Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN: Coming up on deck, power ranking the top five big government regulations that technology companies would really like to blow up.</p><p>That there's still time to vote -- political paralysis is good for business. Is that a buy, sell, or hold? Text 396249.</p><p>ASMAN: Intel's CEO warning of a big tech crunch for America last month, blaming lawmakers for ridiculous regulations, taxes, and an overall hostile climate. So here with tonight's power ranking of the top regulations that tech companies would like to blow up is Fox Business's own Liz MacDonald.</p><p>LIZ MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: These are five of the tech world's not so favorite things. Let's start with the fifth. It's a medical device in health reform. This is a 2.3 percent tax for medical device makers. People who make tweezers or eyeglasses -- I am joke -- is there's going to be a lock box for the tax they pick up.</p><p>ASMAN: Even if it's just the medical industry, it employs 420,000 people and pays $24 billion. This is about three percent of the economy.</p><p>MACDONALD: And $20 billion will be gained supposedly from these taxes. They are going to sit in a lock box to pay for health reform -- doubtful. Next up.</p><p>ASMAN: Violent video game law.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's right. The state of California banned them in 2005. Action videogames make up about a fifth of all games. The fight here is a freedom of speech fight, and basically the state is saying they should be a level of porn.</p><p>ASMAN: Regulation of the internet, net neutrality, which I never really understood.</p><p>MACDONALD: This is a geeky, wonky term, but it matters big time. All data must treated equally on the Internet. You cannot block apps, people on the Internet. They're afraid of Google world. It is a pretty rational field.</p><p>ASMAN: California -- global warming and the regulations, cap and trade, they haven't been put in nationally, but California has one.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, states are moving fast. Just like the EPA, California is basically -- once it capped carbon emissions bringing it down to 1990 starting next year through 2020. What they're missing here is methane is a bigger problem for global warming than carbon. So we don't see that in the law.</p><p>ASMAN: Actually cow flatulation, forgive me represents 40 times what one car -- on cow puts out 40 times more global warming gases than one car.</p><p>MACDONALD: They should have a cap and trade in New Zealand and that will be the end of it.</p><p>ASMAN: The most important, of the -- of you want to start a factory, the regulations for starting a factory our onerous.</p><p>MACDONALD: CEOs are coming making with statements like the CEO of Emerson Electric, and a Lambert is talking about regulation, and GE gets a lot of money in the way of a lot of initiatives and policies. They have gone a lot of contracts from the government, also Verizon out of the box.</p><p>So essentially business saying we're stranded in the middle of traffic with regulations. Feels like a magical mystery tour.</p><p>ASMAN: It's no wonder why companies are going to factories in China because it is more difficult to set them up here. Not just labor costs.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's right, not just labor costs.</p><p>ASMAN: Elizabeth MacDonald, good to see.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm always delighted.</p><p>ASMAN: Thanks for coming in.</p><p>Coming up on deck, you know you really made it when embarrassing episodes of your personal life have been made into a cartoon.

They say in NASCAR if you are not cheating you are not trying.</p><p>But apparently the team couldn't hide it from the officials. The crew chief suspended six races. The driver falls from second place to twelfth place, a big drop in the standings. So Clint Bowyer's penalty, is that a buy, sell or hold?</p><p>GROOVER: It is a sell. You have to follow the rules.</p><p>ASMAN: So that is a buy on the penalty.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CROWLEY: It's all cheap, but you have to do it for a right way.</p><p>ASMAN: Or get away with it when no one notices.</p><p>TANTAROS: I'm holding it because it is not that they did it on purpose.</p><p>ASMAN: True.

By mid-May it should be available to most health agencies. And so it's time to revisit a question we first asked here three weeks ago: will Americans actually use these apps?</p><p><br/>That's the question posed in a new survey conducted by the University of Maryland and the Washington Post. The findings are mixed, report Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Alauna Safarpour:<br/>Nearly 3 in 5 Americans say they are either unable or unwilling to use the infection-alert system under development by Google and Apple, suggesting that it will be difficult to persuade enough people to use the app to make it effective against the coronavirus pandemic, a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll finds. [...]<br/>Among the 82 percent of Americans who do have smartphones, willingness to use an infection-tracing app is split evenly, with 50 percent saying they definitely or probably would use such an app and an equal percentage saying they probably or definitely would not. Willingness runs highest among Democrats and people reporting they are worried about a COVID-19 infection making them seriously ill. Resistance is higher among Republicans and people reporting a lower level of personal worry about getting the virus.<br/>The first thing to say about this is that it's very difficult to predict what people will do when they are asked to begin participating in Big Tech's exposure notification system. It might be true that, for the reasons of diminished trust in tech companies explored at some length in the Post, a majority of Americans will indeed opt out of using the system. It seems to me to be just as likely that, when presented with a simple pop-up box on their phones asking if they want to participate, some healthy percentage of Americans just tap \"yes.\" (In fact, 59 percent of survey respondents said they would \"be comfortable\" using the app to broadcast the fact that they are positive for COVID-19.) The whole appeal of the Apple-Google approach is that it makes participation dead simple; I suspect that simplicity will yield real benefits to public health authorities.<br/>The second thing to say is that if 50 percent of Americans did participate in the Apple-Google scheme, that would be pretty huge! Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, Natasha Singer and Aaron Krolik explain why in the New York Times:<br/>Only 25,000 people in North Dakota, about 3 percent of the population, have downloaded the state's app, which before last week was available only for iPhones. Last month, Singapore introduced a voluntary contact-tracing app, but only about 1.1 million people - 20 percent of the population - have downloaded it. Norway's app has caught on more quickly, with nearly 30 percent of residents signing up for it since it was released about a week and a half ago.<br/>Still, a recent study by epidemiologists at Oxford University estimated that 60 percent of the population in a given area would need to use an automated app that traces contacts and notifies users of exposure, combined with other tactics such as broader testing and the quarantining of the most vulnerable people, for the app to contain the virus.<br/>The primary challenge of getting people to use these exposure notification systems is to get them to download the app in the first place. Sometime this summer, Apple and Google will essentially install the functionality on your phone for you - and, with your permission, begin using it immediately.<br/>The Times goes on to quote an expert in disease transmission who says that the effectiveness of exposure notification scales along with usage. So, while 20 percent adoption of an exposure notification system in your community would not be ideal, it would be much more helpful than 10 percent adoption. And if exposure notification appeared to be working - if public health agencies use it as part of a broader scheme relying on human beings to do more old-fashioned contact tracing - you can imagine big campaigns within communities to get more people to opt in. (Or your employer forcing you to!)<br/>\u00a0<br/>Of course, it's right to worry about the privacy and public-health implications of building and relying on technologies like these. Several governments are collecting data about their citizens' physical locations along with information about smartphones coming into proximity, and processing that data on central servers. A Times analysis found that, for some reason, India's national exposure notification app was sending users' locations to YouTube (?).<br/>And it's easy to focus on the more exciting work of developing new technologies to fight the pandemic instead of on more proven methods of reducing new infections: widespread testing, isolating new cases, and using human beings to trace the contacts they had while they were infectious. (We need a lot more, by the way.)<br/>But at this point, nearly every expert I've spoken to on the subject believes that tech-based solutions can augment the work of public health departments and potentially make an important contribution to ending the pandemic. And in such a world, it's worth considering both high-profile solutions like ones being built by Apple and Google - and the alternatives being peddled in the shadows.<br/>For example, what if your contacts were notified about your COVID-19 infection not by an anonymous message relayed by Bluetooth signals between phones, as with Apple and Google, but by a spyware company whose stock in trade is breaking into criminals' phones? Joel Schectman, Christopher Bing, and Jack Stubbs raise that possibility in Reuters:<br/>Cellebrite's marketing overtures are part of a wave of efforts by at least eight surveillance and cyber-intelligence companies attempting to sell repurposed spy and law enforcement tools to track the virus and enforce quarantines, according to interviews with executives and non-public company promotional materials reviewed by Reuters.<br/>The executives declined to specify which countries have purchased their surveillance products, citing confidentiality agreements with governments. But executives at four of the companies said they are piloting or in the process of installing products to counter coronavirus in more than a dozen countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. A Delhi police spokesman said the force wasn't using Cellebrite for coronavirus containment. Reuters is not aware of any purchases by the U.S. government.<br/>(We've seen similar efforts from software built originally to track the movements of refugees.)<br/>Here we find a meaningful difference in the pandemic response between the Big Tech companies and the surveillance tech companies. One is opt-in and explained in public documents; the other is mandatory and takes place in the shadows. At the moment we don't know which approach will be more effective. But I do know which one I prefer.<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/>\u2b06\ufe0f Trending up: Twitter is making available a stream of tweets related to COVID-19 to approved researchers and developers.

Ed Yong delivers another urgent, sweeping analysis at The Atlantic:<br/>The variability of COVID-19 is also perplexing doctors. The disease seems to wreak havoc not only on lungs and airways, but also on hearts, blood vessels, kidneys, guts, and nervous systems. It's not clear if the virus is directly attacking these organs, if the damage stems from a bodywide overreaction of the immune system, if other organs are suffering from the side effects of treatments, or if they are failing due to prolonged stays on ventilators.<br/>Many US labs are processing coronavirus diagnostic tests far below their actual capacity. The shortfall stems partly from guidelines that limit testing to the sickest patients and front-line workers as well as a lack of centralized system to identify and use capacity. (Brianna Abbott and Sarah Krouse / The Wall Street Journal)<br/>A promising new saliva-based test for COVID-19 has some researchers hoping that it could help solve the ongoing testing shortage. (Apoorva Mandavilli / New York Times)<br/>Facebook and YouTube have been split on whether to remove videos from two controversial doctors who have called for an easing of quarantine restrictions in American communities. YouTube took them down; Facebook has so far left them up. Health experts have condemned their claims.

Test data from The COVID Tracking Project.<br/>Governing\u2b50 James Barnes, the Facebook employee who helped implement Donald Trump's advertising strategy during the 2016 election, is now trying to aid Democrats with the same approach. Nick Corasaniti explains at the New York Times:<br/>The coronavirus outbreak has also forced 2020 campaigns to rely on a nearly entirely digital infrastructure, from fund-raising to organizing to persuasion. Having fresh data to inform campaign arguments online is essential.<br/>This real-time testing project aims to help fill that gap. Called \"Barometer,\" the project has been the obsession of James Barnes, the former Facebook employee who was heralded as an \"M.V.P.\" of the 2016 Trump campaign and has since dedicated his professional life to undoing the results of the last presidential election. He found a home for the project at Acronym, which also houses Pacronym.<br/>Elsewhere, the person behind Trump's 2016 digital strategy, Brad Parscale, gets a fresh profile in the New York Times.<br/>The US trade representative's office put Amazon's web domains in Canada, France, Germany, India, and the UK on its \"notorious markets\" list of platforms that are believed to facilitate intellectual-property violations.

Tony Close will be the company's director of content regulation. (Matthew Moore / The Times)<br/>Facebook's antitrust fight in Washington includes a debate about what constitutes the company's market. This is a standard feature of every antitrust fight, but it's funny to read about Facebook arguing that its true competition includes, uh, video games. (Christopher Stern / The Information)<br/>Facebook beat a request from the federal government to wiretap Messenger in 2018. Now the American Civil Liberties Union is seeking to unseal the ruling on why, so that other messaging apps can learn from Facebook's strategy. (Edvard Pettersson / Bloomberg)<br/>Industry\u2b50 Facebook saw a significant surge in usage over the past three months, according to its quarterly earnings report. Its stock surged after hours on a solid performance despite the pandemic. Also of note: non-advertising revenue is up 80 percent year over year, suggesting that people are buying Facebook and Oculus hardware in significant numbers. (Nick Statt / The Verge)<br/>\u2b50 TikTok is thriving during the global pandemic and has been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally. It was downloaded 315 million times this quarter alone, according to third-party data. Here's Ashley Carman at The Verge:<br/>We've reached out to TikTok to confirm or comment on Sensor Tower's data and will update if we hear back. Still, it wouldn't be surprising if TikTok experienced its biggest growth quarter this year. It's even a joke on TikTok that millennials are finally all joining the platform because of the pandemic and social distancing. As people have more time on their hands and are bored at home, social networks are experiencing growth, despite advertisers tightening their budgets. Snapchat grew its daily user base by 11 million people this quarter, according to its earnings call, and its competitor Marco Polo also experienced massive growth, with a 745 percent increase in signups during just the week of March 30th. Only TikTok knows its own download and usage numbers, but we expect them all to be up.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1094073</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605B-G2S1-JBYT-H2DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2426\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Without this independent entity, 55 percent of those polled would rather yield content control to the companies themselves instead of to the government. A minority 44 percent preferred that the government guides content choices on those platforms. Of those identifying as Republican, only 35 percent trusted the government with content decisions on social pages.</p><p> The poll found that men, white people, and those with less education are more likely to view companies' content oversight systems as \"too tough\" in what they label as fake news or misinformation, and in some cases, remove.</p><p> Then there's the connected issue of the government trying to reform or remove existing laws that all online companies have to follow. In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has angrily opposed Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which states that internet companies aren't liable for speech from third parties hosted on their sites. But this poll found that 66 percent supported keeping the law as is to protect internet companies like Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and beyond from what its users post on the platforms. Twitter flagging Trump's tweet as inaccurate seems to have unleashed his reaction that the social platforms have too much control.</p><p> So, maybe there is something to that Facebook Oversight Board.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A misinformation newsstand displays all the fake news.

Colin Stretch, vice-president and general counsel at Facebook, struggled to answer an angry and incredulous Al Franken when the Democratic senator demanded to know why the social network accepted political advertisements paid for in Russian roubles.</p><p>All three companies will also testify Wednesday before the House and Senate intelligence committees as part of congressional investigations of Russian election interference. </p><p>Anger over their role in Russian information operations is just one aspect of a rising tide of public discontent with Silicon Valley's big tech firms. Once seen as the poster children for free market innovation, they now face scrutiny on both sides of the aisle for anti-competitive practices, tax avoidance and privacy-infringing data practices. In order to stave off regulation, tech firms have been pouring money into lobbying efforts in Washington to the point where they now outspend Wall Street two to one. </p><p>To understand American sentiment towards Facebook, Google and Twitter, the Guardian submitted questions to the nationally representative Harvard/Harris Poll, which surveys more than 2,000 registered voters each month. </p><p>Some of the questions mirror those that Facebook asks its own users in surveys conducted on the platform. Facebook does not release the results of questions it asks users, such as \"Is 'Facebook good for the world?\" and \"Does it care about its users?\"</p><p>In September, the Guardian  put those same questions to readers, and in October also submitted the questions, along with others about big tech, to respondents of the Harvard/Harris poll.</p><p>Thirty-two per cent of American voters agreed that Facebook was good for the world, although only 7% strongly agreed. Forty per cent of people were undecided, while 28% disagreed - half of them strongly.</p><p>Twitter appears to have a worse reputation, with just 20% of respondents believing that the company is good for the world. Forty-four per cent of people disagreed with the statement \"Twitter is good for the world\" -and more than half of those said they strongly disagreed with the statement.</p><p>Google was viewed most favorably, with 58% of people agreeing that Google is good for the world and just 16% disagreeing.</p><p>\"Facebook creates a demand on your time - that's a little onerous,\" said Jeff Hauser, who tracks the lobbying spending of tech companies at the Revolving Door Project. \"Google is a little more utilitarian.\"</p><p>The results followed a similar pattern when people were asked if the tech companies cared about their users.</p><p>Google came out on top in terms of the proportion of people who agreed that it cares about it users (46%), compared with Facebook (26%) and Twitter (17%).</p><p>More than a quarter of people (26%) strongly disagreed with the notion that Twitter cares about its users, while 22% of felt the same about Facebook. Only 12% of people strongly disagreed that Google cares about its users.</p><p>\"Facebook and Twitter are the two most powerful distributors of information in the world,\" said Nesho. \"Voters are aware of their amplifying force and their power when it comes to swaying policy and politics, and are increasingly concerned about it.\"</p><p>\"Reactions to the impact of these platforms to voters' personal lives and the world are tepid or negative, making it important for Facebook and Twitter to address the problems of abuse, privacy, and trust that drive these views.\"</p><p>                   The Guardian Facebook survey                   </p><p>Separate from the Harvard/Harris Poll, the Guardian asked its own readers about their perceptions of Facebook, using the same questions the social network asks its users. More than 3,700 people responded, and although their responses were not statistically representative, their answers also included written comments that explained their views. </p><p>When asked whether \"Facebook is good for the world\", only 10% of Guardian readers agreed, 22% were on the fence, and 68% - considerably more than in the nationwide survey - said they either disagreed or strongly disagreed. </p><p>Concerns about the platform fell into several categories: some complained the social network had become too large and powerful, while others cited its ability to influence elections, its failure to effectively tackle fake news, its Orwellian data harvesting practices and its effects on mental health, particularly on children. </p><p>\"Facebook has always been filled with immensely talented and driven people who have truly built something unique and world-changing,\" said one reader. \"But I also believe that the company has spun wildly beyond their control and been used in ways that they cannot combat.\"</p><p>Another added: \"Facebook was a good idea but has metastasized into a nightmare.\" </p><p>\"Facebook's wide-reaching, non-transparent and unregulated power to shape public opinion is a grave threat to democracy,\" said another. \"America is empowering a new era of robber baron who want us to believe they are beneficent philanthropists.\"</p><p>Eighty-three per cent of respondents to the Guardian's survey disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that \"Facebook cares about its users\", while just 6.5% agreed or strongly agreed.</p><p>\"Facebook uses every psychological trick they possibly can to manipulate their users into spending as much time as possible on the site,\" said a reader. \"They clearly do not care for their users - they treat them as commodities to earn maximum advertising from.\"</p><p> Related:  Silicon Valley helped Russia sway the US election. So now what? | Emily Bell</p><p>Replicating another question Facebook asks its users, the Guardian asked readers whether using Facebook made \"the world better or worse for people who are going through a challenging or difficult time in their lives\". </p><p>Sixty-six per cent of Guardian respondents said the social network made things worse, while 12% said it made things better.</p><p>\"As a doctor, I perceive it to worsen the mental health of vulnerable young people, teenagers in particular,\" said one commenter. Another wrote: \"In my own experience, Facebook use is addictive, as well as contributing to an exponential loss of concentration the more you use it, as well as heightened levels of anxiety.\"</p><p>Positive comments about Facebook tended to focus on its ability to keep friends and relatives connected across long distances and its role in bringing communities together during natural disasters.</p><p>\"Through Facebook's messenger I am able to see my husband and children face to face everyday. We live in separate countries so this is enormously helpful for the emotional side of things,\" said one reader.</p><p>\"It's great for keeping up with distant family and friends, and organizing the occasional event. It's good at being a scrapbook,\" said another. \"When it moves beyond that into a purveyor of news and culture, it falls on its face. It needs more oversight.\"</p><p>Many readers, however, argued that Facebook was simply a platform and could  not be held responsible for its users.</p><p>\"Facebook is often wrongly blamed for the poor behavior of bad people who use it,\" said one respondent.</p><p>\"Facebook is a tool,\" said another. \"It can be used for many different purposes - some good, some not good. The admins have a responsibility to make sure their algorithms aren't causing harm.\"</p><p>One commenter above all others summed up the complex relationship many people appear to have with the sprawling social network.</p><p>\"I hate how it seems to steal my time. I love it when something amazing turns up. I dislike it when it blocks me occasionally. I love it when I have the opportunity to comment on an important event. Since I spend about eight hours a day on it, I guess I love it more than I realize.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-38566983</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVK-8BP1-JCJY-G157-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1519\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The current proposal would result in mass surveillance of Libra users and business partners, systemically dangerous arbitrage of the financial regulatory system, and the concerted encroachment of Facebook and its partners into the financial services sector. It would escalate the dangerous trend toward the commingling of commerce and banking, and it would deepen Facebook's corporate economic and political dominance.</p><p>The report lays out a broad set of tools and actions that regulators can and should take. The FTC should exercise its broad mandate to prevent unfair methods of competition that would likely arise from within the Libra ecosystem, especially those rooted in privacy violations. The SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Reserve System should apply prudential regulation to Libra Networks under the color of federal securities regulation, derivatives regulation, banking regulation, or some combination thereof. Conduct regulators like the IRS, FinCEN, and the CFPB should be prepared to take action according to their respective mandates.</p><p>The report also argues for statutory changes to constrain corporate data use to a short list of permissible purposes, treat bank deposit \"substitutes\" as proper bank deposits, and generally impose bright-line bans on Big Tech's involvement in the financial sector.

This is especially concerning because the Libra Reserve fund would be exposed to turbulence in foreign exchange, sovereign debt, and money markets.\"</p><p>\"The Libra project is a unique attempt by dominant platforms to expand corporate power into new territory,\" says David Segal, executive director for Demand Progress Education Fund. \"The business history of Facebook and its partners suggests they are consistently willing to flout or evade laws regarding data collection, protection, and privacy in order to expand. The increasing combination of social media and payments data is especially troublesome to us, as it reinforces a threat of unfair competition and increased monopolization of our information economy.\"</p><p>[Category: Financial Services]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7156214 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7156214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6071-WFX1-JC11-1124-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 26, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, has issued a public comment on the Office of U.S. Trade Representative's notice entitled \"Initiation of Section 301 Investigations of Digital Services Taxes\". The comment was written on July 11, 2020, and posted on July 15, 2020:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Americans for Tax Reform appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Section 301 Investigations. The following comments summarize our position of the discriminatory design of Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) which arise from their nature.</p><p>Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) is an advocacy organization dedicated to the protection of American taxpayers in the United States and around the world.</p><p>ATR submits the below comments on the initiation of a Section 301 investigations. The intention of Digital Services Tax is to tax the revenues of major American technology companies in order to recoup their purported \"fair share\" of tax revenue that is not paid by companies due to their not having a physical presence in the countries taxing them.</p><p>We argue, however, that all Digital Services Taxes are the wrong direction for global tax policy. They are unilateral moves that are highly discriminatory to American companies, and its effects will be felt by consumers as well as through decreased global innovation and trade.</p><p>Instead of enacting DSTs unilaterally, the governments of the investigated countries should wait for a global consensus on the taxation of the digital economy to be reached by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). For these reasons, ATR fully supports Section 301 investigations into DSTs from Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom and a finding that the DSTs warrant a Section 301 action.</p><p>To fully illustrate why we believe this is the case, we have organized these comments to cover six main points:</p><p>1. Digital Services Taxes violate long-held principles of international tax policy and rules.</p><p>2. The Digital Services Taxes from the European Union, Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, and Spain exclusively target American companies and violate EU law.</p><p>3. The European Union could not reach agreement on a DST and is still waiting for the OECD to reach an agreement.</p><p>4. Digital Services Taxes will harm innovation and growth.</p><p>5. Consequences of a tax and trade war</p><p>6. The effects of DSTs will be mostly borne by consumers and small businesses, not big technology companies and will lead to less innovation and competition in the marketplace.</p><p>Digital Services Taxes violate long-held principles of international tax policy and rules.</p><p>The very premises on which the DSTs is founded are flawed. Under current international tax rules and treaties, a company is only subject to corporate tax on its profits in countries where it has a physical presence./1</p><p>This nexus requirement precludes issues that can arise from countries having unlimited taxing rights to companies that may operate within their borders but have no presence there. All nine investigated countries are Inclusive Framework BEPS members, of which these rules are a part. These rules were seemingly adopted to avoid the very issue brought by DSTs - a country who seeks to tax a company that has no physical presence within its borders.</p><p>While being in direct conflict with the current rules on profit allocation and nexus requirements, the DSTs also abandon the long-held standard of taxing profits by taxing revenues of the targeted technology companies. This violates the principle that companies should only be taxed on their actual gains from doing business, and leaves open the possibility to being taxed on a loss.</p><p>A quick example illustrates this problem. A company that spends $100 and earns $90 is operating at a loss. At a 10% tax on its profits, the normal target of corporate taxation, the company would not be subject to tax. However, if the 10% tax is on the revenues, the $90 in earnings, the tax would be $9 on a company that is already losing money. This is a clear disincentive to new businesses that want to enter the marketplace but may require a few years to earn a profit.</p><p>The Digital Services Taxes from the European Union, Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, and Spain exclusively target American companies and violate EU law.</p><p>Digital Services Taxes do not explicitly target American companies by name or nationality, but they accomplish this goal through their revenue thresholds and design. By only taxing the revenues of companies that earn more than a artificially high amount annually, the laws often exempt domestic companies and effectively target large American technology companies. Through its effects, the revenue thresholds serve as a proxy for nationality - rendering the DST definitively targeted toward, and thus discriminating against, American companies.</p><p>The discriminatory aspects of DSTs also put it in conflict with European Union law. Under Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, a member state may not grant state aid or use state resources to distort competition in the EU marketplace./2</p><p>The revenue thresholds in the European DSTs do not subject those companies to the DST, while raising the tax burden of their competitors. This meets the definition of state aid, and European technology associations have begun proceedings to appeal the law to the European Commission./3</p><p>Not only are DSTs discriminatory toward American companies in the respect that it only targets them with this tax, it also handicaps them versus their competitors in the European Union. They are discriminatory on two fronts at the same time.</p><p>Even if one were to assume that the reasoning of those countries for a DST were valid, that technology companies are not paying their \"fair share\" of tax, the evidence points to the contrary. A report published by the European Centre for International Political Economy found that the effective corporate tax rate for US-based digital companies was significantly higher than non-technology companies based in the European Union./4</p><p>See figure here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=USTR-2020-0022-0330&amp;attachmentNumber=1&amp;contentType=pdf\">https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=USTR-2020-0022-0330&amp;attachmentNumber=1&amp;contentType=pdf</url>)</p><p>The data, as seen in the figure above from the report,/5 does not support the claim that major technology companies are not paying their \"fair share\" of tax. In fact, they are paying higher rates than their European counterparts. The DST proposals seemingly are more about targeting American companies than it is receiving their \"fair share\" of tax revenue.</p><p>The European Union could not reach agreement on a DST and is still waiting for the OECD to reach an agreement.</p><p>The Austrian, Czech Republic, Italian, and Spanish DSTs are similar to the original proposal by the European Union (EU) to establish a DST across each of its member states./6</p><p>The EU proposal called for a 3% tax on the revenues of technology companies that generated more than 750 million Euros in global revenue.</p><p>However, it is very important to remember, that the EU abandoned its proposal after the Nordic countries and Ireland refused to back any version of a DST, even a watered-down proposal that only sought to target advertising revenues. Romania's Eugen Teodorovici, then President of the European Council, said that \"ministers would now focus on trying to reach a common position for an overhaul of digital taxation at a global level.\"/7</p><p>It is a myth that the United States is standing alone opposing Digital Services Taxes.</p><p>This move by the EU to work toward a global consensus on the issue of taxation of the digital economy highlights the unreasonableness of the European (Austria, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic) DSTs. Named countries are member states of the EU. The failure of the EU to adopt a DST has led to unilateral moves, as opposed to following the EU's example and waiting for a global consensus.</p><p>Digital Services Taxes will harm innovation and growth.</p><p>The profitability and success of technology companies is due in large part to their ability to innovate - to produce products and platforms that are in great demand by citizens around the world. The DSTs would inhibit the innovative environment that has allowed this process to take place, especially during a worldwide pandemic where hundreds of millions of people all over the world rely more and more on innovative technology solutions.</p><p>In a report on the proposed DST by the European Union, economist Matthias Bauer called into question the effects of the DST on investment in the EU./8</p><p>These effects would likely be the same for unilateral DSTs from EU member states like Austria, Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic.</p><p>According to the report, the DSTs would be a pass-on tax whose effects will be much greater than the static effects due to higher prices to consumers. For companies that are dependent on external funding for its operating budget, a revenue tax would require much more capital in order to conduct business. DSTs would likely reduce investment in these companies relative to companies not subject to the DSTs. This decrease in the relative attractiveness of an investment into the companies affected by the DST would result in a lower capacity for innovation in the digital sector, negatively impacting both downstream businesses and consumers.</p><p>Consequences of a tax and trade war caused by discriminatory Digital Services Taxes</p><p>ATR applauds the Administration's efforts to oppose France's Digital Services tax and USTR's commitment to address France's discriminatory and unjustifiable DST facing U.S. companies.</p><p>The implementation of the discriminatory and unfounded tax certainly hinders the Administration's and EU's commitment to achieve zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies in transatlantic trade./9</p><p>The Administration should use all appropriate measures to impose penalties on countries that implementing unfair tax and trade policies, such as DSTs. At the same time, the Administration should strongly consider if imposing tariffs, which harm American businesses, without a WTO dispute settlement understanding is an appropriate response considering the inevitable retaliatory tariffs.</p><p>Tariffs, such as the proposed additional 25% duties on $1.3 billion of products covering cosmetics, soaps, cleansing products and handbags from France will affect American consumers and businesses who will eventually have the tariff passed on to them.</p><p>For example, in the USTR public hearing held January 7th, 2020 regarding the imposition of tariffs Nate Herman of the American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association (AAFA) testified \"handbags are generally no longer made in the US and that French bags have a cachet, but that American workers will nonetheless be negatively affected if the US tariffs take effect.\" He added, \"this is quite a literally a tax that hits Americans in the pocketbook.\"/10</p><p>Furthermore, rather than honing a response to the digital service sector the USTR's retaliatory tariffs expand the collateral damage of the DST to non-digital services.</p><p>In addition, according to the Statement of Administrative Action in regards to implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement Act, the USTR \"will invoke the dispute settlement procedures of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) for investigations that involve an alleged violation of (or the impairment of U.S. benefits under) WTO Agreements./11</p><p>While the USTR is free to decide if the DST imposed by France violates WTO commitments, many commentators have opined it does.</p><p>For instance, a WTO dispute panel would most likely agree with the U.S. that DSTs violates Article XVII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services by failing to treat American companies no less favorable than domestic service suppliers. A dispute panel report and subsequent appellate board determination in favor of the United States would permit the U.S. to impose the same tariffs, while also guarding against retaliation.</p><p>The USTR must protect American consumers, businesses, and workers be ensuring trade remedies are not more costly than the unfair trade practices they seek to address. The strategy the USTR has chosen: to impose tariffs without a WTO DSU, on products outside the digital-service sector, and with the promise of retaliatory tariffs certainly raises the risk that the cure may be worse than the disease.</p><p>The effects of DSTs will be mostly borne by consumers and small businesses, not big technology companies and will lead to less innovation and competition in the marketplace.</p><p>The DSTs will not be mostly borne by large technology companies as the investigated governments intend. According to a report from Deloitte, the increased tax burden will be borne by consumers and the small businesses that utilize the digital marketplace to conduct their operations./12</p><p>The increased tax burden is comprised of an upstream pass-on and a downstream pass-on. When the DST is applied to the revenue of the marketplace, the marketplace will increase the commission it charges merchants in order to compensate for the tax. Some merchants may leave the marketplace altogether due to the higher tax burden they will face.</p><p>For those that do not leave, they will pass on this tax burden downstream to consumers through higher prices to compensate for the higher commission rates.</p><p>The Deloitte report finds that 57% of the increased tax burden will be borne by consumers, 39% by merchants and advertisers that use the marketplace, and only 4% of the increased burden will be borne by the large technology companies. The facts are clear: American consumers and American small businesses that rely on the large technology companies will bear the burden of the Digital Services Taxes around the world.</p><p>For these reasons ATR fully supports Section 301 investigations into the DSTs of Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom and a finding that it is unreasonable tax policy, discriminatory towards American technology companies, and will harm both American consumers, small businesses and innovation that is desperately needed. Americans for Tax Reform urges another strong response from the U.S. Trade Representative that deters even more countries from implementing such policies, and instead refocuses the world's efforts toward a global consensus on already existing international tax rules and agreements.</p><p>* * *</p><p>References:</p><p>Article 7 - Permanent Establishment Status, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/beps-actions/action7/\">https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/beps-actions/action7/</url></p><p>Bauer, M.

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thanksgiving to thanks getting. Americans prepared to spend on Black Friday deals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Black Friday to block Friday. Some French activists saying enough is enough.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Buffett rebuffed. Losing a bid for Tech Data, the oracle didn't see that one coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Friday. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. It's Fri-yay. It also happens to be Black Friday here in the United States, a shopaholics' paradise. Plenty of extra time today to shop, too because the stock and bond markets here close early at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Right now, as you can see, futures are a little bit softer. Investors that weren't eating turkey yesterday spent the session waiting, of course for a response from China, after President Trump signed legislation expressing support for Hong Kong's protesters. Nothing, of course, was forthcoming. And so we wait on and ask what this means as well for the trade negotiations.</p><p>That wait, I think not helping sentiment here in Asia markets, there a sea of red as you can see. Healthcare stocks, in fact, in Hong Kong tumbled when a document circulated on social media suggesting Beijing could add dozens of new drugs to another round of procurement that would of course force drug prices lower.</p><p>So that's having an impact there, but there's other news as well. A wall of worry to climb. In South Korea, let's start there. The Central Bank kept rates unchanged, but they did cut their growth forecast for 2019 and 2020.</p><p>A similar story in India. We saw growth there for the third quarter falling to some four and a half percent. That's down just to give you a comparison from seven percent for the same quarter of last year. What about jumping to Japan now? The Bank of Japan governor promising to continue with powerful stimulus, while also paying close attention to economic risks, especially those stemming from overseas, read, yes, the U.S.-China trade war.</p><p>More evidence of strife if we look at Germany as well and the German auto sector in particular. Daimler, announcing thousands of job cuts this morning. More on that shortly. Now, amid all the warnings, the tantrums and the tariffs of course, too. Perhaps it's time to bring it back here to the United States and hope for some retail therapy this Friday. At least that's what I call it.</p><p>Let's get into the drivers. Alison Kosik is at a Best Buy in northern New Jersey. Best Buy of course raising their forecast going into this season so confidence there, but Alison tell us what we can expect and what you're seeing already this morning.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The doors here, Julia had been opened about an hour and a healthy stream of customers has been coming in. TV seems to be a go-to for many of the shoppers and you know, the stream of customers really proves that Black Friday is still alive and well.</p><p>But it's also become one of the five days of a sort of a shopping event because all the shopping began late yesterday. Yes, Thanksgiving Day here in the United States all the way through Monday. That's Cyber Monday.</p><p>So during this long weekend here in the United States, 165 million people are expected to go out there and spend their money and you know what? They've been spending their money even since October.</p><p>More than half of consumers actually started buying holiday gifts that early because unemployment is low and people are feeling more confident and kind of safe in their jobs and happy about their paychecks.</p><p>So the National Retail Federation is expecting that this holiday season will be a strong one, one that could bring it as much as $730 billion.</p><p>Now, the National Retail Federation also says, it does not expect tariffs to impact the way that shoppers get out there and spend their money. Those 79 percent, Julia, 79 percent of those surveyed -- shoppers I'm talking about -- they are concerned that the tariffs could mean higher prices when they get out here and shop for those holiday gifts -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you make such a good point. And we've talked about it in the show before, this idea that actually retailers bought their inventory ahead, ahead of the prospective tariff increases.</p><p>So for this season, we're fine. The question comes, of course, is if we see those tariffs rise in December 15th to be specific what that means for next year, but of course, for now, it seems consumer confidence is all and consumers continue to be pretty confident, quite frankly.</p><p>KOSIK: Yes, and you make a good point. Best Buy is the perfect example. This is an electronic store here in the United States. It took actual steps to mitigate the impacts of those tariffs.</p><p>[09:05:08]</p><p>KOSIK: It talked with its vendors, tried to negotiate cheaper costs. It is diversifying its supply chain, that's helping as well. And then as you said, you know, companies like Best Buy went ahead and pre-ordered their inventory, you know, to get those products in into Customs before those tariffs hit.</p><p>The thing is not every retailer is going to be planning ahead like that. Small retailers, for instance, they're not able to really absorb the higher costs of tariffs. So you're seeing smaller businesses get hit a lot harder than the bigger retailers like Best Buy -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That is such a great point and we will discuss that later on in the show, the difference between the ability of the big retailers here to mitigate this and particularly relative to some of the smaller. Now, Alison, I happen to know you're a very tiny person, but those TVs next to you are enormous.</p><p>KOSIK: Let's take a wide shot. They are and these are actually really, really cheap. I'm surprised they are not flying out of here just yet.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: They're too heavy to carry. They're too heavy. That's an argument for online purchases. Alison Kosik, great job.</p><p>KOSIK: That's right. We'll wheel them -- we'll wheel them out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Get some help on that. Alison Kosik in New Jersey for us there at Best Buy. Thank you very much for that. All right, let's move on to our next driver. Shares in Tech Data are up some 11 percent, premarket after private equity firm, Apollo sweetened their offer for IT firm after a second suitor stepped in.</p><p>Now there's a report that the mystery bidder was none other than Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Paul La Monica joins us on this story.</p><p>Fascinating if Berkshire was buffeted here and prevented from buying it, but actually Warren Buffett has made no secret of the fact that he thinks private equity have bid up prices here and the premiums are too high and quite frankly, he is not paying for it even if he has got a massive cash pile and can afford it.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, Buffett can clearly afford it, Julia, because Berkshire Hathaway has $128 billion in cash. He has repeatedly, Buffett, has said that he is itching to use some of it for a quote-unquote, \"elephant-sized acquisition.\" But we know that Buffett tends to be frugal. He does not want to overpay and he has bemoaned the fact that you've had valuations go up so dramatically.</p><p>We have a market at all-time highs, and as you point out, private equity firms are more than willing to pay higher premiums for companies and Buffet is not going to play that game.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What actually is this company? Because if we look at this space, in particular, private equity have been pretty interested and we've seen some M&amp;A activity in this space. What does the company actually do and why the excitement here?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, it's a distribution company, provider of software and other tech services to larger companies. It's kind of boring to be brutally honest, Julia but that is what Warren Buffett loves.</p><p>I mean, when he bought big tech companies in the past for his portfolio, IDM used to be the main stalwart, Big Blue, you can't really get much more boring than that.</p><p>Now, his top holding is Apple and critics would say that Apple isn't really an exciting company anymore because they're just churning out one new iPhone after another and really relying on services for much of their revenue.</p><p>So this seems like it could fit the classic Berkshire Hathaway-Warren Buffett mold for an acquisition. Now, he has got to look elsewhere and you know, there's been talk, rumors that he was interested in PG&amp;E, the utility in California a couple of months ago, but that talk died down.</p><p>There's been chatter because he owns big stakes in several airlines that he could make a run for Southwest or another airline that Berkshire Hathaway has stock in because that could be a good fit with its Burlington Northern Railroad business. He loves transportation, but I think he wants to do a big deal, but he is not going to rush into one if the price isn't right. He didn't become this rich by overpaying -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I was about to say kind of boring and kind of beaten up as well, which works in the case of PG&amp;E. I mean, this stock, Tech Data trading at record highs. So yes, I think we can probably rule out a sneaky return bid here to it to try and get it in the end. Not paying. Paul La Monica.</p><p>LA MONICA: I don't think so.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you so -- Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, next driver. The car maker, Daimler announcing at least 10,000 job cuts by the end of 2022. It's the third German auto giant this week to announce significant cost cuts.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins us with the details. Anna, let's focus on Daimler first. We know investing in technologies, cars of the future costs money. You have to strip back those costs somewhere and these look pretty steep.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: This is the biggest announcement we've had certainly of late from these big German carmakers.</p><p>They said a figure in the low five figures. So we're looking at least 10,000 jobs being cut and this is part of a broader restructuring program that Daimler indicated they would do earlier this month. They're planning to reduce staff costs by around one and a half billion dollars. They're planning to reduce management positions by 10 percent.</p><p>And as we said, this is all to do with meeting ever stricter emissions regulations. And that involves not just investing more in electric technology, but also really increasing those car sales numbers.</p><p>[09:10:16]</p><p>STEWART: Electric car sales are abysmal, really in Europe. Add to that all of those big, big headwinds that we talk about all the time, trade wars, softening demand in key markets like China; and Julia, listen to this.</p><p>On Monday, Fitch Ratings says it expects global car sales to drop this year by 3.1 million. That is a sharper fall than 2008.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, they really have to do some retrenchment here and we're starting to really see it, not just Daimler though, we kind of hinted at it already with the likes of BMW, Audi this week, also announcing significant adjustments and cuts here.</p><p>Just give us a sense of those, too and then you can really understand what we're seeing for these German automakers. Huge retrenchments.</p><p>STEWART: Because it's very easy to see all these figures and just not really absorb them all. They are coming thick and fast. Yes, we had Volkswagen's luxury brand, Audi earlier this week, they're reducing their workforce by seven and a half thousand or 10 percent of the overall business by 2025. They plan to free up in the sense, $6.6 billion over 10 years for future investment.</p><p>BMW mentioned there, they also made an announcement not quite as severe in terms of job cuts as such, they are reducing bonus payments for their employees.</p><p>It was interesting actually, because the new CEO said this allows us to avoid drastic measures that others are taking to reduce their costs. And that is actually part of a broader plan to save more than $13 billion.</p><p>Plenty of these have also already announced many job cuts in recent years. So this is just the very last few days. So you can see there's a sense of urgency here to do more, to really try and get more money available for their investment and restructure quickly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it makes sense. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for joining us on that story.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories making headlines around the world.</p><p>Iraq's Prime Minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi says he will submit his resignation to Parliament. Deadly protests have flared up repeatedly across Iraq for many months. A surge of violence on Thursday this week left at least 41 people dead.</p><p>Let's get straight to Baghdad now where our Arwa Damon joins us on this story. Perhaps no surprise, Arwa, in light of recent protests. And the protesters cheering when this news broke. Talk us through what this means now for the country and what leadership change will represent?</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is both something of a surprise, at least in terms of the protesters here and in terms of the exact timing of it, but not something that was entirely unexpected, given the fact that we did hear this intention announced by the President a while ago, but then nothing from the government which really frustrated those who have been taking to the streets.</p><p>But the minute that announcement actually trickled down to those who are here and we're in Tahrir Square in the capital of Baghdad, which has become something of the epicenter of these ongoing demonstrations.</p><p>People started coming out en mass. People were dancing. There's music blaring over loud speakers. They were shooting small fireworks out into the air. There is an air of jubilation, yes, but at the same time, it's worth noting that people are still quite somber when it comes to all of this, because they paid such a heavy price just to get to this moment.</p><p>Since October, more than 380 people have been killed. And you do quite often see many of the faces of those who perished throughout the course of these demonstrations, placards with their photographs on them being carried through and 17,700 at least, people injured across the entire country.</p><p>Yesterday was an especially deadly day in the southern part of the country in Iraq's Shia heartland. The minute that announcement did come out, though, people were yes, celebrating, but they were also saying, look, this is just the beginning. We want an entire overhaul of our system of governments. We want changes to the Constitution. We want an end to this rampant corruption, these sectarian politics.</p><p>And people are also saying something that is, frankly, not necessarily something that everyone would have expected to hear in Iraq, but that is that they want an end to Iranian influence.</p><p>And this is something that we really only heard being publicly said during these demonstrations, but it's really an indication of how fed up the population is with the status quo.</p><p>Most of these demonstrators are the country's youth. They are unemployed but they want to see a better Iraq. They tell us over and over again that that the Iraq that their parents grew under, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, an Iraq of oppression -- that is not one that they will accept and they're determined to do everything that they can to change it.</p><p>[09:15:08]</p><p>DAMON: So yes, right now we do have celebrations to a certain degree at this development, but people are very cautious and this does not mean the end they said to their demonstrations. In fact, they say it is only the beginning of their demands.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and the question is, does it change things to your point, whether it's corruption or mass unemployment or the failure of public services, does anything really change?</p><p>Arwa, thank you so much for bringing that story to us there. Arwa Damon joining us from Baghdad.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump is back in the United States after a surprise visit to Afghanistan. In his first trip there since taking office, he told us troops the Taliban wants to make a peace deal.</p><p>The Taliban has responded agreeing to resume talks if that's what America wants. That, according to statement from the militant group spokesman.</p><p>Hong Kong's Polytechnic University says hopes teaching can restart as early as next semester. After police searched the campus which had been used as a stronghold by protesters, officers say they found nearly 4,000 Molotov cocktails on the site, along with other weapons.</p><p>Police say they've arrested almost 5,900 people this year in relation to those pro-democracy protests.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a break here on FIRST MOVE. But coming up, Thailand taking digital payments seriously. We'll hear how traditional banks are changing.</p><p>And lining up for a Black Friday bargain. The shoppers who sacrifice Thanksgiving to wait out in the cold. It's the retailers who will be rubbing their hands with glee. Stay with us. We're back after this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. A quick look at the markets right now. U.S. futures are a touch lower heading into the final session of this week. The NASDAQ as you can see underperforming there, but I should point out liquidity amid trading conditions and volumes are going to be light today with the Thanksgiving weekend holiday.</p><p>[09:20:15]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just one thing to watch, though, cast your eyes over Latin America and specifically what we're seeing in some of these costs rates. The Chilean peso versus the dollar, under pressure continuing yesterday and the Colombian peso hitting an all-time low, too.</p><p>The Brazilian real are managing to eke out gains but only remaining a shade above its own record low. Political turmoil in the region continues following an ongoing anti-government demonstrations. So record lows for a number of those currencies there.</p><p>All right, let's head out to Asia now and it may be the largest commercial bank in Thailand, but Siam Commercial has long recognized the disruptive threat from digital competitors, but also the opportunity that digitization represents.</p><p>So over the past three years SCB has spent a billion dollars on modernization. Now, I caught up with their President during a FinTech Festival in Singapore and I asked him about the banking environment today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ORAPONG THIEN-NGERN, PRESIDENT, SIAM COMMERCIAL BANK: If you look at the banking industry today, we are in the a challenging cycle. We look at return on equity of all the banks in the world going down.</p><p>In Thailand, our bank five years ago, used to have the ROE, return on equity of 22 percent; now we are at 10.2 percent in five years, and we're projecting this five more years if the trade will still be like this, you can see the future of their banks in jeopardy.</p><p>A lot of people believe that banks will still be around but the banks will be around because we are being protected by regulators.</p><p>And if I say that my future exists because I'm being protected. It's not so much of a future. That's a stopping point. We are seeing that clearly. And this last five years, we are entering a challenging time and as we are entering this, this has just started and it's not Thailand, it is the whole banking industry.</p><p>So with that, our initial thought was, in order to be competitive, we need to be innovating. Because the competitors are not just banks, the new commerce, they have more digital, and they don't have foundation -- physical foundation. So their cost is very low.</p><p>So we look at that and said, protecting this five more years, how are we going to compete with a new commerce?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And you cut -- you close branches.</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: Yes, right now we have about 900 branches. But if you look at the kind of changes that is happening in the market. If you compare three years ago, we had our -- own bank had about 2.5 million digital users, and now we have 10 million in three years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What percentage of your transactions now are digitized?</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: Yes. Interesting question. It is 96 percent digitized.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Ninety six percent.</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: Four percent is still branches.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you need to close more branches.</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: Yes. Close more branches or transform the branches to serve other purposes. We -- everyone who has money need to manage their wealth. Wealth, insurance those two high touch business for now. Until innovations come, that will change again.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's quite stark. Traditional banks like SCB are not only facing disruption because of digital competitors as we've been discussing there, they also need to figure out how to respond to the rise of digital currencies and coins and the impact of blockchain technology for example.</p><p>SCB's President says Facebook's future digital plans have the potential to change everything.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: For us, it's a good wake up call. Because the subject of digital currency has been in the media for the longest time, but it was done by startups, small group of people, even though it got, as always speculated.</p><p>But once Facebook and the group of companies that are well known got together and said, we are going to do this, it woke everyone up.</p><p>Personally, I don't think it will happen --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: At all?</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: At all. Not in this current form, because you look at the people who are caught up in --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The regulators.</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: They started to go against it, but it helped in the sense that now, it is surfacing all the issues that need to be addressed. And that will open the road up for the next generation of digital currency.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What about the electronic payment system? Is all the power concentrated here in the wallet? And whatever it is that's facilitating the transfer of value or wealth. IS the power in whoever owns the wallet?</p><p>[09:25:20]</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: This is highly debatable. If you look in the low, bankable population --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The unbanked.</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: The unbanked, right, wallets are stronger than banks. But in our country, I look at data of 2016, ninety seven point five percent of bankable people already have banking services.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: And telcos in our country have been trying to promote wallets for the longest time. And luckily, so far they have not been successful because wallet is no different than accounts. If you can make payment, you can make money transfer in three clicks, from a consumer point of view, I don't care is it a wallet or is it an account.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Now despite the uncertainty and the many challenges traditional banks are facing, the SCB President said he is optimistic about the future. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's end on a positive note. It's challenging. It's an exciting time for technology and for advancements. Are you going to be around in another hundred years?</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: That's the intent.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's the plan.</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: We have been around for 114 years and we are very alert. Even though right now we are the largest bank in Thailand, there was not a single day that we enjoy this success. We see the trip. We see the trend. We see how fast new technologies have been adopted.</p><p>We feel very uncomfortable, but that's also positive sign.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: It gives us energy. I wake up every day thinking about this try to experiment something about this, trying to find solutions, and that's what makes top five.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: My first boss at Morgan Stanley said to me, the moment you feel comfortable, panic. I think that's good advice.</p><p>THIEN-NGERN: That's very good advice. Thank you very much.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right. Some breaking news now coming into us at CNN. The Metropolitan Police say they are dealing with an incident at London Bridge. Details are pretty unclear at the moment.</p><p>Anna Stewart is in London for us on this story. Anna, what can you tell us? What more do we know?</p><p>STEWART: Well, we've had a flurry of tweets regarding the situation as you said. We just had a tweet from the London Met Police to say that they're in the early stages of dealing with an incident.</p><p>Of course they've been plenty of reports on Twitter, the City of London Police have just told us that it is a very dynamic situation. And I think, Julia, we have to remember with a situation like this, that there is so much interest and alarm simply because in 2017, there was of course, the terrorist vehicle ramming and stabbing incidents that really shocked the whole capital of the nation, in fact, the whole world.</p><p>So we'll be bringing you more details as we get them. Very thin on the ground right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. Yes. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for that update there, and just as Anna said, we will keep you posted as more information comes through. We're back after this.</p><p>[09:31:34]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. Let me just bring you up to speed with the breaking news just in the last few moments.</p><p>The U.K. Metropolitan Police say they're dealing with an incident at London Bridge. Details remain unclear at this moment.</p><p>The police are advising people nearby to follow police directions. We will bring you more when we get it. But right now I'm just showing you some images that we're taking from Twitter, from social media, just to give you a sense of what we're seeing there.</p><p>That's just the corner of London Bridge going from north to south that you can see there is the camera pans across. We could clearly hear sirens of the emergency services there.</p><p>It does look like traffic seems to be still flowing at least on one side going across the bridge that you can see there and of course, a number of buses seem to be at a standstill as well.</p><p>Just to reiterate that, of course, the Met Police tweet there as well. The early stages of dealing with an incident at London Bridge. We will bring you any further information there as we get it.</p><p>All right. So let me give you a look at what we're seeing right now for U.S. markets. We have opened lower as anticipated, easing back from those record highs of course that hit when the markets were last open on Wednesday. All majors though in the red.</p><p>The trading day today will be shortened, too for the Thanksgiving Holiday, 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, both the bond markets and the equity markets closing today.</p><p>Let me give you a look for now at some of our Global Movers. Stocks that are moving most in the session. We've talked about them already, Tech Data stock climbing after the private equity firm Apollo improved its offer. It was reported that a second suitor stepped in and that was apparently Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.</p><p>Right now, the stock is that higher by just shy of 12 percent. Apollo paid more perhaps, than they might have done in light of that entry from alleged Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway there.</p><p>What about at Wynn Resorts? We are seeing that down some one percent. The story there, just to bring you up to speed on that is that Wynn Resorts has reached a settlement with Steve Wynn. He stepped down after its sexual assault allegations which he denied, of course.</p><p>All right, as holiday shopping season ramps up here in the United States. It's highlighting a Black Friday divide between retailers who have seen the light and reinvented themselves and those left perhaps fumbling around in the dark.</p><p>On the one hand, you've got the likes of Target, Costco and Best Buy who've ramped up their online offerings, offering deliveries and in-store pickups. Then at the other end of the scale, you've got names like Gap, L Brands, which owns Victoria's Secrets, of course and Macy's lagging behind and moving with the times.</p><p>To explain the divide, Charlie O'Shea is the Vice President at Moody's and a senior credit officer. Charlie, fantastic to have you with us and I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving yesterday.</p><p>Let's start with Best Buy because we were actually in store earlier on in the show. I feel like this is a company that's gone in to the Thanksgiving and this holiday shopping weekend with high confidence. They even raised their forecasts ahead of time. These guys are like one of the winners.</p><p>CHARLIE O'SHEA, VICE PRESIDENT, MOODY'S: Absolutely. And Best Buy has been winning holiday for a long time now, but I think this year, the company is better positioned.</p><p>Some of the things that Best Buy is doing now are resonating more heavily with the consumers than they have in the past.</p><p>[09:35:02]</p><p>O'SHEA: I was in the store last night. A lot of the tech features, not TVs. I mean, TVs are always going to sell. But a lot of the things that the company is selling now are more solutions focused, which brings into play the consultative sales force that Best Buy has and the ability to come to your home with a Geek Squad and actually install things, which creates a deeper relationship with the customer.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, that's such a great point actually, the targeting of customers with specific products and actually that touchiness is one of the benefits of having bricks and mortar stores to that point.</p><p>Do we see the likes of a Walmart, of Best Buy, of Amazon -- some of the strongest players competing against each other for market share? Or particularly given the broader backdrop here, the impact of tariffs, do we see them stealing market share from some of the more restricted and smaller players here?</p><p>O'SHEA: I think what we've been seeing is the latter rather than the former. Certainly, there's some head-to-head battles going on, but it's much easier to pick off a weaker competitor than it is to go head-to-head.</p><p>Say you're Walmart, going head-to-head with Amazon is tough, and the reverse is also true. But Amazon has an advantage with those shareholders that really don't seem to mind the lack of profitability as long as sales grow.</p><p>So if you're a Walmart, you can go after some of the smaller guys pretty easily, and they don't really have a lot of defenses. They've been struggling over the last several years without the financial flexibility to be able to invest in the stores, invest online, and invest in employees.</p><p>And then most importantly, this time of year, invest in price, which is promotion. And a lot of them just don't have the ability to do it.</p><p>You've got to keep the lights on. They've got to meet their debt maturities, and there's something that has to give. Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Best Buy, Target -- don't have to worry about that because they've got loads of money. They've been able to invest and they have a distinct competitive advantage this holiday and beyond.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What about the delivery options that are available here? I mean, we even, I go back to Best Buy offering next day delivery. You can also pick up in store and they're saying that actually you don't even have to be the equivalent of a Prime member and pay some monthly premium in order to have that option. That's really taking the fight to Amazon despite their investment in all these fleet bands.</p><p>O'SHEA: That's true. Best Buy has been offering -- and I've been trying to remember and I was talking to my family about it yesterday, when we actually picked up our first online order in a store, and we were 15 years ago, and we were struggling whether it was really that long ago, maybe it was, but it's been a while.</p><p>And that's one of the advantages brick and mortar has always had and now they've really unlocked it, which is using those stores.</p><p>My estimate is for the big companies that I cover, between 40 and 50 percent of the online orders are going to be picked up in a store, which gives you another opportunity to make an attachment sale which is important.</p><p>Delivery is easy. Free delivery is easy to do. All you have to do is be willing, if you're a retailer to bear the cost and your shareholders again have to be patient.</p><p>But the other things come into play. Amazon is doing everything it possibly can to speed up delivery. We think it's a reaction to buy online and pick up in store. So Amazon is almost being forced to accelerate its two-day to one-day, and then in some cases, same day, it's going to cost the company about $4 billion plus this year. It'll cost more money next year.</p><p>And the whole key to this is to keep those Prime members happy because they spend a lot more money. But delivery for us has been -- we consider it to be an arms race. And we really don't know yet if and when it becomes you know, the retailers have to charge for it. How much the consumer is willing to pay for fast delivery? Do I need it today? Do I need it tomorrow? Do I need it the next day? Do I need it the next day? And the pricing will likely be tiered at that point.</p><p>And then the consumer really has a decision to make, and maybe the retailers are overestimating the demand in which case they will overspend.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such an interesting point and I guess, the proof will be in the pudding. We just have to wait and see how this plays out.</p><p>Talk to me about the shopping season specifically because we're already starting to get numbers for what happened either in store or online for the Thanksgiving spend and it looks pretty strong here, but I guess the comparisons to last year was a December where we had a government shutdown. We had a market pressure -- all sorts of things going on. What are we expecting this weekend?</p><p>O'SHEA: For the whole holiday, the weekend is tough. We look at the holiday as lasting the entire quarter, which runs from November to late January. The season gets elongated every year. The promotion started earlier this year. They started in October before. I was seeing Christmas before Halloween, which is kind of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>But I think it gets longer. I think we have to kind of pull back from the traditional gauges that we're using to evaluate the holiday. You know, the Thanksgiving weekend is now the Thanksgiving weekend. It used to be Black Friday and Cyber Monday now. It's Thanksgiving weekend.</p><p>[09:20:02]</p><p>O'SHEA: And it's going to be a long -- it's going to be a long battle. It's a marathon, not a sprint. And I think that the early data is encouraging from a sales perspective.</p><p>We forecasted four to four and a half percent top line growth this holiday. But we're operating income focused. So we want to see how much money you actually make on those sales.</p><p>If you're selling the dollar for 99 cents, that's not necessarily a good thing. So it'll -- we're always late to make a call because we have to wait for the income data. But some of the data points I've seen so far, again, have been encouraging. Twenty percent online sales growth. Anything less than 15 for online sales has to be disappointing.</p><p>You start getting around 20, that means it's a very positive push. I saw another data point this morning that store visits are down a little bit. I don't know that that's unexpected. I think the retailers have finally gotten the religion that we don't care where we make the sale, be it online or in the store. We just want to make the sale and if you want to buy stuff from us sitting on your couch, or even taking a break from dinner on Thanksgiving. That's just fine with us. We just want to make the sale.</p><p>So I think we just have to -- you know, the paradigm has shifted. And I think our analyses have to kind of move along with that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, our metrics have to move. Charlie O'Shea, Vice President at Moody's. Sir, thank you so much and have a great day.</p><p>O'SHEA: Thanks, Julia. Thanks. You, too.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right. I want to bring you back now to the breaking news that we've been talking to you about just in the last few minutes.</p><p>The U.K. Metropolitan Police say they're dealing with an incident at London Bridge. As we've been discussing with you details remain pretty unclear at this moment. But we do have some further information. Anna Stewart is in London. Anna, what more are we hearing now?</p><p>STEWART: Well, an eyewitness has told CNN that they heard five gunshots in the area. That's all we know from them. The City of London Police have told CNN that it is a very dynamic situation.</p><p>And then of course we have that response from the London Met Police. They tweeted a short while ago saying, \"We are in the early stages of dealing with an incident at London Bridge. Please follow @metpoliceuk on Twitter for updates. If you are near the scene, please follow the directions of any officers on the ground.\"</p><p>We can bring you some videos of the scene from social media. You can see a heavy police presence there. Frankly, the bridge looks to be on lockdown. So much interest and so much concern here, although we know nothing about this incident.</p><p>Of course this was the scene of a dreadful terror attack in June 2017 when a vehicle rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge before attackers left the vehicle and went on a stabbing spree. That terror attack ended with eight people being killed and 48 injured. So a huge concern here.</p><p>We don't have any further details. It is a very dynamic situation. So I expect we will get lots more information in the next few minutes to the next hour, and we will bring that to you as we get it -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, thanks very much. And I just want to say to let our viewers know exactly what they're looking at here. You're looking at London Bridge. On the left of your screen that's North London. And then of course, across the Bridge, towards South London.</p><p>It's an incredibly busy time of day. It's a Friday. So ordinarily you would be seeing traffic cars, buses, as you can see there that seem to be at a standstill passing across this bridge at this time of day.</p><p>And actually, you can see the bridge behind where the traffic actually was flowing, but to Anna's point there, right now whatever is going on, it has brought traffic to an absolute standstill at this stage.</p><p>And Anna, you were just saying to us, an eyewitness suggesting that they'd heard noise that sounds like gunfire and obviously, that's now given the sensitivity of the situation.</p><p>The police are clearly investigating and they've got the thing on lockdown, it seems as far as traffic is concerned until we know more.</p><p>STEWART: That is certainly the situation at the moment. We expect to hear more from eyewitnesses. There's plenty on social media. Of course we're waiting for more official statements from the police as to what happens next, how long the police presence will be there and what's happened and whether we see any arrests coming up. But we should be getting more detail shortly -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And Anna, to your point, there's a real sensitivity in London, just given what we've seen in recent events. The initial response, I think, for everybody is to, when you hear a noise like this, is to flee to try and get out of the area. And instantly, we start looking to social media here.</p><p>As you were saying earlier on the show, in London, as in other places around the world, there's a real sensitivity right now, when you hear noises like this.</p><p>STEWART: There really -- there really is and we take every instance of this incredibly seriously just in case it turns out to be one of these dreadful attacks we have seen in the past and it's too easy of course to jump to conclusions. You do have to wait for the information to come in.</p><p>But as a Londoner myself, you do worry about situations like this. If you hear a bang, you know of course you are going to be extra nervous and you are going to go seek safety, which you should. Follow the police's advice.</p><p>And it is often very useful to go into social media and see what people are saying, but at the same time, making sure that we wait for official statements before jumping to any conclusions.</p><p>[09:45:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. And I'm just again going to reiterate what we're looking at here again, London Bridge, brought to a standstill. On the left of your screen is North London across then to the South of London. One has to presume as well, if we've not seen as yet passengers getting off these buses, it is a busy time of year.</p><p>You have to assume that there are passengers remaining on some of these buses as the traffic has come to a halt and are just waiting to see what happens.</p><p>So just a developing story in the last few minutes, the shopping area, and the railway stations apparently as well as you can see on your screen there have been brought to a halt, too, so taking all precautions it seems and we've heard from the Metropolitan Police as they deal with this situation.</p><p>Thank you very much, Anna Stewart there. We will continue to bring you further details on this story and keep you abreast on the information as we get it. For now, you're watching FIRST MOVE. We'll be right back.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. Again, an update on the breaking news this morning.</p><p>The U.K. Metropolitan Police say they're dealing with an incident at London Bridge. Anna Stewart is on the story for us in London. Anna, and I think a further piece of information now from the Metropolitan Police. What do we know?</p><p>STEWART: We've just had an update from the Met Police who tweeted to say, \"Police were called at 1:58 p.m. to stabbing at premises near to London Bridge. Emergency services attended including officers from the Met Police. A man has been detained by police. We believe a number of people have been injured and further info will follow.\"</p><p>We know that London ambulances have responded. We also have an eyewitness report telling CNN that they heard five gunshots.</p><p>[09:50:00]</p><p>STEWART: Of course, we don't know whether that's true. We don't know whether that was in response to this attack, but we are getting more information.</p><p>It appears to be a stabbing incident according to the police, and of course, this will worry people, particularly given that this was the scene of the most dreadful terror attack in 2017, a vehicle ramming into pedestrians and a stabbing spree.</p><p>So people will be questioning of course, whether there's any terrorist incident related here. We'll be waiting to hear a lot more information about that, that normally takes a lot longer of course to decide to determine, but we'll also be looking at to see how many people have been injured.</p><p>Ambulances are on standby and you're looking at pictures there, live pictures or pictures from earlier of London Bridge at a standstill.</p><p>You can see there's buses are kind of parked there. No idea why the people are stuck on those buses. The police have got that area on lockdown.</p><p>We're also seeing plenty of videos coming through to social media showing a very heavy police presence. But there's been a lot of confusion. A lot of people taking social media saying what they think they heard, but of course no one really knowing. We're waiting for more official response, but the latest from the Met Police is that there was a stabbing incident and one man has been detained -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Anna, stay right where you are. Thank you for that update because I do want to bring in Noa Bodner, an eyewitness. Noa, fantastic to have you with us. Thank you so much for joining us. What can you tell us? What did you see and hear?</p><p>NOA BODNER, WITNESS TO LONDON BRIDGE INCIDENT (via phone): I saw very little. There was a rush of people running into the cafe. We were at the cafe at the base of the bridge. People rushed in immediately.</p><p>The manager ran and shut the door and locked it. Everybody, basically dove under the tables and we were told that shots were heard.</p><p>And then at some point, where we saw police coming to the bridge and closing it off. We were asked to move to the back of the restaurant, or be just away from the windows.</p><p>And everybody has been here ever since trying to piece together all the information that we're getting from what we're seeing, which to honest is not a lot.</p><p>Just basically, nobody is allowed to come through on the -- on all the main roads and the station here. We've heard that there's been a stabbing. We've heard that it's possibly that it was police that shot.</p><p>And now everybody is here just waiting to hear if it is okay to come out again, which you've not heard yet. But hopefully, that will happen soon. People are quite calm and just trying to support each other, I think.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, but, right now you are -- you're locked in. The owner of the cafe locked you in and you're just remaining there.</p><p>BODNER: Yes, we are. We are not allowed to go out. Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think people are more frightened? Do you think people are more frightened just when we see these kind of events now, in light of what we've seen in London, over the -- over the past several months?</p><p>So to your point, actually, do people just act quite calmly in this situation and just get back to the -- you know, the back to the cafe and just wait it out?</p><p>BODNER: Well, you know, the, the main motto here is keep calm and carry on. And I think that's at least what I'm seeing and people don't seem to be panicky.</p><p>I think everybody knows that because this is a sort of gun free country that that the level of danger is always a bit lower. And police are very good at dealing with these sorts of situations as we sadly have seen in the past couple of years.</p><p>So we all believe they've got this under control and we're just waiting for the okay. And yes, nobody is being very brave in trying to step outside. Everybody is just compliant with what we've been told to do and carrying on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're showing images now just to make our viewer aware of fire engines moving on to the site, a police cordon as well and a number 17 double decker bus as you can see. Can you -- can you hear -- actually, Noa, I'm going to leave where we are. Noa Bodner there. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm going to hand over to my colleagues in the United States for more on this.</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN EUROPE EDITOR (via phone): ... about a quarter of a mile down the road along side the River Thames and many of them totally unaware of what is happening nearby London Bridge -- Anna.</p><p>ANA CABRERA, CNN ANCHOR: And Nina, I know you are still working your way there, but it sounds like you're fairly close. You say you're still seeing ambulances heading to the scene?</p><p>DOS SANTOS: Well, I've seen one ambulance and a motorcade of about three or four police outriders as well heading towards the scene and obviously traffic was stopped for them to pass.</p><p>But otherwise, apart from the sort of furtive back and forth of some of the emergency vehicles, it is a calm scene just about a quarter of a mile away.</p><p>But obviously, as I was pointing out, before the fact that the busy subway station, London Bridge is a really busy station, it's also a busy train station as well for the overland train network as well. And it's a big tourist hot spot as Max was just telling you there.</p><p>[09:55:02]</p><p>DOS SANTOS: There's a big market there. It often is busy, at a festive time like this with the Christmas season getting under way. And for all those reasons, this is a busy part of London and it's a part of London that is a thoroughfare as well.</p><p>So the fact that the train station, the subway station is shut off at the moment as head into a Friday and a weekend, obviously that is significant in itself. So as I get closer to the scene, of course I'll try to keep you updated.</p><p>But it's what I'm seeing over there but as I was saying before, as Max also said, we're starting to see already on social media a lot of the kind of pattern that you do see when in the past you have seen some of these things become eventually bigger.</p><p>The Metropolitan Police putting out a statement about 45 minutes or so ago saying that they were in the early stages of dealing with an incident, but we just don't know at this point what the motivation of that type of incident is.</p><p>CABRERA: Right.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: And as Max was also saying, there are many videos that appear to have been taken by some of these commuters going back and forth on buses on London Bridge having witnessed what actually happened firsthand.</p><p>CABRERA: Right. Okay, Nina dos Santos, we'll let you get back to gathering more information. Thank you for that update.</p><p>I have another update for our viewers. London Ambulance Service now tweeting out some more information saying they are responding to a major incident over London Bridge and have a number of crews at the scene there.</p><p>And also we know there was a stabbing according to the Met Police and multiple people injured. Still unclear exactly how many people were involved, at least one person, we're told, has been detained.</p><p>We're going to stay on top of this breaking news. A quick break. We'll be back with the very latest. You're watching CNN. Stay right there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019112901cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMH-S0P1-JB20-G1S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8048\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 29, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000DAH9</classCode><className>BANK OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy, Stock Market, Black Friday, Technology, Warren Buffet, Automobile Industry, Daimler, Labor and Employment, London Bridge, Violence, Police</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Bank Creations &amp;

According to 'American Views: Trust, Media and Democracy[1],' a new report from Gallup and the Knight Foundation, while Americans have access to more news sources than ever, they say that expansion has made it harder, not easier, to stay informed. </p><p>And while people continue to give low marks to traditional news media sources when it comes to objectivity and trust, they're also souring on the big tech platforms too. Here are a few notable findings: \u2014 Americans think the media has an important job, but don't think that current institutions are doing it well. While the vast majority (84 percent) of Americans say that the media has an important role to pay in democracy, just 33 percent have a 'very favorable' or 'somewhat favorable' opinion of the news media. Americans with favorable views towards the news media were also more likely to agree with the idea that more information makes it easier to stay informed, as opposed to harder. Still, 58 percent of Americans said that the proliferation of news sources makes it harder to stay informed. Just half say that there are enough news sources to help them cut through bias, down from 66 percent a generation ago. \u2014 Unsurprisingly, political polarization is behind a lot of the divergence in Americans views on news media. While 54 percent of Democrats hold a favorable view of the news media, only 15 percent of Republicans do. Compared to Democrats, Republicans were also significantly more likely to identify reporting bias, sensationalism, and ideology as major problem with news media today.\u2014 Americans on the whole see greater bias in the news than they did in the past. Forty-five percent agreed that there is 'a great deal' of political bias in news coverage, which is a significant increase from 1989, where only 25 percent said the same. In a similar vein, less than half of Americans said they could name an objective news source.While there was no strong partisan divide on this question, of the Republicans who could name an objective source, 60 percent named Fox News. (Democrats were much less uniform, with CNN and NPR leading the way.)\u2014 Americans have an overall negative view of the role that Facebook and Twitter have had on the news environment. Just 42 percent said that the social media platforms have had a positive impact on the news media environment over the past 10 years. Americans are particularly concerned about the platform's filter bubble problem: 57 percent of Americans said that algorithmic story selection represents 'a major problem' for U.S. democracy. Americans are, however, very much split on what to do about the problem: 49 percent say that there should be rules or regulations that govern the methods platforms use to provide users with news content, while 47 percent say there should not.

It was completed as part of the Knight Foundation's Trust, Media and Democracy initiative.</p><p> Things get interesting when the study's authors dig into the role social media and tech companies are playing in the public's perception of the news. The study looked at how people use and feel about social media, and how people think social media should function as part of the news ecosystem.</p><p> The picture their findings paint is one of conflicted ambivalence. But there's finally one thing Americans agree on: everyone's got to do better.</p><p> The echo chamber</p><p> Within social sharing sites, the study found that people share news knowing that most people they're sharing a piece of news with will agree with it. People are aware that social media can and does further entrench partisan beliefs; however, they do see that as a problem: 57 percent of people say associating only with people who hold similar beliefs to yours is a \"major problem.\"</p><p> Delete ur account</p><p> Americans have an overall negative opinion of how Facebook and other social media sites are affecting the trustworthiness of the news.</p><p> Furthermore, social media use itself has a corrosive effect: the more a demographic engages with social media, the less faith they have in the media as a whole. The largest group that has an unfavorable view of the news media is 18-29 year olds, who, surprise surprise, get their news the most from social feeds.</p><p> Americans also believe that, thanks to technological developments, the proliferation of available news sources  is confusing them more than informing them. That finding skews conservative, but is consistent in terms of age.</p><p> Sam Gill, Knight's vice president for communities and impact, said that this was one of the study's most surprising findings for him.</p><p> \"An implicit core tenet of our democracy is that the more information we have access to, the more likely we are to get to the truth, to make better decisions,\" Gill said. \"At a time when we have as much information as we've ever had, we find it's harder today to be informed than in the past. And I think that's something that should give us pause.\"</p><p> Where do we go from here? America says: \u2013_(\u30c4)_/\u2013</p><p>Facebook, Google, and Twitter have been in political hot water for how Russian hackers were able to manipulate their sites in order to influence the election. And while some members of Congress have expressed strong opinions about the need to regulate social media's role in the news because of these controversies, American citizens aren't so sure.</p><p> Not only are Americans split on whether these companies should or shouldn't be regulated \u2014 49 percent for, 47 percent against \u2014 extreme splits are consistent within the demographics themselves.</p><p> Survey respondents are also unsure about whether institutions or individuals are responsible for media objectivity, trust, and accountability. Half think it's up to us to parse fact from opinion, to ensure \"people have an accurate and politically balanced understanding of the news.\" The other half want to put their faith in news organizations.</p><p> \"People are mixed, or ambivalent, about who should play a role, who's most responsible,\" Busteed said. \"This may be an issue that's so important that we all feel responsibility, or we feel everybody has a responsibility, so that becomes the collective commons issue of, if we all feel responsible, how do we each act individually?\"</p><p> So what?</p><p> Reading through the Gallup/Knight study, the numbers seem to confirm the sorry state of affairs the media is in, that we can feel in our guts, and our newsfeeds.</p><p> But Sam Gill is optimistic.</p><p> \"People recognize the profound role that this technology plays in their lives, but are unclear, again, about what the rules and the norms ought to be,\" Gill said \"That's a fantastic opportunity, hopefully, for a conversation about solutions that can cross sectors, or cross many of the divides that make other issues intractable.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Image: Vicky leta/mashable</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSHNWS-e6636a4232c320a9f37b46883cd591d373ee86</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C251672A101 MSHNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RF2-1911-DXVP-V15B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"971\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Mashable, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Knight Foundation:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid a national debate on content moderation, a new Gallup-Knight Foundation poll finds Americans want some disinformation removed, but don't trust tech companiesor the governmentto police the social platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON (June 16, 2020) As the COVID-19 crisis continues and the debate rages on between Twitter and President Trump over online content moderation, a new report from Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation found that Americans understand the threat of misinformation to public health and democracy, and want misleading information removed from social media.</p><p>However, the public's desire to address the \"infodemic,\" or the excessive amounts of often false or unverified information around the coronavirus, clashes with Americans' overwhelming support for freedom of expression online.</p><p>The major findings in the report, \"Free Expression, Harmful Speech, and Censorship in a Digital World,\" available at kf.org/techpoll, include the following:</p><p>Most people want the internet to be a place for free expression. Nearly two-thirds of Americans (65%) favor allowing people to express their views on social media.</p><p>Most people support the removal of false or misleading health information from social media. Amid the pandemic, 85% of Americans are in favor of this, and 81% support removing intentionally misleading information on elections or other political issues.</p><p>Most Americans don't trust social media companies to police the content on their platforms. Eight in 10 said they don't trust big tech to make the right decisions about what content appears on their sites, and what should be removed. But people, especially conservatives, trust the government even less to make these decisions.</p><p>Most Americans support in principle Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law President Donald Trump and many in Congress are pushing to reform. Almost two-thirds (66%) of Americans say they support keeping the existing law that shields major internet companies from liability.</p><p>Americans favor the creation of independent content oversight boards to govern content policy on social media. Eighty-one percent think independent bodies that set policies on the removal of disputed content are a good idea, as long as they are diverse</p><p>and transparent.</p><p>\"We have a clash of values online,\" said Sam Gill, senior vice president and chief program officer at Knight Foundation. \"People like freedom online but they are genuinely worried about harmand they don't know whom they can trust to make content decisions.\"</p><p>The report's findings come at a critical moment, when Congress and federal agencies are assessing a more prominent role for government in regulating internet technology companies, and the companies themselves are collaborating with the public sector and one another to a greater extent than ever before to weed out dangerous and harmful content. The findings point to an American public that still treasures the ideals of free speech and expression, but sees these values as increasingly in tension with the new realities of the COVID-19 landscape.</p><p>The report contains viewpoints from the following academic and tech industry experts on the findings and their implications on technology policy:</p><p>Evelyn Aswad, professor of law at the University of Oklahoma College of Law, where she is the director of the Center for International Business and Human Rights, and a member of Facebook's Oversight Board.</p><p>Danielle Citron, professor of law at Boston University School of Law and vice president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative.</p><p>Eric Goldman, professor of law and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University School of Law.</p><p>Daphne Keller, director of the Program on Platform Regulation at the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center and former associate general counsel at Google.</p><p>Olivier Sylvain, professor of law and director of the McGannon Center for Communications Research at Fordham University.</p><p>A virtual discussion of the report and its findings will take place at 12 p.m. ET/9 a.m. PT on Wednesday, June 17, with leading experts including Aswad and Keller, as well as John Samples, vice president and founder of the Center for Representative Government at the Cato Institute; and Paul Barrett, adjunct professor of law at New York University and deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.</p><p>The survey is part of Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation's Trust, Media and Democracy research series, which aims to address the decline in trust for journalism and other democratic institutions by examining the causes and supporting solutions.</p><p>For interviews with experts from Knight Foundation to discuss the new report and its findings, please contact Tony Franquiz at [email protected] or 202-374-5393.</p><p>###</p><p>About the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</p><p>Knight Foundation is a national foundation with strong local roots. We invest in journalism, in the arts, and in the success of cities where brothers John S. and James L. Knight once published newspapers. Our goal is to foster informed and engaged communities, which we believe are essential for a healthy democracy.

Hope is riding on a special facility in Nebraska.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: Mike Bloomberg could be on the debate stage for the first time tomorrow if polls this morning go his way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JARRETT: The Boy Scouts of America filing for bankruptcy over sexual abuse allegations dating back decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS: And a fiery end to the Daytona 500 leaves a popular NASCAR driver in the hospital.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>JARRETT: And I'm Laura Jarrett. At 30 minutes past the hour here in New York.</p><p>The U.S. trying desperately to contain the coronavirus. Fourteen Americans who tested positive for the virus were among hundreds of citizens evacuated from cruise ship off Japan and put on flights to Texas and California with the other evacuees. Some of those patients, along with their spouses, are now in isolation at the University of Nebraska medical center. That's the state's largest hospital.</p><p>ROMANS: Its special bio-containment unit is a state of the art facility that's treated Ebola, SARAS, monkeypox, and multidrug resistant tuberculosis, over nearly 15 years. Now, other countries making plans to get their citizens off the floating Petri dish and out of Japan.</p><p>CNN's Matt Rivers, live in Tokyo.</p><p>You know, they're getting off that ship and they are now facing new quarantines and new procedures in their home countries. What can you tell us?</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT. That's exactly right. Before we talk about that, though, Christine, within the last minute, quite literally, the Japanese health ministry confirmed, to CNN, an additional 88 people on board that ship have, once again, tested positive for the coronavirus. That's in the top three in terms of the biggest day-to-day increases.</p><p>Yesterday, it was 99 new cases. Today, it's 88. That brings the total number of cases on board that ship to 544, well over 10 percent of the total amount of people, total amount of passengers that were on that ship.</p><p>But in terms of the disembarkation process, that is going forward. According to the health ministry, starting on the 19th -- that would be tomorrow -- every single person on board this ship is being tested for the virus in different stages. The testing procedure will be done by the end of the day today. But it takes a couple days to get the results.</p><p>So, if you were a person that got tested today and the test comes back negative, the earliest you are getting off this ship is on the 21st. But, clearly, people are still testing positive. This number could continue to go up.</p><p>This, as other countries have followed the United States' lead. The U.S. being the first country to evacuate its citizens. Now, we know the Canadians, the Australians, and the Italians, among others, are planning to do so in the coming days, as well.</p><p>But all eyes are going to be on this disembarkation process, which begins tomorrow, will last several days as hundreds of people remain in local hospitals here in Tokyo receiving treatment. This ordeal, guys, just goes on and on and on.</p><p>ROMANS: It sure does. Unbelievable. Thanks for that breaking news. 88 more people testing positive on that ship. Nice to see you, Matt.</p><p>JARRETT: The novel coronavirus has now killed almost 1,900 people and there are more than 73,000 cases confirmed worldwide. Most of them are in mainland China where 780 million remain on some sort of lockdown. And the hospital director in the epicenter of Wuhan has now died.</p><p>CNN's Steven Jiang is live in Beijing.</p><p>What more can you tell us, Steven?</p><p>STEVEN JIANG, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: Well, Laura, this latest death, a 51-year neurosurgeon really illustrates the danger medical workers continue to face on the front lines. With many of them overwhelmed and under protected.</p><p>Remember, just over a week ago, we talked about this young doctor who died after contracting this very virus he was trying to sound an early alarm about. But instead, he was silenced by local authorities. Speaking of government response, over the weekend, we learned from state media that Chinese president Xi Jinping actually chaired a top leadership meeting on this versus as early as January 7th. Two weeks before he first publicly spoke about it. Really calling into question how early Mr. Xi knew about this virus and what he did or did not do.</p><p>But all politics aside, though, officials across the nation are taking no chances. That is why the epicenter in Hubei province, they are taking increasingly draconian lockdown measures, requiring millions of local residents to stay home around the clock, 24/7, with their food being delivered by local officials. That is also why the Chinese central bank is now deep cleaning and destroying its cash out of concerns how long this virus can actually live on contaminated surfaces.</p><p>And with schools closed nationwide, millions of school children were also logging online to take classes remotely.</p><p>And, Laura, let me tell you as a parent, it's almost impossible to force a 3-year-old to sit-down and focus and learn by watching educational videos -- Laura.</p><p>JARRETT: Yes.</p><p>[04:35:01]</p><p>Tough job for parents, no question, Steven. Thanks so much for all your reporting.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Michael Bloomberg is son the verge of qualifying for tomorrow night's Democratic debate in Nevada even though he is not participating in the state's caucuses. Several polls due to be released this morning could put Bloomberg over the top. One of them comes out next hour.</p><p>CNN has learned the former New York City mayor has been preparing for the debate. Something he's never done on a national level. We are already getting a sense of his opponents' strategy. They want an inspection of Bloomberg's record and say he shouldn't be able to buy the election.</p><p>JARRETT: The gloves are clearly off between Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders. A digital ad from the Bloomberg camp highlights the hostility of some Bernie supporters and their attacks on Democratic rivals. And it's backed up with a Bloomberg tweet claiming that type of energy is not going to beat Trump. Those attacks coming after Sanders said about -- said this about the multibillionaire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will not create the energy and excitement we need to defeat Donald Trump if that candidate pursued, advocated for, and enacted racist policies like stop-and-frisk.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: It was a day-long exchange of attacks between the two camps. Bloomberg's campaign manager charging Sanders staff with using the same tactics employed by President Trump. His statement went out with the subject line Bernie's new bro, Donald Trump.</p><p>Two hours later, Sanders tweeted an image of Bloomberg and Trump, together, on a golf course.</p><p>JARRETT: The Vermont senator also releasing two new ads in Nevada. One has Nevada-first theme, with the focus on the climate crisis. The other touts how Sanders will stand up to corruption. The Sanders camp is also opening new campaign offices in North Carolina, a few days after Bloomberg beat him to the punch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know that you can see very many presidential candidates here in Winston, Salem. They're spending all their time in South Carolina but I think the vote is in North Carolina. It deserves just as much attention.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Right now, the shadow of the Iowa caucus debacle hanging over Nevada. Trained volunteers say they are still unclear about exactly how the process will work. Now, the issue for some precinct captains is how tens of thousands of early votes will fold into what's happening, face to face, inside the caucus room.</p><p>Nevada Democratic Party source tells CNN it's just a matter of plugging numbers into a shared spreadsheet. And there is a paper trail if a backup is needed.</p><p>JARRETT: The counter-programmer in chief following Democrats out west. President Trump begins a four-day Western campaign swing today. He finishes a rally Friday night in Nevada just before the Democrat's caucus. It's the third straight state where the president is rallying ahead of the Democrat's vote.</p><p>Stay with CNN tonight and Thursday night for a series of town halls with the leading Democrats from Las Vegas. Tonight, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar. Thursday, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. That starts tonight at 8:00 p.m. eastern only on CNN.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Breaking overnight, Boy Scouts of America filing for bankruptcy. The organization faces a wave of lawsuits alleging sexual abuse. The Chapter 11 filing will allow the Boy Scouts to continue operations while reorganizing its finances and handling the hundreds of abuse claims. It also provides a limited amount of time for any new victims to come forward, before being barred indefinitely from seeking financial compensation. Boy Scouts marked its 110th anniversary this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: To the inside. Here comes Hamlin up the outside! Crash into the wall. Into the air. Goes Newman.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) JARRETT: A fiery crash in the final lap of the Daytona 500. Ryan Newman, hit from behind, then hitting a wall. Could see there and going airborne. His car flipped over several times before skidding across the finish line in fourth place. Newman is hospitalized with -- in serious condition with non-life threatening injuries.</p><p>President Trump praying for Newman in a tweet. He was at the race Sunday before rain postponed it. As for the race, Denny Hamlin very narrowly taking the checkered flag for his third Daytona 500 win.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Once again, John Bolton speaks. Once again, he doesn't say much at all.</p><p>[04:43:41]</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Mark Zuckerberg has asked for more regulation of big tech. He is about to get what he wants in Europe. During a trip to Munich, Zuckerberg said he wants governments to provide more rules on data use, privacy and content.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: Even if I'm not going to agree with every regulation in the near term, I do think it's going to be the thing that helps create trust and better governance of the Internet and will benefit everyone, including us over the long term.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: On Monday, Facebook released a paper outlining how it wants to be regulated, saying it does not support laws that will hold platforms liable for content posted by users. Increased regulation looks inevitable in Europe. This week, leaders will start a debate about new rules that will govern data and artificial intelligence.</p><p>The big question for tech companies is, how far are European leaders willing to go? The E.U. has been far more aggressive than the U.S. confronting Silicon Valley over competition issues and imposing data- protection rules that have set a new global standard.</p><p>JARRETT: An independent organization of federal judges, now calling an emergency meeting about the Justice Department's intervention in politically sensitive cases. According to \"USA Today,\" the head of the federal judge's association said the group could not wait until its spring conference to respond to the ongoing controversy at DOJ.</p><p>Attorney General Bill Barr overruled career prosecutors' initial sentencing recommendation for longtime Trump ally Roger Stone last week after the president blasted it on Twitter, causing all four prosecutors to quit the case.</p><p>[04:45:07]</p><p>Meanwhile, more than 2,000 former prosecutors and justice officials are calling on the attorney general to resign. And today, a notable hearing on the federal docket. The judge overseeing Stone's case, who Trump also targeted, has called for a scheduling conference call with attorneys. It's the first time Judge Amy Berman Jackson made comment or seek an explanation on the DOJ's sudden reversal, changing Stone's sentencing recommendation.</p><p>Last week, the chief judge of the federal district court in D.C., said judges would not be swayed by public criticism or pressure. Stone's attorneys have made a second request for a new trial. Sentencing is set for this Thursday, pending the outcome of today's proceedings.</p><p>ROMANS: John Bolton, once again, finds a way to speak up without revealing much at all. The former national security advisor making his first public comments since President Trump's impeachment saga. He declined to corroborate any of the details from the inquiry or divulge other details from his highly-anticipated book.</p><p>The book is currently under review by the White House. Bolton said he hopes it's not suppressed. Remember last month, \"The New York Times\" reported Bolton's unpublished manuscript alleges Trump directed him to help with his pressure in Ukraine.</p><p>JARRETT: But Bolton suggests the Ukraine matter is just the start. He says for all the focus on Ukraine and impeachment trial, to me, there are portions of the manuscript that deal with Ukraine. I view that as the sprinkles on an ice cream sundae in terms of the book.</p><p>This is an effort to write history. I did the best I can. We'll see ha happens with the censorship. Asked whether Trump's July 2019 call with Ukraine's president was perfect, Bolton tease, you'll love chapter 14.</p><p>Bolton has said he would testify if subpoenaed, something House Democrats have not ruled out yet.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. You had one job, but this building in Dallas did not come down as planned.</p><p>JARRETT: All right. Welcome back. A bill to ban assault weapons, defeated in the Virginia Senate, despite Democratic control. In a rare win for gun rights groups in the state, four Democrats join Republicans to kill the measure in committee.</p><p>High-capacity magazines would have been outlawed as well. Democrats won control of Virginia's legislature on the promise of sweeping gun control after a shooter killed 12 people at a Virginia Beach municipal building last May.</p><p>ROMANS: A violent holiday weekend in Chicago. Twenty-five people were shot, 11 of them minors, three died, all of them adults. The carnage coming nine months into the administration of Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who made gun violence a top priority in her campaign. Note that Chicago's homicide rate did decrease for the third straight year in 2019. JARRETT: Plymouth Rock has been vandalized. Someone painted red graffiti on the iconic landmark where according to legend, the first pilgrims landed in Massachusetts in 1620. They also spray-painted the pilgrim maiden statute and the national monument to the forefathers. The town of Plymouth has been preparing a 400th anniversary celebration of the pilgrims' arrival on the Mayflower. Police are asking for help finding those vandals.</p><p>ROMANS: In just a few hours, the fate of disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein will be in the hands of a New York jury. The jurors are expected to begin deliberations today after hearing four weeks of witness testimony. The 67-year-old Weinstein charged with five sex crimes involving two women. The charges include rape, sexual criminal act, predatory sexual assault. Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.</p><p>JARRETT: Hollywood sex therapist Amie Harwick found dead in her Hollywood hills home. An ex-boyfriend, 41-year-old Garrett Pursehouse has been arrested and charged with her murder. The former Playboy model was engaged to comedian Drew Carey in 2018 but the couple split a year later. Nevertheless, tapings of Carey's \"Price is Right\" show have been cancelled for the week by CBS because of her death.</p><p>Carey calling Harwick a positive force in the world, a tireless and unapologetic champion for women and passionate about her work as a therapist. I am overcome with grief.</p><p>ROMANS: Brazen thieves going the extra mile in a smash and grab robbery in Littleton, Colorado. Surveillance video shows them ramming a minivan right through the front entrance of a sports bar and restaurant. Two people in hoodies then seen going straight for the ATM and cash registers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEX WOODS, RESTAURANT OWNER: It appears that they do know that there may have been some money in that register. I have four registers and that register was the only one that had money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: The minivan was later determined to be stolen. Fire officials say a full inspection of the building is needed to determine if it's safe before that restaurant can reopen.</p><p>JARRETT: An emergency search for a 62-year-old blind man missing in icy cold weather ends happily with an assist from a police drone. Richard Doty's brother called police in Enfield, Connecticut, after not hearing from him for a day and a half. Police sent up their drone and found Doty in just a half an hour. He was hundred yards into the woods from his home and down an embankment where he spent the night in 9-degree weather. He was taken to the hospital for evaluation. His condition was not immediately known.</p><p>ROMANS: Hundreds of homes and businesses flooded in Jackson, Mississippi. The Pearl River cresting at 36.7 feet, the third highest level on record.</p><p>[04:55:01]</p><p>Officials say at least 1,000 homes are damaged, four injuries reported. Could take several days for the water to recede, and there's more rain in the forecast. With up to 2 inches expected in the -- in a very short time today, a flash flood watch is in effect for central Mississippi.</p><p>JARRETT: A 6-year-old California girl saved from a mountain lion attack when one of the adults in her group punched that lion in the ribs. The girl, her parents, and several other adults and children had been hiking in a Santa Clara County park Sunday morning. Officials say the girl is recovering from minor injuries. The park is closed while rangers search for the mountain lion.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. The implosion of an 11-story high rise in Dallas seemed to go without a hitch. But then when the dust cleared, the center of the building refused to come down. The part left standing has been dubbed the leaning tower of Dallas. The demolition company says these things sometimes happen with older buildings. It says the remaining structure poses no threat.</p><p>JARRETT: Just didn't want to go down.</p><p>Well, random acts of kindness not only help others. It turns out they are also good for the giver's health. Research shows feel-good chemicals flood our system when we do something generous. Sort of a helper's high.</p><p>For example, volunteering has been shown to reduce stress and depression. And studies suggest engaging in giving activities can also reduce the risk for cognitive impairment and help us live longer.</p><p>ROMANS: So does playing with dogs. Dogs make everyone live longer.</p><p>Let's get a check on CNN Business this morning, taking a look at global markets, pretty much mixed performance. Narrowly lower. Tokyo down 1.4 percent. Hong Kong also down here.</p><p>Look, U.S. markets set to reopen after the president's day holiday and looks like it could be a soft opening. You know, investors are watching still how the coronavirus is affecting global business. I think about 20 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies have all come out and said in some way, shape, or form coronavirus will slow their sales or their hurt their business in some way. Also, watching to see how Walmart did in the fourth quarter, with six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, it was a disappointing holiday season for U.S. retailers.</p><p>Investors look to Walmart for signs that consumer spending stayed strong heading into 2020.</p><p>Some relief for America's largest milk producer, Dairy Farmers of America has agreed to buy a substantial part of Dean Foods. Dean filed for bankruptcy in November, blaming its struggles on the accelerated decline in the conventional, white milk category. Volatile prices, the trade war, more plant-based alternatives have not helped the dairy sector. The deal still needs to be approved by the Department of Justice.</p><p>The world's richest person is throwing his weight behind the fight against climate change. On Monday, Jeff Bezos launched the Bezos earth fund and said he will give it $10 billion to start. The new fund will back design tickets, scientists, activists, and those working to mitigate the impact of climate change. Bezos has been under pressure from his own employees to do more to protect the environment, many of them joining a walkout last year. The group that organized that walkout applauded Bezos to address underlying causes of fossil fuel consumption.</p><p>JARRETT: A stray dog was definitely game and showed some good ball skill after running on to the field there during a professional soccer match in Turkey. Players try to get the ball from him, finally, throwing it off the field for the intruder dog to fetch. He did. And then he came right back for more.</p><p>One of the players finally picked up the persistent and promising pup and took him away from the field. Anyone who has a dog knows that you can't throw something and then expect them not to go get it.</p><p>ROMANS: That's cute.</p><p>JARRETT: Thanks to our international viewers for joining us this morning. Have a great rest of your day.</p><p>For our U.S. viewers, EARLY START continues right now.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>JARRETT: Mike Bloomberg could be on the debate stage for the first time tomorrow if polls this morning go his way. New numbers out any moment.</p><p>ROMANS: The U.S. is amassing forces to keep coronavirus from spreading on American soil. Hope is riding on a special facility in Nebraska.</p><p>JARRETT: The Boy Scouts of America filing for bankruptcy over sexual abuse allegations dating back decades.</p><p>ROMANS: And a fiery end to the Daytona 500 leaves a popular NASCAR driver in the hospital.</p><p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>JARRETT: And I'm Laura Jarrett. It's Tuesday, February 18th, 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p>Michael Bloomberg is on the verge of qualifying for tomorrow's night Democratic debate in Nevada, even though he's not even participating in the state's caucuses. Several polls due to be released this morning could put Bloomberg over the top. One of them comes out any time now. CNN has learned former New York City mayor has been preparing for the debate, something he has never done on a national level. We're already getting a sense of the opponents' strategy here. They want an inspection of Bloomberg's record and say he shouldn't be able to buy the election.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2020021802CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7J-D9K1-DXH2-62K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Three 20-somethings launched a firm out of a dorm room at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2016, with the goal of using algorithms to predict the reply to an e-mail. In May they were fundraising for their startup, EasyEmail, when Google held its annual conference for software developers and announced a tool similar to EasyEmail's. Filip Twarowski, its boss, sees Google's incursion as \"incredible confirmation\" they are working on something worthwhile. But he also admits that it came as \"a little bit of a shock\". The giant has scared off at least one prospective backer of EasyEmail, because venture capitalists try to dodge spaces where the tech giants might step. </p><p>The behemoths' annual conferences, held to announce new tools, features, and acquisitions, always \"send shock waves of fear through entrepreneurs\", says Mike Driscoll, a partner at Data Collective, an investment firm. \"Venture capitalists attend to see which of their companies are going to get killed next.\" But anxiety about the tech giants on the part of startups and their investors goes much deeper than such events. Venture capitalists, such as Albert Wenger of Union Square Ventures, who was an early investor in Twitter, now talk of a \"kill-zone\" around the giants. Once a young firm enters, it can be extremely difficult to survive. Tech giants try to squash startups by copying them, or they pay to scoop them up early to eliminate a threat. </p><p>The idea of a kill-zone may bring to mind Microsoft's long reign in the 1990s, as it embraced a strategy of \"embrace, extend and extinguish\" and tried to intimidate startups from entering its domain. But entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' concerns are striking because for a long while afterwards, startups had free rein. In 2014 The Economist likened the proliferation of startups to the Cambrian explosion: software made running a startup cheaper than ever and opportunities seemed abundant. </p><p>Today, less so. Anything having to do with the consumer internet is perceived as dangerous, because of the dominance of Amazon, Facebook and Google (owned by Alphabet). Venture capitalists are wary of backing startups in online search, social media, mobile and e-commerce. It has become harder for startups to secure a first financing round. According to Pitchbook, a research company, in 2017 the number of these rounds were down by around 22% from 2012 (see chart). </p><p>The wariness comes from seeing what happens to startups when they enter the kill-zone, either deliberately or accidentally. Snap is the most prominent example; after Snap rebuffed Facebook's attempts to buy the firm in 2013, for $3bn, Facebook cloned many of its successful features and has put a damper on its growth. A less known example is Life on Air, which launched Meerkat, a live video-streaming app, in 2015. It was obliterated when Twitter acquired and promoted a competing app, Periscope. Life on Air shut Meerkat down and launched a different app, called Houseparty, which offered group video chats. This briefly gained prominence, but was then copied by Facebook, seizing users and attention away from the startup. </p><p>The kill-zone operates in business software (\"enterprise\" in the lingo) as well, with the shadows of Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet looming large. Amazon's cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has labelled many startups as \"partners\", only to copy their functionality and offer them as a cheap or free service. A giant pushing into a startup's territory, while controlling the platform that startup depends on for distribution, makes life tricky. For example, Elastic, a data-management firm, lost sales after AWS launched a competitor, Elasticsearch, in 2015. </p><p> Even if giants do not copy startups outright, they can dent their prospects. Last year Amazon bought Whole Foods Market, a grocer, for $13.7bn. Blue Apron, a meal-delivery startup that was preparing to go public, was suddenly perceived as unappetising, as expectations mounted that Amazon would push into the space. This phenomenon is not limited to young firms: recently Facebook announced it was moving into online dating, causing the share price of Match Group, which went public in 2015, to plummet by 22% that day.</p><p>It has never been easy to make it as a startup. Now the army of fearsome technology giants is larger, and operates in a wider range of areas, including online search, social media, digital advertising, virtual reality, messaging and communications, smartphones and home speakers, cloud computing, smart software, e-commerce and more. This makes it challenging for startups to find space to break through and avoid being stamped on. Today's giants are \"much more ruthless and introspective. They will eat their own children to live another day,\" according to Matt Ocko, a venture capitalist with Data Collective. And they are constantly scanning the horizon for incipient threats. Startups used to be able to have several years' head start working on something novel without the giants noticing, says Aaron Levie of Box, a cloud and file-sharing service that has avoided the kill-zone (it has a market value of around $3.8bn). But today startups can only get a six- to 12-month lead before incumbents quickly catch up, he says. </p><p>There are some exceptions. Airbnb, Uber, Slack and other \"unicorns\" have faced down competition from incumbents. But they are few in number and many startups have learned to set their sights on more achievable aims. Entrepreneurs are \"thinking much earlier about which consolidator is going to buy them\", says Larry Chu of Goodwin Proctor, a law firm. The tech giants have been avid acquirers: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft spent a combined $31.6bn on acquisitions in 2017. This has led some startups to be less ambitious. \"Ninety per cent of the startups I see are built for sale, not for scale,\" says Ajay Royan of Mithril Capital, which invests in tech. </p><p>This can be enriching to founders, who can go on to start another firm or provide financing to peers with smart ideas. To the extent that such exits provide more capital to spur innovation, this is no bad thing. The tech giants can help the firms they acquire grow more than they might have been able to do on their own. For example, Facebook's acquisition of Instagram took out a would-be competitor, but it has thrived under the social-networking giant's sway by adopting the technical infrastructure, staff and know-how that Facebook had in place. </p><p>But plenty of people in the Valley reckon the bad outweighs the good and that early, \"shoot-out\" acquisitions have sapped innovation. \"The dominance of the big platforms has had a meaningful effect on the entrepreneurial culture of Silicon Valley,\" says Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, a private-equity firm, who was an early investor in Facebook. \"It's shifted the incentives from trying to create a large platform to creating a small morsel that's tasty to be acquired by one of the giants.\" </p><p>And when startups are bullied into selling, as some are, it is even more worrying. Big tech firms have been known to intimidate startups into agreeing to a sale, saying that they will launch a competing service and put the startup out of business unless they agree to a deal, says one person who was in charge of these negotiations at a big software firm (which uses such tactics). </p><p>There are three reasons to think that the kill-zone is likely to stay. First, the giants have tons of data to identify emerging rivals faster than ever before. Google collects signals about how internet users are spending time and money through its Chrome browser, e-mail service, Android operating system, app store, cloud service and more. Facebook can see which apps people use and where they travel online. It acquired the app Onavo, which helped it recognise that Instagram was gaining steam. It bought the young firm for $1bn before it could mature into a real threat, and last year it purchased a nascent social-polling firm, tbh, in a similar manner. Amazon can glean reams of data from its e-commerce platform and cloud business. </p><p>Another source of market information comes from investing in startups, which helps tech firms gain insights into new markets and possible disrupters. Of all American tech firms, Alphabet has been the most active. Since 2013 it has spent $12.6bn investing in 308 startups. Startups generally feel excited about gaining expertise from such a successful firm, but some may rue the day they accepted funding, because of conflicts. Uber, for example, took money from one of Alphabet's venture-capital funds, but soon found itself competing against the giant's self-driving car unit, Waymo. Thumbtack, a marketplace for skilled workers, also accepted money from Alphabet, but then watched as the parent company rolled out a competing service, Google Home Services. Amazon and Apple invest less in startups, but they too have clashed with them. Amazon invested in a home intercom system, called Nucleus, and then rolled out a very similar product of its own last year.</p><p>Recruiting is a second tool the giants will use to enforce their kill zones. Big tech firms are able to shell out huge sums to keep top performers and even average employees in their fold and make it uneconomical for their workers to consider joining startups. In 2017 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft allocated a combined a whopping $23.7bn to stock-based compensation. Big companies' hoarding of talent stops startups scaling quickly. According to Mike Volpi of Index Ventures, a venture-capital firm, startups in the firm's portfolio are currently 10-20% behind in their hiring goals for the year. </p><p>A third reason that startups may struggle to break through is that there is no sign of a new platform emerging which could disrupt the incumbents, even more than a decade after the rise of mobile. For example, the rise of mobile wounded Microsoft, which was dominant on personal computers, and gave power to both Facebook and Google, enabling them to capture more online ad dollars and attention. But there is no big new platform today. And the giants make it extremely expensive to get attention: Facebook, Google and Amazon all charge a hefty toll for new apps and services to get in front of consumers. </p><p>Seeing little opportunity to compete with the tech giants on their own turf, investors and startups are going where they can spot an opening. The lack of an incumbent giant is one reason why there is so much investor enthusiasm for crypto-currencies and for synthetic biology today. But the giants are starting to pay more attention. There are rumours Facebook wants to buy Coinbase, a cryptocurrency firm. </p><p>Regulators will be watching what the giants try next. Criticism that they have been too lax in approving deals where tech firms buy tiny competitors that could one day challenge them has been mounting. Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and Google's purchase of YouTube, before it was obvious how the pair might have taken on the giants, might well have been blocked today. To fight back against the kill-zone, regulators must closely consider what weapons to wield themselves. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-BP78KK8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFN-B1N1-JBKN-B0PH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

This followed the President's attacks on the Chinese communists forreleasing[3] and thencovering up[4] the threat from the Wuhan coronavirus. Also his trade war, with huge tariffs on China's exporters, hascaused the Far East nation great pain[5]. And regarding investments, a special working group of the administration's top financial regulators, led by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin,recommended[6] the Securities and Exchange Commission impose stronger transparency rules for foreign companies that are listed on American exchanges. The step was primarily directed at China, whose companies' financial disclosures are opaque. </p><p>This followed a decision by the Department of Labor in May toreverse plans[7] to place some retirement funds for government employees and U.S. military veterans - the largest in the world - into an index with a strong representation of Chinese companies. Trump's allies in the Senatehave echoed the calls to disinvest in China[8]. With regard to the universities - whose collective endowments undoubtedly sit on trillions of dollars - the State Department official also warned that Chinese firms listed in the United States may not be as stable as they represent themselves to be, and that China's hostility towards America and its human rights abuses at home are bringing a reckoning via U.S. policy. If those firms don't respond with stronger transparency measures in line with standards that American companies must follow, they will be delisted from our exchanges. 'Boards of U.S. university endowments would be prudent to divest from People's Republic of China firms' stocks in the likely outcome that enhanced listing standards lead to a wholesale de-listing of PRC firms from U.S. exchanges by the end of next year,' warned Keith Krach, the State Department's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, in theletter[9] to directors of U.S. universities and colleges. 'Holding these stocks also runs the high risks associated with PRC companies having to restate financials.' The advisory, of course, was taken as a threat by one of the Chinese government's top propagandists. 'Putting up obstacles for such cooperation does not serve the interests of our capital markets,' said China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian,according to Bloomberg News[10]. 'We urge the U.S. side to create a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies' investment in the U.S.' Zhao is the Chinese official whosuggested[11] in March that the U.S. Army 'brought the (COVID) epidemic to Wuhan.' 'Be transparent!' he tweeted. 'Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!' The Trump administration's demands for transparency follow the National Legal and Policy Center'sefforts[12] in recent years to hold American companies, institutions, and politicians accountable in their dealings with the Chinese. And it is the focus of anew project and website[13] NLPC has established,Freedom4China.com[14]. The first initiative under the endeavor is to call attention to the hypocrisy of the National Basketball Association and its biggest star, LeBron James, which have immersed themselves in social justice virtue signaling about alleged 'systemic racism' in America, while ignoring the obvious human rights abuses of their business partners in communist China. And NLPC has also called attention to investment inconsistencies by the world's largest investment manager. In May NLPC President Peter Flahertywrote[15] to BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink, asking the firm to divest its customer's money from the 137 Chinese companies currently listed on American stock exchanges. Fink has led the way in the investment trend of prioritizing so-called environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals above financial returns for their customers - while at the same time ignoring the injustices perpetrated by the China-controlled companies that it invests its billions of dollars in. For years now NLPC has also called attention to double standards applied by hypocritical big tech companies - mainlyApple[16] andGoogle[17] - whose corporate leaders attempt to moralize politically against Trump policies at home, while remaining uncritical yet cozy with the ChiComs. Finally, universities' involvement with the Chinese are also part of NLPC's agenda. In May the nonprofit watchdogfiled a complaint[18] with the U.S. Department of Education requesting that it conduct a full investigation into the University of Pennsylvania's failure to disclose the source of millions of dollars of donations from China since 2013 to the university and itsBiden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement[19], as required by law. The center is one of several organizations that Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden founded since leaving at the end of the Obama administration in 2017, including the domestic policy-focused Biden Institute at the University of Delaware and the Biden Cancer Initiative, all launched the same year. All three entities have refused to reveal the sources of their funding. America has had a blind spot for too long towards how China has infiltrated and harmed our politics, culture, and public health. NLPC is glad that top leaders in the federal government have joined it in renewed scrutiny of the Communist regime.Further Reading [ 1]: <url

This followed the President's attacks on the Chinese communists forreleasing[3] and thencovering up[4] the threat from the Wuhan coronavirus. Also his trade war, with huge tariffs on China's exporters, hascaused the Far East nation great pain[5]. And regarding investments, a special working group of the administration's top financial regulators, led by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin,recommended[6] the Securities and Exchange Commission impose stronger transparency rules for foreign companies that are listed on American exchanges. The step was primarily directed at China, whose companies' financial disclosures are opaque. </p><p>This followed a decision by the Department of Labor in May toreverse plans[7] to place some retirement funds for government employees and U.S. military veterans - the largest in the world - into an index with a strong representation of Chinese companies. Trump's allies in the Senatehave echoed the calls to disinvest in China[8]. With regard to the universities - whose collective endowments undoubtedly sit on trillions of dollars - the State Department official also warned that Chinese firms listed in the United States may not be as stable as they represent themselves to be, and that China's hostility towards America and its human rights abuses at home are bringing a reckoning via U.S. policy. If those firms don't respond with stronger transparency measures in line with standards that American companies must follow, they will be delisted from our exchanges. 'Boards of U.S. university endowments would be prudent to divest from People's Republic of China firms' stocks in the likely outcome that enhanced listing standards lead to a wholesale de-listing of PRC firms from U.S. exchanges by the end of next year,' warned Keith Krach, the State Department's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, in theletter[9] to directors of U.S. universities and colleges. 'Holding these stocks also runs the high risks associated with PRC companies having to restate financials.' The advisory, of course, was taken as a threat by one of the Chinese government's top propagandists. 'Putting up obstacles for such cooperation does not serve the interests of our capital markets,' said China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian,according to Bloomberg News[10]. 'We urge the U.S. side to create a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies' investment in the U.S.' Zhao is the Chinese official whosuggested[11] in March that the U.S. Army 'brought the (COVID) epidemic to Wuhan.' 'Be transparent!' he tweeted. 'Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!' The Trump administration's demands for transparency follow the National Legal and Policy Center'sefforts[12] in recent years to hold American companies, institutions, and politicians accountable in their dealings with the Chinese. And it is the focus of anew project and website[13] NLPC has established,Freedom4China.com[14]. The first initiative under the endeavor is to call attention to the hypocrisy of the National Basketball Association and its biggest star, LeBron James, which have immersed themselves in social justice virtue signaling about alleged 'systemic racism' in America, while ignoring the obvious human rights abuses of their business partners in communist China. And NLPC has also called attention to investment inconsistencies by the world's largest investment manager. In May NLPC President Peter Flahertywrote[15] to BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink, asking the firm to divest its customer's money from the 137 Chinese companies currently listed on American stock exchanges. Fink has led the way in the investment trend of prioritizing so-called environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals above financial returns for their customers - while at the same time ignoring the injustices perpetrated by the China-controlled companies that it invests its billions of dollars in. For years now NLPC has also called attention to double standards applied by hypocritical big tech companies - mainlyApple[16] andGoogle[17] - whose corporate leaders attempt to moralize politically against Trump policies at home, while remaining uncritical yet cozy with the ChiComs. Finally, universities' involvement with the Chinese are also part of NLPC's agenda. In May the nonprofit watchdogfiled a complaint[18] with the U.S. Department of Education requesting that it conduct a full investigation into the University of Pennsylvania's failure to disclose the source of millions of dollars of donations from China since 2013 to the university and itsBiden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement[19], as required by law. The center is one of several organizations that Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden founded since leaving at the end of the Obama administration in 2017, including the domestic policy-focused Biden Institute at the University of Delaware and the Biden Cancer Initiative, all launched the same year. All three entities have refused to reveal the sources of their funding. America has had a blind spot for too long towards how China has infiltrated and harmed our politics, culture, and public health. NLPC is glad that top leaders in the federal government have joined it in renewed scrutiny of the Communist regime.Further Reading [ 1]: <url

Trump's statement says that AI 'must also be developed in a way that does not compromise our American values, civil liberties, or freedoms.' </p><p>As President Trump takes the United States on its first steps into the artificial intelligence arms race, it is depending on advice and assistance from the very entities that threaten freedom worldwide. Trump's executive order[2], signed on Monday, will advance research into AI,The initiative focuses Federal Government resources toward developing AI technology and ensuring that the next great AI inventions are made in the United States. Former Google exec Eric Schmidt was recently appointed[3] as chairman of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. Google, IBM and Apple[4] have all indicated that they are willing to submit - and have already - to Chinese government regulations in order to operate in the communist country. The Pentagon is seeking to work with Big Tech to advance AI research. As reported by Wired[5],'The plan depends on the Pentagon working closely with the tech industry to source the algorithms and cloud computing power needed to run AI projects. Federal contracting records indicate that Google, Oracle, IBM, and SAP have signaled interest in working on future Defense Department AI projects.'Google's censored search engine 'Dragonfly' has stirred controversy across the world. AI is the 'ring of power' that is being greedily sought after by nations. Multiple experts have warned that it holds unpredictable and catastrophic danger.

Apple's minimalist store looms over the riverfront, close to a skyscraper carrying the name of another omnipresent brand\u2014Trump. At a bus stop a Facebook advertisement promises that its new algorithm will combat fake news. On the Magnificent Mile's digital hoardings Google urges pedestrians to swoon into the arms of its voice-activated assistant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inside the University of Chicago, a bastion of free-market thinkers and of free speech, tech has become more prominent, too. On April 19th and 20th most of America's antitrust establishment\u2014officials, economists and lawyers\u2014as well as a smattering of Silicon Valley types, gathered to discuss whether big tech needed to be tamed. The conclave came just days after Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief, testified before Congress. </p><p>One Facebook executive was brave enough to show his face in Chicago, bearing the smile of someone stuck at the dentist for two days without anaesthetic. The experts agreed that government intervention in big tech is needed. But debate raged about which institutions should do it, and about the trade-offs between innovation and regulation, between privacy and free flows of data, and between stopping manipulation and protecting free speech.</p><p>When you assemble a room full of intelligent critics, the dizzying scope of the complaints against the tech industry becomes clear. They come in three flavours. First, antitrust worries, which take in big tech firms' high market shares, buying-up of promising competitors, and potential monopsony power over suppliers and vendors. The five biggest American tech firms together make about a tenth of all corporate profits. Second, the externalities they may impose on their users, including a loss of privacy and tech addiction. And third, their probable pollution of the public sphere with fake news, mass manipulation and lobbying.</p><p>The view in Chicago was that Facebook and Alphabet (which owns Google) are the most vulnerable to regulation given their surveillance-based models and high market shares. Apple was viewed as less problematic given that it does not sell ads and has big competitors such as Samsung. Amazon divides opinion: its stratospheric valuation suggests it will evolve into a price-gouging monopoly but at the moment it is lowering consumer prices. Microsoft, which faced an antitrust case in 1998-2001, is now seen as big tech's harmless uncle, a label which should delight it.</p><p>America's antitrust establishment is like a clergy that after decades of obscurity finds itself blinking on the world stage. It simultaneously resents being criticised for its passivity, wants to preserve its doctrinal purity and absolutely loves all the attention. Since the 1980s American competition policy has been timid. Even today some antitrust officials and scholars want to pass the buck, arguing that the tech problem rightfully belongs to other parts of the government.</p><p>There is something to this. Across the Atlantic, the European Commission has taken action on everything from the \"right to be forgotten\" to tax-dodging by tech firms. America has an institutional division of labour. Rights for individuals over their data may be a matter of consumer protection, which falls under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Ensuring there is a variety of news sources, and that political ads are disclosed, could be the job of the Federal Communications Commission. Only Congress can repeal section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which allows tech firms to avoid liability for what they publish. If social media were to be regulated like tobacco or food, as a product that can harm consumers, states could play a role.</p><p>Yet ultimately big tech is also a matter for antitrust. It is possible that the big firms' dominance will be transitory. But this is a risky assumption. The stonking valuations of Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon imply that they will double in size by 2021. All five firms prevent the emergence of rivals by buying or crushing them. They have hoovered up at least 329 small firms in the past five years, according to Bloomberg, a data provider. One venture capitalist told the audience in Chicago that there is a \"kill zone\" around Alphabet and Facebook, which startups cannot survive.</p><p>Antitrust is vital because any solution to the problems of big tech will require innovation as well as regulation. For example, privacy could be protected by the rise of new \"fiduciary\" companies that act as trusted, anonymised intermediaries between users and the big tech firms. \"Ethical\" firms could emerge that create search engines, social-media platforms and digital assistants which are not reliant on ads and surveillance. The job of helping competitors emerge belongs squarely to the antitrust watchdogs. Makan Delrahim, the head of the antitrust arm of the Department of Justice (DoJ), conceded this, arguing that incumbents must not \"kill\" competition.</p><p>Here is a prediction. An alphabet soup of different consumer, privacy and media regulators will slowly try to ensnare the big tech firms. At the same time the antitrust regulators (the DoJ and the competition arm of the FTC) will make it nearly impossible for the big five companies to acquire smaller ones. They will also seek to enforce mechanisms to ensure there can be a safe transfer of data and customers between the big incumbent tech firms and their potential competitors so that newcomers can prosper. </p><p>For the tech firms this may appear utterly disorganised, and thus fairly harmless. But one way of gauging the hawkish mood in Chicago is to listen to what the big hitters of the non-tech business world now say about the industry. On April 23rd Jeffrey Gundlach, a celebrated fund manager, stood on stage at the Sohn Conference, an investment event in New York, and made fun of Mr Zuckerberg before saying Facebook was his best \"short\". The reason? Regulation. Or try the head of a megabank: the big tech firms and their bosses \"have no idea what is going to hit them\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-3T76D2S</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S66-BJF1-DY2R-20PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Two mass shootings, one in El Paso, Texas, and one in Dayton, Ohio, left 31 dead and scores injured, and an aching nation demanded answers as to what, or who, was to blame for this chaotic, unsettling state of affairs. Some looked to President Trump, others to the National Rifle Association or Fox News or white supremacism. But if you want a clearer view of our collective decline, just ask Sally Robey. </p><p>The mother of four from Wilmette, Illinois, was the subject of a recent piece[1] in The Wall Street Journal that captured, far better than most political coverage these days, just what it is that's currently wrong with America. Tired of paying excessive fees on her family's seven phone lines, Robey called AT...nd asked if a better deal was possible. She was a loyal client of the company since George Herbert Walker Bush was president, so when she called to report a counteroffer she had received from Verizon, imagining that a friendly and attentive representative on the other end of the line would do his best to match it. Instead, the representative declined to do anything at all. But when Robey went ahead and began switching her numbers to the competitor, she told theJournal, AT...ushed in and made her the very offer it had previously claimed was impossible. In corporate speak, the company was waiting for the 'breakpoint,' the precise moment in which a person breaks and is no longer willing to suffer abuse. And if you're following the advent of our technologies even haphazardly, it will not surprise you in the least to know that the calculation of breakpoints is now big business in Silicon Valley. Some dashing new startups, for example, now monitor customer service conversations in real time, directing the call to various service providers depending on the customer's perceived level of exasperation. 'Voice,' the chief strategy officer of one such company waxed poetic in theJournal, 'is the last offline data set.' If you're wondering what any of this has to do with mass shootings, political mistrust, and the other ills of our moment in time, simply imagine the staggeringly uncomplicated Platonic ideal of the sort of call Sally Robey was trying to make. It's the sort of call each one of us makes at least once a month if not more frequently. Ideally, when you call a customer care line, you expect a friendly and knowledgeable person on the other end to do their best to resolve your concern. Even if they don't offer any concrete help, we've plenty of research to suggest that just feeling heard and appreciated can go a long way toward making us feel like human beings and not like contestants in some less violent but equally cruel version ofThe Hunger Games. Why can't we get that nice person who listens when we pick up the phone and call for help? Three reasons come to mind, which happen to be the same three that are behind our contemporary bundle of sorrows. They are the advent of global capitalism, the dizzying rise of the technology sector, and the erosion of traditional mores and institutions. This may not sound all that new and exciting. But consider the evidence, beginning, if you will, with the humble call center. What has made that industry bleed jobs\u201418,200 of them lost[2] in 2017 alone? Two academics, John Burgess and Julia Connell, edited a book[3] on the subject, the sprightly titledDevelopments in the Call Centre Industry: Analysis, Changes and Challenges. It's a good read, but the volume's conclusion hardly requires a Ph.D. in sociology, economics, or any related fields: Call center jobs were lost or sent abroad because corporations, pressured by shareholders to produce higher revenues and goaded by consultants demanding cost-cutting galore, looked around for something expendable. They landed on that least quantifiable, least commodifiable asset\u2014interpersonal relations. What happened next doesn't take a genius to guess at, either. Big Tech jumped in like a Hallelujah chorus, ensuring CEOs that they were making the right decision by subjecting the exchanges of humans to an algorithm, which is how you get a culture that thinks of our voices\u2014the instrument with which we declare our liberty from tyranny, say, or our love for our children\u2014as nothing more complicated than an 'offline data set.' In turn, those two thrusts toward a colder, crueler world were made possible because the very institutions we've erected to guard against them\u2014the church, the family, the community\u2014have been systemically and repeatedly eroded by decades of activists who, seeing tradition as a particularly nefarious sort of oppression, argued for rampant individuality as our primary virtue. Economy, technology, morality: Rattle these big three, and soon folks may start feeling a little unsettled and a little more prone to anxiety and depression\u2014and to acts of desperation. And rattling these three is what the last 20 years of American life has been all about. It's a wild story best told wildly, and it goes something like this: Some very smart and very ambitious people decided that profits, like hope, ought to spring eternal. Boosted by a host of factors that enabled them to take their businesses global, they saw their fortunes soar; this is why, in 1978, the average American CEO was making 30 times as much as his or her company's lowest paid employee, and why that number has since soared[4] to 271 times, according to the Economic Policy Institute. This surge did little to improve the lives of average Americans, though. As a recentPew survey[5]found, while Americans' paychecks have gotten bigger over the past 40 years, many of their expenditures have gotten more costly, which means that their purchasing power hasn't budged much. This profound inequality is the sort of soil from which revolutions bloom, and so our economic betters began peddling the narrative of history's inevitable march forward. They told us, in a tone bordering on the bemused, that manufacturing jobs were no more likely to return to America than the Diplodocus, neglecting to add that the only reason that would not happen was that they preferred their revenues in the billions rather than the millions. When rumblings about income inequality persisted, and got louder, during the Obama years, the turbo-techno globalist classes tapped into capitalism's mighty power for reinvention and began embracing the wonders of wokeness. This is why Nike, to use an obvious example, makes so much of Colin Kaepernick: It's much better to have people fume and fight over whether or not athletes ought to take a knee while using identity politics to peddle expensive sneakers to inner city kids and their suburban emulators than to have to address hard allegations of worker abuse, child labor, and massive tax evasion. Luckily for Nike, and for every other corporation covering its sinful ass, launching orchestrated campaigns of mass distraction is easy these days, thanks to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and the other platforms owned by the tech gods. Social media destroyed the careful craft of gathering and disseminating information just as Amazon ravaged the intimacies of commerce and just as every 20-something with venture money and an appetite for disruption giddily reduced intricate human exchanges to a series of simple and convenient transactions. The ability to capture human desires with apps meant that a simple swipe could replace meaningful human interactions, like sex with someone you actually know, or walking over to your local farmer's market and chatting with the people who grew your food a few miles away. Tech's titans were glad to pay the requisite price to stay in the hollowing-out business: Firing an engineer who had said unkind things about women, they realized, was all it took to buy complacency, no matter what their products did to the hopes and dreams of actual women. It is, after all, much easier to demand a modest increase to the minimum wage than to note that the so-called sharing economy has robbed millions of American workers of hard-earned protections, turning them to de facto vassals who have been stripped of the familiar protections of labor laws and antitrust legislation. Depredations like these are best understood and resisted on a communal level, which is a feat a society as thoroughly atomized as ours can no longer achieve. The champions of progress, whether well meaning or purely profit-driven, have spent decades portraying every priest as a potential predator and every parent as a petty tyrant, leaving families and religious groups and other foundations of any society too broken down and stressed out to put up much of a fight. Instead of these familiar structures, progressives aim to create their own social verticals, rooted in the idea of 'identity,' which will supposedly do what families and churches and bowling leagues did, only better. Will they? The advantage of institutions like the family is that they have been around for a very long time. Whether identity politics-driven 'civil society' verticals on Facebook will actually welcome anyone home for Thanksgiving or pay their rent or provide the intimacy and inevitable disappointments of familial love and care is an open question\u2014if you come from Mars. For anyone with any experience of human existence on planet Earth, the idea is at best a joke or a con, and at worst a nightmare. But the most terrifying thing is that these same forces that have already eroded American civic life so thoroughly aren't even halfway done yet\u2014because they are aware that what they have broken can't be glued back together with likes and retweets and the fetishization of sneakers. Instead, their actual vision involves imposing ever-increasing degrees of technologically mediated surveillance and control over increasingly atomized societies. Tech companies already monitor every word we type or say. Smartphones note our location and the patterns of our movement. Lists are compiled, saved, and analyzed of everyone we know and everything we buy. Cameras record our every move. Facial recognition software is making anonymity increasingly difficult. If you wonder where all of this is going, look no further than China, where a complex, tech-driven social credit system is already in place, awarding citizens points for doing good things like volunteering and docking them points if they, say, neglect to pay a parking fine. The government's tracking system is intricately linked up with those of several tech behemoths, which means, quite literally, that everything you do online can and will be used against you if the authorities so please. America is not quite there yet, but it's not too far behind, either. Amazon, for example, is already using its popular home alarm system, Ring, to record video it then shares with local police departments, which is in large part why the company's cloud-computing enterprise, Amazon Web Services, mushroomed[6] from a $200 million business five years ago to a neat $2 billion today\u2014federal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies are paying top dollar for speedy access to the world's largest and most layered database, compiled by a company that has ears in our homes, eyes on our doors, and an exhaustive knowledge of everything we consume. Perversely, some activists\u2014and even somepresidential candidates[7]\u2014are calling for more, not less, control, urging social media companies, say, to censor the speech of political foes. This is a disaster, as well as the pathway to a deeply un-American future in which liberty is compromised and freedom forgotten. It's not too late yet for us to wake up from our collective nightmare, and start building a society that isn't driven by profit-hungry algorithms, and doesn't drive so many of its members to go berserk. But to do this we need to stop shrieking about the president or the gun lobby or other bogeymen and instead address, as good liberals liked to put it, the root causes of our ongoing social carnage. Regulating social media companies\u2014which pronounce themselves platforms even though they make their mint by running content and charging for advertisements, just like traditional publishers\u2014is a good first step, one that both Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump claim to agree on. We have firm laws in place to hold our media accountable, and to ensure that with the great power of freedom of speech comes great responsibility. Another good move would be to crack down on industries, like Big Pharma, that have made a killing while literally killing tens of thousands of Americans each year with addictive opioids. A third may be to explore policies that empower not just individuals but entire communities, be it through faith-based groups or otherwise. None of these are as satisfying a battle cry as 'Impeach Trump' or 'Ban All Guns.' But they are sustainable solutions, the only ones a society teetering on the brink of collapse can afford. *** Like this article?

Their decline was evident in industrial heartland areas voting for Trump and Brexit.</p><p>More financial power in the hands of fewer firms inevitably means more economically destructive rent-seeking.</p><p>Big corporations, with their army of lobbyists and spin doctors, use political influence to build a regulatory moat to protect themselves against insurgents.</p><p>GMO's Grantham argues the proliferation of regulations advantages large, established companies who wield more \"monopoly, political and brand power\", which has created a new \"stickiness\" in profits.</p><p>A new economics paper, Towards a Political Theory of the Firm, by University of Chicago professor Luigi Zingales, says the \"more firms have market power, the more they have both the ability and the need to gain political power\".</p><p>Born in Italy, Zingales witnessed first-hand the consequences of rampant nepotism and cronyism on the country's depressed economy.</p><p>Nobel Laureate Angus Deaton argues that much of the inequality problem in the US is due to rent-seeking from firms who obtain special protections and favours from government.</p><p>Bankers before the 2008 financial crisis and pharmaceutical firms are two prime examples, he says.</p><p>\"All that talent is devoted to stealing things, instead of making things,\" Deaton has said.</p><p>The opioid prescription drug epidemic in the US may be fuelled by pharmaceutical firms securing overly generous Medicaid funding for prescription drugs.</p><p>Australia might not be immune from a concentration of economic power.</p><p>The economy is dominated by oligopolies in banking, insurance, supermarkets, mining and telecommunications.</p><p>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission boss Rod Sims has warned of the risks of anti-competitive monopolies and pushed to strengthen laws covering misuse of market power. Repeated violations by Commonwealth Bank of Australia suggest it might be too big to manage effectively.</p><p>We should be wary of the concentration of business power and potential for crony capitalism.

I'm glad to see Lance Taylor taking on some pet ideas about inequality and low growth that have sadly gotten a following among policymakers. Or to put it another way, too many economists have been reluctant to take the most obvious cause of inequality seriously: that businesses-owners and the wealthy conducted a very successful class war against workers, particularly organized labor whose negotiations provided an anchor for both other blue collar and white collar wages and working conditions. BTW, I had the pleasure of meeting Lance Taylor last year. </p><p>He came to the meetup in Bailey Island, Maine. By Lynn Parramore, Senior Research Analyst at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website[1] In Lance Taylor's new book, Macroeconomic Inequality from Reagan to Trump[2], the noted economist examines how and why the United States, starting in the 80s, started to break down into a sharply divided country of haves and have-nots. How it happened is hotly debated among experts. Is it the lofty rate of return on wealth enjoyed by the affluent? Or the impact of monopolistic corporations that can charge high prices for basic goods and services? What about globalization? Technological change? Taylor, Emeritus Professor of Economics at the New School for Social Research, reveals what he sees as the insidious invisible hand that has been slipping into the pockets of ordinary people and stealing their chances for security and prosperity. This is not some natural process, he holds, but the outcome of deliberate choices and policies made by people who do not prioritize the wellbeing of most Americans. As a result, we are well on our way to constructing a society more unbalanced than what prevailed in the Gilded Age. In the following interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking[3], Taylor explains his approach to the problem of inequality and why the conclusions in his book stand in contrast to those of many of his colleagues. He issues a strong warning that misguided assumptions and methods of today's mainstream economics block us from confronting one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Lynn Parramore: In your new book, you name wage repression as the biggest driver of inequality in the U.S. over the last several decades. Your conclusion differs from many who have studied the issue, such as Thomas Piketty, who theorized that inequality is caused mainly by a tendency of profits to run ahead of the growth rate in the economy. What's different about your take? Lance Taylor: Piketty &amp;#38; Co. deserve a lot of credit for using tax and other data to estimate how income distribution differs across households over 200 years. The question is, what explains these differences? I wanted to analyze how income differences among various kinds of households (poor, middle class, and affluent) came about over time. That meant drilling down into macroeconomic indicators as well as the data associated with the various industries in which people worked and the streams of income they received from them. zlem mer and I assembled what we needed by reworking Congressional Budget Office data along the lines of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National Income Accounts. This allowed us to look at both macroeconomics and individual industries or sectors \u2014 16 in all. We studied changes in the structure of payments, employment, and output of products and services across these 16 sectors. What we found is that except in volatile and low-profit agriculture and mining sectors, real wages grew less rapidly than productivity since around the time of Reagan's presidency. Wage shares decreased, but profit shares increased at the industry and macro levels, and the money from those profits ended up in the pockets of business owners and the wealthy instead of being shared. For the most part, Americans workers have been working more productively, but they haven't been getting paid for it due to forces that aren't natural and inevitable. Wage repression doesn't just happen. It is apparent that something other than the market is at work here - like power relations, ideology about unemployment levels, and many innovations in business strategy, such as subcontracting. These are all feeding on and reinforcing processes within national political institutions that are more and more reflective only of business interests and concerns. LP: You've noted that mainstream economists have been getting the story on inequality wrong. Why is that? LT: Mainstream American PhD students are brainwashed into believing crazy economic theory. The history for 'new Keynesian' macroeconomics goes back to the 'Neoclassical synthesis' that economist Paul Samuelson and many of my former colleagues at MIT developed in the immediate postwar period. One can always hope that it will change. But here's the reality: insofar as the ideas of academics influence politics and policy formation, mainstream analysis today will not help in reducing economic inequality. Economists would refer to my approach to inequality as a post-Keynesian way of looking at the problem, because there is no obvious way you can explain the changes observed in terms of the kind of Neoclassical microeconomics that is typically taught today in economics departments - the framework of supply, demand, and games that ' optimizing agents' play around them. LP: Some point to monopolistic corporations, especially Big Tech, as key contributors to inequality. The idea is that companies with this kind of power can charge more for basic goods and services, for example, which hits ordinary folks hard. What's your view? LT: My research does not show Big Tech monopolies as a major part of the inequality story. Since 1970, the overall corporate profit share of U.S. national income has risen 8%. The corporate share of America's income as a nation is now around 46% \u2014 which is a huge number. Yet, the current share in income of profits in the information sector is just a bit more than 3%. Throw in parts of retail (Amazon) and you might get up to 5%. If this is Big Tech, the share of its profits in income is actually much less than the share of the real estate rental and leasing sector, which stands at 14%. When we analyzed profit share growth across sectors over time, we found that the big movers were actually manufacturing, wholesale, retail, finance-insurance, and information \u2014 in that order. So, the narrative of Big Tech as a principal driver of rising profits and inequality is just wrong. A very important part of the story is the spread of low wage across major parts of the whole economy. For example, seven low wage/low productivity sectors including education and health, accommodation and food, and business services saw their share in output between 1990 and 2016 fall from 48% to 41%. Meanwhile, their share of total employment rose from 47% to 61% with an essentially constant share of total wages (56%). In effect, the structure of production is being hollowed out, and the U.S. is becoming what many analysts are starting to refer to as a 'dual economy' \u2014 one with good wages for a minority of people who work in areas like finance or technology, and stagnant or falling wages for the majority who work in sectors such as retail with relatively high productivity growth but low wages. That pushes overall inequality way up. LP: Just how bad has inequality in the U.S. gotten in your view? LT: Things have become very alarming, and there are no quick fixes. To a large extent, rising corporate profits are transferred to the lucky few households in the top 1% of the income distribution through interest, dividends, and capital gains. Everybody else is stuck or falling behind. The extreme inequality we are witnessing today didn't develop overnight: It took five decades of steady growth in the overall profit share \u2014 adding up to a full 8% increase in that share, as I've noted \u2014 to land the economy in its present distributional mess. I've experimented with mathematical models of the economy in which I test out the effects of various policies that might help reduce inequality. The results are pretty sobering: even if the government enacted fairly aggressive policies to put money in people's pockets, it would probably take decades to get things back to what we had in the U.S. in the 1970s. At that time, things were far from perfect, but there was more balance in the economy. Unfortunately, mainstream economists do not learn post-Keynesian macroeconomics, so they may not see the full extent of how dire things have become. That was painfully obvious in Piketty's book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century. His famous explanation for inequality, which posits that it occurs when rates of return on capital are greater than growth in the real economy (and, by extension, growth in wages), is not really an explanation at all. It's actually just a statement of what happens if the economy simply grows at a constant rate, what in the jargon is called the 'steady state.' That assumption is also implicit in his recent book, Capital and Ideology. You can't hope to reverse trends in inequality until you figure out what is driving it. The problem of inequality is so urgent that it demands a whole new conceptual framework, which I have tried to offer in my book. LP: Your work suggests that this process of wage repression is not natural and inevitable. Who or what has been holding down wages and how are they doing it? How do class conflict, politics, and the role of the Fed and doctrines like the natural rate of employment play into this? LT: There are a lot institutional factors which have held wage increases below growth of productivity. One is macroeconomic austerity, both in practice and as an ideology pushed by those who take an anti-labor stance. Political conflict also plays a role. This is behind federal inaction on labor issues and the rise of state-level right-to-work laws. Employers also use divide-and-rule employment tactics in a 'fissuring' labor market - you see things like pitting regular full-time employees against contractors or gig economy workers. When employers insist on non-poaching and non-competition clauses in contracts, maintaining stagnant minimum wages (now gradually increasing), and maintaining a low ratio of employment to the population (rising prior to the pandemic), inequality results. Changes in trade and technology have also reduced labor's bargaining power - think of globalization and outsourcing. But note that most of the 16 sectors examined in the book are industries classified as 'non-traded.' The main exceptions are manufacturing, finance-insurance, information, mining, and agriculture. I have no doubt that import competition and outsourcing destroyed jobs in traded goods while contributing to onshore productivity. There is less foreign competition in wholesale and retail trade. Better inventory management and information processing pushed up productivity and generated low wage employment (think McDonald's, Walmart, Amazon). Economists, especially those at the Federal Reserve, used to talk a lot about the 'natural rate of employment' -the idea that the number of people working is somehow determined by the market and ought not to be interfered with. In reality, this is just is a disguised version of another idea dating to the turn of the 20th century \u2014 which strangely, after around 2015, took over the mainstream \u2014 of a supposed 'natural rate of interest.' This notion holds that there is a certain interest rate which will keep the economy at the ideal place between overheating and recession. Natural interest rate theory says that the rate will adjust to bring the demand for goods and services into equality with supply. Milton Friedman's old story relied on changes in prices, which empirically just don't happen, to bring the economy into equilibrium at full employment. The same story was baked into the mainstream Phillips curve analyses used by economists, which assumed that getting too close to full employment leads to overheating and inflation. LP: Why is wage repression detrimental to the overall economy? Some argue that raising wages will hurt us because we'll pay more to buy stuff if the cost of labor is passed on to the consumer. Or maybe businesses will freeze new hires or look to outsource labor to other countries. How do you respond? LT: While it's true that outsourcing has played a role in holding wages down when it comes to businesses involved in traded goods, this is likely to become less important as supply chains are shortened in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Some companies see the fallout of the pandemic and want to cut back on sourcing from other countries, and perhaps there will be some reshoring of jobs. On the question of higher prices, if higher wages outrun price inflation plus productivity growth, it's possible that you could see prices go up. But that has to happen if workers are to see their share of the national income recover from what has occurred in the last several decades. You have to keep in mind that wages still make up more than half of total cost of producing Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The fact that price inflation has been flat for almost four decades is strong evidence for generalized money and real wage repression. Really, that isn't a good thing for the economy in the long run. But before you get too worried about higher wages causing higher prices, consider that employers hire in response to the overall demand for goods and services in the economy. Households in the bottom half of the size distribution get about half their income from wages and the other half from government transfers - things like Medicaid, unemployment benefits, Social Security, and so on. They probably have negative saving rates, so higher wages for them could stimulate them to purchase more, which is good for the overall economy. More hiring and better-paying jobs could be the result. Legend has it that Henry Ford paid his workers well so that they could buy his cars, recognizing that wages and prices are not a zero-sum game. LP: Are you concerned that employers will use the pandemic as an excuse to repress wages? LT: Yes, but I hope that the pandemic will mobilize workers to pursue higher wages, even against the institutional barriers mentioned. LP: You observe that instead of a single, unified economy, America now has two separate economies, a 'dual economy.' What does this mean to someone newly entering the job market? How will working life look different? LT: Of course, race, class, and gender come into play here. The share of the labor force forced into low end jobs has been rising steadily. More and more people will be caught unless there is economic structural change involving producing sectors with relatively high employment having demand growth exceed productivity growth over a period of years. Big Tech will not suffice. There could be possibilities for health and retail in the Covid era, but laws and labor rules will have to change to realize them. LP: Your research suggests that it's not just low-wage workers who are impacted by the wage squeeze. How has the middle class been affected? LT: Middle class income still mostly depends on wages. People in the middle class have seen their share of national income squeezed from above by the higher income (mostly from profits) of the top 1%, and from below by bigger transfers to low income households. The squeeze has amounted to around 3% of total income - not trivial. Their position is slipping, making things like paying for college or retiring comfortably more and more difficult. LP: You note that another big factor in surging inequality is the benefits the rich have received from a rise in the prices of assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate, which produce capital gains. Who or what is behind this rise? Why is it a problem for people who aren't affluent? LT: This is a bit complicated, but let me try to explain. The story here has to do with both rising profits and interest rates and the decisions of the Fed. Say you have an asset - you have stock in a company. The value of your stock roughly depends on the flow of income it generates divided by what economists call the 'real' interest rate (adjusted to remove the effects of inflation). That is, the value is your stock's return 'capitalized' over time at the ruling interest rate. Economists talk about something called 'Tobin's q.' That is the ratio of company stock market valuations to the total value of their capital stock. The level of q economy-wide tracks pretty closely to the corporate profit rate (net of taxes, depreciation, and financial payments) capitalized by the real interest rate. Financial payments, that is to say, interest and dividends, from business to households amount to 11% of GDP. Almost half of these payment, 5%, are going to the top 1%. Why does such a large chunk of these payments go to the rich? People who own assets have enjoyed increasing rates of profits thanks to wage repression and low interest rates since the days of Alan Greenspan, who headed the Fed from 1987 to 2006. The Fed has held down rates with the explicit goal of supporting asset prices. In other words, the Fed gives the rich an extra boost on top of what they get from just rising profits due to wage repression. Capital gains, or annual increases in asset prices, do not figure in the BEA accounts because they are not an actual cost of production. They come off the top of what the enterprise makes. Capital gains are transfers of wealth from economic actors who issue liabilities to those who hold them. In the conventions of national and financial accounting as practiced by the BEA and the Fed, corporate shares are liabilities issued by business and (mostly) held by households. Any institutional sector's increase in wealth is equal to its net saving. The BEA data show that business net saving has fallen short of the sector's 'holding losses' on equity (Fed data) due to rising share prices since the mid-1980s. In plain English, more than 100% of net profits have been transferred via financial flows and capital gains to households, predominantly in the top 1%. Share repurchases are another, more recently popular vehicle for transferring business net worth to households. Let's repeat this point: Through various channels, including capital gains, more than 100% of business profits are getting transferred to households, predominantly in the top 1%. Depending on which source you look at, rich households today hold about 40% of total wealth. Given their access to profit income and high saving rates, my simulation model suggests that their wealth share might tend in the long run toward 60-70% \u2014 that's far higher than it was even during the Gilded Age. That level of inequality is detrimental to the entire economy. It certainly makes corporations more vulnerable to financial shocks, for example. LP: Some politicians, including presidential candidate Joe Biden, have expressed interest in raising taxes on capital gains so that wealthier people pay the same rate on this type of income as ordinary people pay on their wages and salaries. Would this be part of the solution? If not, what might work? LT: The only reason why capital gains are not taxed seriously is the political clout of the rich. They are zealous about protecting their offshore tax havens and 'carried interest' while resisting taxation of capital gains. Back in 1990, President George H. W. Bush (who with his class background certainly represented the well-to-do) was forced into agreeing to tax increases, with a 'high' rate of 28% on capital gains. Bush was pilloried by Republicans for reversing his 'read my lips' pledge not to raise taxes. Since then there has been no serious proposal, even though realized gains are visible and relatively easy to tax. The top rate now in the U.S. is 20% on realized gains from assets held more than a year. In contrast, a poor person may be 'taxed' at a 30% rate in terms of reduced benefits if she earns some extra money. Clearly this is unfair and helps to cement inequality. So what can be done? Confronting the outsized power of capital in the U.S. requires bolder thinking than what you generally hear discussed in the political arena. My model simulations show how a 50% tax on gains with proceeds transferred to a wealth fund managed for public purposes could hold the wealth share of the top one percent to around 40%. That would be one approach to the problem. Similar proposals to help balance the power of workers with those of shareholders within companies date back at least to a plan proposed by Swedish labor back in the mid-1970s, known as the Meidner Plan[4], which almost succeeded in being implemented.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/09/americas-dire-inequality-demands-a-new-conceptual-framework-this-economist-has-one.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;#38;utm_medium=feed&amp;#38;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/09/americas-dire-inequality-demands-a-new-conceptual-framework-this-economist-has-one.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;#38;utm_medium=feed&amp;#38;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[5], Economic fundamentals[6], Free markets and their discontents[7], Guest Post[8], Income disparity[9], Politics[10], Regulations and regulators[11], Social policy[12], The destruction of the middle class[13], The dismal science[14] on September 11, 2020[15] by Yves Smith[16].

I\u2019m glad to see Lance Taylor taking on some pet ideas about inequality and low growth that have sadly gotten a following among policymakers. Or to put it another way, too many economists have been reluctant to take the most obvious cause of inequality seriously: that businesses-owners and the wealthy conducted a very successful class war against workers, particularly organized labor whose negotiations provided an anchor for both other blue collar and white collar wages and working conditions.    BTW, I had the pleasure of meeting Lance Taylor last year. He came to the meetup in Bailey Island, Maine.    By Lynn Parramore, Senior Research Analyst at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website    In Lance Taylor\u2019s new book, Macroeconomic Inequality from Reagan to Trump , the noted economist examines how and why the United States, starting in the 80s, started to break down into a sharply divided country of haves and have-nots.    How it happened is hotly debated among experts. Is it the lofty rate of return on wealth enjoyed by the affluent? Or the impact of monopolistic corporations that can charge high prices for basic goods and services? What about globalization? Technological change?    Taylor, Emeritus Professor of Economics at the New School for Social Research, reveals what he sees as the insidious invisible hand that has been slipping into the pockets of ordinary people and stealing their chances for security and prosperity. This is not some natural process, he holds, but the outcome of deliberate choices and policies made by people who do not prioritize the wellbeing of most Americans. As a result, we are well on our way to constructing a society more unbalanced than what prevailed in the Gilded Age.    In the following interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking , Taylor explains his approach to the problem of inequality and why the conclusions in his book stand in contrast to those of many of his colleagues. He issues a strong warning that misguided assumptions and methods of today\u2019s mainstream economics block us from confronting one of the most pressing challenges of our time.    Lynn Parramore: In your new book, you name wage repression as the biggest driver of inequality in the U.S. over the last several decades. Your conclusion differs from many who have studied the issue, such as Thomas Piketty, who theorized that inequality is caused mainly by a tendency of profits to run ahead of the growth rate in the economy. What\u2019s different about your take?    Lance Taylor: Piketty &amp; Co. deserve a lot of credit for using tax and other data to estimate how income distribution differs across households over 200 years. The question is, what explains these differences?    I wanted to analyze how income differences among various kinds of households (poor, middle class, and affluent) came about over time. That meant drilling down into macroeconomic indicators as well as the data associated with the various industries in which people worked and the streams of income they received from them.    \u00d6zlem \u00d6mer and I assembled what we needed by reworking Congressional Budget Office data along the lines of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National Income Accounts. This allowed us to look at both macroeconomics and individual industries or sectors \u2014 16 in all.    We studied changes in the structure of payments, employment, and output of products and services across these 16 sectors. What we found is that except in volatile and low-profit agriculture and mining sectors, real wages grew less rapidly than productivity since around the time of Reagan\u2019s presidency. Wage shares decreased, but profit shares increased at the industry and macro levels, and the money from those profits ended up in the pockets of business owners and the wealthy instead of being shared.    For the most part, Americans workers have been working more productively, but they haven\u2019t been getting paid for it due to forces that aren\u2019t natural and inevitable. Wage repression doesn\u2019t just happen.    It is apparent that something other than the market is at work here \u2013 like power relations, ideology about unemployment levels, and many innovations in business strategy, such as subcontracting. These are all feeding on and reinforcing processes within national political institutions that are more and more reflective only of business interests and concerns.    LP: You\u2019ve noted that mainstream economists have been getting the story on inequality wrong. Why is that?    LT: Mainstream American PhD students are brainwashed into believing crazy economic theory.    The history for \u201cnew Keynesian\u201d macroeconomics goes back to the \u201cNeoclassical synthesis\u201d that economist Paul Samuelson and many of my former colleagues at MIT developed in the immediate postwar period. One can always hope that it will change. But here\u2019s the reality: insofar as the ideas of academics influence politics and policy formation, mainstream analysis today will not help in reducing economic inequality.    Economists would refer to my approach to inequality as a post-Keynesian way of looking at the problem, because there is no obvious way you can explain the changes observed in terms of the kind of Neoclassical microeconomics that is typically taught today in economics departments \u2013 the framework of supply, demand, and games that \u201c optimizing agents\u201d play around them.    LP: Some point to monopolistic corporations, especially Big Tech, as key contributors to inequality. The idea is that companies with this kind of power can charge more for basic goods and services, for example, which hits ordinary folks hard. What\u2019s your view?    LT: My research does not show Big Tech monopolies as a major part of the inequality story.    Since 1970, the overall corporate profit share of U.S. national income has risen 8%. The corporate share of America\u2019s income as a nation is now around 46% \u2014 which is a huge number. Yet, the current share in income of profits in the information sector is just a bit more than 3%. Throw in parts of retail (Amazon) and you might get up to 5%. If this is Big Tech, the share of its profits in income is actually much less than the share of the real estate rental and leasing sector, which stands at 14%.    When we analyzed profit share growth across sectors over time, we found that the big movers were actually manufacturing, wholesale, retail, finance-insurance, and information \u2014 in that order. So, the narrative of Big Tech as a principal driver of rising profits and inequality is just wrong.    A very important part of the story is the spread of low wage across major parts of the whole economy. For example, seven low wage/low productivity sectors including education and health, accommodation and food, and business services saw their share in output between 1990 and 2016 fall from 48% to 41%. Meanwhile, their share of total employment rose from 47% to 61% with an essentially constant share of total wages (56%).    In effect, the structure of production is being hollowed out, and the U.S. is becoming what many analysts are starting to refer to as a \u201cdual economy\u201d \u2014 one with good wages for a minority of people who work in areas like finance or technology, and stagnant or falling wages for the majority who work in sectors such as retail with relatively high productivity growth but low wages. That pushes overall inequality way up.    LP: Just how bad has inequality in the U.S. gotten in your view?    LT: Things have become very alarming, and there are no quick fixes.    To a large extent, rising corporate profits are transferred to the lucky few households in the top 1% of the income distribution through interest, dividends, and capital gains. Everybody else is stuck or falling behind.    The extreme inequality we are witnessing today didn\u2019t develop overnight: It took five decades of steady growth in the overall profit share \u2014 adding up to a full 8% increase in that share, as I\u2019ve noted \u2014 to land the economy in its present distributional mess.    I\u2019ve experimented with mathematical models of the economy in which I test out the effects of various policies that might help reduce inequality. The results are pretty sobering: even if the government enacted fairly aggressive policies to put money in people\u2019s pockets, it would probably take decades to get things back to what we had in the U.S. in the 1970s. At that time, things were far from perfect, but there was more balance in the economy.    Unfortunately, mainstream economists do not learn post-Keynesian macroeconomics, so they may not see the full extent of how dire things have become. That was painfully obvious in Piketty\u2019s book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century . His famous explanation for inequality, which posits that it occurs when rates of return on capital are greater than growth in the real economy (and, by extension, growth in wages), is not really an explanation at all. It\u2019s actually just a statement of what happens if the economy simply grows at a constant rate, what in the jargon is called the \u201csteady state.\u201d That assumption is also implicit in his recent book, Capital and Ideology . You can\u2019t hope to reverse trends in inequality until you figure out what is driving it.    The problem of inequality is so urgent that it demands a whole new conceptual framework, which I have tried to offer in my book.    LP: Your work suggests that this process of wage repression is not natural and inevitable. Who or what has been holding down wages and how are they doing it? How do class conflict, politics, and the role of the Fed and doctrines like the natural rate of employment play into this?    LT: There are a lot institutional factors which have held wage increases below growth of productivity.    One is macroeconomic austerity, both in practice and as an ideology pushed by those who take an anti-labor stance. Political conflict also plays a role. This is behind federal inaction on labor issues and the rise of state-level right-to-work laws.    Employers also use divide-and-rule employment tactics in a \u201cfissuring\u201d labor market \u2013 you see things like pitting regular full-time employees against contractors or gig economy workers. When employers insist on non-poaching and non-competition clauses in contracts, maintaining stagnant minimum wages (now gradually increasing), and maintaining a low ratio of employment to the population (rising prior to the pandemic), inequality results.    Changes in trade and technology have also reduced labor\u2019s bargaining power \u2013 think of globalization and outsourcing. But note that most of the 16 sectors examined in the book are industries classified as \u201cnon-traded.\u201d The main exceptions are manufacturing, finance-insurance, information, mining, and agriculture. I have no doubt that import competition and outsourcing destroyed jobs in traded goods while contributing to onshore productivity. There is less foreign competition in wholesale and retail trade. Better inventory management and information processing pushed up productivity and generated low wage employment (think McDonald\u2019s, Walmart, Amazon).    Economists, especially those at the Federal Reserve, used to talk a lot about the \u201cnatural rate of employment\u201d \u2013the idea that the number of people working is somehow determined by the market and ought not to be interfered with. In reality, this is just is a disguised version of another idea dating to the turn of the 20th century \u2014 which strangely, after around 2015, took over the mainstream \u2014 of a supposed \u201cnatural rate of interest.\u201d    This notion holds that there is a certain interest rate which will keep the economy at the ideal place between overheating and recession. Natural interest rate theory says that the rate will adjust to bring the demand for goods and services into equality with supply. Milton Friedman\u2019s old story relied on changes in prices, which empirically just don\u2019t happen, to bring the economy into equilibrium at full employment. The same story was baked into the mainstream Phillips curve analyses used by economists, which assumed that getting too close to full employment leads to overheating and inflation.    LP: Why is wage repression detrimental to the overall economy? Some argue that raising wages will hurt us because we\u2019ll pay more to buy stuff if the cost of labor is passed on to the consumer. Or maybe businesses will freeze new hires or look to outsource labor to other countries. How do you respond?    LT: While it\u2019s true that outsourcing has played a role in holding wages down when it comes to businesses involved in traded goods, this is likely to become less important as supply chains are shortened in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Some companies see the fallout of the pandemic and want to cut back on sourcing from other countries, and perhaps there will be some reshoring of jobs.    On the question of higher prices, if higher wages outrun price inflation plus productivity growth, it\u2019s possible that you could see prices go up. But that has to happen if workers are to see their share of the national income recover from what has occurred in the last several decades. You have to keep in mind that wages still make up more than half of total cost of producing Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The fact that price inflation has been flat for almost four decades is strong evidence for generalized money and real wage repression. Really, that isn\u2019t a good thing for the economy in the long run.    But before you get too worried about higher wages causing higher prices, consider that employers hire in response to the overall demand for goods and services in the economy. Households in the bottom half of the size distribution get about half their income from wages and the other half from government transfers \u2013 things like Medicaid, unemployment benefits, Social Security, and so on. They probably have negative saving rates, so higher wages for them could stimulate them to purchase more, which is good for the overall economy. More hiring and better-paying jobs could be the result.    Legend has it that Henry Ford paid his workers well so that they could buy his cars, recognizing that wages and prices are not a zero-sum game.    LP: Are you concerned that employers will use the pandemic as an excuse to repress wages?    LT: Yes, but I hope that the pandemic will mobilize workers to pursue higher wages, even against the institutional barriers mentioned.    LP: You observe that instead of a single, unified economy, America now has two separate economies, a \u201cdual economy.\u201d What does this mean to someone newly entering the job market? How will working life look different?    LT: Of course, race, class, and gender come into play here. The share of the labor force forced into low end jobs has been rising steadily. More and more people will be caught unless there is economic structural change involving producing sectors with relatively high employment having demand growth exceed productivity growth over a period of years. Big Tech will not suffice.    There could be possibilities for health and retail in the Covid era, but laws and labor rules will have to change to realize them.    LP: Your research suggests that it\u2019s not just low-wage workers who are impacted by the wage squeeze. How has the middle class been affected?    LT: Middle class income still mostly depends on wages. People in the middle class have seen their share of national income squeezed from above by the higher income (mostly from profits) of the top 1%, and from below by bigger transfers to low income households. The squeeze has amounted to around 3% of total income \u2013 not trivial. Their position is slipping, making things like paying for college or retiring comfortably more and more difficult.    LP: You note that another big factor in surging inequality is the benefits the rich have received from a rise in the prices of assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate, which produce capital gains. Who or what is behind this rise? Why is it a problem for people who aren\u2019t affluent?    LT: This is a bit complicated, but let me try to explain. The story here has to do with both rising profits and interest rates and the decisions of the Fed.    Say you have an asset \u2013 you have stock in a company. The value of your stock roughly depends on the flow of income it generates divided by what economists call the \u201creal\u201d interest rate (adjusted to remove the effects of inflation). That is, the value is your stock\u2019s return \u201ccapitalized\u201d over time at the ruling interest rate.    Economists talk about something called \u201cTobin\u2019s q.\u201d That is the ratio of company stock market valuations to the total value of their capital stock. The level of q economy-wide tracks pretty closely to the corporate profit rate (net of taxes, depreciation, and financial payments) capitalized by the real interest rate. Financial payments, that is to say, interest and dividends, from business to households amount to 11% of GDP. Almost half of these payment, 5%, are going to the top 1%.    Why does such a large chunk of these payments go to the rich? People who own assets have enjoyed increasing rates of profits thanks to wage repression and low interest rates since the days of Alan Greenspan, who headed the Fed from 1987 to 2006. The Fed has held down rates with the explicit goal of supporting asset prices. In other words, the Fed gives the rich an extra boost on top of what they get from just rising profits due to wage repression.    Capital gains, or annual increases in asset prices, do not figure in the BEA accounts because they are not an actual cost of production. They come off the top of what the enterprise makes. Capital gains are transfers of wealth from economic actors who issue liabilities to those who hold them. In the conventions of national and financial accounting as practiced by the BEA and the Fed, corporate shares are liabilities issued by business and (mostly) held by households.    Any institutional sector\u2019s increase in wealth is equal to its net saving. The BEA data show that business net saving has fallen short of the sector\u2019s \u201cholding losses\u201d on equity (Fed data) due to rising share prices since the mid-1980s.    In plain English, more than 100% of net profits have been transferred via financial flows and capital gains to households, predominantly in the top 1%. Share repurchases are another, more recently popular vehicle for transferring business net worth to households.    Let\u2019s repeat this point: Through various channels, including capital gains, more than 100% of business profits are getting transferred to households, predominantly in the top 1%. Depending on which source you look at, rich households today hold about 40% of total wealth. Given their access to profit income and high saving rates, my simulation model suggests that their wealth share might tend in the long run toward 60-70% \u2014 that\u2019s far higher than it was even during the Gilded Age.    That level of inequality is detrimental to the entire economy. It certainly makes corporations more vulnerable to financial shocks, for example.    LP: Some politicians, including presidential candidate Joe Biden, have expressed interest in raising taxes on capital gains so that wealthier people pay the same rate on this type of income as ordinary people pay on their wages and salaries. Would this be part of the solution? If not, what might work?    LT: The only reason why capital gains are not taxed seriously is the political clout of the rich. They are zealous about protecting their offshore tax havens and \u201ccarried interest\u201d while resisting taxation of capital gains.    Back in 1990, President George H. W. Bush (who with his class background certainly represented the well-to-do) was forced into agreeing to tax increases, with a \u201chigh\u201d rate of 28% on capital gains. Bush was pilloried by Republicans for reversing his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to raise taxes. Since then there has been no serious proposal, even though realized gains are visible and relatively easy to tax.    The top rate now in the U.S. is 20% on realized gains from assets held more than a year. In contrast, a poor person may be \u201ctaxed\u201d at a 30% rate in terms of reduced benefits if she earns some extra money. Clearly this is unfair and helps to cement inequality.    So what can be done? Confronting the outsized power of capital in the U.S. requires bolder thinking than what you generally hear discussed in the political arena. My model simulations show how a 50% tax on gains with proceeds transferred to a wealth fund managed for public purposes could hold the wealth share of the top one percent to around 40%. That would be one approach to the problem. Similar proposals to help balance the power of workers with those of shareholders within companies date back at least to a plan proposed by Swedish labor back in the mid-1970s, known as the Meidner Plan , which almost succeeded in being implemented.

There has been success already at both Google and Amazon, and their insider perspective gives them greater ability to drive change internally.</emphasis>Tech giants have amassed enormous power in the last couple of decades, as the value of data has increased exponentially. The top give companies by market capitalisation are all tech companies - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>/ <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>, known as the GAFAM - and this has made it difficult to rein them in. Traditional counterweights, such as customers, regulators and shareholders still have their role, but they have found it difficult, leading to a new type of stakeholder gaining in importance: the companies' own employees.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"320\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> GAFAM On Top </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Market Capitalisation (USDbn), July 2018</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file20921afM4A5ykD\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Nasdaq </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Before discussing the increasing importance of employees, it is worth highlighting why the more traditional counterweights have failed when it comes to tech companies  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Customers</emphasis> remain the most important thing for a company to have, but they have their relative strength when it comes to tech. This is not only because many services are free, with the business model geared towards data, but because of network effects, when tech companies grow in size at a very rapid pace, and become essential for customers, making it very difficult for them to leave. The example of Facebook and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cambridge Analytica</emphasis> highlights that conundrum;  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shareholders</emphasis> have the power of oversight, and they continue, as with Apple looking to fight tech addiction with iOS 12, but again their power has decreased. This is because of the incredible returns these companies have given shareholders, making it more difficult to complain about strategies, but also because some tech companies have changed their governance to ensure one or two people, in many cases the founder, retain the majority of voting rights. This is the case with Google and Facebook, for instance;  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regulators</emphasis> have their role to play, but the pace of technological development means they are always behind the curve. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU is a case in point. While it is a necessary piece of legislation, it has come very late in the day, not only because it has taken almost 10 years to find agreement from start to finish. The next focus should be on artificial intelligence (AI), but it is likely that regulators will only legislate after the fact. Employees can therefore make a bigger impact on a company's strategy, because of how these tech companies are looking to position themselves publicly as forces for good, and we have already seen a series of examples following that trend:  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>: pressure from its employees led the company to not renew its AI contract with the US Defense Department, as well as publishing its seven core principles with regards to AI;  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>: pressure from its employees led the company to end its contract with the US' Orlando Police Department regarding facial recognition software;  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>: no impact so far, but there has been employees' pressure regarding its contract with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency in the US;  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Salesforce</emphasis>: no impact so far, but there has been employees' pressure regarding its contract with the US Customs and Border Protection agency. These four examples show that employees will not always get their way, but they will offer a different kind of pressure than either customers, shareholders or regulators, because of their insider perspective and their ability to drive change from within the company. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1378212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SPP-SJY1-JD33-J29K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Business Monitor International Ltd.

This simple truth, he argues, is the problem with those who believe US stock prices have become detached from reality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Annual economic growth and stock prices have only had a correlation coefficient of .09 from 1930 through to 2019, a stat Mr Miller quotes to make his point that investors pay for what they think a company can make in the future, not how it is doing now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The question investors should be asking is whether the optimism is well placed. Since Mr Miller published his letter, rising Covid-19 death tolls in America's sunbelt have given cause to doubt a V-shaped economic recovery and the rapidly approaching elections bring more uncertainty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bulls can point to some impressive recent earnings beats by the likes of Microsoft (US:MSFT) and Tesla (US:TSLA), a stalwart of quality growth and poster child of speculative growth investing strategies, respectively.</p><p>Then there is the ultra-dovish Federal Reserve, creating hundreds of billions of dollars to puff up asset prices and sign-posting that it has no intention of raising interest rates for years.</p><p>As Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital put it in his second-quarter note (written before the sunbelt Covid-19 spike): \"With the outlook now positive, investors likely concluded that they no longer needed to insist on the generous risk premiums afforded by low entry prices, meaning purchase prices could rise.\"</p><p>                     The trouble with the market's assumptions                   </p><p>Framing the discussion another way, the market hasn't necessarily lost touch with reality, rather that reality is now driven by falling discount rates and not fundamentals. Yet companies must still deliver earnings growth and the market is placing extreme expectations on a few quality businesses.</p><p>Citing a report by Empirical Research on the phenomenon of the \"Big Grower\", David M Poppe of Giverny Capital weighs in with his assessment of market rationality.</p><p>Based on Goldman Sachs' expectations that S&amp;P 500 earnings will decline 24 per cent in 2020 and recover 31 per cent in the next year, Mr Poppe concedes that - so long as 2021 earnings rebound to 2019 levels as implied - it's not obvious the market is wrong.</p><p>Empirical Research shows, however, that even amongst companies expected to grow revenues, there is great dependence on a concentrated few to increase earnings.</p><p>Their study identified 75 stocks with exceptional revenue and share price momentum. The combined market cap approached $7 trillion and the group traded on 71 times forward earnings estimates. That's a long multiple but subtract the largest companies and the bet on profits growth is even starker.</p><p>Microsoft and Apple (US:AAPL) weren't in the 75, but Amazon (US:AMZN), Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Facebook (US:FB.) were. Take them out and the remaining 72 (market cap $4 trillion) are nowhere near as supported by trailing earnings and free cash flow, with 22 of the growers losing money.</p><p>The market, writes Mr Poppe, seems to say that today's earnings don't matter because the future trajectory is so clear. The median company on the Empirical Research list has generated 30 per cent annual revenue growth over the past five years and the pandemic has amplified investor interest in businesses that cater to working, shopping and playing at home.</p><p>Changes in the way people live may well be accelerated thanks to Covid-19, but the mathematics for investors is still daunting. Empirical says Wall Street analysts expect median Big Grower earnings to grow at a compound annualised rate of 22 per cent over five years, and 13 per cent over 10 years.</p><p>To put that in perspective, Mr Poppe highlights that over the past 60 years about 30 per cent of the 75 fastest growers in any given year achieved at least 13 per cent earnings growth for the following decade. Yet the market is saying the next ten years will see half of companies achieve this.</p><p>In only one decade, the 1960s, have half of the 75 fastest growers maintained over 13 per cent a year and that was when US gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a real rate of 5 per cent. In the 2020s, Mr Poppe writes, US GDP may not grow half as fast.</p><p>                     But don't fight the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6                   </p><p>The one overarching rational force behind the second-quarter rally was the sheer scale of money creation by the Fed, which has signalled it will not step back from supporting bond markets, both in US Treasuries and credit. Inevitably, with yields suppressed, money is finding its way into equity markets, keeping share prices sky-high.</p><p>Ensuring the functioning of the financial system is the Fed's core remit and it speaks volumes that America's central bank is seeming to settle for avoiding systemic collapse over markets that allocate capital efficiently.</p><p>Mr Marks writes: \"\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there's no reason to believe the Fed insists on good value, high prospective returns, strong creditworthiness to protect it from possible defaults, or adequate risk premiums.</p><p>Rather, its goal seems to be to keep the markets liquid and capital flowing freely to companies that need it. This orientation suggests it has no aversion to prices that overstate financial reality.\"</p><p>Really, Fed Chair Jay Powell and the rest of the open markets committee who set monetary policy, have an impossible task. Coronavirus is a black swan event that has strangled the cash flows of otherwise well-run businesses. Without access to the Fed's refinancing facilities they would be going to the wall in greater numbers.</p><p>Bad companies whose interest costs would have exceeded cash profits anyway are kept alive too, which is an unhealthy consequence of the emergency measures. \"Zombie companies (debt service &gt; Ebitda) and moral hazard don't appear to trouble the Fed,\" writes Mr Marks.</p><p>Although this assessment is harsh, he is right that indiscriminate support will be bad for the economy if continued indefinitely.</p><p>Textbook economics explains the effectiveness of monetary policy even as the real economy struggled in the second quarter. Unlike in 2008-09 when it took the Fed a while to marshal enough firepower to end the financial crisis, Mr Miller says the immediate and overwhelming response this time brought the equation of exchange into play.</p><p>Money supply multiplied by the velocity with which it is spent is equal to the price times the quantity of goods sold: MV=PQ is the equation. \"The pandemic and economic shutdown led to a collapse in money velocity as there was little to spend money on with so many businesses closed,\" explains Mr Miller.</p><p>\"Other things equal, P or Q or both would then collapse with velocity. PQ is equivalent to nominal GDP. So the Fed responded by expanding the money supply, at a record pace.\"</p><p>\"Some of that money is making its way into the real economy and the data indicate economic activity bottomed in the second quarter and things are improving. It also made its way into the markets, helping to lift stocks.\"</p><p>                     Can the Fed keep propping up markets?                   </p><p>In its recent update, Epoch Investment Partners noted that the Fed's main concern is unemployment and highlighted that even with the gargantuan bond purchases made this year, the share of US government debt held by the central bank is still low as a proportion compared with peers.</p><p>Therefore, they argue, the Fed will see plenty of scope to keep expanding its asset purchase scheme with monetary policy likely to focus on yield curve control to manage the ballooning debt.</p><p>Although the Fed's willingness to expand its balance sheet is seemingly unlimited, Epoch points to evidence that the marginal effectiveness of this largesse is diminishing. Furthermore, they say, evidence from Europe and Japan points to an increase in debt hindering rather than boosting growth.</p><p>Longer term, it seems the impact of zombie companies is to crowd out better run businesses which, if week competition doesn't die, won't win the market share their superiority warrants. This means the economy is less creative, dynamic and full of too many sluggish performers which in turn acts as a drag on productivity and the velocity of money.</p><p>                     If we're witnessing the slowdown of big tech, where can investors look for positive returns?                    </p><p>Although the so-called 'Fed put' has seen stock prices rise, the longer-term outlook for GDP growth looks weak, which implies challenges for the 75 Big Growers in continuing to build revenues and deliver consistent profits growth to justify their valuation.</p><p>Growth investors have had a phenomenal run since 2009, but although the tech giants that have driven S&amp;P 500 earnings growth are still great businesses, their next leg up will be priced in. The reaction to Microsoft's full-year results was revealing. Although it delivered revenue and earnings beats, a fall in the rate of cloud user growth was enough to send its share price lower.</p><p>That shows how valuations of super quality shares are on a knife edge. Investors are nervy at any sign of future disappointment, good news is already priced in and even if all business indicators and financial results are as expected, just a slight uptick in inflation and interest rates will mean share prices have to fall to imply a fair real value for the company's future cash flows.</p><p>Value investing has been seriously out of vogue for many years - and the first half of 2020 has seen the style underperform spectacularly - but as Bill Gross explains in his 'The Real Deal' newsletter in July, value investors acknowledge the importance of real interest rates.</p><p>One reason Mr Gross offers for the erstwhile outperformance of growth stocks is that the price of dependable growth stocks is significantly influenced by a declining real interest rate. The market assumes Amazon or Microsoft will maintain a consistent future growth rate, so when the price of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (Tips) rises and their yield goes down, the value of these tech stars shoots up.</p><p>The plunge in long-term real interest rates has impacted the share price of Apple and Amazon significantly, says Mr Gross, but the effect has been much less for cyclical and value-oriented stocks because their expected growth rates have fallen too.</p><p>Has the low rate tailwind for quality stocks seen its best days? Mr Gross thinks so, and he points to the 10-year U.S. real rate, at minus 75 basis points, approaching the inflation-linked bond yields of Germany and Japan. He notes the only buyers for these securities are governments and regulated pension funds, \"which incredibly mandate their purchase for portfolios\".</p><p>Perhaps this last point presents the flaw in his argument, however. The presence of forced buyers suppresses yields and there is no forced buyer like the Fed, which as well as lubricating a financial system with an insatiable thirst for dollars, is also creating the money to lend to the U.S. government to fund its enormous fiscal support programmes for the economy.</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr Gross is right to highlight that investors should be looking at the fact of real interest rates as well as hoping for future earnings upgrade forecasts. In the absence of the latter, big tech's relative outperformance of lesser growth but still high quality stocks such as Coca Cola (US:KO) and Procter &amp; Gamble (US:PG), depends on continued trust in existing forecasts and ongoing decline in real rates.</p><p>Evidence that value investing tools should not be forgotten when assessing growth stocks - after all, what you pay for something matters - is found in Microsoft's past share price movements.</p><p>Described by Mr Gross as \"perhaps the most consistent growth stock of all\" in terms of its expected growth rate, he identifies Microsoft's share price as having a .854 r-squared correlation to the price of Tips securities in the past two years. When Tips prices go down (i.e. when real yields, that move inversely to price, go up), Microsoft goes down in the subsequent few days.</p><p>Correlation is not to be confused with causality though, and Mr Gross acknowledges higher growth, momentum and the effect of index funds have provided for a share of the appreciation. He estimates, however, that Tip rates dropping nearly 200 basis points in two years could account for half Microsoft's share price increase.</p><p>\"Would I bet the farm on this correlation in the future?\", he asks rhetorically, \"Well maybe 40 acres worth.\"</p><p>                     Taking the right risks                    </p><p>Overall, Mr. Gross prefers value stocks over the \"Fab Five\" tech stocks - Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon - but the companies he touts on his watchlist all have their own idiosyncratic risks.</p><p>He names oil &amp; gas pipeline services business Enterprise Products Partners (US:EPD); tobacco firm Altria Group (US:MO); computer business IBM (US:IBM), which is repositioning itself to compete in cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology; and pharmaceuticals company AbbVie (US:ABBV).</p><p>High-conviction value investing has been waiting what seems like an eternity to come good, however. Many have been burned trying to time a style rotation from growth to value stocks and it seems prudent to re-weight portfolios rather than totally exit positions in quality businesses.</p><p>Being out of the best tech stocks was the biggest opportunity cost for Distillate Capital, even though its investing strategy outperformed in the sharp market decline as well as in the recovery.</p><p>Being shy of exposure to Amazon's 49 per cent Q2 gain subtracted 1.7 per cent from Distallate's relative performance. Missing gains from Netflix (US: NFLX), Paypal (US:PYPL), semi-conductor business Nvidia (US:NVDA) and Microsoft cumulatively cost 1.6 per cent against benchmark.</p><p>Distillate's strategy might be loosely described as quality-value investing - it seeks to invest in the 100 most attractively valued stocks with high levels of long-term fundamental stability and low leverage. Star performers in the last quarter included Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (US:REGN) and software specialist Citrix Systems (US:CTXS), and they also did well from holdings in Procter &amp; Gamble and Abbvie.</p><p>Clearly, such a strategy isn't light on quality but there is no need to risk missing out if there is further upside for big tech. Giverny Capital's Mr Poppe says his fund owns six companies on the list of 75 Big Growers, three of which are Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>The other three are Mastercard (US:MA), computer communications business Arista Networks (US:ANET) and discount stores chain Five Below (US:FIVE). At the time of Mr Poppe's note, all of them were profitable and traded at less than 21 times analyst estimates of 2024 earnings.</p><p>Facebook's second-quarter earnings were published on 29 July and Alphabet's a day later, but at the time of Mr Poppe's letter they traded on 13 times their 2024 earnings estimates. Of course, both are vulnerable to a downturn in ad spend and in a US election year, Facebook in particular is subject to scrutiny and high costs of moderating content, but Mr Poppe's hope was that in aggregate his six growers would need two or three years to become reasonably priced, not ten.</p><p>The elephant in the room (or will that be the Democrat donkey after November) is, of course, the rising cases of coronavirus in America's western and southern states. Along with everyone else, money managers have taken up armchair virology and despite some convincing arguments that the disease break point may be lower than the threshold required for herd immunity, nobody really knows - and the recent data on cases and deaths is heading in the wrong direction.</p><p>Unfortunately, this has been the most politicised pandemic in history and the narrative around the disease is hugely damaging to the economy even if the medical situation is manageable. Then there is the ongoing geopolitical risk as America's relations with China worsen.</p><p>Until the election, it may be that the momentum trade is no longer stocks but continues to be gold. Unlike the professional money managers who are expected to be invested, retail investors might also want to keep some powder dry and hold more cash. Despite the need for caution, however, the breadth of quality companies on offer means it doesn't pay to be out of US stocks entirely.</p><p>As far as a US equities strategy is concerned, the way forward is perhaps to invest away from market capitalisation weighting so the focus isn't too skewed to the most expensive companies. In other words, don't ditch tech but underweight it to benchmark and increase the weight of value approaches but consider quality safeguards. Of course, that's easier said than done, but the task is less difficult with US shares compared to the UK market.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-64841832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-R701-F021-6223-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2799\"/><timeReceived>5:09 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

This simple truth, he argues, is the problem with those who believe US stock prices have become detached from reality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Annual economic growth and stock prices have only had a correlation coefficient of .09 from 1930 through to 2019, a stat Mr Miller quotes to make his point that investors pay for what they think a company can make in the future, not how it is doing now. The question investors should be asking is whether the optimism is well placed. Since Mr Miller published his letter, rising Covid-19 death tolls in America's sunbelt have given cause to doubt a V-shaped economic recovery, and the rapidly approaching elections bring more uncertainty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bulls can point to some impressive recent earnings beats by the likes of Microsoft (US:MSFT) and Tesla (US:TSLA), a stalwart of quality growth and poster child of speculative growth investing strategies, respectively. Then there is the ultra-dovish Federal Reserve, creating hundreds of billions of dollars to puffup asset prices and sign-posting that it has no intention of raising interest rates for years.</p><p>As Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital put it in his second quarter (Q2) note (written before the sunbelt Covid-19 spike): \"With the outlook now positive, investors likely concluded that they no longer needed to insist on the generous risk premiums afforded by low entry prices, meaning purchase prices could rise.\"</p><p>The trouble with the market's assumptions Framing the discussion another way, the market hasn't necessarily lost touch with reality, rather that reality is now driven by falling discount rates and not fundamentals. Yet companies must still deliver earnings growth and the market is placing extreme expectations on a few quality businesses.</p><p>Citing a report by Empirical Research on the phenomenon of the \"Big Grower\", David M Poppe of Giverny Capital weighs in with his assessment of market rationality.</p><p>Based on Goldman Sachs' expectations that S&amp;P 500 earnings will decline 24 per cent in 2020 and recover 31 per cent in the next year, Mr Poppe concedes that - so long as 2021 earnings rebound to 2019 levels as implied - it's not obvious the market is wrong.</p><p>Empirical Research shows, however, that even among companies expected to grow revenues, there is great dependence on a concentrated few to increase earnings.</p><p>Their study identified 75 stocks with exceptional revenue and share price momentum. The combined market cap approached $7 trillion and the group traded on 71 times forward earnings estimates. That's a long multiple, but subtract the largest companies and the bet on profits growth is even starker.</p><p>Microsoft and Apple (US:AAPL) weren't in the 75, but Amazon (US:AMZN), Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Facebook (US:FB.) were. Take them out and the remaining 72 (market cap $4 trillion) are nowhere near as supported by trailing earnings and free cash flow, with 22 of the growers losing money.</p><p>The market, writes Mr Poppe, seems to say that today's earnings don't matter because the future trajectory is so clear. The median company on the Empirical Research list has generated 30 per cent annual revenue growth over the past five years and the pandemic has amplified investor interest in businesses that cater to working, shopping and playing at home.</p><p>Changes in the way people live may well be accelerated thanks to Covid-19, but the mathematics for investors is still daunting. Empirical says Wall Street analysts expect median Big Grower earnings to grow at a compound annualised rate of 22 per cent over five years, and 13 per cent over 10 years.</p><p>To put that in perspective, Mr Poppe highlights that over the past 60 years about 30 per cent of the 75 fastest growers in any given year achieved at least 13 per cent earnings growth for the following decade. Yet the market is saying the next 10 years will see half of companies achieve this.</p><p>In only one decade, the 1960s, have half of the 75 fastest growers maintained over 13 per cent a year and that was when US gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a real rate of 5 per cent. In the 2020s, Mr Poppe writes, US GDP may not grow half as fast.</p><p>Can the Fed keep propping up markets? In its recent update, Epoch Investment Partners noted that the Fed's main concern is unemployment and highlighted that even with the gargantuan bond purchases made this year, the share of US government debt held by the central bank is still low as a proportion compared with peers.</p><p>Therefore, they argue, the Fed will see plenty of scope to keep expanding its asset purchase scheme with monetary policy likely to focus on yield curve control to manage the ballooning debt.</p><p>Although the Fed's willingness to expand its balance sheet is seemingly unlimited, Epoch points to evidence that the marginal effectiveness of this largesse is diminishing. Furthermore, they say, evidence from Europe and Japan points to an increase in debt hindering rather than boosting growth.</p><p>Longer term, it seems the impact of zombie companies is to crowd out better-run businesses which, if weak competition doesn't die, won't win the market share their superiority warrants. This means the economy is less creative, dynamic and full of too many sluggish performers, which in turn acts as a drag on productivity and the velocity of money.</p><p>Where can investors look for positive returns? Although the so-called 'Fed put' has seen stock prices rise, the longer-term outlook for GDP growth looks weak, which implies challenges for the 75 Big Growers in continuing to build revenues and deliver consistent profits growth to justify their valuation.</p><p>Growth investors have had a phenomenal run since 2009, but although the tech giants that have driven S&amp;P 500 earnings growth are still great businesses, their next leg up will be priced in. The reaction to Microsoft's full-year results was revealing. Although it delivered revenue and earnings beats, a fall in the rate of cloud user growth was enough to send its share price lower.</p><p>That shows how valuations of super quality shares are on a knife edge. Investors are nervy at any sign of future disappointment, good news is already priced in and even if all business indicators and financial results are as expected, just a slight uptick in inflation and interest rates will mean share prices have to fall to imply a fair real value for the company's future cash flows.</p><p>Value investing has been seriously out of vogue for many years - and the first half of 2020 has seen the style underperform spectacularly - but as Bill Gross explains in his 'The Real Deal' newsletter in July, value investors acknowledge the importance of real interest rates.</p><p>One reason Mr Gross offers for the erstwhile outperformance of growth stocks is that the price of dependable growth stocks is significantly influenced by a declining real interest rate. The market assumes Amazon or Microsoft will maintain a consistent future growth rate, so when the price of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (Tips) rises and their yield goes down, the value of these tech stars shoots up.</p><p>The plunge in long-term real interest rates has impacted the share price of Apple and Amazon significantly, says Mr Gross, but the effect has been much less for cyclical and value-oriented stocks because their expected growth rates have fallen too.</p><p>Don't fight the Fed\u2026 The one overarching rational force behind the Q2 rally was the sheer scale of money creation by the Fed, which has signalled it will not step back from supporting bond markets, both in US Treasuries and credit. Inevitably, with yields suppressed, money is finding its way into equity markets, keeping share prices sky-high.</p><p>Ensuring the functioning of the financial system is the Fed's core remit and it speaks volumes that America's central bank is seeming to settle for avoiding systemic collapse over markets that allocate capital efficiently.</p><p>Mr Marks writes: \"\u2026there's no reason to believe the Fed insists on good value, high prospective returns, strong creditworthiness to protect it from possible defaults, or adequate risk premiums. Rather, its goal seems to be to keep the markets liquid and capital flowing freely to companies that need it. This orientation suggests it has no aversion to prices that overstate financial reality.\"</p><p>Really, Fed Chair Jay Powell and the rest of the open markets committee who set monetary policy, have an impossible task. Coronavirus is a black swan event that has strangled the cash flows of otherwise well-run businesses. Without access to the Fed's refinancing facilities they would be going to the wall in greater numbers.</p><p>Bad companies whose interest costs would have exceeded cash profits anyway are kept alive too, which is an unhealthy consequence of the emergency measures. \"Zombie companies (debt service &gt; Ebitda) and moral hazard don't appear to trouble the Fed,\" writes Mr Marks.</p><p>Although this assessment is harsh, he is right that indiscriminate support will be bad for the economy if continued indefinitely.</p><p>Textbook economics explains the effectiveness of monetary policy even as the real economy struggled in the second quarter. Unlike in 2008-09 when it took the Fed a while to marshal enough firepower to end the financial crisis, Mr Miller says the immediate and overwhelming response this time brought the equation of exchange into play.</p><p>Money supply multiplied by the velocity with which it is spent is equal to the price times the quantity of goods sold: MV=PQ is the equation. \"The pandemic and economic shutdown led to a collapse in money velocity as there was little to spend money on with so many businesses closed,\" explains Mr Miller.</p><p>\"Other things equal, P or Q or both would then collapse with velocity. PQ is equivalent to nominal GDP. So the Fed responded by expanding the money supply, at a record pace.\"</p><p>\"Some of that money is making its way into the real economy and the data indicate economic activity bottomed in the second quarter and things are improving. It also made its way into the markets, helping to lift stocks.\"</p><p>Has the low rate tailwind for quality stocks seen its best days? Mr Gross thinks so, and he points to the 10-year US real rate, at minus 75 basis points, approaching the inflation-linked bond yields of Germany and Japan. He notes the only buyers for these securities are governments and regulated pension funds, \"which incredibly mandate their purchase for portfolios\".</p><p>Perhaps this last point presents the flaw in his argument, however. The presence of forced buyers suppresses yields and there is no forced buyer like the Fed, which as well as lubricating a financial system with an insatiable thirst for dollars, is also creating the money to lend to the US government to fund its enormous fiscal support programmes for the economy.</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr Gross is right to highlight that investors should be looking at the fact of real interest rates as well as hoping for future earnings upgrade forecasts. In the absence of the latter, big tech's relative outperformance of lesser growth, but still high-quality stocks such as Coca Cola (US:KO) and Procter &amp; Gamble (US:PG), depends on continued trust in existing forecasts and ongoing decline in real rates.</p><p>Evidence that value investing tools should not be forgotten when assessing growth stocks - after all, what you pay for something matters - is found in Microsoft's past share price movements. Described by Mr Gross as \"perhaps the most consistent growth stock of all\" in terms of its expected growth rate, he identifies Microsoft's share price as having a .854 r-squared correlation to the price of Tips securities in the past two years. When Tips prices go down (ie when real yields, that move inversely to price, go up), Microsoft goes down in the subsequent few days.</p><p>Correlation is not to be confused with causality, though, and Mr Gross acknowledges higher growth, momentum and the effect of index funds have provided for a share of the appreciation. He estimates, however, that Tips rates dropping nearly 200 basis points in two years could account for half Microsoft's share price increase.</p><p>\"WouldIbetthefarmonthiscorrelationinthefuture?\", he asks rhetorically, \"Well maybe 40 acres-worth.\"</p><p>Taking the right risks Overall, Mr Gross prefers value stocks over the \"Fab Five\" tech stocks - Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon - but the companies he touts on his watchlist all have their own idiosyncratic risks.</p><p>He names oil &amp; gas pipeline services business Enterprise Products Partners (US:EPD); tobacco firm Altria Group (US:MO); computer business IBM (US:IBM), which is repositioning itself to compete in cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology, and pharmaceuticals company AbbVie (US:ABBV).</p><p>High-conviction value investing has been waiting what seems like an eternity to come good, however. Many have got burned trying to time a style rotation from growth to value and it seems prudent to re-weight portfolios rather than totally exit positions in quality businesses.</p><p>Being out of the best tech stocks was the biggest opportunity cost for Distillate Capital, even though its investing strategy outperformed in the sharp market decline as well as in the recovery.</p><p>Being shy of exposure to Amazon's 49 per cent Q2 gain subtracted 1.7 per cent from Distallate's relative performance. Missing gains from Netflix (US:NFLX), Paypal (US:PYPL), semi-conductor business Nvidia (US:NVDA) and Microsoft cumulatively cost 1.6 per cent against benchmark.</p><p>Distillate's strategy might be loosely described as quality-value investing - it seeks to invest in the 100 most attractively valued stocks with high levels of long-term fundamental stability and low leverage. Star performers in the last quarter included Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (US:REGN) and software specialist Citrix Systems (US:CTXS), and they also did well from holdings in Procter &amp; Gamble and Abbvie.</p><p>Clearly, such a strategy isn't light on quality, but there is no need to risk missing out if there is further upside for big tech. Giverny Capital's Mr Poppe says his fund owns six companies on the list of 75 Big Growers, three of which are Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon. The other three are Mastercard (US:MA), computer communications business Arista Networks (US:ANET) and discount stores chain Five Below (US:FIVE). At the time of Mr Poppe's note, all of them were profitable and traded at less than 21 times analyst estimates of 2024 earnings.</p><p>Facebook's second-quarter earnings will have been published on 29 July and Alphabet's a day later, but at the time of Mr Poppe's letter they traded on 13 times their 2024 earnings estimates. Of course, both are vulnerable to a downturn in ad spend and in a US election year, Facebook in particular is subject to scrutiny and the high costs of moderating content, but Mr Poppe's hope was that in aggregate his six growers would need two or three years to become reasonably priced, not 10.</p><p>The elephant in the room is, of course, the rising cases of coronavirus in America's western and southern states. Along with everyone else, money managers have taken up armchair virology and despite some convincing arguments that the disease break point may be lower than the threshold required for herd immunity, nobody really knows - and the recent data on cases and deaths is heading in the wrong direction.</p><p>Unfortunately, this has been the most politicised pandemic in history and the narrative around the disease is hugely damaging to the economy even if the medical situation is manageable. Then there is the ongoing geopolitical risk as America's relations with China worsen. Until the election, it may be that the momentum trade is no longer stocks but continues to be gold. Unlike the professional money managers who are expected to be invested, retail investors might also want to keep some powder dry and hold more cash. Despite the need for caution, however, the breadth of quality companies on offer means it doesn't pay to be out of US stocks entirely.</p><p>As far as a US equities strategy is concerned, the way forward is perhaps to invest away from market capitalisation weighting so the focus isn't too skewed to the most expensive companies. In other words, don't ditch tech but underweight it to benchmark and increase the weight of value approaches, but consider quality safeguards. Of course, that's easier said than done, but the task is less difficult with US shares compared with the UK market.</p><p/><p>75 THE NUMBER OFS&amp;P STOCKS EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IDENTIFYWITH EXCEPTIONALREVENUE ANDSHARE PRICE MOMENTUM</p><p/><p>'Over the past 60 years about 30 per cent of the 75 fastest growers in any given year achieved at least 13 per cent earnings growth for the following decade'</p><p/><p>'The reaction to Microsoft's full-year results was revealing... a fall in the rate of cloud user growth was enough to send its share price lower'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The plunge in long-term real interest rates has impacted the share price of Apple and Amazon</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-161977521</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-PRP1-JCBW-N3WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2814\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Take Europe's and improve on it</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AMERICA rarely looks to the bureaucrats of Brussels for guidance. Commercial freedom appeals more than dirigisme. But when it comes to data privacy, the case for copying the best bits of the European Union's approach is compelling. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is due to come into force next month. It is rules-heavy and has its flaws, but its premise that consumers should be in charge of their personal data is the right one. The law lets users gain access to, and to correct, information that firms hold on them. It gives consumers the right to transfer their data to another organisation. It requires companies to define how they keep data secure. And it lets regulators levy big fines if firms break the rules. </p><p>America has enacted privacy rules in areas such as health care. But it has never passed an overarching data-protection law. The latest attempt, the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, introduced in 2012 by the Obama administration, died a slow death in Congress. The GDPR should inspire another try.</p><p>The failings of America's self-regulatory approach are becoming clearer by the week. Large parts of the online economy are fuelled by data that consumers spray around without thought. Companies' arcane privacy policies obfuscate what they do with their users' information, which often amounts to pretty much anything they please. Facebook is embroiled in crisis after news that data on 87m users had been passed to a political-campaign firm. Identity-theft is widespread; the annual cost to American consumers exceeds $16bn, according to some estimates. On March 29th Under Armour, a clothing brand, said that hackers had gained access to information about 150m users of its MyFitnessPal app. </p><p>These scandals are changing the calculus about the benefits of self-regulation. Opponents of privacy legislation have long argued that the imposition of rules would keep technology companies from innovating. Yet as trust leaches out of the system, innovation is likely to suffer. If consumers fret about what smartphone apps may do with their data, fewer new offerings will take off\u2014especially in artificial intelligence. It emerged this week that Grindr, a dating app aimed at gay people, had been sharing details of users' HIV status with other firms. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple (which, admittedly, has sold itself on the idea that its customers' data should not be a source of profit), has called privacy a \"human right\". Even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's boss, has signalled an openness to regulation. It is striking that many of the firms preparing for the GDPR's arrival in Europe enthuse that the law has forced them to put their data house in order (see Business section). </p><p>The need to minimise legal fragmentation only adds to the case for America to adopt bits of the GDPR. One reason behind the new rules in the EU was to harmonise data-protection laws so that firms can do business across Europe more easily. America is moving in the opposite direction. States that have detected a need for greater privacy are drafting their own laws. California, for instance, has pending legislation that would establish a data-protection authority to regulate how the state's big tech firms use Californians' personal data. </p><p>Internationally, too, America is increasingly an outlier. Any American firm that serves European customers will soon have no choice but to comply with the GDPR; some firms plan to employ the rules worldwide. Other countries are adopting GDPR-style laws. A similar regime on both sides of the Atlantic would help keep data flowing across borders. The alternative, of a regulatory patchwork, would make it harder for the West to amass a shared stock of AI training data to rival China's.</p><p>America need not adopt the GDPR wholesale. The legislation is far from perfect. At nearly 100 articles long, it is too complex and tries to achieve too many things. The compliance costs for smaller firms, in particular, look burdensome. In addition, parts of the GDPR are out of step with America's constitutional guarantee of free speech: a \"right to be forgotten\" of the kind that the new law enshrines will not fly. </p><p>But these are arguments for using the GDPR as a template, not for ignoring the issue of data protection. If America continues on today's path, it will fail to protect the privacy of its citizens and long-term health of its firms. America's data economy has thrived so far with hardly any rules. That era is over. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-8Q751S0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1P-YPY1-JBKN-B01G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Outside the train station that connects San Francisco to the sprawling campuses of Google, Facebook and Apple, the Democratic senator has rented a billboard. In bold white capitals on a black background, its message is stark: \"Break Up Big Tech.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ms Warren is no firebrand. Nor is she a Corbyn-like figure on the fringes whose views are suddenly mainstream. The former Harvard Law School professor, 69, a frontrunner in the race to become the Democratic candidate in the next presidential election, is about as radical as a white picket fence.</p><p>Her transformation into a crusader against Silicon Valley is one that many on Capitol Hill have made. Not so long ago US policymakers would bask in the reflected glow of their world-conquering tech industry. Barack Obama developed an all too cosy relationship with the tech barons. During his presidency there was a revolving door between the White House, Google and its paid-up lobbyists and think tanks.</p><p>Such close ties have been ripped asunder by scandals, from the abuse of privacy rights to facilitating Russian tampering in the 2016 election. The clamour is growing for tighter regulation and break-ups. Last weekend it emerged that the justice department was opening a preliminary investigation into whether Google stifled competition. The Federal Trade Commission is to investigate Amazon for potential infringements of anti-trust laws.</p><p>On Monday the House of Representatives said that it, too, would investigate Silicon Valley, raising the prospect that America's competition laws could be rebooted for the digital age. President Trump has accused internet platforms such as Facebook of discriminating against conservatives and blamed Amazon for hollowing out America's shopping malls. Even Chris Hughes, one of Facebook's founders, recently published an essay entitled: \"It's time to break up Facebook.\" In the fractured politics of today's America it's rare to find such consensus.</p><p>It is dawning on politicians that they have stood idly by while Google and Facebook accumulated troves of personal information and with it extraordinary wealth and power. Between them they control about two thirds of the $300-billion-a-year global digital advertising business.</p><p>Their ascent was not an inevitable consequence of their innate genius. At key points in recent history US regulators facilitated their rise, taking decisions that in hindsight look ill-judged. In the 2000s Google was allowed to acquire two online advertising platforms, Admob and Doubleclick, which gave it even greater control over the digital ad chain. Facebook's takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp this decade, waived through with minimal scrutiny, helped Mark Zuckerberg to dominate social networking. The last time the US competition authorities took a serious look at Google, in 2013, it was cleared of using its pre-eminence in internet search to harm users and competitors. Since then its parent company has added $500 billion to its market value. As William Barr, Mr Trump's pliant attorney-general, put it: \"A lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths ... have taken shape under the nose of anti-trust enforcers.\"</p><p>Brussels has been quicker to take Silicon Valley to task. The European Commission has fined Google (EURO)8 billion for using its dominant positions in internet search, online advertising and smartphone software to crush rivals. American watchdogs look at potential competition law breaches through the narrow lens of \"consumer welfare\", focusing on the prices of goods or services. That clearly favours the big internet platforms, which do not charge users.</p><p>Ultimately it is up to lawmakers to ensure that the next wave of disruptive start-ups can rise to the surface.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-149916228</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8P-0T91-JCBW-N025-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 6, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That clearly favours the big internet platforms, which do not charge users.</p><p>Ultimately it is up to lawmakers to ensure that the next wave of disruptive start-ups can rise to the surface.</p><p>                   Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-53419480</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8J-24T1-F021-602S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><timeReceived>4:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Outside the train station that connects San Francisco to the sprawling campuses of Google, Facebook and Apple, the Democratic senator has rented a billboard. In bold white capitals on a black background, its message is stark: \"Break Up Big Tech.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ms Warren is no firebrand. Nor is she a Corbyn-like figure on the fringes whose views are suddenly mainstream. The former Harvard Law School professor, 69, a frontrunner in the race to become the Democratic candidate in the next presidential election, is about as radical as a white picket fence.</p><p>Her transformation into a crusader against Silicon Valley is one that many on Capitol Hill have made. Not so long ago US policymakers would bask in the reflected glow of their world-conquering tech industry. Barack Obama developed an all too cosy relationship with the tech barons. During his presidency there was a revolving door between the White House, Google and its paid-up lobbyists and think tanks.</p><p>Such close ties have been ripped asunder by scandals, from the abuse of privacy rights to facilitating Russian tampering in the 2016 election. The clamour is growing for tighter regulation and break-ups. Last weekend it emerged that the justice department was opening a preliminary investigation into whether Google stifled competition. The Federal Trade Commission is to investigate Amazon for potential infringements of anti-trust laws.</p><p>On Monday the House of Representatives said that it, too, would investigate Silicon Valley, raising the prospect that America's competition laws could be rebooted for the digital age. President Trump has accused internet platforms such as Facebook of discriminating against conservatives and blamed Amazon for hollowing out America's shopping malls. Even Chris Hughes, one of Facebook's founders, recently published an essay entitled: \"It's time to break up Facebook.\" In the fractured politics of today's America it's rare to find such consensus.</p><p>It is dawning on politicians that they have stood idly by while Google and Facebook accumulated troves of personal information and with it extraordinary wealth and power. Between them they control about two thirds of the $300-billion-a-year global digital advertising business.</p><p>Their ascent was not an inevitable consequence of their innate genius. At key points in recent history US regulators facilitated their rise, taking decisions that in hindsight look ill-judged. In the 2000s Google was allowed to acquire two online advertising platforms, Admob and Doubleclick, which gave it even greater control over the digital ad chain. Facebook's takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp this decade, waived through with minimal scrutiny, helped Mark Zuckerberg to dominate social networking. The last time the US competition authorities took a serious look at Google, in 2013, it was cleared of using its pre-eminence in internet search to harm users and competitors. Since then its parent company has added $500 billion to its market value. As William Barr, Mr Trump's pliant attorney-general, put it: \"A lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths ... have taken shape under the nose of anti-trust enforcers.\"</p><p>Brussels has been quicker to take Silicon Valley to task. The European Commission has fined Google (EURO)8 billion for using its dominant positions in internet search, online advertising and smartphone software to crush rivals. American watchdogs look at potential competition law breaches through the narrow lens of \"consumer welfare\", focusing on the prices of goods or services. That clearly favours the big internet platforms, which do not charge users.</p><p>Ultimately it is up to lawmakers to ensure that the next wave of disruptive start-ups can rise to the surface.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-149908624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8P-0T91-JCBW-N0JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 6, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Outside the train station that connects San Francisco to the sprawling campuses of Google, Facebook and Apple, the Democratic senator has rented a billboard. In bold white capitals on a black background, its message is stark: \"Break Up Big Tech.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ms Warren is no firebrand. Nor is she a Corbyn-like figure on the fringes whose views are suddenly mainstream. The former Harvard Law School professor, 69, a frontrunner in the race to become the Democratic candidate in the next presidential election, is about as radical as a white picket fence.</p><p>Her transformation into a crusader against Silicon Valley is one that many on Capitol Hill have made. Not so long ago US policymakers would bask in the reflected glow of their world-conquering tech industry. Barack Obama developed an all too cosy relationship with the tech barons. During his presidency there was a revolving door between the White House, Google and its paid-up lobbyists and think tanks.</p><p>Such close ties have been ripped asunder by scandals, from the abuse of privacy rights to facilitating Russian tampering in the 2016 election. The clamour is growing for tighter regulation and break-ups. Last weekend it emerged that the justice department was opening a preliminary investigation into whether Google stifled competition. The Federal Trade Commission is to investigate Amazon for potential infringements of anti-trust laws.</p><p>On Monday the House of Representatives said that it, too, would investigate Silicon Valley, raising the prospect that America's competition laws could be rebooted for the digital age. President Trump has accused internet platforms such as Facebook of discriminating against conservatives and blamed Amazon for hollowing out America's shopping malls. Even Chris Hughes, one of Facebook's founders, recently published an essay entitled: \"It's time to break up Facebook.\" In the fractured politics of today's America it's rare to find such consensus.</p><p>It is dawning on politicians that they have stood idly by while Google and Facebook accumulated troves of personal information and with it extraordinary wealth and power. Between them they control about two thirds of the $300-billion-a-year global digital advertising business.</p><p>Their ascent was not an inevitable consequence of their innate genius. At key points in recent history US regulators facilitated their rise, taking decisions that in hindsight look ill-judged. In the 2000s Google was allowed to acquire two online advertising platforms, Admob and Doubleclick, which gave it even greater control over the digital ad chain. Facebook's takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp this decade, waived through with minimal scrutiny, helped Mark Zuckerberg to dominate social networking. The last time the US competition authorities took a serious look at Google, in 2013, it was cleared of using its pre-eminence in internet search to harm users and competitors. Since then its parent company has added $500 billion to its market value. As William Barr, Mr Trump's pliant attorney-general, put it: \"A lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths ... have taken shape under the nose of anti-trust enforcers.\"</p><p>Brussels has been quicker to take Silicon Valley to task. The European Commission has fined Google (EURO)8 billion for using its dominant positions in internet search, online advertising and smartphone software to crush rivals. American watchdogs look at potential competition law breaches through the narrow lens of \"consumer welfare\", focusing on the prices of goods or services. That clearly favours the big internet platforms, which do not charge users.</p><p>Ultimately it is up to lawmakers to ensure that the next wave of disruptive start-ups can rise to the surface.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-149909624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8P-0T91-JCBW-N08C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 6, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

America's political culture is coming apart. The rhetoric is rapidly getting harsher, in case you haven't noticed. It is getting more venomous, and most autonomously, it is becoming more racialized. Riots over race and politics were virtually unheard of ten years ago in this country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sadly, now they are common. We are living in a scary time, and people know it. A new FOX poll found that 81 percent of voters think the bonds that hold this country together are weakening. Just a decade ago, people joked about letting states secede from the union or splitting the country into two along political lines. None of that sounds very funny anymore or even far-fetched at this point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, at a volatile moment like this, the last thing this country needs is more demagoguery, especially racial demagoguery which always leaves the deepest and longest lasting ones. On the other hand, whipping people into a frenzy of fear and rage is a guaranteed ratings bonanza, and CNN can never resist that. Watch how the network takes the controversy over the National Anthem at football games and turns it into a terrifying story about race hatred.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: If anyone actually believes this is about the flag, then you must believe Rosa Parks' protest was about a bus. Think about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he says he was really telling the owners -- like, the owners or the plantation owners, and the guys playing in the league, you know, they are on the plantation, you can't say anything. And so the things really escalated.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It does sound a little bit and obviously, you can come at me on Twitter about this, like he is saying control your dog, control your dog to the owners. And now he says, they are fearful of the players, he said, he is setting up the ugliest kind of tension that you can. And I know when you say, control your dog, it has got a lot of racial overtones to it. So does this situation. I don't know how you can look at it and not see how it is racial.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Dogs? Who said anything about dogs? Nobody did. But it doesn't matter. The image is horrifying, and that is the point. You can't turn away from that. Now, do you hate and fear your neighbor a little more by the end of that segment? Of course you do. Imagine millions of people watching that kind of thing all day long. What would happen to the country? We are finding out now.</p><p>Monique Pressley is an attorney. She is a Democratic political commentator, and she joins us tonight. Thanks a lot Monique for coming on.</p><p>MONIQUE PRESSLEY, TRIAL ATTORNEY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I guess what bothers me is, you know, I think it is important to have honest conversations about race, but I think you should be responsible because it has the capacity to really scare people and really hurt people and hurt the country. And so when you see a journalist on another network basically make up a quote and say, \"he is saying, control your dogs,\" as nobody has ever said, and then comment upon this imaginary quote and go off on this, \"oh, it's a racial thing.\" if I am watching that with, you know, half-asleep, I'm terrified by the end. They shouldn't do that to people.</p><p>PRESSLEY: And perhaps you would be terrified at the end, but I'm really not interested in how Chris Cuomo's analogy may terrify people. The issue is why there are protests in the first place and the people who are living terrified every day just walking down the street. So, if you look at how we got here, we got here because African-American men are disproportionately stopped, disproportionately searched, disproportionately arrested, and disproportionately killed per capita in this country.</p><p>CARLSON: That is true.</p><p>PRESSLEY: And one brave man decided to first sit and then take a knee. The escalation didn't come into what I guess you are now calling terror. I'm not really hearing about, frankly, Tucker, a lot of people being afraid.</p><p>CARLSON: Let me just stop you really quick. I mean, let me just say, let me just acknowledge that I think a lot of what you say is valid, reasonable, something that we can talk about and debate. But what I really object to, and what I think it's hurting the country, is the demagoguery in the way that it is discussed and described on other channels, particularly on CNN.</p><p>So, for example, what you just said, that African-American men are more likely to be stopped and shot. That is absolutely true. But it is a nuanced question, actually. Black men are more likely to be shot by African-American cops and by white cops. I'm not sure that proves anything, but it certainly detracts from the story line CNN is pushing. And so, when you are going to tell a story, you have to tell the whole story, or else what you're doing is you are pushing a false story designed to scare the crap out of people and that is what they're doing.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Right. But even what you just said, that was incorrect because --</p><p>CARLSON: It's not incorrect.</p><p>PRESSLEY: -- when the numbers are concerned, when you are talking about more likely, you're talking about statistics into the future. But when you look at the numbers of the race of police officers who have actually killed African-American males, there have been more white officers to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: I'm saying as of right now, and look, I'm saying, as of right now -- actually, what I said is true. And look, I'm not drawing a massive conclusion from it other than, this stuff is super complicated, okay? So, a lot of these cities in which this is taken place is run by African- Americans, the majority African-Americans police departments. It doesn't mean there isn't racism. I'm just saying, there isn't.</p><p>I'm just saying, add the context, and don't start using dog analogies which immediately invoke pictures of Alabama in 1955 and Bull Connor and all the rest which are not assigned to inform people or elucidate. They are designed to terrify and horrify people and that is bad for the country.</p><p>PRESSLEY: I am not sure who they are designed to terrify and horrify though. I keep hearing you saying that, and I heard in the intro where you kept saying, it's scary, it's terrifying, it's horrifying. But the African-Americans were already terrified. They are terrified of law enforcement. They are terrified that the very flag that we revere and adhere to, the very flag that symbolizes the best of freedom in this country is the same symbol that is now being used to represent race superiority. The same symbol that is now being used to represent --</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. That is your opinion which I think I really hope is not a majority opinion in any community, because I think it is a crackpot, with respect, theory. But let me give you a specific example of why this coverage has been irresponsible. Spike Lee was up there, you saw on CNN.</p><p>PRESSLEY: He is not a CNN commentator.</p><p>CARLSON: He is not.</p><p>PRESSLEY: He is an individual, private businessman.</p><p>CARLSON: No, but he is also a prolific conspiracy not.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Successful owner, African-American man.</p><p>CARLSON: No, he's a conspiracy nut.</p><p>PRESSLEY: And that would be an opinion, especially the \"nut\" part.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I will give you an example because I was there.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Uh-hm.</p><p>CARLSON: In 2006, Spike Lee said to me on television that the levees in New Orleans during Katrina were blown up in order to hurt black people. And I don't think he was there during Katrina. I was. As a factual matter, that didn't happen. That was crazier than anything Alex Jones has ever said. So, you look that guy on your air --</p><p>PRESSLEY: Crazier than anything President Trump has ever said?</p><p>CARLSON: Look, my only point is, if you have --</p><p>PRESSLEY: -- conspiracy nuts right now. Maybe he will be our next president.</p><p>CARLSON: Maybe that is the problem. So, if you have a guy like that on who said something racially inflammatory and untrue, you should push back a little bit when he theorizes about how this is about the plantation mentality on the base of no evidence. If you're journalist, you're going to say, look, can you prove that?</p><p>PRESSLEY: He used an analogy, and using an analogy that actually came to the minds of many people in African-American communities and in Caucasian communities and in Latino or brown communities.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PRESSLEY: When our president, the President of this country, referred to African-American citizens, taxpaying citizens who are gainfully employed, making good money in this country, in the NFL, as professional athletes, when he referred to them in the manner he did, as the sons of bitches and said that the owners are to get those sons of bitches out there, just drive them out of there.</p><p>That language makes it seem like these owners have a proprietary interest in the bodies of these African-American athletes.</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, come on! You know what, I don't know --</p><p>PRESSLEY: Such that they can be -- I went to Howard University School of Law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PRESSLEY: He is saying that they should be dragged out of there for a peaceful protest.</p><p>CARLSON: Spare me.</p><p>PRESSLEY: The next time they get down on their needs in their peaceful, lawful protest, those SLBs ought to be dragged out of there.</p><p>CARLSON: That is his opinion.</p><p>PRESSLEY: And the President of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: And some of these guys -- hold on. Can I slow you down your speech for one second? You don't like what the President said, but I was there.</p><p>PRESSLEY: You don't like what he said, do you?</p><p>CARLSON: I absolutely agree that it is divisive and offensive to attack the flag. If you got a problem with the police, explain it.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Did you think that his language was divisive?</p><p>CARLSON: I think that there is nothing about what he said that was explicitly racial and I think it is immoral for you and others to pretend that you know what he was thinking when you don't.</p><p>PRESSLEY: I asked if you liked it.</p><p>CARLSON: It's not offensive to me.</p><p>PRESSLEY: I understand you were in the SOB in question.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. Look, maybe he should have done that, but the point remains, it is not a racial attack. Their white players down on one knee, as well, as you know, you are ignoring that because it doesn't bolster the divisive argument you are seeking to make.</p><p>PRESSLEY: The issue that they are protesting and the majority of the ones who were doing it in the NFL in general --</p><p>CARLSON: You know nothing about that because -- about what it is about.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Okay.</p><p>CARLSON: The majority of players, don't pretend you know because you don't.</p><p>PRESSLEY: I wasn't pretending. What I was saying is that the National Players Association issued a statement about what they were protesting.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PRESSLEY: So, they represent all of the players. And then specific players such as Colin Kaepernick who stood up first was protesting racial injustice within this country.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. Got it. Here's the point. If you disagree with how people treat the flag without being a racist, and you're not allowing room for that, no one is contesting that.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Well, it's constitutional, right? It's constitutional.</p><p>CARLSON: No one is contesting that.</p><p>PRESSLEY: You have a constitutional right to do it.</p><p>CARLSON: You are inserting a racial angle where none necessarily exist, and it is irresponsible.</p><p>PRESSLEY: If I am inserting it, and I am inserting it because it is obvious to any eyes that aren't rose-colored.</p><p>CARLSON: You know, that's your opinion. But it is like a news organization, hold on --</p><p>PRESSLEY: I don't work for CNN. So, I can't defend them. But I think what was set on this issue was true.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. You think someone who gets up as a reporter and claims to be a conveyor of the news ought to be speculating with no evidence about the opinions or attitudes are deepest beliefs of a figure in the news? Do you think we should just make up something and say, this is what he meant, when we don't know that?</p><p>PRESSLEY: Well, here's the thing.</p><p>CARLSON: Why would you do that?</p><p>PRESSLEY: When you just said that Spike Lee was a conspiracy nut --</p><p>CARLSON: Because he told me a conspiracy nut theory --</p><p>PRESSLEY: What he said to you was what he believes to be true. And you, as a journalist, commented on it and gave your own opinion about what he said.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not my opinion, it's a factual statement. The levees were not blown up.</p><p>PRESSLEY: It isn't really a factual assertion.</p><p>CARLSON: Actually it is, the levees were not, we know conclusively that they were not blown up.</p><p>PRESSLEY: That is just a derogatory statement.</p><p>CARLSON: Because that is an outrageous thing to say. And the African- American-run city of New Orleans determined that was untrue, it was a lie. So, he shouldn't say because it scares the hell out of people. That's all I'm saying.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Who got scared?</p><p>CARLSON: I did, to think my government would blow up a levee to kill people and you're joking? That is grotesque.</p><p>PRESSLEY: And if you are feeling any amount of fear then it may be like a smidge close to what an African-American male might feeling just driving --</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. Well, maybe it's because of people, maybe it's like, people like that are making it worse, that is my point. They're making it worst. Monique, thank you.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Thank you for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Lawrence Jones is a host at The Blaze TV and he joins us now. So, Lawrence as I just said, I'm not against conversations about the police or the abuse of power which I think is real, not just the police which I think is real, not just the police, but anyone on those power tends to abuse it.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, THE BLAZE TV HOST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And I think we should talk about that.</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What I am against is people who claim to be journalists making claims they can't back up for the sake of scaring the hell out of their viewers so they'll keep watching and that's what I see happening on CNN.</p><p>JONES: Yes, Tucker. It's one thing to talk about. And thanks for having me. It is one thing to talk about police brutality and talk about criminal justice reform. Both issue that I'm passionate about and bringing the community together, but it is another thing to accuse the President of having racist comments. And I think this is something that the left is doing to push their narrative because they know that when they do this, it riles people emotions.</p><p>If you know anything about Donald Trump, he has no respect of a person. I mean, whether you are a woman, crooked Hillary, little Marco, he goes after people, he just does. And no matter what race, male or female, that is just his style. It's one thing to say you disagree with his style, but to suggest that he is racist, homophobic, or whatever label they want to put on it, I think it is just being intellectually dishonest.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I think it is too, and I don't even think it is about trauma. I may be the only person in America who was not even that deeply interested in Trump. I'm deeply interested in people saying what they think is true without being shouted down by name callers. And I think that if the President or any other figures is not allowed to give -- don't disrespect the flag. That's not a crazy thing to say. If you can't say that without being called a racist, then I don't think I can either, and I want to jealously guard my right to say what I think is true. You see what I mean?</p><p>JONES: I totally agree. But as I said before, it is one thing to have a conversation if you disagreeing with the President's comments which, I thought the President -- he shares the sentiment of, you know, of many Americans because a lot of people don't like the flag being disrespected. That is totally reasonable. But I did disagree with the President getting involved in a private business and telling them what to do.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it's fun.</p><p>JONES: That is one argument. But to suggest that it was based on race, that the President came to this conclusion, as I said, it is intellectually dishonest. But the problem is, is that when people make those outrageous claims, it shuts down the debate. And I would encourage people that are on the right. They are typically go with the left on this issue, it happens to every Republican, no matter if it was Donald Trump or Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz. This is what they do to all Republicans, all conservatives, until you are faced with somebody that looks like me and you can't go around on TV calling me a racist black man.</p><p>CARLSON: But if, the long-term consequences of it are profound, and if you look at the polling, people increasingly distrust each other, they hate each other, they fear each other. And there are a lot of reasons for it, but this kind of news coverage is one of the reasons. If you are telling people constantly, you are hated, there is a conspiracy against you, you're never going to get a fair shake, the people in power want to kill you, without any evidence -- by the way, if there's ever any evidence that the President or anyone else has attitudes like that, I will be the first to denounce him and I mean that. But there is no evidence, you shouldn't say it, right?</p><p>JONES: Right. And I am a crazy libertarian, so any time the government gets out of line, I am quick to address that. But again, Tucker, if the media truly is interested in having a national conversation, then they would be more responsible with their reporting. Because this doesn't help the national conversation. As a matter of fact, Tucker, this keeps people from the table, having spirited conversations. I understand people getting angry and upset. People get mad at what I say. But at the end of the day, you can't call, every time someone says something that you dislike, racist. It shuts down the conversations.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I don't think we're dealing with people who want to have a conversation.</p><p>JONES: Well, they're not rational. And the thing is, they need to be held responsible for it -- people shouldn't be supporting these organizations if they continue to just spew out a hate. They are just as bad as the people that they accuse of being racist.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sorry, I want to say Monique is still sitting here next to me, and she is responding in a way that suggests I want to put her back on TV to respond to you.</p><p>JONES: Go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Monique? I don't think your sold.</p><p>PRESSLEY: No, I don't think it is convincing at all. Because everything that we just heard is the line we hear over and over again in order to not have a voice and to say, when racism really is an issue. The dog whistle. I'm not done. Un momento. Un momento. The dog whistle has turned into a megaphone, a microphone from the bulliest of the bulliest pulpit in the world. And I know you are chiming in. But when the President, over and over again, says things that are reminiscent of the, you know what, the fact that he is an equal opportunity insulter doesn't mean that he doesn't insult people of color along color lines.</p><p>JONES: No, it just means -- it is not a crime to be insulted. It is not racist to be insulted.</p><p>CARLSON: Can I ask you a question that I think -- do you feel, since you are on television, a lot of people are watching you, any responsibility at all to be responsible in fact-based on your comments?</p><p>PRESSLEY: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you have any sense of what you're saying, what effect that has that people feel about each other? You don't seem to care.</p><p>PRESSLEY: I have a concern that I speak truth and that I speak facts. It is the facts --</p><p>CARLSON: That's not in evidence at all.</p><p>PRESSLEY: If the facts that I speak and the analysis which is opinion, and I'm sure everybody who is on TV right now knows that, it is my factual analysis is based on truth, then the fact that it may concern you, Tucker, or it may scare you, or it may upset you, really is necessary. Because then what I'm hearing --</p><p>CARLSON: But you don't have facts, actually. And that is the troubling -- if we were debating the tax code, I would say look, you know, we differ, I think your economics are wrong.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: We are talking about something that is based on America's original sin, and it is an open wound to this day.</p><p>JONES: And we should talk about it.</p><p>CARLSON: And on the basis of no facts, you are making it worse.</p><p>PRESSLEY: But what was that original sin?</p><p>CARLSON: Slavery.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Yes. But it wasn't the bounce of slavery physically. It was the notion that one race being white is superior to another.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I got it.</p><p>PRESSLEY: And that is what we are still seeing. We're seeing the one --</p><p>CARLSON: But you have no evidence for that. And yet, it doesn't bother you to paraphrase people --</p><p>PRESSLEY: How can you say that there's no evidence for it when people are dying in the streets simply because on their color.</p><p>JONES: You can talk about it without calling everybody racist.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. I'm sorry. Unfortunately, we are out of time. Thank you for doing this. Monique, thank you, Lawrence. Thank you.</p><p>PRESSLEY: Thank you again.</p><p>CARLSON: You just heard CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, his views on things. Let's just say, you can't get enough of Chris Cuomo. You want to hear more Chris Cuomo but you don't want to have to watch CNN to get it. You are in luck, we have more later in this show. Greatest hits from Chris Cuomo. Trust me, worth it.</p><p>And violence anti-fa becoming routine, and now a libertarian, a librarian law, they are far from libertarian at NYU says, violence is necessary for the good of the country. Alan Dershowitz of Harvard here to weigh in on that, next.</p><p>CARLSON: Political fanaticism on-campus keeps getting more intense, but at the same time, also more routine. A New York University librarian April Hathcock says that violence by anti-fa isn't simply indefensible, but necessary, quote, \"Fighting oppression is messy, Hathcock wrote in a recent essay, and that's okay, it is so vitally worth doing.\" So far, there are no signs that Hathcock job is in danger.</p><p>Alan Dershowitz is the author of \"Trumped Up.\" He is also a retired Harvard Law School professor who is frequently spoken on various campuses, including last night at Columbia University in New York and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Professor, thanks for coming on.</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you are a First Amendment absolutist, self-described, and I think your career attests to that. Where is the line? It is okay from the perspective of a school administration to have an employee advocate political violence?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, I think employees are different than students because they are supposed to be role models, students are supposed to listen to them. NYU is a private university, and I think the President would be well within his rights to fire a professor who advocates violence, particularly to students, because students who are joining anti-fa, it is growing by leaps and bounds. And he is justifying not only violence but violence to suppress free speech and economic freedom.</p><p>I guess, the implications of what he is saying is, if a teacher gets up in class and pronounces a view that here regard to sexist, it would be okay for the students to get up and beat up the teacher.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Or like the student the other day in New York and The Bronx pulled out a knife and killed a fellow student who was expressing a contrary view. Where does it end? If one side can use violence to stop oppression, oppression is in the eye of the beholder. What is the other side do in response?</p><p>CARLSON: That is a wise point, and is often overlooked by the advocates of squelching speech. So, you said recently that you are considering suing Cal Berkeley, the University of California at Berkeley, for suppressing free speech. Explain your case.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, I was invited by a group of students to speak at Berkeley about Israel, and I generally am supportive of Israel and the two- states solution. The Berkeley administration has said that they will not allow me to speak because I didn't give them eight weeks advance notice, but there is an exception to the eight-week rule. If you are invited by a department, you don't have to give an eight-week notice.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Now, who is invited by departments? Radicals, liberals, people of the left, and anti-Israel speakers, speakers like me, a moderate liberal who supports Israel, we generally don't get invited by departments. So, what we have done now is ask a number of departments to invite us. If no departments invites us, having invited people on the other side, we will sue them, arguing that the eight-week rule is a cover for content-based discrimination against moderates, liberals, conservatives, and supporters of Israel.</p><p>CARLSON: What do you think they will find when they produce the schedule and list of speakers they have invited to campus?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, I have no doubt that anti-Israel speakers are invited by departments all the time all over the United States. And often, when an anti-Israel speaker has been invited and groups want to have me come to present the other side, the school won't invite me. The departments won't invite me. That happened at a number of universities. And we are testing Berkeley at this point to see if it happens there.</p><p>Look, this is not being done for a test. I'm going to California to visit members of my family, and I was invited to speak at the school, and I wanted to present to the students, the liberal case for Israel. And if Berkeley won't let me do it, it is a public university, and I have legal recourse which I intend to take. I hope Berkeley will allow me to speak. Either a department will invite me where the school will change the rule, because the rule has all kinds of potential for misuse.</p><p>It says, you need to give eight weeks if you are a high profile person. What does that mean? If the President of the United States said, I want to speak at Berkeley, they would make him wait eight weeks? What if some liberal activist, famous actor or actress, decided to speak? You think they would really make them wait eight weeks? I think it is much too vague a term to satisfy the requirements of the First Amendment for a public university.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Noam Chomsky is not waiting eight weeks to attack Israel on the campus of Berkeley. Is there any precedent for a suit like yours?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: I have never heard of a precedent for the eight-week rule, so there is no precedent for my suit. But I think it is a very strong suit. I think Berkeley will realize it is a strong suit. And I think in the end they will allow me to speak. But if they don't, they have to comply with the rule of law, including the First Amendment.</p><p>CARLSON: You are a brave man. Alan Dershowitz, thank you very much for joining us tonight.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Bizarre new revelations tonight in the case of that alleged NSA leaker reality winner. Among other things, she headed <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>so much, she filed a formal complaint against the television set. That and more details just ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Judge Roy Moore won the Alabama Republican Senate primary earlier this week, and he won it easily. He beat incumbent Luther Strange by almost 10 points. Now, Moore won despite unrelentingly hostile press coverage, not to mention a bumpy political history. Moore has been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court by judicial discipline panels. People in that state's richest zip codes consider him a buffoon and may be dangerous.</p><p>Luther Strange and his allies, by contrast, had almost universal support from Republican leaders in the state and across the country, many of whom he considers friends. Luther Strange is a decent person, nobody denies that. By some calculations, he outspent Ray Moore by seven to one. And most significant of all, Luther Strange had the enthusiastic endorsement of Donald Trump, who remains immensely popular in the state of Alabama, and yet he lost anyway. It was remarkable. What are the lessons here, exactly?</p><p>Well, first, it is getting harder to call the Trump phenomenon a cult of personality. That may come as news to the press corps, and indeed, to the President himself, both of whom assume it is all about Trump's personal appeal. Shooting someone on Fifth Avenue and all that. But it turns out that is not really true. If it were true, Luther Strange would be a senator right now, and the latest health care bill would be law.</p><p>Trump supported both of those. His voters did not. It is now pretty clear the Trump movement is not primarily about Donald Trump. The president is popular and powerful when he is taking on the establishment of both parties, but he is diminished when he is aligned with them. The message is bigger than the man. So what is the message? Well, the same as it always was. Our elites have failed.</p><p>That message resonates because it is true. For decades, the country has watched as the leaders of both parties sell them out, putting the interests of multi-national corporations, D.C. lobbyists, even foreign countries ahead of the concerns of Americans. They are enraged by this, not surprisingly, and they will consider backing almost anybody who fights back against it.</p><p>That is why Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders and Roy Moore all did far better than predicted. Now, when you look closely, the three don't seem to have much in common at all, but take a few steps back. Their messages are essentially the same. The people in charge don't care about you. Try something else. It is all pretty obvious when you think about it, though for some reason, virtually nobody in Washington ever since to figure it out.</p><p>They are shocked and appalled every time it happens. They wonder, what is wrong with voters. They never seem to consider what is wrong with themselves. Well, do you remember Reality Winner? She is the NSA employee arrested earlier this year for leaking classified secrets. Now, according to newly-filed court documents, her behavior was not just ad but bizarre.</p><p>FOX's Peter Doocy has been on this story all day and he joins us with details. What is this?</p><p>PETER DOOCY, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: So, Tucker, the final straw for this NSA translator named Reality Winner that made her staff classified material into her panty hose and then head for the door with it. The NSA had Intel on an NSA database that had classified reporting about Russian election interference that the public had not been briefed on, and she thought that they should know because she figured that sources and methods had already been compromised anyway.</p><p>But shortly after sneaking the material, in her panty hose, past guards at the NSA's outpost at Fort Gordon Military Reservation in Georgia and mailing it to the to the news outlet, The Intercept, the FBI followed digital footprints to her front door and that is when she said, part of her problem with the NSA was <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>on TV. Page 58 of the FBI interview transcript, she says this. \"I guess it's just been hard at work because, and I have filed formal complaints about them having <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>on, you know? Just, at least, for God sake, put al Jazeera on, or a slideshow with people's pets. I've tried everything to get that changed.\"</p><p>Reality Winner also left a lot of clues on Facebook and in chats with her sister and a lot of them. The suspected leaker said this. Quote, \"I only say I hate America like three times a day. I'm no radical. It is mostly just about American's obsession with air conditioning.\" And her sister said back, \"You don't really actually hate America, right?\"</p><p>And Reality said, \"I mean, yes, I do. It's literally the worst thing to happen on the planet. We invented capitalism, and the downfall of the environment.\" And Tucker, something else that is extraordinary in these documents, they are interviewing her, the FBI at her house and they say, okay, anything else classified on your desk back at the NSA that we need to know about. And she said, well, I have a picture of Anderson Cooper that is signed, but the autograph is not real. And they say, but no classified information? And she said, oh, no.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CARLSON: Picture of Anderson Cooper with an ersatz autographs. Peter, that was fantastic.</p><p>DOOCY: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm really glad you came tonight.</p><p>DOOCY: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, up next, Facebook, one of the most powerful companies in the history of the world. Is it evil? Up next, we'll discuss Facebook's drive to censored fake news well collaborating with authoritarian foreign governments and squelching content to their benefit in exchange for profit.</p><p>Plus, FOX correspondent Rich Edson squares off against a former Obama administration's spokeswoman in this week's \"Final Exam.\" It is a close one too. Stay tuned.</p><p>CARLSON: CNN's Chris Cuomo is an awfully busy man. Some days he is doing what he can to worsen America's racial divide doing a pretty good job on that. Others, he is warning regular Americans, it is illegal to read leaked emails embarrassing Hillary Clinton. But even with that packed schedule, he still takes time to post videos like this on Facebook, and we're glad he does.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: First, the good news. Rose is back. Yay! Rose just got married. We're all very happy. All right. Now, back to the serious stuff. Keeping this up here, the hashtag stands from, please use it, why? Fight injustice, re-enforce morality. Okay? That is what the firm parts stands for. It applies to everything. Look at Puerto Rico. There are problems there with the recovery. Not the storm, that is obvious. By now, you ought to know that. Because the coverage has been completed.</p><p>You should see it, you should understand it, you should connect to it. Why aren't they getting more help to the places that needed faster? You have to push for accountability. We know that there is some intention there. We know the President was there, we have to get at it. This also applies to this health care message. They don't have the votes, the President shouldn't say that they do this. Not optimism, it's being deceptive. You need truth, you need accuracy. And lastly, on taxes, you need details because what came out helps the has, not the have-nots. Have a great day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, as this video raises a lot of questions, some of them theological, what exactly is Chris Cuomo talking about? What office is he running for? Do Chris Cuomo and the rest of us exist in the true reality or in strange cartoonist simulated universe? Where in the world that this come from, and in a world where Chris Cuomo has a TV show, what has meaning? What is virtue? Does God exist?</p><p>These are questions that arise when watching these videos. We will try to find answers, updates later in the week. Well, 15 years ago, Facebook didn't even exist. Today, it is one of the world's most powerful companies, the biggest news company in history. As a result, it is important to ask what Facebook is doing with all of the information they gather and with all of the power they wield. Can they be trusted?</p><p>Scott Cleland wrote a book about this, about big tech companies, \"Search and Destroy, Why You Can't Trust Google Inc.\" He joins us tonight. Scott, you are one of the few who really thought deeply about this, and the core question right now about Facebook is, can we trust Mark Zuckerberg and his staff not to censor news?</p><p>SCOTT CLELAND, AUTHOR, \"SEARCH AND DESTROY\": Well, what you need to look at is, Facebook is a series of conflicts. It is a hot mess of conflict. So, first of all, it is an unaccountable monopoly that is in the influence business. It is an autocracy that is pretending to be a democracy. You then have this black box technology that tells everybody else has to be completely transparent. Then you have a media company who actually will live broadcast murder, torture, and rape with no editorial on it at all.</p><p>And then you have a self-appointed regulator of free speech that claims to be neutral. And then you also have a self-appointed political organizer and a power broker with a mission that is very political saying, oh, I'm not political, you can trust me. Now, it's okay. Whatever their politics are. But when you try and say you're not political, their new mission, which Mark Zuckerberg gave us just in June, give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Now, anybody that has a sense about politics knows the word \"power,\" politics is built on it.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course it is. So, Facebook clearly has a political agenda. They are clearly hostile to certain worldviews. And it seems like they have a history of squelching certain parts of the news in order to please foreign governments.</p><p>CLELAND: And that is a problem. You know, when you are an autocracy, technological autocracy, about, you know, half of the countries or more depending on how you judge it are autocracies. So, they have despots that run them. And when you have a company that is two billion users and your value, the force value, most valuable company in the world, their value comes on how many users they have and how much they are used.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CLELAND: And so if a country, autocratic company says, hey, you do this, they complied. Meanwhile, they are saying, we are neutral and we're not political.</p><p>CARLSON: But they engage in censorship on behalf of authoritarian governments.</p><p>CLELAND: Yes, because that is the deal they have made is they know that they are valuable because of how many people use them.</p><p>CARLSON: So, they suck up to dictators in order to make money, but we have to trust them. As the largest news organization in history not to sensor our news, to influence us with propaganda. Why would we trust them to do that?</p><p>CLELAND: Well, you know, like anything, you need to take anything with a grain of salt. The reason you shouldn't address them here is, on fake news and fake ads, you know, you say, how could that happen? Well, they are the most profitable ads because somebody designed them to be viral, meaning that they were like click bait or, you know, just something that people can't resist. And that is algorithmically detectable.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CLELAND: When you see somebody who is doing viral stuff and it is of a certain type, an algorithm can figure it out because it is a pattern. And so, what is, you know, really I think a problem here is that they are like an arms merchant in a war where they make their most money when people are politically divided, and they make less if people are passionate and at peace.</p><p>CARLSON: It sounds ominous that they have more power than any information company has ever had.</p><p>Scott, thank you for that.</p><p>CLELAND: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: For all the work you have done on it. \"Final Exam\" is next. Which of these two DC news aficionados has actually been paying attention to the news this week? Only one can win. We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: Despite our claims, there is a test on the show. Time now for \"Final Exam.\" We find out whether the people who work in the news actually read and retain the news. This week, special edition. We have a clash of foreign policy experts.</p><p>Marie Harf of course is a former spokesperson for the Obama State Department, she will be facing off with <person><nameText>FOX News </nameText></person>State Department correspondent Rich Edson. Holy smokes! Here are the rules. I'm not going to ask if your nervous because I can feel it coming off in waves.</p><p>RICH EDSON, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: I have been studying all week for this examination and I am prepared.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CARLSON: I actually got money with the cameramen on this. I'm not going to win. Okay. Put your hands on the buzzers, I'm going to ask the questions. The first one to press down on the buzzer will get to answer it.</p><p>MARIE HARF, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: Okay.</p><p>CARLSON: We'll go to the tape to show whether you are right or not. Each correct answer is worth a point. Each incorrect answer detracts a point from your total. There are five questions. The person with the most wins. All right? You ready?</p><p>HARF: Ready.</p><p>CARLSON: Here we go. Question one. NFL players are not the only ones taking a knee this week. On the floor of the House of Representatives, this Texas Congresswoman dropped to her knee in protest of the President. Who was it?</p><p>EDSON: Jackson Lee?</p><p>CARLSON: Jackson Lee says Rich Edson. Let's go to the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D), TEXAS: I kneel in honor of them. I kneel in honor of the First Amendment. I kneel because the flag is a symbol of freedom. I kneel because I am going to stand against racism.</p><p>HARF: Rich Edson watching c-span all day.</p><p>EDSON: Yes. The State Department TV, there is nothing else to watch.</p><p>CARLSON: That was the sum total of her legislative achievement in this Congress, by the way.</p><p>EDSON: Okay.</p><p>CARLSON: The first point goes to you, Mr. Edson.</p><p>EDSON: Do I control the board?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARLSON: Which is right here. This week, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee announced he will not seek reelection next year. Reports have emerged that Super Bowl-winning quarterback --</p><p>HARF: Peyton Manning.</p><p>CARLSON: Peyton manning!</p><p>HARF: I hit it first!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Bob Corker is retiring at the end of his term in 2018. One name already floating around to replace him, NFL legend Peyton Manning.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Peyton Manning, senator!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know if I can participate. Did you -- okay, because you seemed to hit it first, but your light went off, and you guessed Peyton Manning as well. We're going to award you each a point. I'm going to override the judges on this. That is right.</p><p>EDSON: We are good.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. Perfect. We need to fix those lights, clearly. Okay. Third question, with its transgender document leaker was just turned away at the Canadian border because of a criminal record. Marie Harf?</p><p>HARF: Chelsea Manning.</p><p>CARLSON: Chelsea Manning! To the tape we go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Canada welcomes refugees with open arms but is leaving Chelsea Manning at the door. The convicted government leaker says, the country denied her entry because it considers her crimes to be treason.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Holy smokes. So, now we have two-two, with only three questions answered, we have a total of four points on the board. It is a weird mathematical alchemy. Next question, which Supreme Court justice is blaming Hillary Clinton's loss on sexism?</p><p>EDSON: Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p><p>CARLSON: Ruth Bader Ginsburg says Rich Edson. To the tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You think sexism played a role in that campaign?</p><p>RUTH BADER GINSBURG, JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT: Do I think so?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>GINSBURG: I have no doubt that it did.</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>There are so many things that might have been decisive, but that was a major, major factor.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: There are no trouble that we should point out on the Supreme Court and you're correct.

On the final question, I'm going to ask, I complete the question before you buzz in.</p><p>HARF: Okay.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay. Here we go. Here's a multiple choice. Women in Saudi Arabia now have the right to drive. Men can begin driving at the age of 18. How old do Saudi women have to be before getting a license? Here are the choices? Is it 15?

That was very impressive to you both.</p><p>HARF: I'm never going to live that down.</p><p>CARLSON: Rich Edson.</p><p>EDSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: You win.

But while the United States continues to outperform other advanced economies, this success has yet to dispel many Americans' persistent sense of economic insecurity and frustration; nor does it alleviate concerns about the lack of policy space to respond to the next economic downturn or financial shock.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The current expansion began in mid-2009, following the 2008 financial crisis and the \"Great Recession.\" Powered initially by exceptional fiscal interventions and previously unthinkable monetary policies, the economy built enough of a foundation for private-sector confidence to return, and for corporate balance sheets to recover. Coupled with accelerating advances in new technologies, the expansion came to be led in large part by technology and platform firms presiding over the new \"gig economy.\" It was given further impetus by pro-growth measures, including deregulation and tax cuts.</p><p>With the U.S. unemployment rate at 3.6 percent, real (inflation-adjusted) wages are now growing at 1.6 percent. And with the most recent quarterly data indicating an annualized GDP growth rate of 3.1 percent, U.S. economic activity continues to outpace that of Europe and Japan by a significant margin. Owing to this strength, America has become increasingly assertive in pursuing national objectives abroad, including by circumventing longstanding cooperative and conflict-resolution mechanisms and threatening import tariffs and other protectionist measures.</p><p>To get to this point, the U.S. had to overcome headwinds from abroad, including an existential debt crisis in Europe and slowing economic growth in China. Domestically, deep political polarization, especially since 2011, has impeded congressional legislative activity and produced multiple actual or threatened government shutdowns (including the longest on record). In the absence of new pro-growth measures from Congress, monetary policy became the \"only game in town.\" After being forced to expand its role in the economy substantially during the crisis years, the U.S. Federal Reserve flirted with some major policy mistakes, and became more vulnerable to political interference.</p><p>Because annual growth over the past decade has often been tepid and insufficiently inclusive - what has become known as the \"new normal,\" or secular stagnation - the U.S. economy has been left with a residual sense of underperformance and potential vulnerability. According to an oft-cited Fed survey, almost half of U.S. households report having insufficient savings to cover a $400 emergency expense.</p><p>No wonder trust in institutions and expert opinion remains so low. Coupled with excessive inequality (of income, wealth and opportunity), frustration and political anger remain high. Making matters worse, fearmongering about the implications of technology and globalization continues to fuel concerns of job dislocations and disruptions. And outside the U.S., many have come to worry that the superpower responsible for issuing the global reserve currency, and that plays a decisive role in many multilateral interactions, is no longer a reliable and predictable anchor for global trade and finance. Moreover, unlike in prior expansions, the U.S. is yet to build sufficient buffers to deal with future economic and financial challenges. Or, to quote former U.S. President John F. Kennedy by way of IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde more recently, we have not fixed the roof while the sun was shining.</p><p>Beyond the lack of self-insurance at the household level, the Fed's ability to counter economic recessions and financial disruptions is rather limited. Whereas the current policy rate is 2.25-2.5 percent, past downturns have usually required cuts of 5 percentage points or more. Also, the Fed has a bloated balance sheet and a rather weak mechanism for transmitting monetary policy measures to the real economy. And even if fiscal policymakers were to become more responsive, they would be starting from a point of relatively high deficits and debt.</p><p>Prolonging the current expansion will require great care. Policymakers, particularly Congress, need to avoid big mistakes and minimize the risk of market accidents while doing more to promote growth. The U.S. needs a well-targeted approach to modernizing and upgrading its infrastructure.</p><p>Policymakers and leading economists also must be more sensitive to how the fruits of economic growth are shared; among other things, there should be better protections for the most vulnerable segments of society and stronger automatic stabilizers. Businesses, for their part, need to do more to embrace their social responsibilities, if only to avoid ending up in the same position as the banks after the 2008 crash. There is already a growing chorus calling for more regulatory constraints on Big Tech.</p><p>Moreover, having shaken up global trade, the U.S. needs to ensure that it will remain the anchor of the rules-based international system. Otherwise, its ability to inform and influence economic and financial outcomes around the world will weaken.</p><p>The U.S. will - and should - soon be celebrating its longest-ever expansion. But it must not lose sight of its remaining challenges. The last thing the world needs right now is for today's expansion to give way to a sustained period of lower growth, higher financial instability and greater cross-border tensions.</p><p>Mohamed A.

On November 1st executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter will testify before the House Intelligence Committee about how their platforms were used by Russia's government during last year's election. Politicians on both sides of the aisle, though they see eye-to-eye on very little, seem to agree that giant internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google may pose a threat to society. \"If data is the new oil, is [Amazon's Jeff] Bezos the new Rockefeller?\" asks Bruce Mehlman, a Republican lobbyist, in a report called \"Navigating the New Gilded Age\", which is circulating in Washington.</p><p>Democrats, long backers of the tech sector's innovative products, are no longer the allies they used to be. When Barack Obama was president techies got plum jobs in his administration, and the party's supposedly superior data analytics seemed destined to help lock in an emerging Democratic majority. That warmth disappeared last November. Most Democrats believe Twitter, Google and Facebook helped put a Republican in the White House by boosting disinformation campaigns. A recent paper by the Computational Propaganda Project at Oxford University found that Twitter-users in swing states were just as likely to come across conspiratorial fictions in the run-up to the presidential election as they were to encounter something that passed for news. Liberal anti-tech sentiment in Washington was stoked in August, when a critic of Google's dominance, Barry Lynn, was fired from the New America Foundation, a think-tank, supposedly because executives at Google, a donor, wanted him gone (New America denies this). </p><p>Several Democratic senators are rallying supporters by taking sharp public jabs against tech firms' dominance. The odds are \"very high\" that the Democratic nominee for president in 2020 will run on an anti-tech platform, promising to break up the big companies, predicts Rob Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think-tank.</p><p>Meanwhile, Republicans have also turned more hostile. In the past they could be counted on to approach regulation with a light touch, but today's populist Republicans are not so hands-off. President Donald Trump has sent tweets beating up Amazon and other tech firms; his former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, has suggested regulating Google and Facebook as utilities. Fox News and other right-leaning outlets have begun to criticise tech with the venom they once reserved for Hillary Clinton. Tech bosses have also clashed with Republicans over immigration policy. \"Can tech just find one issue that's supportive of Republicans?\" laments a disconsolate Republican lobbyist. </p><p>Giant firms tend to attract scrutiny. However, unlike other huge companies, which create jobs in many states, internet firms employ fewer people per dollar of market value and concentrate those jobs mainly in thriving tech hubs. Techies' tremendous wealth has made it easy to draw comparisons to last century's robber barons. Consumers may benefit from their free products and from low prices, but small businesses have been hurt by the tech giants' incursions into a wide array of industries, which can influence politicians. According to one estimate, Amazon captures half of all dollars spent online. Google and Facebook have captured virtually all the growth in digital advertising.</p><p>So far America's techlash has consisted of more rhetoric than regulation. One exception concerns a proposal to regulate online political advertising. Two Democratic senators, Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner, and one Republican, John McCain, recently introduced the Honest Ads Act, which aims to require online political ads to include information about who paid for them. Political ads on television, in print and on the radio must already do this, but Google and Facebook had successfully lobbied to be exempted from the requirement. </p><p>Bringing transparency to online political advertising is sensible, because more money will be spent on internet ads in future elections. This year digital advertising accounts for around 35% of total advertising spending in America. This will not rectify the larger problem, which concerns the ease with which Facebook, Twitter and Google spread fiction masquerading as news. After the recent shooting in Las Vegas, users who typed \"Las Vegas shooting\" into YouTube, which is owned by Google, were prompted to click on videos claiming that the shooter was secretly working for the government.</p><p>Compared with regulation aimed at holding companies responsible for spreading false information, the advertising bill ought to be fairly painless for tech companies to accept. That does not mean they will. Big tech companies have so far resisted any legislation that treats them like media companies, and have taken the minimum action necessary to appear co-operative. Facebook has found that Russian entities spent around $100,000 on ads in the election of 2016. But there is still more digging to do. Congressional leaders would be wise to demand an exhaustive audit of all political ads on the social network in order to see the extent of Russia's purchases, says a top executive of a large advertising agency, who believes Facebook's initial review and report to Congress were cursory. </p><p>In Europe America's tech giants have faced regulation and antitrust action. The European Commission levied a ?2.4bn ($2.7bn) fine on Google for abusing its monopoly position in online search. Is Washington likely to follow Europe's path? In spite of the heated rhetoric similar enforcement measures, or sweeping new regulations, are several years away at least. Apart from the Honest Ads Act, the only other legislation that seems likely in the near term is a tax cut, which would benefit tech firms by making it easier to repatriate profits, says Blair Levin, a former official at the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>Although there may be more calls to break up tech monopolies, there is not any real political appetite to do so. Nor is it clear that, under current law, trustbusters would succeed even if they tried. The likeliest impact will eventually be on the ability of tech firms to pursue acquisitions and mergers, although this has not happened yet. Amazon's $13.7bn bid for Whole Foods, a grocer, was approved by regulators without much protest. Facebook recently announced that it was buying TBH, a nascent social-polling firm, for an undisclosed sum. Some pundits, such as Ben Thompson of Stratechery, a technology blog, have called for the deal to be blocked, arguing that social-media firms should not be allowed to buy one another. But it is unlikely that regulators in the Trump administration will take such a view.</p><p>Perceiving future risk, internet firms want to do all they can to fight the souring mood and win political allies. They have spent around $50m on lobbying so far in 2017. More than half of that comes from Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon and Facebook combined. One of their tactics is to hire not just more lobbyists but also more employees. Amazon has started an advertising campaign to market its job creation: it has plans to hire an additional 100,000 people by mid-2018. But many of these jobs will probably be automated eventually. The e-commerce firm, which is based in Seattle, has also announced that it will open a second headquarters in North America, which would be a boon to any city it chooses. Around 240 cities and regions have submitted proposals. While Amazon contemplates its choice, it is enjoying a temporary boost in popularity among members of Congress.</p><p>Other firms are also proposing local projects as a way to curry favour with politicians. Microsoft is helping bring high-speed internet to rural areas. Google has run a programme called Google Fiber to roll out high-speed internet locally, although the project is on hold while it searches for a new boss. Facebook recently said it would spend $1bn to build a data centre in Virginia. But the new digital economy does not create many human jobs directly. Only around 100 Virginians will be needed to work at the data centre once it is built. Denso, a Japanese car-parts maker, recently announced that it would spend $1bn to build a manufacturing plant in Tennessee, creating ten times as many jobs as Facebook's data centre will. </p><p>While heavy regulation of tech does not seem likely in the near term, political winds can change quickly and unpredictably. If a national data breach occurred at Facebook, Google or Amazon, exposing people's personal information, as recently occurred with the credit-reporting firm Equifax, there could be a strong public outcry and greater urgency to impose regulations to ensure privacy. What helps protect internet firms today is that they have remained generally popular among consumers by offering cheap services and widely used products. But if a crunch comes, the big tech companies may find themselves haunted by their behaviour now. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-A96QR22</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PTC-N3S1-DY2R-237W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.
