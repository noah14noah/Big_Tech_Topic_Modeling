It is happy hour and the cosmopolitans are half price. Like most young Chinese, the two twenty-somethings' conversation is punctuated by frantic bursts of tapping on their mobile phones. It's a scene repeated the world over - with one difference. Few of us would recognise a single thing on their touchscreens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The blinking apps they are checking have unfamiliar names and logos. Toutiao or Douyin, anyone? There are none of the symbols we are used to here: no Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google. Nor Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube, Skype or Uber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is a simple explanation, of course. \"Most are banned,\" Shi said, forcing an embarrassed smile. Most western firms are still unable to breach the great firewall of China, Beijing's strict censorship barrier.</p><p>That is no problem, however. Indeed, many Chinese think it a blessing because it has forced local firms to stop copying western rivals and innovate. As a result, many Chinese apps and services are now better than their foreign counterparts. Huawei handsets outperform Apple's and China is ahead on 5G, mobile money and artificial intelligence (AI), prompting US tech bible Wired to run a cover story headlined: \"It's time to copy China.\"</p><p>Amid all the whizziness, there is a dark side. You see it the moment you check into your hotel. Notices list some of the websites you \"might have difficulty accessing due to Chinese internet regulations\". They include the BBC, Wikipedia and Bloomberg.</p><p>And you don't have to be paranoid to wonder whether it is a great idea for the multipurpose WeChat app that almost everyone in China uses to have a record of pretty much everything they do.</p><p>Beijing confirmed last week it plans to use citizens' digital footprints to create \"social credit\" ratings. Those with high scores - earned by, say, paying bills on time and avoiding parking fines - will be given speedier access to state services. It has been condemnded as Big Brother made real.</p><p>What exercises investors, however, is whether the Chinese firms will be able to vault the great firewall and expand across the world - or whether Silicon Valley can succeed in China. The prize - global tech domination - could scarcely be greater.</p><p>Chinese tech is fizzing. Mobile phone and telecoms giant Huawei - second only to Samsung in global handset sales - is setting new standards with the best triple-lens Leica camera and battery charging technology. It will launch the first mobile phone with a folding screen next year, and is leading the race to develop 5G, the next-generation mobile standard offering download speed 100 times faster than 4G - a leap forward essential to the development of \"the internet of things\".</p><p>The apps on Ju's handset are worthy of the epithet \"killer\". WeChat blends voice calls, email, ecommerce, social media, banking, insurance, text messaging, video conferencing, gaming, music, news and weather, smart city services, dating, doctor and hospital appointments, transport, government and local authority services and restaurant booking. She can do or find pretty much anything in seconds. \"It keeps my life easy and fast,\" she said.</p><p>Chinese consumers spend an average of three hours a day on WeChat's \"magic button\", which earlier this year helped to catapult its creator, Tencent - run by Ma Huateng, known as Pony Ma - to fifth spot in the list of the world's largest tech companies by market capitalisation, overtaking Facebook and behind only Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. It has since fallen back.</p><p>Electronic payment systems - notably Alipay, a spinoff from Alibaba, China's Amazon, which Shi uses to buy the cocktails - are streets ahead of anything in Europe or America. Mobile phone payments are now so popular (they reached $12.7 trillion, or \u00a39.9 trillion, in China last year) that cash is a rare sight on the streets of many large cities.</p><p>Add in drones, robotics and self-driving car technology - sectors in which Chinese firms are bounding ahead - and it is easy to see why Alpha Xu, 33, who runs a global internet marketing firm, ASAP+, rates Chinese tech as \"9 out of 10 while the US is 6-7\". Why such a low score for the US? \"Lots of people in America are not very digital. They still use cheques,\" he replied, laughing. When did he last write a cheque? \"More than 10 years ago.\"</p><p>How have China's \"Bats\" - Baidu, the dominant search engine, Alibaba and Tencent - expanded so far, so fast? China offers structural advantages. Its vast population - it has 800m internet users - encourages entrepreneurs to think big. Take Wanxiang, a huge car-parts manufacturer. To help develop autonomous cars, it is building a \u00a323bn \"smart city\" in Hangzhou. Try doing that in Coventry.</p><p>Beijing is four-square behind big tech. President Xi Jinping has made AI one of the central pillars of the Communist Party's \"Made in China 2025\" plan to transform the economy.</p><p>Chinese attitudes to data privacy are very different from those in Europe or America. \"The government can see everything, but we think it is not to monitor us, but to protect us,\" said Xu. This gives innovators a free hand to develop whatever products they want, safe in the knowledge that, if consumers like them, they will not hesitate to snap them up.</p><p>Entrepreneurs and staff work punishing hours. Chinese start-ups have adopted a schedule called 996 - 9am to 9pm, six days a week. No one walks out in protest against workplace injustice, as Google staff worldwide did recently.</p><p>If Chinese firms are to expand globally, they will have to convince western governments and consumers that their kit and apps are not a back door for Beijing's spies. Chinese firms have a bad record when it comes to techno-snooping.</p><p>Huawei and telecoms equipment firm ZTE are trying to break into the 5G market in Europe and the US, with some success. In Britain, Huawei is trialling 5G with mobile provider Three.</p><p>Alipay has signed a deal with US payment infrastructure company First Data to install Alipay devices in the stores of some US retailers. Its rival, WeChat Pay, is expanding partnerships with shopping malls in Paris and in Hokkaido, Japan.</p><p>But Washington, irked by what it sees as intellectual property theft as much as fear of espionage, is using tech as a key weapon in its broader trade war with Beijing. US telecoms networks have been banned from buying Huawei equipment, and mobile companies ordered not to sell Huawei handsets with data contracts.</p><p>Earlier this year, President Donald Trump torpedoed a $1.2bn bid by Ant Financial, the payments arm of Alibaba, to buy Dallas-based MoneyGram. He also blocked a $142bn hostile bid for US chip-maker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States warned that the deal could end up giving Chinese firms an advantage in 5G technology.</p><p>If western firms are to make it in the world's biggest, fastest-growing consumer tech market, they are going to have to compromise with Beijing's censors, which many of their staff and shareholders bitterly oppose.</p><p>Apple has opened stores all over China but has been criticised for agreeing to stop selling VPN software, which enables users to access banned websites, on its Chinese app store.</p><p>The Cupertino-based giant has also agreed to comply with a new local law and hand over the management of customers' data on iCloud in China to a state company. Tim Cook, Apple's boss, insists that \"no back doors will be created into any of our systems\" and it will ensure \"strong data privacy\".</p><p>Waymo, the autonomous driving unit of Alphabet, recently won approval to operate self-driving cars in Shanghai. Google is considering following that success by launching a partially censored version of its search engine, reversing its decision in 2010 to pull out in protest at Beijing's censorship and attempts to hack into the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. The move has prompted staff protests and resignations.</p><p>Both China's Greater Bay Area - a network of southern tech hubs - and America's San Francisco Bay Area are ready for the future. The question is: whose?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-49519033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTH-0SS1-JCJY-G1FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1361\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 25, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

It is happy hour and the cosmopolitans are half price. Like most young Chinese, the two twentysomethings' conversation is punctuated by frantic bursts of tapping on their mobile phones. It's a scene repeated the world over - with one difference. Few of us would recognise a single thing on their touchscreens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The blinking apps they are checking have unfamiliar names and logos. Toutiao or Douyin, anyone? There are none of the symbols we are used to here: no Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google. Nor Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube, Skype or Uber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is a simple explanation, of course. \"Most are banned,\" Shi said, forcing an embarrassed smile. Most western firms are still unable to breach the great firewall of China, Beijing's strict censorship barrier.</p><p>That is no problem, however. Indeed, many Chinese think it a blessing because it has forced local firms to stop copying western rivals and innovate. As a result, many Chinese apps and services are now better than their foreign counterparts. Huawei handsets outperform Apple's and China is ahead on 5G, mobile money and artificial intelligence (AI), prompting US tech bible Wired to run a cover story headlined: \"It's time to copy China.\"</p><p>Amid all the whizziness, there is a dark side. You see it the moment you check into your hotel. Notices list some of the websites you \"might have difficulty accessing due to Chinese internet regulations\". They include the BBC, Wikipedia and Bloomberg.</p><p>And you don't have to be paranoid to wonder whether it is a great idea for the multipurpose WeChat app that almost everyone in China uses to have a record of pretty much everything they do.</p><p>Beijing confirmed last week it plans to use citizens' digital footprints to create \"social credit\" ratings. Those with high scores - earned by, say, paying bills on time and avoiding parking fines - will be given speedier access to state services. It has been condemnded as Big Brother made real.</p><p>What exercises investors, however, is whether the Chinese firms will be able to vault the great firewall and expand across the world - or whether Silicon Valley can succeed in China. The prize - global tech domination - could scarcely be greater.</p><p>Chinese tech is fizzing. Mobile phone and telecoms giant Huawei - second only to Samsung in global handset sales - is setting new standards with the best triple-lens Leica camera and battery charging technology. It will launch the first mobile phone with a folding screen next year, and is leading the race to develop 5G, the next-generation mobile standard offering download speed 100 times faster than 4G - a leap forward essential to the development of \"the internet of things\".</p><p>The apps on Ju's handset are worthy of the epithet \"killer\". WeChat blends voice calls, email, ecommerce, social media, banking, insurance, text messaging, video conferencing, gaming, music, news and weather, smart city services, dating, doctor and hospital appointments, transport, government and local authority services and restaurant booking. She can do or find pretty much anything in seconds. \"It keeps my life easy and fast,\" she said.</p><p>Chinese consumers spend an average of three hours a day on WeChat's \"magic button\", which earlier this year helped to catapult its creator, Tencent - run by Ma Huateng, known as Pony Ma - to fifth spot in the list of the world's largest tech companies by market capitalisation, overtaking Facebook and behind only Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. It has since fallen back. Electronic payment systems - notably Alipay, a spinoff from Alibaba, China's Amazon, which Shi uses to buy the cocktails - are streets ahead of anything in Europe or America. Mobile phone payments are now so popular (they reached $12.7 trillion, or \u00a39.9 trillion, in China last year) that cash is a rare sight on the streets of many large cities.</p><p>Add in drones, robotics and self-driving car technology - sectors in which Chinese firms are bounding ahead - and it is easy to see why Alpha Xu, 33, who runs a global internet marketing firm, ASAP+, rates Chinese tech as \"9 out of 10 while the US is 6-7\". Why such a low score for the US? \"Lots of people in America are not very digital. They still use cheques,\" he replied, laughing. When did he last write a cheque? \"More than 10 years ago.\"</p><p>How have China's \"Bats\" - Baidu, the dominant search engine, Alibaba and Tencent - expanded so far, so fast? China offers structural advantages. Its vast population - it has 800m internet users - encourages entrepreneurs to think big.</p><p>Take Wanxiang, a huge car-parts manufacturer. To help develop autonomous cars, it is building a \u00a323bn \"smart city\" in Hangzhou. Try doing that in Coventry.</p><p>Beijing is four-square behind big tech.</p><p>President Xi Jinping has made AI one of the central pillars of the Communist Party's \"Made in China 2025\" plan to transform the economy.</p><p>Chinese attitudes to data privacy are very different from those in Europe or America. \"The government can see everything, but we think it is not to monitor us, but to protect us,\" said Xu. This gives innovators a free hand to develop whatever products they want, safe in the knowledge that, if consumers like them, they will not hesitate to snap them up.</p><p>Entrepreneurs and staff work punishing hours. Chinese start-ups have adopted a schedule called 996 - 9am to 9pm, six days a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.week.No\">www.week.No</url> one walks out in protest against workplace injustice, as Google staff worldwide did recently.</p><p>If Chinese firms are to expand globally, they will have to convince western governments and consumers that their kit and apps are not a back door for Beijing's spies. Chinese firms have a bad record when it comes to techno-snooping.</p><p>Huawei and telecoms equipment firm ZTE are trying to break into the 5G market in Europe and the US, with some success. In Britain, Huawei is trialling 5G with mobile provider Three.</p><p>Alipay has signed a deal with US payment infrastructure company First Data to install Alipay devices in the stores of some US retailers. Its rival, WeChat Pay, is expanding partnerships with shopping malls in Paris and in Hokkaido, Japan.</p><p>But Washington, irked by what it sees as intellectual property theft as much as fear of espionage, is using tech as a key weapon in its broader trade war with Beijing. US telecoms networks have been banned from buying Huawei equipment, and mobile companies ordered not to sell Huawei handsets with data contracts.</p><p>Earlier this year, President Donald Trump torpedoed a $1.2bn bid by Ant Financial, the payments arm of Alibaba, to buy Dallas-based MoneyGram. He also blocked a $142bn hostile bid for US chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States warned that the deal could end up giving Chinese firms an advantage in 5G technology.</p><p>If western firms are to make it in the world's biggest, fastest-growing consumer tech market, they are going to have to compromise with Beijing's censors, which many of their staff and shareholders bitterly oppose.</p><p>Apple has opened stores all over China but has been criticised for agreeing to stop selling VPN software, which enables users to access banned websites, on its Chinese app store.</p><p>The Cupertino-based giant has also agreed to comply with a new local law and hand over the management of customers' data on iCloud in China to a state company. Tim Cook, Apple's boss, insists that \"no back doors will be created into any of our systems\" and it will ensure \"strong data privacy\".</p><p>Waymo, the autonomous driving unit of Alphabet, recently won approval to operate self-driving cars in Shanghai. Google is considering following that success by launching a partially censored version of its search engine, reversing its decision in 2010 to pull out in protest at Beijing's censorship and attempts to hack into the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. The move has prompted staff protests and resignations.</p><p>Both China's Greater Bay Area - a network of southern tech hubs - and America's San Francisco Bay Area are ready for the future. The question is: whose?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ma Huateng, head of Tencent, and Apple chief executive Tim CookILLUSTRATION: JAMES COWEN</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-143951729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSG-W371-DYTY-C38R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1361\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 25, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

They include the BBC, Wikipedia and Bloomberg.</p><p>And you don't have to be paranoid to wonder whether it is a great idea for the multipurpose WeChat app that almost everyone in China uses to have a record of pretty much everything they do.</p><p>Beijing confirmed last week it plans to use citizens' digital footprints to create \"social credit\" ratings. Those with high scores - earned by, say, paying bills on time and avoiding parking fines - will be given speedier access to state services. It has been condemnded as Big Brother made real.</p><p>What exercises investors, however, is whether the Chinese firms will be able to vault the great firewall and expand across the world - or whether Silicon Valley can succeed in China. The prize - global tech domination - could scarcely be greater.</p><p>Chinese tech is fizzing. Mobile phone and telecoms giant Huawei - second only to Samsung in global handset sales - is setting new standards with the best triple-lens Leica camera and battery charging technology. It will launch the first mobile phone with a folding screen next year, and is leading the race to develop 5G, the next-generation mobile standard offering download speed 100 times faster than 4G - a leap forward essential to the development of \"the internet of things\".</p><p>The apps on Ju's handset are worthy of the epithet \"killer\". WeChat blends voice calls, email, ecommerce, social media, banking, insurance, text messaging, video conferencing, gaming, music, news and weather, smart city services, dating, doctor and hospital appointments, transport, government and local authority services and restaurant booking. She can do or find pretty much anything in seconds. \"It keeps my life easy and fast,\" she said.</p><p>Chinese consumers spend an average of three hours a day on WeChat's \"magic button\", which earlier this year helped to catapult its creator, Tencent - run by Ma Huateng, known as Pony Ma - to fifth spot in the list of the world's largest tech companies by market capitalisation, overtaking Facebook and behind only Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. It has since fallen back. Electronic payment systems - notably Alipay, a spinoff from Alibaba, China's Amazon, which Shi uses to buy the cocktails - are streets ahead of anything in Europe or America. Mobile phone payments are now so popular (they reached $12.7 trillion, or \u00a39.9 trillion, in China last year) that cash is a rare sight on the streets of many large cities.</p><p>Add in drones, robotics and self-driving car technology - sectors in which Chinese firms are bounding ahead - and it is easy to see why Alpha Xu, 33, who runs a global internet marketing firm, ASAP+, rates Chinese tech as \"9 out of 10 while the US is 6-7\". Why such a low score for the US? \"Lots of people in America are not very digital. They still use cheques,\" he replied, laughing. When did he last write a cheque? \"More than 10 years ago.\"</p><p>How have China's \"Bats\" - Baidu, the dominant search engine, Alibaba and Tencent - expanded so far, so fast? China offers structural advantages. Its vast population - it has 800m internet users - encourages entrepreneurs to think big.</p><p>Take Wanxiang, a huge car-parts manufacturer. To help develop autonomous cars, it is building a \u00a323bn \"smart city\" in Hangzhou. Try doing that in Coventry.</p><p>Beijing is four-square behind big tech.</p><p>President Xi Jinping has made AI one of the central pillars of the Communist Party's \"Made in China 2025\" plan to transform the economy.</p><p>Chinese attitudes to data privacy are very different from those in Europe or America. \"The government can see everything, but we think it is not to monitor us, but to protect us,\" said Xu. This gives innovators a free hand to develop whatever products they want, safe in the knowledge that, if consumers like them, they will not hesitate to snap them up.</p><p>Entrepreneurs and staff work punishing hours. Chinese start-ups have adopted a schedule called 996 - 9am to 9pm, six days a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.week.No\">www.week.No</url> one walks out in protest against workplace injustice, as Google staff worldwide did recently.</p><p>If Chinese firms are to expand globally, they will have to convince western governments and consumers that their kit and apps are not a back door for Beijing's spies. Chinese firms have a bad record when it comes to techno-snooping.</p><p>Huawei and telecoms equipment firm ZTE are trying to break into the 5G market in Europe and the US, with some success. In Britain, Huawei is trialling 5G with mobile provider Three.</p><p>Alipay has signed a deal with US payment infrastructure company First Data to install Alipay devices in the stores of some US retailers. Its rival, WeChat Pay, is expanding partnerships with shopping malls in Paris and in Hokkaido, Japan.</p><p>But Washington, irked by what it sees as intellectual property theft as much as fear of espionage, is using tech as a key weapon in its broader trade war with Beijing. US telecoms networks have been banned from buying Huawei equipment, and mobile companies ordered not to sell Huawei handsets with data contracts.</p><p>Earlier this year, President Donald Trump torpedoed a $1.2bn bid by Ant Financial, the payments arm of Alibaba, to buy Dallas-based MoneyGram. He also blocked a $142bn hostile bid for US chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States warned that the deal could end up giving Chinese firms an advantage in 5G technology.</p><p>If western firms are to make it in the world's biggest, fastest-growing consumer tech market, they are going to have to compromise with Beijing's censors, which many of their staff and shareholders bitterly oppose.</p><p>Apple has opened stores all over China but has been criticised for agreeing to stop selling VPN software, which enables users to access banned websites, on its Chinese app store.</p><p>The Cupertino-based giant has also agreed to comply with a new local law and hand over the management of customers' data on iCloud in China to a state company. Tim Cook, Apple's boss, insists that \"no back doors will be created into any of our systems\" and it will ensure \"strong data privacy\".</p><p>Waymo, the autonomous driving unit of Alphabet, recently won approval to operate self-driving cars in Shanghai. Google is considering following that success by launching a partially censored version of its search engine, reversing its decision in 2010 to pull out in protest at Beijing's censorship and attempts to hack into the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. The move has prompted staff protests and resignations.</p><p>Both China's Greater Bay Area - a network of southern tech hubs - and America's San Francisco Bay Area are ready for the future.

It's happy hour and the cosmopolitans are half-price. Like most young Chinese, the two twentysomethings' conversation is punctuated by frantic bursts of tapping on their mobile phones. It's a scene repeated the world over - with one difference. Few of us would recognise a single thing on their touchscreens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The blinking apps they are checking have unfamiliar names and logos. Toutiao or Douyin, anyone? There are none of the symbols we are used to here: no Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google. Nor Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube, Skype or Uber. There's a simple explanation, of course. \"Most are banned,\" Shi said. Most western firms are still unable to breach the great firewall of China, Beijing's strict censorship barrier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is no problem, however. Indeed, many Chinese think it a blessing because it has forced local firms to stop copying western rivals and innovate. As a result, many Chinese apps and services are now better than their foreign counterparts. Huawei handsets outperform Apple's and China is ahead on 5G, mobile money and artificial intelligence (AI), prompting US tech bible Wired to run a cover story headlined: \"It's time to copy China.\"</p><p>Amid all the whizziness, there is a dark side. You see it the moment you check into your hotel. Notices list some of the websites you \"might have difficulty accessing due to Chinese internet regulations\". They include the BBC, Wikipedia and Bloomberg.</p><p>And you don't have to be paranoid to wonder whether it is a great idea for the multipurpose WeChat app that almost everyone in China uses to have a record of pretty much everything they do. Beijing confirmed last week it plans to use citizens' digital footprints to create \"social credit\" ratings. Those with high scores - earned by, say, paying bills on time and avoiding parking fines - will get speedier access to state services. It has been called Big Brother made real.</p><p>What exercises investors, however, is whether the Chinese firms will be able to vault the great firewall and expand across the world, or whether Silicon Valley will have a chance in China. The prize - global tech domination - could scarcely be greater. Mobile phone and telecoms giant Huawei - second only to Samsung in global handset sales - is setting new standards with the best triple-lens Leica cameras and battery charging technology. It will launch the first mobile phone with a folding screen next year, and is leading the race to develop 5G, the nextgeneration mobile standard offering download speed 100 times faster than 4G.</p><p>The apps on Ju's handset are worthy of the epithet \"killer\". WeChat blends voice calls, email, ecommerce, social media, banking, insurance, text messaging, video conferencing, gaming, music, news and weather, smart city services, dating, doctor and hospital appointments, transport, government and local authority services and restaurant booking.</p><p>She can do or find pretty much anything in seconds.</p><p>Chinese consumers spend an average of three hours a day on WeChat's \"magic button\", which earlier this year helped to catapult its creator, Tencent - run by Ma Huateng, known as Pony Ma - to fifth spot in the list of the world's largest tech companies by market capitalisation, overtaking Facebook and behind only Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. It has since fallen back. Electronic payment systems - notably Alipay, a spinoff from Alibaba, China's Amazon, which Shi uses to buy the cocktails - are streets ahead of anything in Europe or America. Mobile phone payments are now so popular (they reached $12.7 trillion, or (EURO)11 trillion, in China last year) that cash is now a rare sight on the streets of many Chinese cities. Add in 5G, drones, robotics and self-driving car technology - sectors in which Chinese firms are bounding ahead - and it is easy to see why Alpha Xu, 33, who runs a global internet marketing firm, ASAP+, rates Chinese tech as \"9 out of 10 while the US is 6-7\". Why such a low score for the US? \"Lots of people in America are not very digital. They still use cheques,\" he replied, laughing.</p><p>How have China's \"Bats\" - Baidu, the dominant search engine, Alibaba and Tencent - expanded so far, so fast? China offers structural advantages. Its vast population - it has 800m internet users - encourages entrepreneurs to think big. Take Wanxiang, a huge car-parts manufacturer. To help develop autonomous cars, it is building a (EURO)26bn \"smart city\" in Hangzhou. Beijing is four-square behind big tech. President Xi Jinping has made AI one of the central pillars of the Communist Party's \"Made in China 2025\" plan to transform the economy.</p><p>Chinese attitudes to data privacy are very different from those in Europe or America. \"The government can see everything, but we think it is not to monitor us, but to protect us,\" said Xu. This gives innovators a free hand to develop whatever products they want, safe in the knowledge that, if they like them, consumers will not hesitate to snap them up. Entrepreneurs and staff work punishing hours. Chinese start-ups have adopted a schedule called 996 - 9am to 9pm, six days a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.week.No\">www.week.No</url> one walks out in protest against workplace injustice, as Google staff worldwide did recently.</p><p>If Chinese firms are to expand globally, they will have to convince western governments and consumers that their kit and apps are not a back door for Beijing's spies. Chinese firms have a bad record when it comes to techno-snooping.</p><p>Huawei and telecoms equipment firm ZTE are trying to break into the 5G market in Europe and the US, with some success. In Britain, Huawei is trialling 5G with mobile provider Three. Alipay has signed a deal with US payment infrastructure company First Data to install Alipay devices in the stores of some US retailers. Its rival, WeChat Pay, is expanding partnerships with shopping malls in Paris and in Hokkaido, Japan. But Washington, irked at what it sees as intellectual property theft as much as fear of espionage, is using tech as a key weapon in its broader trade war with Beijing.</p><p>US telecoms networks have been banned from buying Huawei equipment, and mobile phone companies ordered not to sell Huawei handsets with service subscriptions. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump torpedoed a $1.2bn bid by Ant Financial, the payment arm of Alibaba, to buy Dallas-based money transfer outfit MoneyGram. Trump also blocked a $142bn hostile bid for US chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States warned that the deal could end up giving Chinese companies an advantage in 5G technology.</p><p>If western firms are to make it in the world's biggest, fastest-growing consumer tech market, they are going to have to compromise with Beijing's censors, which many of their staff and shareholders bitterly oppose. Apple has opened Apple Stores all over China but has been criticised for agreeing to stop selling VPN software on its Chinese app store that enables users to access banned websites in the country.</p><p>The Cupertino giant has also agreed to comply with a new local law and hand over the management of customers' data on iCloud in China to a state company. Tim Cook, Apple's boss, insists that \"no back doors will be created into any of our systems\" and it will ensure \"strong data privacy\".</p><p>Waymo, the autonomous driving unit of Alphabet, recently won approval to operate self-driving cars in Shanghai. Google is considering following that success by launching a partially censored version of its search engine, reversing its decision in 2010 to pull out in protest at Beijing's censorship and attempts to hack into the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. The move has prompted staff protests and resignations. Both China's Greater Bay Area and America's San Francisco Bay Area are ready for the future.

If we are to continue growing and enrich the lives of our citizens, it must be through innovation.     And if we are to spread the benefits of growth, innovation must be pervasive and not the exclusive preserve of the talented or well-endowed.  Innovation is not a zero-sum game.  It thrives on diversity, collaboration, and openness. </p><p>     There is much we can learn from each other.     France and Singapore have been deepening collaboration in areas such as finance, science, and technology.     2018 was designated as the France-Singapore Year of Innovation.  Today, I want to focus on innovation in financial services.  Globally, the financial industry is facing slower economic growth, tighter regulation, and keener competition.      To overcome these headwinds and contribute to the broader economy, the industry needs to harness technology, foster innovation, and transform itself.     But how to do this, while maintaining the single most important commodity that underpins financial institutions \u2013 trust.  As Stephen Covey said: \u201cStrength lies in differences, not in similarities\u201d. This principle is embodied in the French novel \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d by Alexandre Dumas.      Set in the 17th century, the novel recounts the journey of D\u2019Artagnan, who left for Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard, and how he overcomes all adversities.     Together with him are three musketeers with contrasting personalities:         Athos who is intelligent;         Porthos who is adventurous; and         Aramis who is true and faithful.     But together they form a well-balanced trio that supports D\u2019Artagnan on his journey.  The three musketeers today are Finance, Technology, and Trust, corresponding to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.  Society is D\u2019Artagnan.      Can the three modern musketeers work together to support Society?     Can they complement one another?  Can they click?  Finance - the Astute Musketeer Losing Appeal   Let me introduce the first musketeer - Finance.  Like Athos, Finance is wise but can be complicated, and to some extent, mysterious and non-accessible to many people.  As a result, Finance \u2013 at least in its traditional form - is losing its appeal.      Consumers find that banks\u2019 processes are too cumbersome to navigate.     They are increasingly looking to technology firms for their needs.     Some of them are even losing trust in the ability of banks to act in their interest.  Bill Gates once said: \u201cPeople need banking, not banks\u201d.  It is a reminder that, to survive, Finance needs to be intuitive, innovative and customer-centric.  Technology - the Musketeer who can Transform Finance  This is where the second musketeer \u2013 Technology - comes in.  Technology is akin to Porthos, the fearless musketeer who is eager to try new ways for a better future.  In a similar vein, Technology presents us opportunities to revitalise Finance:      the opportunity to enhance customer experience;     the opportunity to strengthen risk management; and     the opportunity to improve cost efficiency.  Let me elaborate on each of these opportunities.  First, enhancing customer experience.  This has become a critical success factor in many industries, including finance.  Why?  Basically, technology firms have reshaped the way businesses interact with customers.      They have empowered customers and set higher bars for customer satisfaction.     Whether they are established Big Tech firms or small FinTech start-ups, they pose a competitive challenge to financial institutions.  If I have to name one thing these technology firms do very well, much better than financial institutions, it would be that they are obsessively customer-centric.  Tech firms embed themselves in the customer journey and use data analytics to deeply understand customer needs.      They then provide end-to-end solutions, often customised to individual circumstances.     They have agile IT systems, efficient processes, and a culture that emphasises speed.     Essentially, tech firms think of themselves not as being in a particular industry, but as platforms, upon which they provide access to the services their customers need.  Traditional banks tend to be largely product-centric.      The credit card division tries to sell you unsecured credit, the wealth management division tries to sell you mutual funds, the lending division tries to sell you a mortgage.     They start with the product and try to persuade the customer why their product is good for him.     Many banks do not have a complete picture of their customers.     They are weighed down by legacy IT systems and bureaucratic processes.  But several banks are stepping up to the challenge.  Athos is learning from Porthos.      Banks are investing heavily in technology to optimise their operations and enhance their systems.     They are collaborating with technology firms to accelerate the pace of innovation.     They are becoming more customer-centric.  These banks are using technology to provide customised solutions, complete solutions, and seamless solutions.  First, customised solutions to suit the individual needs and characteristics of the customer.  Some banks are experimenting with personalised products and services, not just based on what the customer asks for but by anticipating what the customer might need.      Commonwealth Bank of Australia\u2019s mobile app is using behavioural science to provide customers with financial management advice based on their spending patterns and financial goals.  Some banks are offering personalised interactions at every customer touchpoint.      Royal Bank of Canada has enabled its customers to pay their bills on the mobile app via speech and voice recognition.  Second, complete solutions that are based on the total picture of the customer.  Today\u2019s customers are more sophisticated and want holistic solutions.      In a survey of 10,000 tech-savvy customers, Accenture found that 80% of them want integrated solutions that address both their financial and non-financial needs.     Financial needs are really driven by non-financial desires. People do not desire a housing loan or a fire insurance policy.  People desire a house.  To provide complete, holistic solutions, you need comprehensive customer data and you need a deep understanding of the customer journey.  The customer data that most banks have are simply not sufficient to develop a good understanding of the financial situation or needs of their customers.      Customers have multiple relationships, with deposits and loans, investments, insurance policies, and retirement plans, spread across many financial institutions.     How many financial institutions advising a customer have a complete picture of the customer\u2019s balance sheet \u2013 all his assets and liabilities?  Some banks have started to offer aggregator services which consolidate financial information such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and investments from all the financial institutions serving their customers.      This allows financial institutions to provide holistic financial planning.     BBVA provides its corporate customers with a consolidated view of all their financial information from about 90 financial institutions.  Next, understanding the customer journey.  Some banks have begun to offer their corporate customers complete, end-to-end solutions, based on a keen understanding of their customers\u2019 work processes.      United Overseas Bank in Singapore provides its corporate customers an integrated digital platform that enables the customer to:         generate purchase orders and invoices with a few clicks;         streamline its payroll process; and         get up-to-date views of its financials.      Some banks are positioning themselves as partners with their customers on their life journey, integrating their financial and non-financial needs.      DBS Bank in Singapore provides its customers looking to buy a car an online portal that enables them to calculate their budget, find an affordable car, connect with the seller, get a car loan, and finally purchase a car insurance.  Third, banks are using technology to provide seamless solutions.  This means resolving bottlenecks and providing customers with a frictionless experience.      Banks such as BBVA, Mitsubishi UFJ, and BNP Paribas are using blockchain technology for syndicated loans.     It improves efficiency.           Each step of the loan process, from credit underwriting to credit administration, is documented in the distributed ledger, thereby eliminating the need for duplicative back office processing.         The loan process is shortened from about two weeks to two days.     It also improves trust.         Every record in the distributed ledger has a user code and time stamp.         This creates an audit trail, leading to higher level of trust among the participants.  Let me share two initiatives from the Singapore financial sector, which show that achieving a seamless customer experience often requires collaboration across institutions and inter-operability across systems.  The two key ingredients for a digital transaction are identity authentication and secure payments.  The Singapore government worked closely with the industry to make the customer experience seamless in these two areas.  First, seamless identity authentication through MyInfo.      MyInfo is a government digital service that enables Singapore residents to authorise third-parties to access their personal data residing across different government agencies through APIs.     This means that, with the consent of the customer, banks can use the MyInfo service for more efficient KYC using government-verified personal data.  I can now open a bank account or obtain a credit card - online and instantly - when I give consent to my bank to access my data through MyInfo.      Customers do not need to go through the tedious process of filling up forms and providing hardcopy documents to banks for verification.  And they certainly don\u2019t need to go to the bank branch.     Banks benefit from higher productivity and better risk management.  Second, secure and seamless payments through PayNow.      PayNow was jointly developed by MAS and the banking industry.     It enables individuals and businesses to transfer funds using just the personal ID number or mobile phone number or unique entity number of their recipients.     It operates 24-by-7 and funds can be transferred directly from one bank account to another in real-time.     I can now send money to my friend in just three clicks on my smart phone \u2013 all I need to know is his mobile number.  Business users of PayNow can generate a QR code containing their unique entity number.      This means I can now pay my utilities provider, telephone company, or plumber by simply scanning their QR code using my smart phone and keying in the amount to be transferred.  Let me now move on to the second way in which Technology can benefit Finance - strengthening risk management.  Risk management and compliance have become major cost drivers in financial institutions since the global financial crisis.      Processes have become slower and more cumbersome.     The answer does not lie in lowering regulatory requirements or risk management standards.  We know from 2008 what that can lead to.     Instead, financial institutions should harness technology to make risk management and compliance more efficient and effective.  Technology can improve the efficiency of risk management.      JP Morgan is using machine learning to review loan contracts.  This reduces the review time from 360,000 man-hours to seconds.  It also minimises human errors.     OCBC Bank in Singapore is using machine learning to monitor customer transactions real-time and across multiple channels.  This allows the bank to identify fraudulent fund transfers and take more timely actions to recover the funds.  Technology can make risk management less passive and more predictive by harnessing the informational value of data.      Ping An Insurance has developed a system that detects whether a banking customer is lying about the reason for borrowing money.         It is based on subtle changes in customers\u2019 facial expressions, with the analytical algorithm based on 30,000 videos of real lending cases.         According to Ping An, this has helped to reduce credit losses by 60%.     Blackrock and Rhodium are using data analytics to assess the risks of climate change to assets such as mortgage backed securities under different scenarios.  We have not tapped on the full potential of new technologies.      Research by IBM has found that quantum computing algorithms can compute the risk of an investment portfolio near real-time.     This is a significant reduction from the present Monte Carlo simulation approach which can take days.  The third big opportunity that Technology offers Finance is improving cost-efficiency.  This is particularly relevant for banks - saddled with the high costs of maintaining extensive branch networks and deterred from entering new markets or reaching underserved segments of the population because the cost of setting up branches is too high.  Technology is changing this in two ways.  First, the use of digital platforms to quickly and cheaply acquire customers.      The ubiquity of the Internet combined with the proliferation of the smart phone has helped to slash the cost of acquiring a customer.     According to research by Oliver Wyman, it costs about $30 to acquire an online banking customer compared to $150 using offline channels.     Basically, the smart phone is replacing the bank branch.  Non-bank players have led the way in digital banking.  In the UK, we have seen a proliferation of so-called \u201cneo-banks\u201d \u2013 basically non-bank start-ups who have obtained licenses to do banking business without physical branches.      Starling has opened 520,000 personal accounts since getting a banking license in 2016.     Monzo has opened 1.6 million accounts, adding 30,000 each week.         Monzo\u2019s customers can connect their accounts to 600 different apps and services, and create rules to integrate banking into their daily lives.         For example, users can create a rule that automatically logs calories to the health app on their mobile phone whenever they purchase coffee.  But banks can also play the same game, and more of them are doing it.  DBS Bank from Singapore launched a \u201cdigi-bank\u201d in India two years ago and has already garnered 2.5 million customers.      Digibank is using artificial intelligence to learn customers\u2019 spending habits and will prompt them if they are overspending, or provide relevant marketing offers such as coffee vouchers for a caffeine-lover.     Maybe we should combine the DBS Bank app and the Monzo app to achieve a more balanced intake of coffee!  United Overseas Bank from Singapore has just launched in Thailand a digital-only bank TMRW (pronounced \u201ctomorrow\u201d) aimed at millennials.      It comes complete with an \u201cengagement lab\u201d using behavioural insights to study customers banking habits and needs.     TMRW\u2019s mobile app features a game designed to encourage their customers to save more.  In Hong Kong, the regulator has given out licenses to 8 virtual banks to acquire and deliver banking services through the Internet.      The take-up numbers are interesting; they indicate the competition emerging in the space of digital banking.     Out of the 8 virtual banks, 5 are non-banks but 3 are backed by banks.  But the second and potentially more powerful way in which technology is helping to drive down the cost of financial intermediation is through partnerships between financial institutions and FinTech firms.      Soc-G\u00e9n is working with TagPay to provide mobile banking in Africa through a cloud-based platform that is compatible with any mobile phone.     AXA is working with MicroEnsure to offer simple and affordable insurance products to customers across Asia and Africa.  By helping to reduce customer acquisition costs, these collaborations have helped to serve a larger social purpose - enhancing financial inclusion and expanding opportunity.  But there is a lot more we need to do.      There are about 1.7 billion adults globally who are unbanked.     In the ten ASEAN countries of Southeast Asia, half the adult population is unbanked.     This is a shame.  The ASEAN countries have a burgeoning middle class and increasingly modern infrastructure, yet so many do not have access to a bank account, secure and affordable payments, or insurance protection.     Banks and insurers face high costs in reaching out to customers in remote areas.  We need to take collaboration between financial institutions and FinTech firms to a much broader level \u2013 through platforms for innovation and inclusion.  This is why the MAS, the ASEAN Bankers Association, and the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation have teamed up to establish the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network, or AFIN in short.  AFIN aims to bring banks and FinTech firms from across the world to develop innovative solutions to penetrate hard-to-reach markets in a cost efficient way.      Last year, AFIN launched the API eXchange \u2013 the world\u2019s first cross-border, open architecture platform to enhance financial inclusion.     The API eXchange is a cloud-based platform that does two things:         It is a marketplace, enabling financial institutions to discover and connect with FinTech partners through APIs on a globally curated platform.         It also provides a sandbox environment for financial institutions and FinTech firms to design and test cross-border solutions.  I have spoken so far of how the two musketeers \u2013 Finance and Technology \u2013 can and must come together to bring value and convenience to customers.  But for consumers to be part of this ecosystem, there needs to be Trust \u2013 the third musketeer.  Trust - the Musketeer who Binds Consumers to Finance  Trust is similar to Aramis, the third musketeer who is faithful and values friendship.  Trust is a key attribute for the success of a financial ecosystem.      It is a shared responsibility among all the actors in the ecosystem.     Banks in particular must be trustworthy so that customers have faith that their money and data are safe with them.  As Finance adopts more Technology, it must pay close attention to three risks, so as to maintain the Trust of consumers.  First, cyber risk.  As more financial services move online and collaboration among banks and technology companies becomes more pervasive, a growing risk that financial institutions are facing is in cyber space.      The frequency, scale, and complexity of cyber-attacks are mounting.     Attackers can carry out sophisticated and prolonged attacks that can be difficult to identify and defend against.     According to a study by FireEye, the median time it takes to detect a cyber intrusion is 78 days.  We need some common risk management standards in cyber defence.      The risk management systems in financial institutions and regulatory and supervisory frameworks for cyber resilience are uneven and still evolving.     There is no international equivalent of the Basel Capital Accord in cyber risk management.     But given the clear and present danger that cyber risk poses, MAS has put in place a mix of mandatory requirements and best practice guidelines in this area.  Given their role as repositories of public monies and conduits for payments, banks in particular must meet higher cyber security standards.  MAS expects banks to:      limit unscheduled system downtime of their critical IT systems to not more than 4 hours within a year;     conduct due diligence on third-party service providers\u2019 controls to safeguard customer information; and     report all significant cyber incidents to MAS within one hour.  But cyber risk management should go beyond banks.      The connectedness among participants in the financial system means that a cyber-attack on one party can potentially escalate into a more systemic problem.     We need to level up the cyber resilience of all financial institutions, not necessarily to the level of banks but at least to a basic level - what we call cyber hygiene.     Research has shown that the majority of cyber incidents can be avoided if some simple cyber hygiene practices are adopted.  MAS will soon issue a set of mandatory requirements on cyber hygiene that will apply to all financial institutions in Singapore.  They include basic things like:      securing administrative accounts;     controlling network access at the perimeter;     installing security patches promptly;     installing anti-virus software on their systems; and     implementing multi-factor authentication for users who access confidential information over the Internet.  In short, if we don\u2019t get cyber security right, financial institutions will be constrained in how much they can leverage on technology.  The second area financial institutions must address to ensure customer confidence is information security risk.  Information security is not the same as cyber security.      Information security is focused on protecting data, while cyber security is focused on protecting systems.     They are however closely related.     Data leaks can occur when a system is not properly secured.  In the financial ecosystem, information security risk is growing for two key reasons:      One, more data are becoming digitised.         The International Data Corporation has estimated that digital data will increase fivefold from 2018 to 2025.     Two, as banks begin to collaborate with FinTech and BigTech players, customer data that was traditionally within the inner sanctum of banks will increasingly be shared with third party service providers.  Banks have to exercise care for the data they hold, as well as those that they have shared with third parties. This means:      understanding at a granular level the data that are held, processed or shared;     assessing the criticality and sensitivity of all data sets;     putting in place targeted measures to safeguard data; and     taking swift recovery measures in the event of a data breach.  Besides their personal health data, people regard their personal financial data as most sensitive.  Financial institutions have a particular responsibility to safeguard this data.  The third area to watch closely is risk from the misuse of data analytics and artificial intelligence.  Data analytics and artificial intelligence can help to uncover patterns which we are unaware of and to provide insights that we could not have gained from traditional analytical tools.  But unless there is public trust that data analytics and artificial intelligence will be used responsibly, financial institutions will not get the social license they need to apply these technologies widely.  To gain this trust, we must address four areas in data analytics and artificial intelligence:      Privacy of data.  How do we safeguard the confidentiality of personal data?     Explainability of results. How do we minimise the \u201cblack box\u201d syndrome?     Accountability for decisions.  How can we hold humans ultimately responsible for decisions made by self-learning machines?     Acceptability of outcomes.  How do we minimise unconscious bias, social exclusion, and ethically unacceptable consequences?  MAS has co-created with the financial industry in Singapore a set of preliminary principles to guide the responsible use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in financial services.      The Principles are centred on four pillars - fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency.  Hence, the short-hand name FEAT Principles.     They are not prescriptive but represent an industry consensus that individual financial institutions take reference from when formulating their own data governance policies and practices.     We believe that the FEAT Principles will help to promote public confidence and trust in the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in our financial sector. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN1025265220190515</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W41-5N01-DXCW-D395-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4057\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 15, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This principle is embodied in the French novel \"The Three Musketeers\" by Alexandre Dumas.</p><p>* Set in the 17th century, the novel recounts the journey of D'Artagnan, who left for Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard, and how he overcomes all adversities.</p><p>* Together with him are three musketeers with contrasting personalities:</p><p>- Athos who is intelligent;</p><p>- Porthos who is adventurous; and</p><p>- Aramis who is true and faithful.</p><p>* But together they form a well-balanced trio that supports D'Artagnan on his journey.</p><p>The three musketeers today are Finance, Technology, and Trust, corresponding to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Society is D'Artagnan.</p><p>* Can the three modern musketeers work together to support Society?</p><p>* Can they complement one another? Can they click?</p><p>Finance - the Astute Musketeer Losing Appeal<br/><br/>Let me introduce the first musketeer - Finance.</p><p>Like Athos, Finance is wise but can be complicated, and to some extent, mysterious and non-accessible to many people. As a result, Finance - at least in its traditional form - is losing its appeal.</p><p>* Consumers find that banks' processes are too cumbersome to navigate.</p><p>* They are increasingly looking to technology firms for their needs.</p><p>* Some of them are even losing trust in the ability of banks to act in their interest.</p><p>Bill Gates once said: \"People need banking, not banks\". It is a reminder that, to survive, Finance needs to be intuitive, innovative and customer-centric.</p><p>Technology - the Musketeer who can Transform Finance</p><p>This is where the second musketeer - Technology - comes in.</p><p>Technology is akin to Porthos, the fearless musketeer who is eager to try new ways for a better future. In a similar vein, Technology presents us opportunities to revitalise Finance:</p><p>* the opportunity to enhance customer experience;</p><p>* the opportunity to strengthen risk management; and</p><p>* the opportunity to improve cost efficiency.</p><p>Let me elaborate on each of these opportunities.</p><p>First, enhancing customer experience. This has become a critical success factor in many industries, including finance. Why?</p><p>Basically, technology firms have reshaped the way businesses interact with customers.</p><p>* They have empowered customers and set higher bars for customer satisfaction.</p><p>* Whether they are established Big Tech firms or small FinTech start-ups, they pose a competitive challenge to financial institutions.</p><p>If I have to name one thing these technology firms do very well, much better than financial institutions, it would be that they are obsessively customer-centric.</p><p>Tech firms embed themselves in the customer journey and use data analytics to deeply understand customer needs.</p><p>* They then provide end-to-end solutions, often customised to individual circumstances.</p><p>* They have agile IT systems, efficient processes, and a culture that emphasises speed.</p><p>* Essentially, tech firms think of themselves not as being in a particular industry, but as platforms, upon which they provide access to the services their customers need.</p><p>Traditional banks tend to be largely product-centric.</p><p>* The credit card division tries to sell you unsecured credit, the wealth management division tries to sell you mutual funds, the lending division tries to sell you a mortgage.</p><p>* They start with the product and try to persuade the customer why their product is good for him.</p><p>* Many banks do not have a complete picture of their customers.</p><p>* They are weighed down by legacy IT systems and bureaucratic processes.</p><p>But several banks are stepping up to the challenge. Athos is learning from Porthos.</p><p>* Banks are investing heavily in technology to optimise their operations and enhance their systems.</p><p>* They are collaborating with technology firms to accelerate the pace of innovation.</p><p>* They are becoming more customer-centric.</p><p>These banks are using technology to provide customised solutions, complete solutions, and seamless solutions.</p><p>First, customised solutions to suit the individual needs and characteristics of the customer.</p><p>Some banks are experimenting with personalised products and services, not just based on what the customer asks for but by anticipating what the customer might need.</p><p>* Commonwealth Bank of Australia's mobile app is using behavioural science to provide customers with financial management advice based on their spending patterns and financial goals.</p><p>Some banks are offering personalised interactions at every customer touchpoint.</p><p>* Royal Bank of Canada has enabled its customers to pay their bills on the mobile app via speech and voice recognition.</p><p>Second, complete solutions that are based on the total picture of the customer.</p><p>Today's customers are more sophisticated and want holistic solutions.</p><p>* In a survey of 10,000 tech-savvy customers, Accenture found that 80% of them want integrated solutions that address both their financial and non-financial needs.</p><p>* Financial needs are really driven by non-financial desires. People do not desire a housing loan or a fire insurance policy. People desire a house.</p><p>To provide complete, holistic solutions, you need comprehensive customer data and you need a deep understanding of the customer journey.</p><p>The customer data that most banks have are simply not sufficient to develop a good understanding of the financial situation or needs of their customers.</p><p>* Customers have multiple relationships, with deposits and loans, investments, insurance policies, and retirement plans, spread across many financial institutions.</p><p>* How many financial institutions advising a customer have a complete picture of the customer's balance sheet - all his assets and liabilities?</p><p>Some banks have started to offer aggregator services which consolidate financial information such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and investments from all the financial institutions serving their customers.</p><p>* This allows financial institutions to provide holistic financial planning.</p><p>* BBVA provides its corporate customers with a consolidated view of all their financial information from about 90 financial institutions.</p><p>Next, understanding the customer journey.</p><p>Some banks have begun to offer their corporate customers complete, end-to-end solutions, based on a keen understanding of their customers' work processes.</p><p>* United Overseas Bank in Singapore provides its corporate customers an integrated digital platform that enables the customer to:</p><p>- generate purchase orders and invoices with a few clicks;</p><p>- streamline its payroll process; and</p><p>- get up-to-date views of its financials.</p><p>Some banks are positioning themselves as partners with their customers on their life journey, integrating their financial and non-financial needs.</p><p>* DBS Bank in Singapore provides its customers looking to buy a car an online portal that enables them to calculate their budget, find an affordable car, connect with the seller, get a car loan, and finally purchase a car insurance.</p><p>Third, banks are using technology to provide seamless solutions.</p><p>This means resolving bottlenecks and providing customers with a frictionless experience.</p><p>* Banks such as BBVA, Mitsubishi UFJ, and BNP Paribas are using blockchain technology for syndicated loans.</p><p>* It improves efficiency.</p><p>- Each step of the loan process, from credit underwriting to credit administration, is documented in the distributed ledger, thereby eliminating the need for duplicative back office processing.</p><p>- The loan process is shortened from about two weeks to two days.</p><p>* It also improves trust.</p><p>- Every record in the distributed ledger has a user code and time stamp.</p><p>- This creates an audit trail, leading to higher level of trust among the participants.</p><p>Let me share two initiatives from the Singapore financial sector, which show that achieving a seamless customer experience often requires collaboration across institutions and inter-operability across systems.</p><p>The two key ingredients for a digital transaction are identity authentication and secure payments. The Singapore government worked closely with the industry to make the customer experience seamless in these two areas.</p><p>First, seamless identity authentication through MyInfo.</p><p>* MyInfo is a government digital service that enables Singapore residents to authorise third-parties to access their personal data residing across different government agencies through APIs.</p><p>* This means that, with the consent of the customer, banks can use the MyInfo service for more efficient KYC using government-verified personal data.</p><p>I can now open a bank account or obtain a credit card - online and instantly - when I give consent to my bank to access my data through MyInfo.</p><p>* Customers do not need to go through the tedious process of filling up forms and providing hardcopy documents to banks for verification. And they certainly don't need to go to the bank branch.</p><p>* Banks benefit from higher productivity and better risk management.</p><p>Second, secure and seamless payments through PayNow.</p><p>* PayNow was jointly developed by MAS and the banking industry.</p><p>* It enables individuals and businesses to transfer funds using just the personal ID number or mobile phone number or unique entity number of their recipients.</p><p>* It operates 24-by-7 and funds can be transferred directly from one bank account to another in real-time.</p><p>* I can now send money to my friend in just three clicks on my smart phone - all I need to know is his mobile number.</p><p>Business users of PayNow can generate a QR code containing their unique entity number.</p><p>* This means I can now pay my utilities provider, telephone company, or plumber by simply scanning their QR code using my smart phone and keying in the amount to be transferred.</p><p>Let me now move on to the second way in which Technology can benefit Finance - strengthening risk management.</p><p>Risk management and compliance have become major cost drivers in financial institutions since the global financial crisis.</p><p>* Processes have become slower and more cumbersome.</p><p>* The answer does not lie in lowering regulatory requirements or risk management standards. We know from 2008 what that can lead to.</p><p>* Instead, financial institutions should harness technology to make risk management and compliance more efficient and effective.</p><p>Technology can improve the efficiency of risk management.</p><p>* JP Morgan is using machine learning to review loan contracts. This reduces the review time from 360,000 man-hours to seconds. It also minimises human errors.</p><p>* OCBC Bank in Singapore is using machine learning to monitor customer transactions real-time and across multiple channels. This allows the bank to identify fraudulent fund transfers and take more timely actions to recover the funds.</p><p>Technology can make risk management less passive and more predictive by harnessing the informational value of data.</p><p>* Ping An Insurance has developed a system that detects whether a banking customer is lying about the reason for borrowing money.</p><p>- It is based on subtle changes in customers' facial expressions, with the analytical algorithm based on 30,000 videos of real lending cases.</p><p>- According to Ping An, this has helped to reduce credit losses by 60%.</p><p>* Blackrock and Rhodium are using data analytics to assess the risks of climate change to assets such as mortgage backed securities under different scenarios.</p><p>We have not tapped on the full potential of new technologies.</p><p>* Research by IBM has found that quantum computing algorithms can compute the risk of an investment portfolio near real-time.</p><p>* This is a significant reduction from the present Monte Carlo simulation approach which can take days.</p><p>The third big opportunity that Technology offers Finance is improving cost-efficiency.</p><p>This is particularly relevant for banks - saddled with the high costs of maintaining extensive branch networks and deterred from entering new markets or reaching underserved segments of the population because the cost of setting up branches is too high.</p><p>Technology is changing this in two ways.</p><p>First, the use of digital platforms to quickly and cheaply acquire customers.</p><p>* The ubiquity of the Internet combined with the proliferation of the smart phone has helped to slash the cost of acquiring a customer.</p><p>* According to research by Oliver Wyman, it costs about $30 to acquire an online banking customer compared to $150 using offline channels.</p><p>* Basically, the smart phone is replacing the bank branch.</p><p>Non-bank players have led the way in digital banking.</p><p>In the UK, we have seen a proliferation of so-called \"neo-banks\" - basically non-bank start-ups who have obtained licenses to do banking business without physical branches.</p><p>* Starling has opened 520,000 personal accounts since getting a banking license in 2016.</p><p>* Monzo has opened 1.6 million accounts, adding 30,000 each week.</p><p>- Monzo's customers can connect their accounts to 600 different apps and services, and create rules to integrate banking into their daily lives.</p><p>- For example, users can create a rule that automatically logs calories to the health app on their mobile phone whenever they purchase coffee.</p><p>But banks can also play the same game, and more of them are doing it.</p><p>DBS Bank from Singapore launched a \"digi-bank\" in India two years ago and has already garnered 2.5 million customers.</p><p>* Digibank is using artificial intelligence to learn customers' spending habits and will prompt them if they are overspending, or provide relevant marketing offers such as coffee vouchers for a caffeine-lover.</p><p>* Maybe we should combine the DBS Bank app and the Monzo app to achieve a more balanced intake of coffee!</p><p>United Overseas Bank from Singapore has just launched in Thailand a digital-only bank TMRW (pronounced \"tomorrow\") aimed at millennials.</p><p>* It comes complete with an \"engagement lab\" using behavioural insights to study customers' banking habits and needs.</p><p>* TMRW's mobile app features a game designed to encourage their customers to save more.</p><p>In Hong Kong, the regulator has given out licenses to 8 virtual banks to acquire and deliver banking services through the Internet.</p><p>* The take-up numbers are interesting; they indicate the competition emerging in the space of digital banking.</p><p>* Out of the 8 virtual banks, 5 are non-banks but 3 are backed by banks.</p><p>But the second and potentially more powerful way in which technology is helping to drive down the cost of financial intermediation is through partnerships between financial institutions and FinTech firms.</p><p>* Soc-Gen is working with TagPay to provide mobile banking in Africa through a cloud-based platform that is compatible with any mobile phone.</p><p>* AXA is working with MicroEnsure to offer simple and affordable insurance products to customers across Asia and Africa.</p><p>By helping to reduce customer acquisition costs, these collaborations have helped to serve a larger social purpose - enhancing financial inclusion and expanding opportunity. But there is a lot more we need to do.</p><p>* There are about 1.7 billion adults globally who are unbanked.</p><p>* In the ten ASEAN countries of Southeast Asia, half the adult population is unbanked.</p><p>* This is a shame. The ASEAN countries have a burgeoning middle class and increasingly modern infrastructure, yet so many do not have access to a bank account, secure and affordable payments, or insurance protection.</p><p>* Banks and insurers face high costs in reaching out to customers in remote areas.</p><p>We need to take collaboration between financial institutions and FinTech firms to a much broader level - through platforms for innovation and inclusion.</p><p>This is why the MAS, the ASEAN Bankers Association, and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation have teamed up to establish the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network, or AFIN in short.</p><p>AFIN aims to bring banks and FinTech firms from across the world to develop innovative solutions to penetrate hard-to-reach markets in a cost efficient way.</p><p>* Last year, AFIN launched the API eXchange - the world's first cross-border, open architecture platform to enhance financial inclusion.</p><p>* The API eXchange is a cloud-based platform that does two things:</p><p>- It is a marketplace, enabling financial institutions to discover and connect with FinTech partners through APIs on a globally curated platform.</p><p>- It also provides a sandbox environment for financial institutions and FinTech firms to design and test cross-border solutions.</p><p>I have spoken so far of how the two musketeers - Finance and Technology - can and must come together to bring value and convenience to customers. But for consumers to be part of this ecosystem, there needs to be Trust - the third musketeer.</p><p>Trust - the Musketeer who Binds Consumers to Finance</p><p>Trust is similar to Aramis, the third musketeer who is faithful and values friendship.</p><p>Trust is a key attribute for the success of a financial ecosystem.</p><p>* It is a shared responsibility among all the actors in the ecosystem.</p><p>* Banks in particular must be trustworthy so that customers have faith that their money and data are safe with them.</p><p>As Finance adopts more Technology, it must pay close attention to three risks, so as to maintain the Trust of consumers.</p><p>First, cyber risk.</p><p>As more financial services move online and collaboration among banks and technology companies becomes more pervasive, a growing risk that financial institutions are facing is in cyber space.</p><p>* The frequency, scale, and complexity of cyber-attacks are mounting.</p><p>* Attackers can carry out sophisticated and prolonged attacks that can be difficult to identify and defend against.</p><p>* According to a study by FireEye, the median time it takes to detect a cyber intrusion is 78 days.</p><p>We need some common risk management standards in cyber defence.</p><p>* The risk management systems in financial institutions and regulatory and supervisory frameworks for cyber resilience are uneven and still evolving.</p><p>* There is no international equivalent of the Basel Capital Accord in cyber risk management.</p><p>* But given the clear and present danger that cyber risk poses, MAS has put in place a mix of mandatory requirements and best practice guidelines in this area.</p><p>Given their role as repositories of public monies and conduits for payments, banks in particular must meet higher cyber security standards. MAS expects banks to:</p><p>* limit unscheduled system downtime of their critical IT systems to not more than 4 hours within a year;</p><p>* conduct due diligence on third-party service providers' controls to safeguard customer information; and</p><p>* report all significant cyber incidents to MAS within one hour.</p><p>But cyber risk management should go beyond banks.</p><p>* The connectedness among participants in the financial system means that a cyber-attack on one party can potentially escalate into a more systemic problem.</p><p>* We need to level up the cyber resilience of all financial institutions, not necessarily to the level of banks but at least to a basic level - what we call cyber hygiene.</p><p>* Research has shown that the majority of cyber incidents can be avoided if some simple cyber hygiene practices are adopted.</p><p>MAS will soon issue a set of mandatory requirements on cyber hygiene that will apply to all financial institutions in Singapore. They include basic things like:</p><p>* securing administrative accounts;</p><p>* controlling network access at the perimeter;</p><p>* installing security patches promptly;</p><p>* installing anti-virus software on their systems; and</p><p>* implementing multi-factor authentication for users who access confidential information over the Internet.</p><p>In short, if we don't get cyber security right, financial institutions will be constrained in how much they can leverage on technology.</p><p>The second area financial institutions must address to ensure customer confidence is information security risk.</p><p>Information security is not the same as cyber security.</p><p>* Information security is focused on protecting data, while cyber security is focused on protecting systems.</p><p>* They are however closely related.</p><p>* Data leaks can occur when a system is not properly secured.</p><p>In the financial ecosystem, information security risk is growing for two key reasons:</p><p>* One, more data are becoming digitised.</p><p>- The International Data Corporation has estimated that digital data will increase fivefold from 2018 to 2025.</p><p>* Two, as banks begin to collaborate with FinTech and BigTech players, customer data that was traditionally within the inner sanctum of banks will increasingly be shared with third party service providers.</p><p>Banks have to exercise care for the data they hold, as well as those that they have shared with third parties. This means:</p><p>* understanding at a granular level the data that are held, processed or shared;</p><p>* assessing the criticality and sensitivity of all data sets;</p><p>* putting in place targeted measures to safeguard data; and</p><p>* taking swift recovery measures in the event of a data breach.</p><p>Besides their personal health data, people regard their personal financial data as most sensitive. Financial institutions have a particular responsibility to safeguard this data.</p><p>The third area to watch closely is risk from the misuse of data analytics and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Data analytics and artificial intelligence can help to uncover patterns which we are unaware of and to provide insights that we could not have gained from traditional analytical tools.</p><p>But unless there is public trust that data analytics and artificial intelligence will be used responsibly, financial institutions will not get the social license they need to apply these technologies widely.</p><p>To gain this trust, we must address four areas in data analytics and artificial intelligence:</p><p>* Privacy of data. How do we safeguard the confidentiality of personal data?</p><p>* Explainability of results. How do we minimise the \"black box\" syndrome?</p><p>* Accountability for decisions. How can we hold humans ultimately responsible for decisions made by self-learning machines?</p><p>* Acceptability of outcomes. How do we minimise unconscious bias, social exclusion, and ethically unacceptable consequences?</p><p>MAS has co-created with the financial industry in Singapore a set of preliminary principles to guide the responsible use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in financial services.</p><p>* The Principles are centred on four pillars - fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency. Hence, the short-hand name FEAT Principles.</p><p>* They are not prescriptive but represent an industry consensus that individual financial institutions take reference from when formulating their own data governance policies and practices.</p><p>* We believe that the FEAT Principles will help to promote public confidence and trust in the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in our financial sector.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Let me conclude.</p><p>Technology and Finance must come together. And they must do so in a manner that maintains Trust.</p><p>Finance, Technology and Trust are like the three musketeers of old.</p><p>* Like Athos, Finance allocates resources to those who need it.</p><p>* Like Porthos, Technology represents the aspiration for Finance to innovate.</p><p>* Like Aramis, Trust engenders confidence in Finance.</p><p>The motto of the three musketeers is: \"Tous pour un, Un pour tous\" - \"One for all, All for one\".</p><p>* If Finance, Technology, and Trust can do the same, we can have innovation and dynamism with safety and stability.</p><p>* We can benefit not only the financial industry, but society at large.</p><p>* We can raise productivity, expand opportunity, and enrich the lives of our people.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0047426831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W42-7Y51-JB5M-W1X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4104\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 14, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002EIQ</classCode><className>BANQUE DE FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

It thrives on diversity, collaboration, and openness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is much we can learn from each other. France and Singapore have been deepening collaboration in areas such as finance, science, and technology.</p><p>2018 was designated as the France-Singapore Year of Innovation.</p><p>Today, I want to focus on innovation in financial services. Globally, the financial industry is facing slower economic growth, tighter regulation, and keener competition.</p><p>To overcome these headwinds and contribute to the broader economy, the industry needs to harness technology, foster innovation, and transform itself.</p><p>But how to do this, while maintaining the single most important commodity that underpins financial institutions - trust.</p><p>As Stephen Covey said: \"Strength lies in differences, not in similarities\". This principle is embodied in the French novel \"The Three Musketeers\" by Alexandre Dumas.</p><p>Set in the 17th century, the novel recounts the journey of D'Artagnan, who left for Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard, and how he overcomes all adversities.</p><p>Together with him are three musketeers with contrasting personalities:</p><p>Athos who is intelligent;<br/>Porthos who is adventurous; and<br/>Aramis who is true and faithful.</p><p>But together they form a well-balanced trio that supports D'Artagnan on his journey.</p><p>The three musketeers today are Finance, Technology, and Trust, corresponding to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Society is D'Artagnan.</p><p>Can the three modern musketeers work together to support Society'</p><p>Can they complement one another? Can they click'</p><p>FINANCE - THE ASTUTE MUSKETEER LOSING APPEAL</p><p>Let me introduce the first musketeer - Finance.</p><p>Like Athos, Finance is wise but can be complicated, and to some extent, mysterious and non-accessible to many people. As a result, Finance - at least in its traditional form - is losing its appeal.</p><p>Consumers find that banks' processes are too cumbersome to navigate. They are increasingly looking to technology firms for their needs.</p><p>Some of them are even losing trust in the ability of banks to act in their interest.</p><p>Bill Gates once said: \"People need banking, not banks\". It is a reminder that, to survive, Finance needs to be intuitive, innovative and customer-centric.</p><p>TECHNOLOGY - THE MUSKETEER WHO CAN TRANSFORM FINANCE</p><p>This is where the second musketeer - Technology - comes in.</p><p>Technology is akin to Porthos, the fearless musketeer who is eager to try new ways for a better future. In a similar vein, Technology presents us opportunities to revitalise Finance:</p><p>- the opportunity to enhance customer experience;<br/>- the opportunity to strengthen risk management; and<br/>- the opportunity to improve cost efficiency.</p><p>Let me elaborate on each of these opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First,</emphasis> enhancing customer experience. This has become a critical success factor in many industries, including finance. Why'Basically, technology firms have reshaped the way businesses interact with customers.</p><p>They have empowered customers and set higher bars for customer satisfaction. Whether they are established Big Tech firms or small FinTech start-ups, they pose a competitive challenge to financial institutions.</p><p>If I have to name one thing these technology firms do very well, much better than financial institutions, it would be that they are obsessively customer-centric.</p><p>Tech firms embed themselves in the customer journey and use data analytics to deeply understand customer needs.</p><p>They then provide end-to-end solutions, often customised to individual circumstances. They have agile IT systems, efficient processes, and a culture that emphasises speed.</p><p>Essentially, tech firms think of themselves not as being in a particular industry, but as platforms, upon which they provide access to the services their customers need.</p><p>Traditional banks tend to be largely product-centric.</p><p>The credit card division tries to sell you unsecured credit, the wealth management division tries to sell you mutual funds, the lending division tries to sell you a mortgage.</p><p>They start with the product and try to persuade the customer why their product is good for him. Many banks do not have a complete picture of their customers.</p><p>They are weighed down by legacy IT systems and bureaucratic processes.</p><p>But several banks are stepping up to the challenge. Athos is learning from Porthos.</p><p>Banks are investing heavily in technology to optimise their operations and enhance their systems. They are collaborating with technology firms to accelerate the pace of innovation. They are becoming more customer-centric.</p><p>These banks are using technology to provide customised solutions, complete solutions, and seamless solutions.</p><p>First, customised solutions to suit the individual needs and characteristics of the customer.</p><p>Some banks are experimenting with personalised products and services, not just based on what the customer asks for but by anticipating what the customer might need.</p><p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia's mobile app is using behavioural science to provide customers with financial management advice based on their spending patterns and financial goals.</p><p>Some banks are offering personalised interactions at every customer touchpoint.</p><p>Royal Bank of Canada has enabled its customers to pay their bills on the mobile app via speech and voice recognition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Second,</emphasis> complete solutions that are based on the total picture of the customer.Today's customers are more sophisticated and want holistic solutions.</p><p>In a survey of 10,000 tech-savvy customers, Accenture found that 80% of them want integrated solutions that address both their financial and non-financial needs.</p><p>Financial needs are really driven by non-financial desires. People do not desire a housing loan or a fire insurance policy. People desire a house.</p><p>To provide complete, holistic solutions, you need comprehensive customer data and you need a deep understanding of the customer journey.</p><p>The customer data that most banks have are simply not sufficient to develop a good understanding of the financial situation or needs of their customers.</p><p>Customers have multiple relationships, with deposits and loans, investments, insurance policies, and retirement plans, spread across many financial institutions.</p><p>How many financial institutions advising a customer have a complete picture of the customer's balance sheet - all his assets and liabilities'</p><p>Some banks have started to offer aggregator services which consolidate financial information such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and investments from all the financial institutions serving their customers.</p><p>This allows financial institutions to provide holistic financial planning.</p><p>BBVA provides its corporate customers with a consolidated view of all their financial information from about 90 financial institutions.</p><p>Next, understanding the customer journey.</p><p>Some banks have begun to offer their corporate customers complete, end-to-end solutions, based on a keen understanding of their customers' work processes.</p><p>United Overseas Bank in Singapore provides its corporate customers an integrated digital platform that enables the customer to: generate purchase orders and invoices with a few clicks; streamline its payroll process; and get up-to-date views of its financials.</p><p>Some banks are positioning themselves as partners with their customers on their life journey, integrating their financial and non-financial needs.</p><p>DBS Bank in Singapore provides its customers looking to buy a car an online portal that enables them to calculate their budget, find an affordable car, connect with the seller, get a car loan, and finally purchase a car insurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Third,</emphasis> banks are using technology to provide seamless solutions.This means using technology to resolve bottlenecks in processes to provide customers with a frictionless experience.</p><p>Banks such as BBVA, Mitsubishi UFJ, and BNP Paribas are using blockchain technology for syndicated loans.</p><p>It improves efficiency. Each step of the loan process, from credit underwriting to credit administration, is documented in the distributed ledger, thereby eliminating the need for duplicative back office processing. The loan process is shortened from about two weeks to two days.</p><p>It also improves trust.</p><p>Every record in the distributed ledger has a user code and time stamp. This creates an audit trail, leading to higher level of trust among the participants.</p><p>Let me share two initiatives from the Singapore financial sector, which show that achieving a seamless customer experience often requires collaboration across institutions and inter- operability across systems.</p><p>The two key ingredients for a digital transaction are identity authentication and secure payments. The Singapore government worked closely with the industry to make the customer experience seamless in these two areas.</p><p>First, seamless identity authentication through MyInfo.</p><p>MyInfo is a government digital service that enables Singapore residents to authorise third-parties to access their personal data residing across different government agencies through APIs.</p><p>This means that, with the consent of the customer, banks can use the MyInfo service for more efficient KYC using government-verified personal data.</p><p>I can now open a bank account or obtain a credit card - online and instantly - when I give consent to my bank to access my data through MyInfo.</p><p>Customers do not need to go through the tedious process of filling up forms and providing hardcopy documents to banks for verification. And they certainly don't need to go to the bank branch. Banks benefit from higher productivity and better risk management.</p><p>Second, secure and seamless payments through PayNow.</p><p>PayNow was jointly developed by MAS and the banking industry. It enables individuals and businesses to transfer funds using just the personal ID number or mobile phone number or unique entity number of their recipients.</p><p>It operates 24-by-7 and funds can be transferred directly from one bank account to another in real-time. I can now send money to my friend in just three clicks on my smart phone - all I need to know is his mobile number.</p><p>Business users of PayNow can generate a QR code containing their unique entity number. This means I can now pay my utilities provider, telephone company, or plumber by simply scanning their QR code using my smart phone and keying in the amount to be transferred.</p><p>Let me now move on to the second way in which Technology can benefit Finance - strengthening risk management.</p><p>Risk management and compliance have become major cost drivers in financial institutions since the global financial crisis.</p><p>Processes have become slower and more cumbersome. The answer does not lie in lowering regulatory requirements or risk management standards. We know from 2008 what that can lead to.</p><p>Instead, financial institutions should harness technology to make risk management and compliance more efficient and effective.</p><p>Technology can improve the efficiency of risk management.</p><p>JP Morgan is using machine learning to review loan contracts. This reduces the review time from 360,000 man-hours to seconds. It also minimises human errors.</p><p>OCBC Bank in Singapore is using machine learning to monitor customer transactions real-time and across multiple channels. This allows the bank to identify fraudulent fund transfers and take more timely actions to recover the funds.</p><p>Technology can make risk management less passive and more predictive by harnessing the informational value of data.</p><p>Ping An Insurance has developed a system that detects whether a banking customer is lying about the reason for borrowing money. It is based on subtle changes in customers' facial expressions, with the analytical algorithm based on 30,000 videos of real lending cases. According to Ping An, this has helped to reduce credit losses by 60%.</p><p>Blackrock and Rhodium are using data analytics to assess the risks of climate change to assets such as mortgage backed securities under different scenarios.</p><p>We have not tapped on the full potential of new technologies.</p><p>Research by IBM has found that quantum computing algorithms can compute the risk of an investment portfolio near real-time.</p><p>This is a significant reduction from the present Monte Carlo simulation approach which can take days.</p><p>The third big opportunity that Technology offers Finance is improving cost-efficiency.</p><p>This is particularly relevant for banks - saddled with the high costs of maintaining extensive branch networks and deterred from entering new markets or reaching underserved segments of the population because the cost of setting up branches is too high.</p><p>Technology is changing this in two ways.</p><p>First, the use of digital platforms to quickly and cheaply acquire customers.</p><p>The ubiquity of the Internet combined with the proliferation of the smart phone has helped to slash the cost of acquiring a customer.</p><p>According to research by Oliver Wyman, it costs about US$30 to acquire an online banking customer compared to US$150 using offline channels.</p><p>Basically, the smart phone is replacing the bank branch.</p><p>Non-bank players have led the way in digital banking.</p><p>In the UK, we have seen a proliferation of so-called \"neo-banks\" - basically non-bank startups who have obtained licences to do banking business without physical branches.</p><p>Starling has opened 520,000 personal accounts since getting a banking licence in 2016.</p><p>Monzo has opened 1.6 million accounts, adding 30,000 each week. Monzo's customers can connect their accounts to 600 different apps and services, and create rules to integrate banking into their daily lives. For example, users can create a rule that automatically logs calories to the health app on their mobile phone whenever they purchase coffee.</p><p>But banks can also play the same game, and more of them are doing it.</p><p>DBS Bank from Singapore launched a \"digi-bank\" in India two years ago and has already garnered 2.5 million customers.</p><p>Digibank is using artificial intelligence to learn customers' spending habits and will prompt them if they are overspending, or provide relevant marketing offers such as coffee vouchers for a caffeine-lover.</p><p>Maybe we should combine the DBS Bank app and the Monzo app to achieve a more balanced intake of coffee!</p><p>United Overseas Bank from Singapore has just launched in Thailand a digital-only bank TMRW (pronounced \"tomorrow\") aimed at millennials.</p><p>It comes complete with an \"engagement lab\" using behavioural insights to study customer's banking habits and needs. TMRW's mobile app features a game designed to encourage their customers to save more.</p><p>In Hong Kong, the regulator has given out licences to eight virtual banks to acquire and deliver banking services through the Internet.</p><p>The take-up numbers are interesting; they indicate the competition emerging in the space of digital banking. Out of the eight virtual banks, five are non-banks but three are backed by banks.</p><p>But the second and potentially more powerful way in which technology is helping to drive down the cost of financial intermediation is through partnerships between financial institutions and fintech firms.</p><p>Soc-G\u00e9n is working with TagPay to provide mobile banking in Africa through a cloud- based platform that is compatible with any mobile phone.</p><p>AXA is working with MicroEnsure to offer simple and affordable insurance products to customers across Asia and Africa.</p><p>By helping to reduce customer acquisition costs, these collaborations have helped to serve a larger social purpose - enhancing financial inclusion and expanding opportunity. But there is a lot more we need to do.</p><p>There are about 1.7 billion adults globally who are unbanked.</p><p>In the ten ASEAN countries of Southeast Asia, half the adult population is unbanked. This is a shame. The ASEAN countries have a burgeoning middle class and increasingly modern infrastructure, yet so many do not have access to a bank account, secure and affordable payments, or insurance protection.</p><p>Banks and insurers face high costs in reaching out to customers in remote areas.</p><p>We need to take collaboration between financial institutions and fintech firms to a much broader level - through platforms for innovation and inclusion.</p><p>This is why the MAS, the ASEAN Bankers Association, and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation have teamed up to establish the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network, or AFIN in short.</p><p>AFIN aims to bring banks and fintech firms from across the world to develop innovative solutions to penetrate hard-to-reach markets in a cost efficient way.</p><p>Last year, AFIN launched the API eXchange - the world's first cross-border, open architecture platform to enhance financial inclusion.</p><p>The API eXchange is a cloud-based platform that does two things:</p><p>It is a marketplace, enabling financial institutions to discover and connect with fintech partners through APIs on a globally curated platform. It also provides a sandbox environment for financial institutions and fintech firms to design and test cross-border solutions.</p><p>I have spoken so far of how the two musketeers - Finance and Technology - can and must come together to bring value and convenience to customers. But for consumers to be part of this ecosystem, there needs to be Trust - the third musketeer.</p><p>TRUST - THE MUSKETEER WHO BINDS CONSUMERS TO FINANCE</p><p>Trust is similar to Aramis, the third musketeer who is faithful and values friendship.</p><p>Trust is a key attribute for the success of a financial ecosystem.</p><p>It is a shared responsibility among all the actors in the ecosystem.</p><p>Banks in particular must be trustworthy so that customers have faith that their money and data are safe with them.</p><p>As Finance adopts more Technology, it must pay close attention to three risks, so as to maintain the Trust of consumers.</p><p>First, cyber risk.</p><p>As more financial services move online and collaboration among banks and technology companies becomes more pervasive, a growing risk that financial institutions are facing is in cyber space.</p><p>The frequency, scale, and complexity of cyber-attacks are mounting.</p><p>Attackers can carry out sophisticated and prolonged attacks that can be difficult to identify and defend against. According to a study by FireEye, the median time it takes to detect a cyber intrusion is 78 days.</p><p>We need some common risk management standards in cyber defence.</p><p>The risk management systems in financial institutions and regulatory and supervisory frameworks for cyber resilience are uneven and still evolving.</p><p>There is no international equivalent of the Basel Capital Accord in cyber risk management.</p><p>But given the clear and present danger that cyber risk poses, MAS has put in place a mix of mandatory requirements and best practice guidelines in this area.</p><p>Given their role as repositories of public monies and conduits for payments, banks in particular must meet higher cyber security standards. MAS expects banks to:</p><p>- limit unscheduled system downtime of their critical IT systems to not more than four hours within a year;<br/>-conduct due diligence on third-party service providers' controls to safeguard customer information; and<br/>- report all significant cyber incidents to MAS within one hour.</p><p>But cyber risk management should go beyond banks.</p><p>The connectedness among participants in the financial system means that a cyber- attack on one party can potentially escalate into a more systemic problem.</p><p>We need to level up the cyber resilience of all financial institutions, not necessarily to the level of banks but at least to a basic level - what we call cyber hygiene.</p><p>Research has shown that the majority of cyber incidents can be avoided if some simple cyber hygiene practices are adopted.</p><p>MAS will soon issue a set of mandatory requirements on cyber hygiene that will apply to all financial institutions in Singapore. They include basic things like:</p><p>- securing administrative accounts;<br/>- controlling network access at the perimeter;<br/>- installing security patches promptly;<br/>- installing anti-virus software on their systems; and<br/>- implementing multi-factor authentication for users who access confidential information over the Internet.</p><p>In short, if we don't get cyber security right, financial institutions will be constrained in how much they can leverage on technology.</p><p>The second area financial institutions must address to ensure customer confidence is information security risk.</p><p>Information security is not the same as cyber security.</p><p>Information security is focused on protecting data, while cyber security is focused on protecting systems.</p><p>They are however closely related.</p><p>Data leaks can occur when a system is not properly secured.</p><p>In the financial ecosystem, information security risk is growing for two key reasons:</p><p>One, more data are becoming digitised. The International Data Corporation has estimated that digital data will increase fivefold from 2018 to 2025.</p><p>Two, as banks begin to collaborate with fintech and BigTech players, customer data that was traditionally within the inner sanctum of banks will increasingly be shared with third party service providers.</p><p>Banks have to exercise care for the data they hold, as well as those that they have shared with third parties. This means:</p><p>- understanding at a granular level the data that are held, processed or shared;<br/>- assessing the criticality and sensitivity of all data sets;<br/>- putting in place targeted measures to safeguard data; and<br/>- taking swift recovery measures in the event of a data breach.</p><p>Besides their personal health data, people regard their personal financial data as most sensitive. Financial institutions have a particular responsibility to safeguard this data.</p><p>The third area to watch closely is risk from the misuse of data analytics and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Data analytics and artificial intelligence can help to uncover patterns which we are unaware of and to provide insights that we could not have gained from traditional analytical tools.</p><p>But unless there is public trust that data analytics and artificial intelligence will be used responsibly, financial institutions will not get the social licence they need to apply these technologies widely.</p><p>To gain this trust, we must address four areas in data analytics and artificial intelligence:</p><p>- Privacy of data. How do we safeguard the confidentiality of personal data'<br/>- Explainability of results. How do we minimise the \"black box\" syndrome'<br/>- Accountability for decisions. How can we hold humans ultimately responsible for decisions made by self-learning machines'<br/>- Acceptability of outcomes. How do we minimise unconscious bias, social exclusion, and ethically unacceptable consequences'</p><p>MAS has co-created with the financial industry in Singapore a set of preliminary principles to guide the responsible use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in financial services.</p><p>The Principles are centred on four pillars - fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency. Hence, the short-hand name FEAT Principles.</p><p>They are not prescriptive but represent an industry consensus that individual financial institutions take reference from when formulating their own data governance policies and practices.</p><p>We believe that the FEAT Principles will help to promote public confidence and trust in the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in our financial sector.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Technology and Finance must come together. And they must do so in a manner that maintains Trust.</p><p>Finance, Technology and Trust are like the three musketeers of old.</p><p>Like Athos, Finance allocates resources to those who need it.</p><p>Like Porthos, Technology represents the aspiration for Finance to innovate.</p><p>Like Aramis, Trust engenders confidence in Finance.</p><p>The motto of the three musketeers is: \"Tous pour un, Un pour tous\" - \"One for all, All for one\".</p><p>If Finance, Technology, and Trust can do the same, we can have innovation and dynamism with safety and stability.</p><p>We can benefit not only the financial industry, but society at large.</p><p>We can raise productivity, expand opportunity, and enrich the lives of our people.</p><p> The writer is managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This was his Banque de France Lecture delivered at the French central bank in Paris on 14 May 2019. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The motto of the three musketeers is: \"Tous pour un, Un pour tous\" - \"One for all, All for one\".

The impact of this 'tool' on competition law and policy would be impossible to overstate. It would be likely to change competition law as we know it, and as developed over decades of thinking, debate, precedent and experience. The goal of the tool is to identify 'structural risks' that cannot be addressed under Articles 101 and 102, and under the merger rules. These include markets that risk tipping, unilateral practices by non-dominant firms or oligopolistic market structures. </p><p>In the face of those risks, and even absent any infringement, the Commission could then impose behavioural or structural remedies (e.g. divestments, break-ups and other line of business restrictions[2]). The Commission explains that the scope of this tool would not necessarily be limited to digital markets. This new initiative would have been unthinkable only a few months ago. But then again, we live in a strange new world. Let me give you just one additional example: in a report[3] also published last week, the Austrian competition authority proposed to 'reverse the burden of proof' in cases where 'official investigations rapidly come up against natural or technical limits' (!). As explained here,[4] and by more authoritative people than myself, this was, and should still be, something 'hard to conceive, at least in free democratic societies'. I have trouble accepting that these ideas might be the new normal. The proposal of a new competition tool also raises too many important questions; here are just a few as an appetizer. We will have time for more in the future. [Disclosure: Just like virtually every competition lawyer/economist, I have a large number of clients that would be potentially affected by this proposal, and they might have different views about it; these are just my own]. Please feel free to engage with these questions, particularly if you have different views. Would there be an overlap between the new tool and Articles 101 and 102? The justification for the tool is that there may be concerns that 'the EU competition rules cannot tackle or cannot address in the most effective manner'. Is the idea to cover alleged 'gap' cases only, or also concerns that could be addressed under competition law but that it would be harder to prove under an infringement procedure (e.g. because there are clear evidentiary standards)? Overlaps could be problematic (see the next question below). And if the Commission wants to avoid potential overlap, then it should make clear the type of 'concerns' that fall outside the scope of the competition rules (e.g. self-preferencing absent indispensability?) I doubt one may want to do that. The key question, and the limitations of the legal basis: Would the tool have the object or the effect of bypassing the intervention standards set by the EU Courts in relation to Articles 101 and 102? This is, in my mind, the real question. To the extent that there may be a material overlap, this would become inevitable. As explained here[5] and here[6], I think it would be unwise to ignore the lessons learnt over the years (I don't buy, and will actively combat, the new argument that 'judges don't get it'). But my point today is a different one: there is no legal basis for the Commission to bypass the content of Articles 101 and 102 as interpreted by the EU Courts. The Commission has explained that the competition legal basis for the proposal would be Article 103 TFEU[7]. This provision only enables the adoption of legislation to 'give effect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and 102', 'ensure compliance with the prohibitions' or 'define the scope of the provisions'. Any new tool based on Art. 103 TFEU would need to be consistent with the provisions of the Treaty as interpreted by the Courts (regarding, for example, the burden of proof, the notions of restriction of competition[8], dominance, anticompetitive effects[9]). The Treaty provisions deal with restrictions of competition, but can arguably not be the legal basis for measures that seek to create new competition. Do we want to bring the definition of the substantive scope of the competition rules to the realm of politics? Competition law has historically been judge-made law, in the belief that this would ensure its flexibility, adaptability, and its isolation from small politics.[10] Until now, only the Commission and the Courts have played a role in defining the material scope of the competition rules. Legislative initiatives under Art. 103 TFEU were limited to merger rules and procedural matters. Again, the times they are-a changin'. This may (for better or for worse) cross what until now was a red line, potentially changing the discipline. It may seem the Commission is obtaining new powers, but it may be at the risk of losing its preeminent role in defining the rules. Is there really a blind spot in competition law? We dealt with that in a recent post[11]. There are few, if any, areas of the law as flexible and malleable as competition law. Are there really gaps? I, for one, trust in the ability of the Commission to bring, and win, cases where a real problem exists. Have DG Comp's existing sectoral powers let us down? Remarkably, not so long ago the sentiment was that competition law was unduly harsh to dominant firms[12] (I didn't buy that then, and I don't buy the opposite now). That competition law may not reach where some people would like it to doesn't mean there is a gap. Having to analyze practices on a case by case basis is not a flaw, but the only way to get it right. Can the pace of competition enforcement give rise to irreversible consequences?Two questions here: is there any case where we know that earlier intervention would have made a change? If you think about it, even the tech cases that have taken a number of years (e.g. Google Shopping) were ultimately precautionary in nature (i.e. concerned about likely potential effects). If the decision had really come too late, it should have been easy to make a case about actual effects. Also, can we all agree that competition authorities need more resources and that this would also help speeding up cases? Are remedies the problem? You may have lately heard on the conference circuit that cases are good but remedies are horrible. It's clear why one would say that, but it can be a legitimate view. The way we see it, though, remedies, and their outcome, often tell you a lot about how solid a case really is. Imagine a fictional case where there would be no causality between the conduct found as abusive and its alleged effects (for example, because the domco's market share was due to superior quality). If you impose a remedy targeting that conduct, the remedy will of course not have any impact. Arguably, the remedy's failure would simply expose that the conduct wasn't a problem in the first place. If one believes that the theories of harm underlying a decision are sound, and we believe that a compliant remedy is insufficient, why don't we simply draft decisions differently? How to ensure the proportionality of intervention? Under current EU competition law (and except in Art. 9 commitment scenarios) remedies need to be proportionate to undoing the consequences of an alleged infringement. Some people believe that the advantage of the new tool is that it would enable the Commission to impose more far-reaching remedies because, as there would be no infringement, there would be no need to ensure proportionality to it. This is a curious logic: since a company did nothing wrong, it can be treated worse. Where would then lie the proportionality limits? The Inception Impact Assessment[13] explains that 'these remedies would increase costs for the companies concerned. The proportionality of the costs incurred would be ensured by the fact that such remedies have to be limited to ensuring the proper functioning of the market under scrutiny'. You can judge for yourselves whether that dispels concerns. What impact on international convergence? The EU competition law system of objective expert-based and fair has been a model to other jurisdictions and has inspired many important legislative initiatives around the world. The creation of new standards, the imposition of remedies absent an infringement and the wide margin to identify the situations in need of intervention could also be replicated in other jurisdictions with arguably less guarantess. Be careful what you wish for. The CMA experience is cited as the basis for this new tool, but not all jurisdictions have the UK's checks and balances. There are in any case lessons from the experience there. The UK has chosen not to use that tool for tech issues when it could have, believing that other tools would be preferable. Why? Where has the CMA done a better job in a market than DG Comp? Was it because the CMA could act faster or because of something else? Would the new tool be of a 'non punitive' nature? The Inception Impact Assessment insists that the options considered would entail no finding of infringement, no fines, no damages claims. Why that emphasis? There may be an assumption that a new regulatory tool would be able to do away with some burdens, including the burden of proof.[14] The 'advantage' of the new tool is that one could impose even stricter remedies, without having to establish any wrongdoing. That seems like a win-win for some. But think about it again: companies may face stricter remedies than under quasi criminal competition law, with less procedural rights, and even if they haven't done anything wrong. This doesn't mean there is no punishment; it means there would be punishment without the crime and without limiting principles. Would a new tool compliant with the standards that the ECHR sets for liberal democracies? How would we be able to challenge other countries if they start adopting adopting harsh remedies (against companies or individuals) absent wrongdoing but in response to perceived threats? Do we really want this to be the new normal? The 'new tool' would not be a mere technical refirenement; it goes much beyond that. We can no doubt make improvements, but we should be extremely careful not to cross red lines. In competition law (and perhaps even more in competition economics) we have become accustomed to the absence of bright lines and we dislike restrictions, but the law does by nature set some limits to what we all can do (and this goes both for companies and public authorities). Legal rules are but the wise restraints that make us free[15]. It may be frustrating, but we know from experience that it is much better than discretion[16]. This doesn't mean we should necessarily be satisfied with the 'status quo' (without some friction there may not be progress), but we shouldn't compromise basic principles in the search for solutions. The European Union leads with values, and the balance of justice that makes us proud depends on our taking an evidence led approach to competition law subject to clear standards and thorough judicial review.

It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome.

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries.

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries.

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

Facebook will also exclude Australia from the roll out of the platform's news tab, which has already seen payments to participating publishers including, in the US, News Corp.  The announcement follows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/19/tech-giants-google-media-threat/\">big tech playbook</url>: can't pay? Won't pay!  It's come as a shock. While Google has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">actively mobilising</url> its audience in opposition to the proposed mandatory code between big tech and old media, which would require payments for use of news in search or social media,\u00a0Facebook has been remarkably quiet until today.  It came in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">online announcement</url> from Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton, with the vanilla heading: \"An update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia\":   \"We are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits. Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.\"  It's not the first time big tech has gone on strike to protest regulations that cost it money. Google dropped its news search tab in Spain in 2014 when faced with copyright fees for its brief snippets, while car hire apps Uber and Lyft are threatening to leave California if they are forced to treat drivers as employees, which they claim will increase costs by 30%.  Facebook and Google say the justification for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's mandatory code proposal gets it precisely back to front: \"Over the first five months of 2020 we sent 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook's News Feed back to Australian news websites at no charge -- additional traffic worth an estimated $200 million AUD to Australian publishers.\"   Sounds like a lot. But it's a fraction of the day-to-day traffic across the social media giant. This traffic ( which \"allows family and friends to connect\" as Facebook says) will not be affected by the news boycott.  Facebook has been winding down its promotion of news. In early 2018, it tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from family and friends (and paid-for advertising) over news posts. The result? Traffic went up and news went down.  The draft legislation for the mandatory code was aimed at leveraging funding for old media -- particularly News Corp which has been the driving force behind the proposal. Their Australian CEO Michael Miller has boasted of potential revenues of $1 billion.   It excludes the ABC and SBS from payments, but it also precludes the tech giants from picking favourites -- it either allows all news, or no news. While commercial publishers use social media to draw traffic to their own sites, the public broadcasters don't need to monetise their content. This allows them to meet their audience where they find it. As a result, their audiences are likely to be disproportionately affected by today's announcement.   The draft code also provided old media with extensive rights to fore-knowledge or any algorithm changes that could affect them -- a proposal that Google has said may allow companies to game the system over the interests of other organisations, including other media.  The code would also require Facebook to allow users to turn off comments -- which Australian courts have found can lead to defamation claims against publishers. This would be a challenge to Facebook's engagement (read: outrage) model.  News is often used by political actors to build their own outrage model, particularly within closed groups. A news-free Facebook will challenge that organising approach or see news increasingly replaced by fake news.  The Australian government (and old media) have been hyping the mandatory code as \"world first\" regulation that will set a model for other countries. Now, Facebook is testing a new world model, banking that a News Feed without news will be their best possible outcome. That will certainly be closely watched. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Facebook's threats work? Will the ACCC's code make online media a better place?

But it is not really using its strength wisely.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Data released over the next few months will show that the current US economic expansion is the longest on record. But while the United States continues to outperform other advanced economies, this success has yet to dispel many Americans' persistent sense of economic insecurity and frustration; nor does it alleviate concerns about the lack of policy space to respond to the next economic downturn or financial shock.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The current expansion began in mid-2009, following the 2008 financial crisis and the \"Great Recession.\" Powered initially by exceptional fiscal interventions and previously unthinkable monetary policies, the economy built enough of a foundation for private-sector confidence to return, and for corporate balance sheets to recover. Coupled with accelerating advances in new technologies, the expansion came to be led in large part by technology and platform companies presiding over the new \"gig economy.\" It was given further impetus by pro-growth measures, including deregulation and tax cuts.</p><p>With the US unemployment rate at <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>3.6%</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, real (inflation-adjusted) wages are now growing at 1.6%. And with the most recent quarterly data indicating an annualised GDP growth rate of       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>3.1%</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, US economic activity continues to outpace that of Europe and Japan by a significant margin. Owing to this strength, America has become increasingly assertive in pursuing national objectives abroad, including by circumventing longstanding cooperative and conflict-resolution mechanisms and threatening import tariffs and other protectionist measures.</p><p>To get to this point, the US had to overcome headwinds from abroad, including an existential debt crisis in Europe and slowing economic growth in China. Domestically, deep political polarisation, especially since 2011, has impeded congressional legislative activity and produced multiple actual or threatened government shutdowns (including the <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>longest on record</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>). In the absence of new pro-growth measures from Congress, monetary policy became the \"      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>only game in town</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.\" After being forced to expand its role in the economy substantially during the crisis years, the US Federal Reserve flirted with some major policy mistakes, and became more vulnerable to       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>political interference</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.</p><p>Potential vulnerability</p><p>Because annual growth over the past decade has often been tepid and insufficiently inclusive - what has become <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>known</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> as the \"new normal,\" or secular stagnation - the US economy has been left with a residual sense of underperformance and potential vulnerability. According to an oft-cited Fed       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>survey</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, almost half of US households report having insufficient savings to cover a $400 emergency expense.</p><p>No wonder trust in institutions and expert opinion <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>remains</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> so low. Coupled with excessive inequality (of income, wealth, and opportunity), frustration and political anger remain high. Making matters worse, fearmongering about the implications of technology and globalisation continues to fuel concerns of job dislocations and disruptions. And outside the US, many have come to worry that the superpower responsible for issuing the global reserve currency, and that plays a decisive role in many multilateral interactions, is no longer a reliable and predictable anchor for global trade and finance.</p><p>Moreover, unlike in prior expansions, the US is yet to build sufficient buffers to deal with future economic and financial challenges. Or, to quote former US president John F. Kennedy <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>by way of</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> IMF managing director       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Christine Lagarde</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> more recently, we have not fixed the roof while the sun was shining.</p><p>Beyond the lack of self-insurance at the household level, the Fed's ability to counter economic recessions and financial disruptions is rather limited. Whereas the current policy rate is 2.25%-2.5%, past downturns have usually required cuts of five percentage points or more. Also, the Fed has a bloated balance sheet and a rather weak mechanism for transmitting monetary-policy measures to the real economy. And even if fiscal policymakers were to become more responsive, they would be starting from a point of relatively high deficits and debt.</p><p>Market accidents</p><p>Prolonging the current expansion will require great care. Policymakers, particularly Congress, need to avoid big mistakes and minimise the risk of market accidents while doing more to promote growth. The US needs a well-targeted approach to modernising and upgrading its infrastructure.</p><p>Policymakers and leading economists also must be more sensitive to how the fruits of economic growth are shared; among other things, there should be better protections for the most vulnerable segments of society and stronger automatic stabilisers. Businesses, for their part, need to do more to embrace their social responsibilities, if only to avoid ending up in the same position as the banks after the 2008 crash. There is already a growing chorus calling for more regulatory constraints on Big Tech.</p><p>Moreover, having shaken up global trade, the US needs to ensure that it will remain the anchor of the rules-based international system. Otherwise, its ability to inform and influence economic and financial outcomes around the world will weaken.</p><p>The US will - and should - soon be celebrating its longest-ever expansion. But it must not lose sight of its remaining challenges.

Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \u201cThe bill not only codifies privacy as a right \u2014a measure long overdue \u2014but it also recognizes that \u2018rights\u2019 that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\u201d</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers\u2019 data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights.</p><p>\u201cIn the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\u201d Ranking Member Cantwell said. \u201cThey should be like your Miranda rights\u2014clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won\u2019t be used to harm them,\u201d said Senator Schatz. \u201cOur bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompanies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\u201d said Senator Klobuchar. \u201cOur legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It\u2019s time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demand for consumers\u2019 personal information today is at an all-time high,\u201d Senator Markey said. \u201cBut while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\u201d</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people\u2019s online privacy\u2014a challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE.</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE.</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation:</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \u201cThis bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information \u2014whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right \u2014a measure long overdue \u2014but it also recognizes that \u2018rights\u2019 that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\u201d Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \u201cThis is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors\u2019 leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\u201d</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \u201cThis legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\u201d</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy &amp; Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: 'For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacy\u2014not just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.'</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \u201cAfrican Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership and on including important protections for civil and human rights in the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step. In the 21st century, privacy legislation must ensure data cannot be used in ways to undermine hard-fought civil rights. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on comprehensive data privacy rights legislation.\u201d</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \u201cIn today\u2019s online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals\u2019 personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\u201d</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \u201cThe Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S \u201d</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \u201cThis strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy: \u201cResearch demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\u201d</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2655005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKT-SWG1-JDG9-Y4T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- New consumer rights guaranteed by strong federal compliance and consumer right to sue</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Data companies with security breaches can be fined</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and fellow senior members Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Ed Markey (D-MA) unveiled comprehensive federal online privacy legislation to establish privacy rights, outlaw harmful and deceptive practices, and improve data security safeguards for the record number of American consumers who now shop or conduct business online.</p><p>With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done online--making this the largest online holiday shopping season ever --families everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security. Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \"The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\"</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights.</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Ranking Member Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights--clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" said Senator Schatz. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" said Senator Klobuchar. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Senator Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people's online privacy--a challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text</url>).</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager</url>).</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security</url>).</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation:</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information --whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\" Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\"</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \"This legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\"</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy &amp;#38; Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: \"For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacy--not just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.\"</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership and on including important protections for civil and human rights in the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step. In the 21st century, privacy legislation must ensure data cannot be used in ways to undermine hard-fought civil rights. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on comprehensive data privacy rights legislation.\"</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\"</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.\"</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S. PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \"This strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\"</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy: \"Research demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\"</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S. economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6941112 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6941112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKV-CPD1-JC11-11J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1829\"/><timeReceived>7:55 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done onlinemaking this the largest online holiday shopping season ever families everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security. Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \"The bill not only codifies privacy as a right a measure long overdue but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\" The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. </p><p>The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights. \"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Ranking Member Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" said Senator Schatz. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" said Senator Klobuchar. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Senator Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\" This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people's online privacya challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE. A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE. The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE. Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation :</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right a measure long overdue but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\" Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\" University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \"This legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\"</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: \"For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacynot just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.\"</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership and on including important protections for civil and human rights in the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step. In the 21st century, privacy legislation must ensure data cannot be used in ways to undermine hard-fought civil rights. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on comprehensive data privacy rights legislation.\"</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\"</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.\"</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S. PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \"This strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\"</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocac y: \"Research demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\" Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S. economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123346279</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM3-61H1-JCBF-S22G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Cantwell, Maria - (D - WA) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON, D.C--Today U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and fellow senior members Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Ed Markey (D-MA) unveiled comprehensive federal online privacy legislation to establish privacy rights, outlaw harmful and deceptive practices, and improve data security safeguards for the record number of American consumers who now shop or conduct business online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done online--making this the largest online holiday shopping season ever --families everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security. Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \"The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\"</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights.</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Ranking Member Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights--clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" said Senator Schatz. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" said Senator Klobuchar. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Senator Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people's online privacy--a challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text</url>.</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager</url>.</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security</url>.</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation:</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information --whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\" Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\"</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \"This legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\"</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: \"For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacy--not just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.\"</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership and on including important protections for civil and human rights in the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step. In the 21st century, privacy legislation must ensure data cannot be used in ways to undermine hard-fought civil rights. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on comprehensive data privacy rights legislation.\"</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\"</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.\"</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S. PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \"This strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\"</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy: \"Research demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\"</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S. economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-senate-democrats-unveil-strong-online-privacy-rights\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-senate-democrats-unveil-strong-online-privacy-rights</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSMB2690272</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKV-C8K1-JCCP-01M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Maria Cantwell (D-WA), ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, has introduced consumer privacy legislation as Chairman Roger Wicker (R-MS) prepares for a Dec. 4 hearing where privacy advocates and former regulators will likely square off over protecting personal information in an increasingly digital economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" said Cantwell in a statement announcing her bill on Tuesday. \"They should be like your Miranda rights -- clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>Cantwell's bill -- co-sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ed Markey (D-MA) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) -- could be seen as a pre-emptive strike by Democrats as the Commerce Committee's Republican leadership gears up for a legislative process that could kick off with next week's hearing.</p><p>The bill, the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA), also comes just days after senior Democrats from several key committees with jurisdiction over some aspect of consumer data offered a \"framework\" intended to guide legislative work on a comprehensive approach to protecting online consumer data. Cantwell was part of the Democratic group that issued the framework on Nov. 18, along with Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Judiciary; Sherrod Brown (D-OH) on Banking; and Patty Murray (D-WA) on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used,\" said Klobuchar in a statement announcing COPRA. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>Specifically, the Cantwell bill requires companies that handle consumer information to adopt \"reasonable data security practices,\" which include assessing vulnerabilities, mitigating risks and deleting data when it \"is no longer necessary for the purpose for which the data was collected,\" among other measures.</p><p>The proposed Democratic legislation would give online customers the right to access data being collected about them, the right to request that data be deleted or corrected, and the right to expect adequate security measures are being taken.</p><p>The legislation defines \"covered data\" as \"information that identifies, or is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual or a consumer device, including derived data.\" The legislation also includes provisions for the handling of \"de-identified\" data, \"employee data\" and \"public records.\"</p><p>\"Term 'de-identfied data' means information that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, an individual, a household, or a device used by an individual or household, provided that the entity -- (A) takes reasonable measures to ensure that the information cannot be reidentified, or associated with, an individual, a household, or a device used by an individual or household; (B) publicly commits in a conspicuous manner -- (i) to process and transfer the information in a de-identified form; and (ii) not to attempt to reidentify or associate the information with any individual, household, or device used by an individual or household; and (C) contractually obligates any person or entity that receives the information from the covered entity to comply with all of the provisions of this paragraph,\" according to the legislation.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee is slated to hold a hearing Dec. 4 on \"Examining Legislative Proposals to Protect Consumer Data Privacy,\" during which Cantwell's bill is likely to be discussed.</p><p>Witnesses include Julie Brill, former commissioner of the FTC and vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft; Maureen Ohlhausen, former acting chair of the FTC and co-chair of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition; and Michelle Richardson, director of privacy and data at the Center for Democracy and Technology. -- Rick Weber (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rweber@iwpnews.com\">rweber@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICSRTY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICSRTY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNB-0FW1-DY0P-G304-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">412529</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"720\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Cyber Security</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 3, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

They\u2019re getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won\u2019t.</p><p>The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives \u2014 when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms \u2014 Americans turned to their government for a fix.</p><p>In the last half-century, lawmakers and regulators set up a regime to improve the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.crashtest.org/history-car-safety/\">safety of automobiles</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Guides/General-Information/Who-We-Are\u2014-What-We-Do-for-You\">other manufactured goods</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.corp.att.com/history/history3.html\">to break up a telephone monopoly</url> that controlled much of the nation\u2019s communications and to loosen the fatal grip that tobacco companies held over American society.</p><p>We are now at another great turning point in the global economy. A handful of technology companies, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/technology/techs-frightful-5-will-dominate-digital-life-for-foreseeable-future.html\">the Frightful Five</url> \u2014 Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, the largest American corporations by stock-market value \u2014 control the technological platforms that will dominate life for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind.</p><p>Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants\u2019 power through government \u2014 and, if so, how.</p><p>There are growing efforts in Washington to do something about big tech. The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last year\u2019s presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.</p><p>On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five \u2014 Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.</p><p>But there is little to suggest we\u2019ll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants\u2019 vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.</p><p>\u201cIndividuals, lawmakers, we\u2019re all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,\u201d said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable \u2014 so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.</p><p>Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting. In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html\">reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder</url>. (Google and New America have denied that claim.)</p><p>\u201cOur firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cFolks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I\u2019d bet a lot of money a year from now we\u2019ll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.\u201d</p><p>Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we\u2019ve ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They\u2019re being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.</p><p>They\u2019re creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence \u2014 a technological achievement that may come with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgjMXMkebWAhVKxoMKHUXtAYEQFghGMAU&amp;url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x&amp;usg=AOvVaw1k4v60I3g_BmyB9joLYFnC\">as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons</url>. And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.</p><p>But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power. Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2017/07/28/google-facebook-digital-advertising/\">Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example</url>.</p><p>Apple\u2019s iPhone is the world\u2019s most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States<url normalizedValue=\"https://9to5mac.com/2017/08/09/us-iphone-sales-ios-market-share-kantar/\">are not iPhones</url>.</p><p>Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines. But only in the last year did Amazon\u2019s annual revenue surpass that of Costco. It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/07/amazon-is-eating-the-retail-world.html\">a single-digit share of American retail</url> and is still a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theinformation.com/amazon-supremacy-think-again\">minor satellite compared with Walmart\u2019s sun</url>.</p><p>Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five\u2019s power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all become a bit cyborg,\u201d writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d one of several new books examining the giants. \u201cWhat we need to always remember is that we\u2019re not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.\u201d</p><p>The complicated nature of the Five\u2019s power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them. In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">an article in The Yale Law Journal</url> arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon. Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.</p><p>Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazon\u2019s growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy. Open Markets has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/5/16243868/google-monopoly-antitrust-open-markets-barry-lynn\">offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook</url>.</p><p>Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it\u2019s politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn\u2019t need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.</p><p>That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn\u2019t done much in office to carry that out.

They're getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won't.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives - when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms - Americans turned to their government for a fix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last half-century, lawmakers and regulators set up a regime to improve the safety of automobiles and other manufactured goods, to break up a telephone monopoly that controlled much of the nation's communications and to loosen the fatal grip that tobacco companies held over American society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are now at another great turning point in the global economy. A handful of technology companies, the Frightful Five - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, the largest American corporations by stock-market value - control the technological platforms that will dominate life for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind.</p><p>Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants' power through government - and, if so, how.</p><p>There are growing efforts in Washington to do <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">something</emphasis> about big tech. The recognition that networks like Facebook, Google and YouTube played a great and mainly hidden role in last year's presidential election has spurred an urgent effort to regulate political ads online.</p><p>On the left, there has been a surge of interest in rethinking antitrust policy to deal with the most economically impactful of the Five - Amazon, Facebook and Google. Republicans have been more muted, but there are wisps of concern, especially from the Steve Bannon wing of the right. Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart chairman and former presidential adviser, has repeatedly assailed tech companies for their liberal worldview and what he calls their threats to free speech.</p><p>But there is little to suggest we'll see drastic action anytime soon. Among policy intellectuals, there is far from universal recognition that the tech giants' vast powers might be harmful. The intellectual underpinnings for how to regulate one or two or several of the Five remain vague. The political will to do so is even more elusive; the tech companies remain exceedingly popular, and they are using their vast fortunes to acquire political and cultural clout.</p><p>\"Individuals, lawmakers, we're all feeling a rapid loss of control and power around these companies,\" said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that opposes concentrated corporate power. For many years, he said, tech giants have been considered essentially untouchable - so big that even contemplating taking them on prompts political paralysis.</p><p>Mr. Lynn thinks that view is shifting. In June, Open Markets was forced from its previous home, the New America Foundation, reportedly because of pressure from Google, a huge New America funder. (Google and New America have denied that claim.)</p><p>\"Our firing has transformed the discussions among people about the power of these companies,\" Mr. Lynn said. \"Folks in this town saw this, noticed it, and I'd bet a lot of money a year from now we'll see real huge shifts in feelings around here.\"</p><p>Part of what has hampered governmental action against the Five is the unusual nature of their power. Much of what they do now, and will soon have the power to do, exceeds what we've ever expected from corporations. In different ways, they each collect, analyze and mediate our most important public and personal information, including news, political data and our relationships. They're being called upon to police free speech, terrorism and sex trafficking, and to defend nations and individuals against existential digital attack.</p><p>They're creating machines that could one day approximate and surpass human intelligence - a technological achievement that may come with as many complications as the advent of nuclear weapons. And all of them figure into economic inequality in the United States, since their digital wares provide vast riches to a relative few employees and investors in liberal West Coast enclaves, while passing over much of the rest of the world.</p><p>But in other ways, the Five do not cleanly fit traditional notions of what constitutes dangerous corporate power. Only a couple of them enjoy monopolies or duopolies in their markets - Google and Facebook in digital ads, for example.</p><p>Apple's iPhone is the world's most profitable product, its App Store the most important digital marketplace, and yet two out of three smartphones sold in the United States are not iPhones.</p><p>Amazon is considered ground zero in the vast transformation of American retail, and is implicated in the unfolding story of how our jobs and our lunches will be gobbled up by machines. But only in the last year did Amazon's annual revenue surpass that of Costco. It does not yet enjoy a majority share of online commerce in America, has a single-digit share of American retail and is still a minor satellite compared with Walmart's sun.</p><p>Then there is our own complicated relationship with the tech giants. We do not think of them in the same way we think of, say, the faceless megacorps of Wall Street. The Five's power comes cloaked in friendliness, utility and irresistible convenience at unbelievable prices. We hooked our lives into them willingly, and then we became addicted to them. For many Americans, life without all but one or two of them might feel just about unlivable.</p><p>\"We've all become a bit cyborg,\" writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of New Republic, in \"World Without Mind,\" one of several new books examining the giants. \"What we need to always remember is that we're not just merging with machines, but with the companies that run the machines.\"</p><p>The complicated nature of the Five's power has sparked novel ideas about how to regulate them. In January, Lina M. Khan, a fellow at Open Markets, published an article in The Yale Law Journal arguing for a complete reconception of antitrust laws to deal with the rise of Amazon. Ms. Khan argued that the modern view of antitrust laws, which were conceived under the Reagan administration, overemphasized low prices as a test for whether a company is gaining too much market power.</p><p>Because Amazon manages to keep lowering prices, the antitrust authorities have overlooked other harms caused by Amazon's growth, she said, including the way it has created platforms for shipping and cloud storage that give it deep hooks into much of the rest of the economy. Open Markets has offered a similar critique of Google and Facebook.</p><p>Yet these ideas are controversial even among liberals, in part because it's politically perilous to argue that consumers should somehow be suspicious of lower prices. Diana Moss, the president of the progressive American Antitrust Institute, told me that we didn't need new rules to go after tech firms; we just needed stronger enforcement.</p><p>That, too, seems to be lacking. Under the Obama administration, tech companies were treated solicitously by the government. European regulators have pursued Google and accused it of abusing its search monopoly, but the Federal Trade Commission closed a 2013 review. During last year's presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked often about quashing tech power, but he hasn't done much in office to carry that out. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, for example, sailed through regulatory review.</p><p>Put all this together and you get a story of apathy and indecision in the face of colossal corporate power.</p><p>\"We are looking at a set of circumstances where the monopolies have become so much more pervasive and intrusive,\" said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who took on Microsoft at its peak two decades ago, prompting the historic trial against the company.</p><p>Mr. Reback, who is now working against Google, argued that the government's antitrust prosecution of Microsoft had altered the company's culture - which in turn created room in the market for entrants like Google and Facebook.</p><p>A similar revival could be in the offing if we started policing today's tech giants. But that's a big if.</p><p>\"The big hurdle is, are we going to decide to address these problems as a society?\" Mr. Reback said. \"Had we been more diligent, we wouldn't have nearly the problems we have today.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter: @fmanjoo</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005514331</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PTC-JVF1-DYR7-C3BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 25, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

But the problems with the social-networking platform are essentially the same for all the big so-called edge companies - Facebook, Apple, Google and Twitter - that are getting a taste of the regulatory ire long principally confined to internet-service providers under the Obama administration.</p><p>Their enormous scale, compared to predecessors, and market power over information have created enormous, unforeseen and complicated issues, from seemingly unstoppable Russian election meddlers to inopportune breaches to claims of outright censorship.</p><p>Driving it all is a massive and heavily guarded, data-driven, targeted-advertising business model that provides for all that \"free\" content. The price/trade-off all along appears to have been consumer privacy and data security. The companies' biggest sin, though, is hiding that fact from consumers - and Congress - and not allowing simpler solutions for consumers, such as a comprehensive opt-out policy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Litany of Problems, Critics</emphasis></p><p>The problems the former garage-startup Silicon Valley darlings face are legion, and attacks are coming from all sides: competitors, the Federal Communications Commission, President Donald Trump, Republicans and Democrats in Congress and even activist groups that were once allied with the edge and against the internet-service providers but that have now expanded their view of \"bad actors.\"</p><p>Democrats and Republicans in Congress are taking a hard look at social media's liability from third-party postings, driven by issues like online sex trafficking, hate speech, violent speech and allegations of censorship of conservative speakers.</p><p>If social-media sites are weeding out content, then they are not neutral platforms. And if they are not neutral platforms, the argument goes, then they should not get the benefit of Section 230 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which innoculates them from legal action targeting third-party posts.</p><p>And as one side of the political aisle hammers edge providers for allegedly censoring conservative speech, the edge also faces hammering (from both sides) for not doing enough to weed out hateful and violent speech (as defined by whoever is doing the criticizing).</p><p>If edge providers are expected to police their sites better for unacceptable content, just what content qualifies as unacceptable?</p><p>No one argues that websites shouldn't take down terrorist threats or streamed video of mass attacks, but what about grayer areas? Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has signaled content that makes the online community feel uncomfortable is subject to being blocked.</p><p>And who is making the call? A person, an algorithm, the government? Edge providers are trying to figure that out under the explicit warning from Washington that they need to do it ASAP, including from Republicans who argue social media sites are not getting it right, or are getting \"too left,\" as it were.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blackburn Video Was Rallying Point</emphasis></p><p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) testified at a Capitol Hill hearing last year that an October 2017 video launching her ultimately successful Senate campaign - she was chair of the House Communications Subcommittee at the time - was removed from Twitter's ad platform \"due to my pro-life message.\" It was restored and Twitter ultimately apologized, saying the removal was a mistake.</p><p>But Blackburn's experience became a rallying point for other Republicans, who have invoked it in recent weeks in their push to regulate the edge.</p><p>In a recent speech, Blackburn said that Silicon Valley has been arrogant, with a \"toxic undercurrent\" to industry practices that \"can't be ignored,\" and something she signaled Washington definitely wouldn't be ignoring.</p><p>Democrats and Republicans are both on board with some form of government crackdown on Big Tech, either more vigorous antitrust enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, new privacy regulations on edge providers or both, enforced by the FTC with stronger rulemaking and fining authority.</p><p>For edge companies not wishing to be the nail to Washington's hammer, it couldn't be a worse time for regulators and lawmakers to wake up to the dangers of all that data collection and sharing and tracking. That's because this new scrutiny coincides with a presidential election campaign, giving a crowded field of Democratic primary candidates a \"big issue\" to hitch their wagons to.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been the most vocal on the subject, even adding a plank in her presidential campaign platform about breaking up Big Tech (see sidebar, page 10).</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) a familiar critic of internet-service provider size and power, is also on the record, as is South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg said antitrust law \"has begun to hit its limits\" with regulating Big Tech, which may need shaking up or even breaking up. He said that law \"was not designed to handle some of these tech companies.\"</p><p>And presidential hopefuls are not the only officials looking to leverage the issue.</p><p>Shaking up or breaking up Big Tech has even made allies of Klobuchar and Blackburn. The two lawmakers have pressed the Federal Trade Commission to go public with any investigation it is conducting of Google or other edge providers given \"concerns regarding potential privacy, data security and antitrust violations involving online platforms,\" the duo said in an April letter to the agency.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is taking a new look at the edge as it relates to antitrust issues. FTC chairman Joe Simons told Congress last month that the review of how the antitrust laws should apply to high-tech conduct is not a one-off task force, but a new litigation division ready to pursue anti-competitive conduct by the edge, including getting at digital platforms through their impact on privacy.</p><p>Simons made it clear that antitrust issues are raised not only by pricing but by reductions in product quality, which could include privacy, he said.</p><p>One argument is that edge giants have been allowed to grow by buying smaller companies - acquisitions that didn't raise antitrust alarms - then use that size as a de facto bar to future competitive startups, the absence of which can't be measured.</p><p>At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing two weeks ago, witness Brian O'Kelley - founder of AppNexus and the self-described founder of many of the technologies that make programmatic advertising possible - summed up his issue with big tech in general and Google in particular. He said Google has used its bundled services to \"unfairly\" impede the growth of his startup: \"The internet giants have no incentive to address privacy issues without competitive pressure or regulatory oversight.\"</p><p>Congress needs to \"figure out a way to rein in these massive companies\" to protect consumers and preserve startup innovation, he said.</p><p>O'Kelley also said the focus on price is the loophole that has allowed Google and Facebook to buy hundreds of companies under the antitrust radar.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New Antitrust Scrutiny at Justice</emphasis></p><p>The Brookings Institution just released a report teeing up the \"the major political and economic threats\" posed by online platforms, arguing that while a number of lawmakers are calling for \"modernizing\" antitrust to match the digital age, \"dominant tech companies continue to largely evade scrutiny.\"</p><p>The Justice Department is also definitely looking at whether antitrust laws have kept up with the digital age and, if not, what needs to be done about that.</p><p>There is a bright spot for Big Tech in Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim's cautionary words that size, even virtual monopoly power, is not in and of itself illegal. Rather, the concern is whether or not that power is used anti-competitively.</p><p>Old views of competition are already being upended by new tech, though.</p><p>In a decision that could have wider implications for Big Tech, the U.S. Supreme Court recently held that Apple could be sued for the prices developers charge for their apps on its App Store.</p><p>Somewhat mirroring the arguments for Section 230 liability protection for social-media sites for third party postings, Apple had argued, citing 40-year-old precedent, that it was not liable for the prices charged by the members (essentially third parties) of its App Store marketplace. The high court saw it otherwise - given that iOS device users do not have the option of another marketplace, and that Apple takes a 30% cut of the app price - and allowed a suit by iPhone users to proceed.</p><p>That could open the door to suits against others, including Google and Microsoft.</p><p>The Open Markets Institute, which filed an amicus brief in support of the iPhone users, called it an important win in the public's fight against monopoly in the tech sector.</p><p>\"Today, more and more of consumers' purchases go through platforms, where sellers and buyers meet virtually via technology, instead of in brick-and-mortar stores,\" Center for Democracy &amp; Technology senior fellow Avery Gardiner said following the decision. \"These technologies are evolving fast, and [the court's] decision shows that antitrust law is - as it should be - flexible enough to address allegations that companies may misuse their market strength in novel ways. ... The more we can learn about the actual impact on competition of high tech companies' policies, the better.\"</p><p>Even internet activist groups, which allied with Big Tech firms in pushing for the reinstatement of ISP network-neutrality regulations, are in the hunt for Big Tech scalps.</p><p>Fight for the Future weighed in with an op-ed in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis> last month calling for Zuckerberg's resignation and providing 25 reasons why that should happen. No. 22: \"Special access for tech giants: Facebook gave certain business partners like Amazon and Netflix preferential access to user data, allowing the tech giants to skirt the company's usual privacy rules in order to grow its user base and attract more advertising revenue.\"</p><p>That ofif-with-his-head approach is a far cry from the days when Zuckerberg's founding of Facebook, and its explosive growth, was being celebrated in the 2010 movie <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Social Network.</emphasis></p><p>That Big Tech has become the new go-to target was illustrated on Capitol Hill at a recent hearing.</p><p>Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) routinely raised the issue of the virtual regulatory impunity of edge providers during the FCC chairmanship of Democrat Tom Wheeler, who frequently pointed out that the agency had no regulatory authority over social media or search engines.</p><p>In defense of mobile broadband providers being investigated for sharing geolocation data with aggregators who turned it over to bounty hunters and stalkers (as Democrats claimed), Walden said most carriers had stopped sharing that data, and aggregators had instead turned to data harvesting apps and engines. Those sources provide information that was even more precise, and they were essentially unregulated.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heading Off New Regs at the Edge</emphasis></p><p>Seeing the handwriting on the wall, edge providers have signed on to some form of federal privacy legislation and have taken self-regulatory steps to better track where political and other ads are coming from. Getting paid in Russian rubles, as some were, should have already been a tipofif, some skeptical legislators have said.</p><p>Edge firms also have launched diversity audits and created content boards to look at what goes up and what must come down on their social media sites. But the massed lobbying and public relations power of the so-called FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) may not be enough to derail what has become a bipartisan regulatory freight train.</p><p>If they want any insight on how to deal with that, cable broadband providers have had plenty of experience, though don't look for a lot of sympathy.</p><p>In an interview for C-SPAN's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Communicators</emphasis> series in March, Michael Powell, president of NCTA-The Internet &amp;

Walk out at the far end and you are looking at the techcentric Silicon Docks rising up across the river. Nearby sparkles the new golden facade of Ireland's regulatory seat of power, the Central Bank. Inside CHQ, those employed in these sectors buzz about at lunchtime eating salads and drinking smoothies.</p><p>\"There is a big opportunity for Dublin to become one of the major centres for financial technology focus,\" said Skinner. The prize, he said, is huge. Globally, fintech averages up to $30bn ((EURO)24bn) a year in investment and the next generation of financial services is being built by those chasing this investment.</p><p>\"Adjacency is a critical advantage for Dublin,\" he said. \"You've the regulator, the Central Bank, the technology community, the financial community all side by side. What does a fintech startup really need? Tech talent and financial talent.\"</p><p>It seems simple but, according to Skinner, this type of adjacency is not the case in many of the other countries vying for business in the sector.</p><p>\"Take the US. New York has the financial community, Silicon Valley has the technology community and then there is Washington DC. In Germany, Frankfurt, Berlin and Munich are all vying for financial and technology business separately. That separation makes it more difficult to get things done quickly.\"</p><p>But, warned Skinner, the fintech ecosystem in Ireland needs to get a lot bigger and Brexit is an opportunity for it to gain critical mass. He places Dublin, with Amsterdam and Berlin, in a second tier of cities vying for fintech business, after a first tier that includes London, Dubai, Singapore, New York and San Francisco.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland has placed much hope in the sector. Its head of fintech, Giles O'Neill, also believes that a confluence of increasingly compatible sectors is a key advantage.</p><p>\"What really stands out for us is the dynamic created by having seven of the top 10 international insurance companies, 17 of the top 20 international banks and financial institutions, huge presence from big tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook and LinkedIn. You have people who work in these places honing their own skills and then deciding to do something themselves. You can't put a value on that.\"</p><p>Ireland has over 400 specialist financial services firms, half of them foreign-owned, employing over 40,000 people. Enterprise Ireland's 200 client companies in the space now have exports topping (EURO)1bn a year. Employment at those companies rose 7pc last year.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland head of fintech Giles O'Neill Last week's conference showcasing the industry here saw more than 60 international financial institutions fly in representatives. MasterCard's head of technology and Deutsche Bank's head of innovation rubbed shoulders with eager young founders from Ireland's fintech hopefuls. \"Introducing them to the ecosystem in Ireland is a really good opportunity that we couldn't miss,\" said O'Neill.</p><p>Other delegations came from Africa to tell their story of how technology is changing the economy in countries like Kenya and South Africa, using mobile payments and micro payments: \"Taking that insight and applying it to what we are doing is really, really valuable,\" he said.</p><p>Many banks in developed countries have not changed their legacy banking systems since the 1970s, making applying new technology difficult.</p><p>\"Industries such as pharma have had constant innovation and change over the years,\" he said. \"But in banking, for a long time, there was one way to do it and the big banks were in a powerful position. Those were the rails on which the industry operated. But those rails have been removed and the speed of innovation has gathered pace. That is driven by ourselves as consumers and what we are demanding. We don't care that it has always been done this way or that way. We just want it done. So the industry has had to become really mobile and the speed of innovation has been quite dramatic. And it's not just banking. There are huge opportunities to transform the insurance and legal industries too,\" said O'Neill.</p><p>Chris Skinner believes that real success will come from looking at even more radical approaches. Europe and America, he said, are dealing with infrastructure from the last century, trying to use technology to evolve the old way of doing things into an open banking market. \"But China has leapfrogged us all because it didn't have that legacy infrastructure and started this century with a clean slate.\"</p><p>Last year, Chinese citizens spent over $15trn ((EURO)12trn) through their mobile phones, he said, compared to $140bn ((EURO)112bn) in the US.</p><p>\"Chinese giants like Alibaba and Tencent are going global and we are not looking closely enough at their business model, which is very different to Amazon or Google or the banks. They have integrated social, financial and commercial services into their ecosystem.\"</p><p>Equally, he said, there is huge innovation coming out of countries with little financial market infrastructure, for example in sub-Saharan Africa, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p><p>\"They are inventing brand new models of how to transact money,\" said Skinner. \"What we are doing is developing ways to make the old infrastructure better. In Asia, Latin America and Africa, they are creating brand new visions of everything to do with commerce and money.\"</p><p>Tapping into this new vision could, he said, provide a really bright future for Irish companies.</p><p>One firm that is attempting to do just that is Leveris - one of the largest startups Enterprise Ireland has ever funded, with more than 200 staff already employed. The Leveris platform allows banks to bring a 21st-century experience to their customer base and to easily integrate third-party services into their core banking experience.</p><p>\"That means that the bank doesn't have to be the sole source of innovation for its customers,\" said Leveris head of innovation Conor McAlevey.</p><p>\"The bank can, for example, offer a current account but offer foreign exchange or cross-border payments through a partner. That allows a bank to give customers a much wider offering of products and services through one portal.\"</p><p>The type of technology developed by Leveris also allows for the development of a community of compatible service providers in an increasingly hot subsector known as marketplace banking.</p><p>McAlevey believes, like Skinner, that the best indication of where all of this technology is likely to be at in five or 10 years is to be seen in China.</p><p>The most used app in China by far is Tencent's WeChat, accounting for 30pc of all app time. It started as a chat app but has developed into a central portal for almost every useful product and service in the country. \"Now you can order flowers, order a taxi, get dates, do whatever you want within that one platform,\" said McAlevey. \"We are beginning to see that happening in banking as well. The bank will have the banking licence and will take your deposits, look after your money, handle your current account and do some lending, but it will curate specific services from third parties and offer them to you through their portal and their app. Sometimes you will know it and sometimes you won't and it will also allow consumers to choose the services that are most convenient and cost-effective for them.\"</p><p>But, he said, some banks are more progressive than others, not least because of the problems around their legacy underlying tech infrastructure.</p><p>\"On the whole, the Irish banks are lagging behind some of the UK and Spanish banks, who are probably the standard bearers when it comes to collaborating with fintechs and opening up their platforms. But a change of culture has to happen as well as a change in technology to allow that journey with fintechs to take place,\" he said.</p><p>He believes this change would further boost the growing fintech sector here but that the sector is in no way dependent on that happening.</p><p>\"Ireland is a small country with a small number of banks. So Irish fintechs have always had to look abroad because they were never going to survive simply by selling their wares to AIB and Bank of Ireland. As a company, we talk to the Irish banks but we've always had a global view.\"</p><p>Skinner agrees that Ireland can look to tap into this global demand for new, more technologically advanced tools in banking and finance.</p><p>\"What Ireland has in its favour is that - not only has it been a strong centre for tax efficiency - it is also the natural stopping point between the UK and America,\" he says.</p><p>That, he believes, means Ireland will become increasingly important for US fintech companies looking for an English-speaking, European base.</p><p>But he has a warning too: \"I've been coming to Dublin for quite a number of years. I've seen the Port Tunnel and the tram system being built ... it has taken a long time. There needs to be a faster cycle for the implementation of infrastructure.\"</p><p>Issues around housing, public transport and broadband availability - in the long term - are what could stifle the potential of Ireland as a global fintech hub, he said.</p><p>\"I see cities like Dubai and Hong Kong building the infrastructure they need very rapidly. If Dublin wants to be in the race for fintech business you have to learn to do these things at a much faster speed.\"</p><p>TRANSFERMATE DUBLIN is not the be all and end all of the Irish fintech scene. Some of the biggest success stories - like Fexco and the Collison brothers - come from beyond the Pale. TransferMate - a subsidiary of Terry Clune's Taxback group (pictured) that is revolutionising global payments - is another. It is at the centre of a growing financial services hub in Kilkenny.</p><p>But TransferMate's Kilkenny location is not the only thing that makes it stand out from the crowd. In November, AIB invested (EURO)30m in TransferMate in exchange for a small minority equity ownership stake in the fintech company. The investment by the bank is understood to have valued the rapidly growing international payments company at (EURO)250m to (EURO)300m. The investment was a big vote of confidence by a traditional bank in the technology and platform that TransferMate has developed but also showed how big financial institutions are increasingly looking to the fintech sector for the types of services their customers are increasingly demanding. TransferMate has already transferred more than (EURO)10bn to over 100 countries since it was set up in 2010.</p><p>AQ METRICS REGTECH - the subset of fintech aimed at using technology that helps financial companies deal with risk and ever more complex regulation - is an area that has huge potential.</p><p>AQMetrics provides automated risk monitoring and regulatory reporting in a single cloud-based platform. Simply put, risk insights and compliance automation.</p><p>AQMetrics, which was last year ranked as one of the top 50 European businesses transforming financial services, is looking to double headcount and open an office in mainland Europe on the back of a number of recent big contract wins.</p><p>Established by Geraldine Gibson (pictured) in Maynooth, Co Kildare, in 2012, AQMetrics raised $3.25m ((EURO)2.64m) from investors including Frontline Ventures, Bluff Point Associates and Enterprise Ireland in early 2016 to help it expand in the United States.</p><p>The firm is reported to have signed contracts with financial giants such as Mercer, Investec and US Bancorp, as well as a number of Tier One international banks.</p><p>P LY N K PLYNK, which has developed a money messaging app, is a superb example of Ireland's unique mix of financial and technology companies - foreignowned and domestic - combining in different ways to create something really exciting.</p><p>Plynk co-founder and chief executive Charles Dowd worked for Facebook in Dublin, while co-founder Clive Foley worked for Wonga and Full Tilt Poker. The Plynk app was developed over 15 months at the Bank of Ireland Workbench in Grand Canal Square in Dublin's docklands. It raised its initial seed funding from a variety of sources - including BoI, Delta Partners, Enterprise Ireland and the National Digital Research Centre - before moving into the big time last June when it raised (EURO)25m from a Swiss investment trust - the biggest ever Series A investment for an Irish software startup.</p><p>The messaging app - which Plynk says aims to be fun, fast and free - allows Facebook users to send money via messages and group chats, just like they would a photo. The founders have said that their growth plan is simple: \"Become a verb, in every European language.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-134259871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJW-H221-DY9P-N17F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2184\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 4, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009SPQ</classCode><className>COMPANY LISTS &amp;

That goes quadruple for Apple., Google, Amazon, and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the upside, these US tech giants provide some of the world's best-loved products and services. Investors love them, too. They're the first-, second-, fourth-, and fifth-most-valuable companies. (Microsoft places third.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the four, taken together, also stand widely accused of the sins associated with corporate bullies: crushing competition, avoiding taxes, undermining democracy and invading privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Russian operatives have used American social media companies as a playground. Executives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter told US Congress on October 31 that they can't even measure the extent of Russia's manipulation of the US presidential election and don't yet have the tools to stop it the next time.</p><p>The result, so far, has been threats of new taxes, regulations, laws and antitrust actions - not only in Europe, where the giants have long been treated as problems, but increasingly from what has been long seen as the more hands-off US government.</p><p>Some experts see the US Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner as a possible precursor of actions against the tech giants.</p><p>Even the experts are confused: Are these companies our friends, enemies or frenemies? Are they basically familiar entities that can be dealt with using tried-and-true remedies - or something new that requires a fresh approach?</p><p>\"We are living through a moment in which the forms of our legal institutions are being revealed to us as obsolete,\" said Julie Cohen, a professor at Georgetown Law School who is working on a book about rethinking antitrust law for the new era of powerful online platforms. \"Our regulatory institutions date to the early 20th century. They were created in response to particular problems. They're not timeless.\"</p><p>Part of the difficulty is that, right now at least, every allegation against Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple is weighed as a separate matter. That doesn't make sense economically. Actions against each one, taken in combination, could result in death or diminution by a thousand cuts. Or, at the other extreme, the big four could manage to escape serious reform by exploiting the authorities' lack of coordination.</p><p>So it's important to think holistically about these tech giants. To do that, we collected some of the best thinking about what regulators could do, stopping to consider the possible consequences. We made sure to include cases wherein it makes sense simply to back off and leave them alone.</p><p>If regulators wanted to fix the playing field, would Google become five Googlettes? Should Facebook become a regulated utility, treated more like your local phone company than your favourite social network? Could Amazon be barred from selling its own books, movies and TV shows to protect other sellers on its all-powerful platform? Do governments work together to take away the tax shelters behind Apple's nearly quarter-trillion-dollar cash hoard?</p><p>No one knows, of course, but it's still valuable to think through possible actions and consequences. Here, then, are scenarios in which regulators and politicians might try to tame four of the most valuable companies on the planet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google: Breaking up a tech giant is hard to do</emphasis></p><p>Could Google be split into five Googlettes?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: AP</emphasis></p><p>When people worry that companies are too powerful, the first impulse is to reach back into trust-busting history and break them into pieces, just as when Standard Oil was splintered into 34 independent companies in 1911. A breakup hasn't shattered a major US company in more than three decades.</p><p>The last big breakup came in 1982, after the Justice Department entered into a consent decree with what was then called American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. As a result, on the first day of 1984, Ma Bell spawned seven regional Baby Bells to provide local and regional phone service. The rump company that retained the AT&amp;T name provided long-distance service and manufactured equipment.</p><p>The result of the split was generally positive: first cheaper long-distance calls, then the mobile-phone revolution. The Baby Bells eventually escaped some regulatory restraints. But there were losses, too: Bell Laboratories, a visionary research and development centre that gave birth to the transistor and the laser, couldn't be sustained without monopoly profits.</p><p>Google - or rather its parent company, Alphabet - is the tech giant that most frequently inspires imagined breakup scenarios. An op-ed in the New York Times earlier this year dared to pose the question in a headline: \"Is it time to break up Google?\"</p><p> Five Googlettes? </p><p>So let's use the case of Google to evaluate the argument for chopping up any overgrown tech company.</p><p>Just as Ma Bell's demise doomed Bell Labs, the disintegration of Google would probably spell the end to Google X, the R&amp;D operation that calls itself a \"moonshot factory\" and is working on everything from balloon-based internet service to fuel from seawater. Presumably its researchers would carry on elsewhere, perhaps with less generous funding.</p><p>Breaking up Google by regions, as happened to AT&amp;T, wouldn't work because Google isn't organised that way. An alternative would be to split Google into, say, five smaller companies that would be quite similar to one another. Call them Google, Hoogle, Ioogle, Joogle and Koogle.</p><p>They might compete by charging less for advertising, which is by far Google's main revenue source. That would presumably benefit advertisers and, eventually, consumers.</p><p>But five little Googlettes might not last any longer on their own than the seven Baby Bells did. If there are economies of scale and a winner-take-all tendency, one of the little five could soon come to dominate the others.</p><p>A more logical breakup of Google would be along functional lines. Search could be walled off as a stand-alone business, with its own shareholders, to prevent Alphabet from favouring its own products over those of rivals in search results. The sky-high profits generated from search-related ads would no longer be able to subsidise the invasion of other market segments. In a classic antitrust case, the monopoly part of the business would then be subject to price regulation.</p><p>The problem with price regulation is that Google doesn't charge high prices - at least not to consumers, the traditional victims in monopoly cases. The company initially helped wipe out the profitability of newspapers and magazines, in part, by undercutting the price of print advertising.</p><p>These days, however, Google can charge hefty prices to advertisers because it controls so much inventory and user data. Advertisers can feel they have no choice but to pay up, while consumers pay precisely zero to do searches or send emails.</p><p>Critics of the tech giants have started to argue that current antitrust policy is blinkered by the emphasis on direct harm to consumers beyond other anti-competitive behaviours. Companies can do evil, even if their prices are low - if they acquire too much political power, for instance, or smother new ideas and kill small businesses.</p><p>Enforcing antitrust law isn't a cure-all. \"There are attempts to try to give the antitrust courts a quasi-executive mandate to go across the terrain and fix every problem they encounter,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and Law School. Some concerns might be better dealt with other ways, he said, such as campaign finance reform.</p><p>As an alternative to breakup, trustbusters could limit themselves to forcing Alphabet to split off some of the acquisitions financed with its near-monopoly profits. In contrast to trying to regulate preferential treatment between business units inside a big company, \"structural separation is just cleaner and neater,\" said Lina Khan, an associate research scholar at Yale Law School.</p><p>YouTube and Waze could be shed relatively easily. It would be harder to break off such businesses as DoubleClick, which have been tightly integrated into Google's business. In June, to take one example, the European Union fined Google ???2.4 billion ($3.6 billion) for favouring its own comparison-shopping service in search results. Rather than spin off its shopping service to placate the EU, Google is putting it in a stand-alone unit and requiring it to bid against rivals for ads shown on the top of its search page.</p><p>But breaking up a company is an extreme measure - almost the corporate equivalent of a death sentence - and the benefits are unclear. That's why even some of the most assertive foes of tech giants shy away from calling for outright dismemberment.</p><p>Even Jonathan Taplin, author of the Times op-ed asking if it's time to break up Google, never answered affirmatively. He called for something considerably short of that: requiring Google to license its patents freely, as the US required AT&amp;T to do in a 1956 consent decree. Another solution favoured by Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who's been a nemesis of Big Tech, focuses on getting Google to treat rivals better in search results.</p><p>Barry Lynn, who runs an advocacy group called Open Markets Institute and has been an outspoken critic of Google, says platform companies should be treated like railroads and forbidden from going into businesses in which they compete with their customers.</p><p>If Google and its brethren get any bigger and more powerful, we might eventually see an antitrust action along these lines. It's tricky, though, since hampering one of these giants could backfire by making it easier for another to expand. \"You hate to cripple any one of them, and you hate to discourage them from attacking one another,\" said Scott Hemphill, a visiting professor of antitrust and intellectual property at New York University School of Law.</p><p>If breaking up a tech giant is hard, another class of remedy would be to assert more control over a giant's behaviour. This second category can also apply to Google, Facebook and Apple, but let's focus on what it might do to Amazon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon: Trying the Gulliver solution</emphasis></p><p>Loved by consumers, Amazon has become the biggest threat to bricks and mortar retailers worldwide.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: AP</emphasis></p><p>The world has a love-hate relationship with Amazon. Consumers mainly love it, competitors hate it and the government is pulled in both directions. Almost 240 cities are vying to host the second US headquarters of a company that many of them have condemned for putting local retailers out of business.</p><p>Amazon is a \"cheetelephant,\" said one analyst: an elephant that runs as fast as a cheetah. It's considerably faster than the regulators and lawmakers who have been caught flat-footed and are now wondering what, if anything, to do about its increasing market power, from books to groceries to moviemaking.</p><p>In a widely read article in the January issue of the Yale Law Journal entitled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" Yale's Khan laid out the two main options for dealing with Amazon and other companies that run on online platform markets, such as Google and Facebook.</p><p>One is to discipline them via competition, relying on antitrust law to make sure they don't put competitors out of business. The other is to throw in the towel on competition and \"accept that they are inherently monopolistic or oligopolistic and regulate them instead.\" You'd pursue the second option if you thought there were such important economies of scale that it made sense for Amazon to be huge, even dominant. In that case you'd let it grow, Khan wrote, \"while neutering the firm's ability to exploit its dominance.\"</p><p>Amazon is considerably faster than regulators and lawmakers</p><p>For those who want to rely on the competition solution, a key problem is coming up with a standard for judging when Amazon is competing unfairly. Let's say Amazon slashes prices. Is that a \"predatory\" move designed to drive a competitor out of business and clear the way to raise prices and profits? Or is it just aggressive pricing by a company that has no intention of raising prices in the future?</p><p>\"If you look at the business models of these firms, none of these is a predatory pricing model. These firms are making a lot of money doing what they're currently doing,\" said Penn's Hovenkamp.</p><p> New entrants </p><p>Besides, he said, \"there are constantly new entrants\" that would prevent a company from earning monopolistic profits. For antitrust enforcers, the problem is that by the time you know for sure whether a company predatorily drove rivals out of business, it's too late to prevent it.</p><p>If the choice is to accept rather than fight Amazon's dominance, one traditional solution would be to regulate Amazon the same as the local electricity, gas, water or sewer utilities. That would involve treating it like a \"common carrier,\" meaning it would be barred from favouring its own products over those of competitors by, say, displaying them more prominently.</p><p>Short of that, Amazon's network could be declared an \"essential facility,\" meaning Amazon would have to let any competitor use its platform without question. Khan argues that Amazon's delivery service, its Marketplace and Amazon Web Services could all come to be considered essential facilities someday, \"in light of the company's current trajectory.\"</p><p>\"Essential\" is kind of a stretch, at least for now. Vendors don't have to use the Amazon Marketplace if they don't want to, and there are plenty of other choices for cloud providers.</p><p>Customers might not notice much change right away if Amazon's various platforms were declared essential facilities that are open to everyone. After all, other companies already account for half the items sold on Amazon Marketplace. But over time, the reliability of merchandise sold through Amazon might decline if the company had to accept all vendors, including crappy ones.</p><p>Another option, designating Amazon as a common carrier, would let regulators control what Amazon charges vendors for appearing on its site or using its delivery service. There again, the change might not be immediately apparent to customers, especially if regulators stepped in only to halt obviously unfair treatment.</p><p>So far we've looked at a breakup solution for Google and a regulation solution for Amazon. The Google breakup seems far-fetched, and the result of our Amazon regulation scenario is underwhelming. What else? Another solution that's being floated is to hold companies liable for the things that happen on their platforms. Let's see how that would play out for Facebook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook: Making it liable for its customers' posts</emphasis></p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been under pressure to root out offensive material and fake news on the social media behemoth.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: AP</emphasis></p><p>None other than British Prime Minister Theresa May has floated the idea of treating Facebook, Google and Twitter like news organisations, making them responsible for content appearing on their platforms. In the US Senate, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) would expose internet companies such as Facebook and Google to civil lawsuits over content created by their customers. There's a similar bill in the House of Representatives.</p><p>To turn Facebook into a publisher, Congress would have to repeal or amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The section protects social networks from lawsuits over content created by others. There's also a Good Samaritan provision, which says that if the companies do choose to kill some offensive customer-created content, they don't thereby lose their legal protection and become responsible for every other bad thing customers do on their platforms.</p><p>Notice how making Facebook liable for customers' content is very different-opposite, really-from the solution of making it and others into common carriers. A common carrier, such as a plain vanilla phone company, submits to regulation of its prices and terms of service but has pretty much complete immunity against lawsuits over customers' behaviour. No one holds the phone company responsible for things people say to each other on the phone.</p><p>It's clear that the government isn't willing to excuse Facebook for the content that has appeared on its site, from animal abuse to live-streamed suicides. The company has become far more aggressive about rooting out offensive material, including fake news, sex-trafficking and hate speech. By monitoring itself, it's hoping to dodge government control.</p><p> 'When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers' </p><p>But that's creating a whole new set of problems, including backlash from customers and activists, who say Facebook is setting itself up as an unofficial censor. Right-leaning groups accuse Facebook of a liberal bias. Facebook considers itself a marketplace of ideas and rails against the notion that it's a media company. Some critics are asserting a First Amendment right to free speech on Facebook, saying that it has become, in effect, a public space. They cite a 1946 Supreme Court decision, Marsh v. Alabama, that said a state trespassing statute couldn't prevent distribution of religious materials on the sidewalk, even in a privately owned company town.</p><p>\"A lot of people aren't thinking hard about the world they are asking [Silicon Valley] to build,\" Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, wrote in October. \"When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.\"</p><p>Facebook, in other words, is damned if it does censor and damned if it doesn't. How is this likely to evolve? One possibility is that Facebook will tire of taking the heat and voluntarily submit to government regulation. John Battelle, a tech writer and entrepreneur who helped launch Wired and the Industry Standard, has argued for just this approach.</p><p>A regulated Facebook would still have to employ people and algorithms to scour its website of forbidden materials, as it does today, but at least it could point the finger at lawmakers and regulators if questioned about its choices. The same would go for Google and some companies not covered here, such as Twitter.</p><p>But as troubling as censorship by Facebook is, censorship by the government could turn out worse: \"A lot of the people who say, 'Well, these tech giants ought to be regulated,' are also people who are quite critical of the current government. They haven't really thought through what it means to give more regulatory tools to a government they disapprove of,\" said Michael Godwin, a tech law veteran who is director of innovation policy at the R Street Institute, a free-market think tank.</p><p>That brings us to Apple, which differs from the others in that it's not mainly a platform company making money by bringing together friends and advertisers or suppliers and customers. Many of the issues that affect Google, Amazon and Facebook are less important for Apple. But one - taxation - is huge for Apple and important for all four companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple: How the taxman could get another bite out of it?</emphasis></p><p>Should governments work together to take away the tax shelters behind Apple's nearly quarter-trillion-dollar cash hoard?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: Bloomberg</emphasis></p><p>Apple, the world's most valuable company, finished its last fiscal year with $US216 billion in cash and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries. As US Congress looks under the seat cushions for spare change, Apple's foreign treasure is a tempting target - especially since, in reality, the money is mostly held in the US in dollar-denominated securities such as Treasury bonds.</p><p>Right now Apple doesn't have to pay US tax on profits earned abroad until it \"repatriates\" the money, by paying a dividend or benefiting shareholders in some other way. Tax bills under consideration call for changing that system, taxing the entire sum now, although at preferential rates -7 per cent to 14 per cent in the House plan and 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the Senate's. The economic rationale for the super-low rates is shaky. In principle, although it's highly unlikely, nothing is stopping Congress from charging companies the entire 35 per cent they owe.</p><p>The Europeans are even more exercised than the Americans over how hard it is to tax Apple and the other tech giants. The European Commission claims that Apple struck a sweetheart deal with Ireland that allowed it to pay an effective tax rate in 2014 of just 0.005 per cent on its European profits. In 2016, it ordered Ireland to collect as much as ???13 billion in back taxes from Apple. Ireland, which uses a low tax rate to attract business, has balked.</p><p> 'Total political crap' </p><p>Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called the commission's order \"total political crap,\" saying his company had paid its fair share of taxes.</p><p>Until recently, tech companies have had lots of ways to minimise their taxes legally. The general idea has been to take advantage of transfer-pricing rules by deeming as much of your profits as possible to have been earned in a low-tax jurisdiction such as Ireland. But the Europeans are tightening those loopholes. Aside from the Apple case, Amazon this year was also ordered to pay ???250 million in back taxes to Luxembourg.</p><p>It's a good bet that there will be more such orders in coming years. Governments want money, and the four tech giants have a lot of it. In the meantime, while trying to come up with a better tax system, Europe is toying with the idea of taxing the tech companies' revenue rather than their profits.</p><p>The reasoning is that revenue is harder to manipulate. But revenue is a crude measure of a company's ability to pay taxes. Revenue-based taxation would be too hard on companies with lots of revenue but little profit, and too easy on companies with little revenue but lots of profit.<br/><br/> \"I liken it to a drunk looking for his keys under the lamp post because the light is better there,\" said Scott Marcus, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute. \"The mere fact that it's easier to measure revenue doesn't mean it's the right thing to tax.\"</p><p>What would be smarter would be changing the tax code to take away the incentive for companies to attribute their profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Some Europeans are discussing an idea of splitting a company's worldwide tax liability among countries, according to how much revenue the company derives in each country.</p><p>Assets or employment in a country could also be used as yardsticks. </p><p>Under an apportionment system, each country is still permitted to set its corporate tax rate however it chooses. But it will be able to charge its rate only on its little slice of the company's global profit-a slice that's determined by an agreed-upon formula. A country can no longer grab a bigger piece of a shrinking corporate-tax pie by cutting its rate below other countries'. In one stroke, the race to the bottom in tax rates is cut short.</p><p>The European Commission raised the idea in 2011 and again in 2016 in the form of something called the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. \"It's an amazing change. Ten years ago nobody talked about this,\" said??Jose Antonio Ocampo, a Columbia University professor and former Colombian finance minister who is chairman of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation.</p><p>Getting low-tax countries to go along with an apportionment system would be tough, though. No country wants to give up what makes it special. So something like the current tax system, albeit with fewer loopholes, is likely to persist for at least awhile. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon will keep finding ways to pit countries against one another.</p><p>As the four tech giants grow and invade each other's turf, it may turn out that the strongest force preventing them from abusing the public is the force of competition - i.e., each other.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bloomberg</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBTOL-1027719633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBTOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R36-8WN1-JBJ7-N458-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437139</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3942\"/><timeReceived>05:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That goes quadruple for Apple., Google, Amazon, and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the upside, these US tech giants provide some of the world's best-loved products and services. Investors love them, too. They're the first-, second-, fourth-, and fifth-most-valuable companies. (Microsoft places third.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the four, taken together, also stand widely accused of the sins associated with corporate bullies: crushing competition, avoiding taxes, undermining democracy and invading privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Russian operatives have used American social media companies as a playground. Executives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter told US Congress on October 31 that they can't even measure the extent of Russia's manipulation of the US presidential election and don't yet have the tools to stop it the next time.</p><p>The result, so far, has been threats of new taxes, regulations, laws and antitrust actions - not only in Europe, where the giants have long been treated as problems, but increasingly from what has been long seen as the more hands-off US government.</p><p>Some experts see the US Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner as a possible precursor of actions against the tech giants.</p><p>Even the experts are confused: Are these companies our friends, enemies or frenemies? Are they basically familiar entities that can be dealt with using tried-and-true remedies - or something new that requires a fresh approach?</p><p>\"We are living through a moment in which the forms of our legal institutions are being revealed to us as obsolete,\" said Julie Cohen, a professor at Georgetown Law School who is working on a book about rethinking antitrust law for the new era of powerful online platforms. \"Our regulatory institutions date to the early 20th century. They were created in response to particular problems. They're not timeless.\"</p><p>Part of the difficulty is that, right now at least, every allegation against Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple is weighed as a separate matter. That doesn't make sense economically. Actions against each one, taken in combination, could result in death or diminution by a thousand cuts. Or, at the other extreme, the big four could manage to escape serious reform by exploiting the authorities' lack of coordination.</p><p>So it's important to think holistically about these tech giants. To do that, we collected some of the best thinking about what regulators could do, stopping to consider the possible consequences. We made sure to include cases wherein it makes sense simply to back off and leave them alone.</p><p>If regulators wanted to fix the playing field, would Google become five Googlettes? Should Facebook become a regulated utility, treated more like your local phone company than your favourite social network? Could Amazon be barred from selling its own books, movies and TV shows to protect other sellers on its all-powerful platform? Do governments work together to take away the tax shelters behind Apple's nearly quarter-trillion-dollar cash hoard?</p><p>No one knows, of course, but it's still valuable to think through possible actions and consequences. Here, then, are scenarios in which regulators and politicians might try to tame four of the most valuable companies on the planet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google: Breaking up a tech giant is hard to do</emphasis></p><p>Could Google be split into five Googlettes?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: AP</emphasis></p><p>When people worry that companies are too powerful, the first impulse is to reach back into trust-busting history and break them into pieces, just as when Standard Oil was splintered into 34 independent companies in 1911. A breakup hasn't shattered a major US company in more than three decades.</p><p>The last big breakup came in 1982, after the Justice Department entered into a consent decree with what was then called American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. As a result, on the first day of 1984, Ma Bell spawned seven regional Baby Bells to provide local and regional phone service. The rump company that retained the AT&amp;T name provided long-distance service and manufactured equipment.</p><p>The result of the split was generally positive: first cheaper long-distance calls, then the mobile-phone revolution. The Baby Bells eventually escaped some regulatory restraints. But there were losses, too: Bell Laboratories, a visionary research and development centre that gave birth to the transistor and the laser, couldn't be sustained without monopoly profits.</p><p>Google - or rather its parent company, Alphabet - is the tech giant that most frequently inspires imagined breakup scenarios. An op-ed in the New York Times earlier this year dared to pose the question in a headline: \"Is it time to break up Google?\"</p><p> Five Googlettes? </p><p>So let's use the case of Google to evaluate the argument for chopping up any overgrown tech company.</p><p>Just as Ma Bell's demise doomed Bell Labs, the disintegration of Google would probably spell the end to Google X, the R&amp;D operation that calls itself a \"moonshot factory\" and is working on everything from balloon-based internet service to fuel from seawater. Presumably its researchers would carry on elsewhere, perhaps with less generous funding.</p><p>Breaking up Google by regions, as happened to AT&amp;T, wouldn't work because Google isn't organised that way. An alternative would be to split Google into, say, five smaller companies that would be quite similar to one another. Call them Google, Hoogle, Ioogle, Joogle and Koogle.</p><p>They might compete by charging less for advertising, which is by far Google's main revenue source. That would presumably benefit advertisers and, eventually, consumers.</p><p>But five little Googlettes might not last any longer on their own than the seven Baby Bells did. If there are economies of scale and a winner-take-all tendency, one of the little five could soon come to dominate the others.</p><p>A more logical breakup of Google would be along functional lines. Search could be walled off as a stand-alone business, with its own shareholders, to prevent Alphabet from favouring its own products over those of rivals in search results. The sky-high profits generated from search-related ads would no longer be able to subsidise the invasion of other market segments. In a classic antitrust case, the monopoly part of the business would then be subject to price regulation.</p><p>The problem with price regulation is that Google doesn't charge high prices - at least not to consumers, the traditional victims in monopoly cases. The company initially helped wipe out the profitability of newspapers and magazines, in part, by undercutting the price of print advertising.</p><p>These days, however, Google can charge hefty prices to advertisers because it controls so much inventory and user data. Advertisers can feel they have no choice but to pay up, while consumers pay precisely zero to do searches or send emails.</p><p>Critics of the tech giants have started to argue that current antitrust policy is blinkered by the emphasis on direct harm to consumers beyond other anti-competitive behaviours. Companies can do evil, even if their prices are low - if they acquire too much political power, for instance, or smother new ideas and kill small businesses.</p><p>Enforcing antitrust law isn't a cure-all. \"There are attempts to try to give the antitrust courts a quasi-executive mandate to go across the terrain and fix every problem they encounter,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and Law School. Some concerns might be better dealt with other ways, he said, such as campaign finance reform.</p><p>As an alternative to breakup, trustbusters could limit themselves to forcing Alphabet to split off some of the acquisitions financed with its near-monopoly profits. In contrast to trying to regulate preferential treatment between business units inside a big company, \"structural separation is just cleaner and neater,\" said Lina Khan, an associate research scholar at Yale Law School.</p><p>YouTube and Waze could be shed relatively easily. It would be harder to break off such businesses as DoubleClick, which have been tightly integrated into Google's business. In June, to take one example, the European Union fined Google ???2.4 billion ($3.6 billion) for favouring its own comparison-shopping service in search results. Rather than spin off its shopping service to placate the EU, Google is putting it in a stand-alone unit and requiring it to bid against rivals for ads shown on the top of its search page.</p><p>But breaking up a company is an extreme measure - almost the corporate equivalent of a death sentence - and the benefits are unclear. That's why even some of the most assertive foes of tech giants shy away from calling for outright dismemberment.</p><p>Even Jonathan Taplin, author of the Times op-ed asking if it's time to break up Google, never answered affirmatively. He called for something considerably short of that: requiring Google to license its patents freely, as the US required AT&amp;T to do in a 1956 consent decree. Another solution favoured by Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who's been a nemesis of Big Tech, focuses on getting Google to treat rivals better in search results.</p><p>Barry Lynn, who runs an advocacy group called Open Markets Institute and has been an outspoken critic of Google, says platform companies should be treated like railroads and forbidden from going into businesses in which they compete with their customers.</p><p>If Google and its brethren get any bigger and more powerful, we might eventually see an antitrust action along these lines. It's tricky, though, since hampering one of these giants could backfire by making it easier for another to expand. \"You hate to cripple any one of them, and you hate to discourage them from attacking one another,\" said Scott Hemphill, a visiting professor of antitrust and intellectual property at New York University School of Law.</p><p>If breaking up a tech giant is hard, another class of remedy would be to assert more control over a giant's behaviour. This second category can also apply to Google, Facebook and Apple, but let's focus on what it might do to Amazon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon: Trying the Gulliver solution</emphasis></p><p>Loved by consumers, Amazon has become the biggest threat to bricks and mortar retailers worldwide.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: AP</emphasis></p><p>The world has a love-hate relationship with Amazon. Consumers mainly love it, competitors hate it and the government is pulled in both directions. Almost 240 cities are vying to host the second US headquarters of a company that many of them have condemned for putting local retailers out of business.</p><p>Amazon is a \"cheetelephant,\" said one analyst: an elephant that runs as fast as a cheetah. It's considerably faster than the regulators and lawmakers who have been caught flat-footed and are now wondering what, if anything, to do about its increasing market power, from books to groceries to moviemaking.</p><p>In a widely read article in the January issue of the Yale Law Journal entitled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" Yale's Khan laid out the two main options for dealing with Amazon and other companies that run on online platform markets, such as Google and Facebook.</p><p>One is to discipline them via competition, relying on antitrust law to make sure they don't put competitors out of business. The other is to throw in the towel on competition and \"accept that they are inherently monopolistic or oligopolistic and regulate them instead.\" You'd pursue the second option if you thought there were such important economies of scale that it made sense for Amazon to be huge, even dominant. In that case you'd let it grow, Khan wrote, \"while neutering the firm's ability to exploit its dominance.\"</p><p>Amazon is considerably faster than regulators and lawmakers</p><p>For those who want to rely on the competition solution, a key problem is coming up with a standard for judging when Amazon is competing unfairly. Let's say Amazon slashes prices. Is that a \"predatory\" move designed to drive a competitor out of business and clear the way to raise prices and profits? Or is it just aggressive pricing by a company that has no intention of raising prices in the future?</p><p>\"If you look at the business models of these firms, none of these is a predatory pricing model. These firms are making a lot of money doing what they're currently doing,\" said Penn's Hovenkamp.</p><p> New entrants </p><p>Besides, he said, \"there are constantly new entrants\" that would prevent a company from earning monopolistic profits. For antitrust enforcers, the problem is that by the time you know for sure whether a company predatorily drove rivals out of business, it's too late to prevent it.</p><p>If the choice is to accept rather than fight Amazon's dominance, one traditional solution would be to regulate Amazon the same as the local electricity, gas, water or sewer utilities. That would involve treating it like a \"common carrier,\" meaning it would be barred from favouring its own products over those of competitors by, say, displaying them more prominently.</p><p>Short of that, Amazon's network could be declared an \"essential facility,\" meaning Amazon would have to let any competitor use its platform without question. Khan argues that Amazon's delivery service, its Marketplace and Amazon Web Services could all come to be considered essential facilities someday, \"in light of the company's current trajectory.\"</p><p>\"Essential\" is kind of a stretch, at least for now. Vendors don't have to use the Amazon Marketplace if they don't want to, and there are plenty of other choices for cloud providers.</p><p>Customers might not notice much change right away if Amazon's various platforms were declared essential facilities that are open to everyone. After all, other companies already account for half the items sold on Amazon Marketplace. But over time, the reliability of merchandise sold through Amazon might decline if the company had to accept all vendors, including crappy ones.</p><p>Another option, designating Amazon as a common carrier, would let regulators control what Amazon charges vendors for appearing on its site or using its delivery service. There again, the change might not be immediately apparent to customers, especially if regulators stepped in only to halt obviously unfair treatment.</p><p>So far we've looked at a breakup solution for Google and a regulation solution for Amazon. The Google breakup seems far-fetched, and the result of our Amazon regulation scenario is underwhelming. What else? Another solution that's being floated is to hold companies liable for the things that happen on their platforms. Let's see how that would play out for Facebook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook: Making it liable for its customers' posts</emphasis></p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been under pressure to root out offensive material and fake news on the social media behemoth.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: AP</emphasis></p><p>None other than British Prime Minister Theresa May has floated the idea of treating Facebook, Google and Twitter like news organisations, making them responsible for content appearing on their platforms. In the US Senate, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) would expose internet companies such as Facebook and Google to civil lawsuits over content created by their customers. There's a similar bill in the House of Representatives.</p><p>To turn Facebook into a publisher, Congress would have to repeal or amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The section protects social networks from lawsuits over content created by others. There's also a Good Samaritan provision, which says that if the companies do choose to kill some offensive customer-created content, they don't thereby lose their legal protection and become responsible for every other bad thing customers do on their platforms.</p><p>Notice how making Facebook liable for customers' content is very different-opposite, really-from the solution of making it and others into common carriers. A common carrier, such as a plain vanilla phone company, submits to regulation of its prices and terms of service but has pretty much complete immunity against lawsuits over customers' behaviour. No one holds the phone company responsible for things people say to each other on the phone.</p><p>It's clear that the government isn't willing to excuse Facebook for the content that has appeared on its site, from animal abuse to live-streamed suicides. The company has become far more aggressive about rooting out offensive material, including fake news, sex-trafficking and hate speech. By monitoring itself, it's hoping to dodge government control.</p><p> 'When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers' </p><p>But that's creating a whole new set of problems, including backlash from customers and activists, who say Facebook is setting itself up as an unofficial censor. Right-leaning groups accuse Facebook of a liberal bias. Facebook considers itself a marketplace of ideas and rails against the notion that it's a media company. Some critics are asserting a First Amendment right to free speech on Facebook, saying that it has become, in effect, a public space. They cite a 1946 Supreme Court decision, Marsh v. Alabama, that said a state trespassing statute couldn't prevent distribution of religious materials on the sidewalk, even in a privately owned company town.</p><p>\"A lot of people aren't thinking hard about the world they are asking [Silicon Valley] to build,\" Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, wrote in October. \"When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.\"</p><p>Facebook, in other words, is damned if it does censor and damned if it doesn't. How is this likely to evolve? One possibility is that Facebook will tire of taking the heat and voluntarily submit to government regulation. John Battelle, a tech writer and entrepreneur who helped launch Wired and the Industry Standard, has argued for just this approach.</p><p>A regulated Facebook would still have to employ people and algorithms to scour its website of forbidden materials, as it does today, but at least it could point the finger at lawmakers and regulators if questioned about its choices. The same would go for Google and some companies not covered here, such as Twitter.</p><p>But as troubling as censorship by Facebook is, censorship by the government could turn out worse: \"A lot of the people who say, 'Well, these tech giants ought to be regulated,' are also people who are quite critical of the current government. They haven't really thought through what it means to give more regulatory tools to a government they disapprove of,\" said Michael Godwin, a tech law veteran who is director of innovation policy at the R Street Institute, a free-market think tank.</p><p>That brings us to Apple, which differs from the others in that it's not mainly a platform company making money by bringing together friends and advertisers or suppliers and customers. Many of the issues that affect Google, Amazon and Facebook are less important for Apple. But one - taxation - is huge for Apple and important for all four companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple: How the taxman could get another bite out of it?</emphasis></p><p>Should governments work together to take away the tax shelters behind Apple's nearly quarter-trillion-dollar cash hoard?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: Bloomberg</emphasis></p><p>Apple, the world's most valuable company, finished its last fiscal year with $US216 billion in cash and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries. As US Congress looks under the seat cushions for spare change, Apple's foreign treasure is a tempting target - especially since, in reality, the money is mostly held in the US in dollar-denominated securities such as Treasury bonds.</p><p>Right now Apple doesn't have to pay US tax on profits earned abroad until it \"repatriates\" the money, by paying a dividend or benefiting shareholders in some other way. Tax bills under consideration call for changing that system, taxing the entire sum now, although at preferential rates -7 per cent to 14 per cent in the House plan and 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the Senate's. The economic rationale for the super-low rates is shaky. In principle, although it's highly unlikely, nothing is stopping Congress from charging companies the entire 35 per cent they owe.</p><p>The Europeans are even more exercised than the Americans over how hard it is to tax Apple and the other tech giants. The European Commission claims that Apple struck a sweetheart deal with Ireland that allowed it to pay an effective tax rate in 2014 of just 0.005 per cent on its European profits. In 2016, it ordered Ireland to collect as much as ???13 billion in back taxes from Apple. Ireland, which uses a low tax rate to attract business, has balked.</p><p> 'Total political crap' </p><p>Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called the commission's order \"total political crap,\" saying his company had paid its fair share of taxes.</p><p>Until recently, tech companies have had lots of ways to minimise their taxes legally. The general idea has been to take advantage of transfer-pricing rules by deeming as much of your profits as possible to have been earned in a low-tax jurisdiction such as Ireland. But the Europeans are tightening those loopholes. Aside from the Apple case, Amazon this year was also ordered to pay ???250 million in back taxes to Luxembourg.</p><p>It's a good bet that there will be more such orders in coming years. Governments want money, and the four tech giants have a lot of it. In the meantime, while trying to come up with a better tax system, Europe is toying with the idea of taxing the tech companies' revenue rather than their profits.</p><p>The reasoning is that revenue is harder to manipulate. But revenue is a crude measure of a company's ability to pay taxes. Revenue-based taxation would be too hard on companies with lots of revenue but little profit, and too easy on companies with little revenue but lots of profit.<br/><br/> \"I liken it to a drunk looking for his keys under the lamp post because the light is better there,\" said Scott Marcus, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute. \"The mere fact that it's easier to measure revenue doesn't mean it's the right thing to tax.\"</p><p>What would be smarter would be changing the tax code to take away the incentive for companies to attribute their profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Some Europeans are discussing an idea of splitting a company's worldwide tax liability among countries, according to how much revenue the company derives in each country.</p><p>Assets or employment in a country could also be used as yardsticks. </p><p>Under an apportionment system, each country is still permitted to set its corporate tax rate however it chooses. But it will be able to charge its rate only on its little slice of the company's global profit-a slice that's determined by an agreed-upon formula. A country can no longer grab a bigger piece of a shrinking corporate-tax pie by cutting its rate below other countries'. In one stroke, the race to the bottom in tax rates is cut short.</p><p>The European Commission raised the idea in 2011 and again in 2016 in the form of something called the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. \"It's an amazing change. Ten years ago nobody talked about this,\" said??Jose Antonio Ocampo, a Columbia University professor and former Colombian finance minister who is chairman of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation.</p><p>Getting low-tax countries to go along with an apportionment system would be tough, though.

(Microsoft places third.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the four, taken together, also stand widely accused of the sins associated with corporate bullies: crushing competition, avoiding taxes, undermining democracy and invading privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Russian operatives have used American social media companies as a playground. Executives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter told US Congress on October 31 that they can't even measure the extent of Russia's manipulation of the US presidential election and don't yet have the tools to stop it the next time.</p><p>The result, so far, has been threats of new taxes, regulations, laws and antitrust actions - not only in Europe, where the giants have long been treated as problems, but increasingly from what has been long seen as the more hands-off US government.</p><p>Some experts see the US Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner as a possible precursor of actions against the tech giants.</p><p>Even the experts are confused: Are these companies our friends, enemies or frenemies? Are they basically familiar entities that can be dealt with using tried-and-true remedies - or something new that requires a fresh approach?</p><p>\"We are living through a moment in which the forms of our legal institutions are being revealed to us as obsolete,\" said Julie Cohen, a professor at Georgetown Law School who is working on a book about rethinking antitrust law for the new era of powerful online platforms. \"Our regulatory institutions date to the early 20th century. They were created in response to particular problems. They're not timeless.\"</p><p>Part of the difficulty is that, right now at least, every allegation against Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple is weighed as a separate matter. That doesn't make sense economically. Actions against each one, taken in combination, could result in death or diminution by a thousand cuts. Or, at the other extreme, the big four could manage to escape serious reform by exploiting the authorities' lack of coordination.</p><p>So it's important to think holistically about these tech giants. To do that, we collected some of the best thinking about what regulators could do, stopping to consider the possible consequences. We made sure to include cases wherein it makes sense simply to back off and leave them alone.</p><p>If regulators wanted to fix the playing field, would Google become five Googlettes? Should Facebook become a regulated utility, treated more like your local phone company than your favourite social network? Could Amazon be barred from selling its own books, movies and TV shows to protect other sellers on its all-powerful platform? Do governments work together to take away the tax shelters behind Apple's nearly quarter-trillion-dollar cash hoard?</p><p>No one knows, of course, but it's still valuable to think through possible actions and consequences. Here, then, are scenarios in which regulators and politicians might try to tame four of the most valuable companies on the planet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google: Breaking up a tech giant is hard to do</emphasis></p><p>Could Google be split into five Googlettes?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: AP</emphasis></p><p>When people worry that companies are too powerful, the first impulse is to reach back into trust-busting history and break them into pieces, just as when Standard Oil was splintered into 34 independent companies in 1911. A breakup hasn't shattered a major US company in more than three decades.</p><p>The last big breakup came in 1982, after the Justice Department entered into a consent decree with what was then called American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. As a result, on the first day of 1984, Ma Bell spawned seven regional Baby Bells to provide local and regional phone service. The rump company that retained the AT&amp;T name provided long-distance service and manufactured equipment.</p><p>The result of the split was generally positive: first cheaper long-distance calls, then the mobile-phone revolution. The Baby Bells eventually escaped some regulatory restraints. But there were losses, too: Bell Laboratories, a visionary research and development centre that gave birth to the transistor and the laser, couldn't be sustained without monopoly profits.</p><p>Google - or rather its parent company, Alphabet - is the tech giant that most frequently inspires imagined breakup scenarios. An op-ed in the New York Times earlier this year dared to pose the question in a headline: \"Is it time to break up Google?\"</p><p> Five Googlettes? </p><p>So let's use the case of Google to evaluate the argument for chopping up any overgrown tech company.</p><p>Just as Ma Bell's demise doomed Bell Labs, the disintegration of Google would probably spell the end to Google X, the R&amp;D operation that calls itself a \"moonshot factory\" and is working on everything from balloon-based internet service to fuel from seawater. Presumably its researchers would carry on elsewhere, perhaps with less generous funding.</p><p>Breaking up Google by regions, as happened to AT&amp;T, wouldn't work because Google isn't organised that way. An alternative would be to split Google into, say, five smaller companies that would be quite similar to one another. Call them Google, Hoogle, Ioogle, Joogle and Koogle.</p><p>They might compete by charging less for advertising, which is by far Google's main revenue source. That would presumably benefit advertisers and, eventually, consumers.</p><p>But five little Googlettes might not last any longer on their own than the seven Baby Bells did. If there are economies of scale and a winner-take-all tendency, one of the little five could soon come to dominate the others.</p><p>A more logical breakup of Google would be along functional lines. Search could be walled off as a stand-alone business, with its own shareholders, to prevent Alphabet from favouring its own products over those of rivals in search results. The sky-high profits generated from search-related ads would no longer be able to subsidise the invasion of other market segments. In a classic antitrust case, the monopoly part of the business would then be subject to price regulation.</p><p>The problem with price regulation is that Google doesn't charge high prices - at least not to consumers, the traditional victims in monopoly cases. The company initially helped wipe out the profitability of newspapers and magazines, in part, by undercutting the price of print advertising.</p><p>These days, however, Google can charge hefty prices to advertisers because it controls so much inventory and user data. Advertisers can feel they have no choice but to pay up, while consumers pay precisely zero to do searches or send emails.</p><p>Critics of the tech giants have started to argue that current antitrust policy is blinkered by the emphasis on direct harm to consumers beyond other anti-competitive behaviours. Companies can do evil, even if their prices are low - if they acquire too much political power, for instance, or smother new ideas and kill small businesses.</p><p>Enforcing antitrust law isn't a cure-all. \"There are attempts to try to give the antitrust courts a quasi-executive mandate to go across the terrain and fix every problem they encounter,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and Law School. Some concerns might be better dealt with other ways, he said, such as campaign finance reform.</p><p>As an alternative to breakup, trustbusters could limit themselves to forcing Alphabet to split off some of the acquisitions financed with its near-monopoly profits. In contrast to trying to regulate preferential treatment between business units inside a big company, \"structural separation is just cleaner and neater,\" said Lina Khan, an associate research scholar at Yale Law School.</p><p>YouTube and Waze could be shed relatively easily. It would be harder to break off such businesses as DoubleClick, which have been tightly integrated into Google's business. In June, to take one example, the European Union fined Google ???2.4 billion ($3.6 billion) for favouring its own comparison-shopping service in search results. Rather than spin off its shopping service to placate the EU, Google is putting it in a stand-alone unit and requiring it to bid against rivals for ads shown on the top of its search page.</p><p>But breaking up a company is an extreme measure - almost the corporate equivalent of a death sentence - and the benefits are unclear. That's why even some of the most assertive foes of tech giants shy away from calling for outright dismemberment.</p><p>Even Jonathan Taplin, author of the Times op-ed asking if it's time to break up Google, never answered affirmatively. He called for something considerably short of that: requiring Google to license its patents freely, as the US required AT&amp;T to do in a 1956 consent decree. Another solution favoured by Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who's been a nemesis of Big Tech, focuses on getting Google to treat rivals better in search results.</p><p>Barry Lynn, who runs an advocacy group called Open Markets Institute and has been an outspoken critic of Google, says platform companies should be treated like railroads and forbidden from going into businesses in which they compete with their customers.</p><p>If Google and its brethren get any bigger and more powerful, we might eventually see an antitrust action along these lines. It's tricky, though, since hampering one of these giants could backfire by making it easier for another to expand. \"You hate to cripple any one of them, and you hate to discourage them from attacking one another,\" said Scott Hemphill, a visiting professor of antitrust and intellectual property at New York University School of Law.</p><p>If breaking up a tech giant is hard, another class of remedy would be to assert more control over a giant's behaviour. This second category can also apply to Google, Facebook and Apple, but let's focus on what it might do to Amazon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon: Trying the Gulliver solution</emphasis></p><p>Loved by consumers, Amazon has become the biggest threat to bricks and mortar retailers worldwide.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: AP</emphasis></p><p>The world has a love-hate relationship with Amazon. Consumers mainly love it, competitors hate it and the government is pulled in both directions. Almost 240 cities are vying to host the second US headquarters of a company that many of them have condemned for putting local retailers out of business.</p><p>Amazon is a \"cheetelephant,\" said one analyst: an elephant that runs as fast as a cheetah. It's considerably faster than the regulators and lawmakers who have been caught flat-footed and are now wondering what, if anything, to do about its increasing market power, from books to groceries to moviemaking.</p><p>In a widely read article in the January issue of the Yale Law Journal entitled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" Yale's Khan laid out the two main options for dealing with Amazon and other companies that run on online platform markets, such as Google and Facebook.</p><p>One is to discipline them via competition, relying on antitrust law to make sure they don't put competitors out of business. The other is to throw in the towel on competition and \"accept that they are inherently monopolistic or oligopolistic and regulate them instead.\" You'd pursue the second option if you thought there were such important economies of scale that it made sense for Amazon to be huge, even dominant. In that case you'd let it grow, Khan wrote, \"while neutering the firm's ability to exploit its dominance.\"</p><p>Amazon is considerably faster than regulators and lawmakers</p><p>For those who want to rely on the competition solution, a key problem is coming up with a standard for judging when Amazon is competing unfairly. Let's say Amazon slashes prices. Is that a \"predatory\" move designed to drive a competitor out of business and clear the way to raise prices and profits? Or is it just aggressive pricing by a company that has no intention of raising prices in the future?</p><p>\"If you look at the business models of these firms, none of these is a predatory pricing model. These firms are making a lot of money doing what they're currently doing,\" said Penn's Hovenkamp.</p><p> New entrants </p><p>Besides, he said, \"there are constantly new entrants\" that would prevent a company from earning monopolistic profits. For antitrust enforcers, the problem is that by the time you know for sure whether a company predatorily drove rivals out of business, it's too late to prevent it.</p><p>If the choice is to accept rather than fight Amazon's dominance, one traditional solution would be to regulate Amazon the same as the local electricity, gas, water or sewer utilities. That would involve treating it like a \"common carrier,\" meaning it would be barred from favouring its own products over those of competitors by, say, displaying them more prominently.</p><p>Short of that, Amazon's network could be declared an \"essential facility,\" meaning Amazon would have to let any competitor use its platform without question. Khan argues that Amazon's delivery service, its Marketplace and Amazon Web Services could all come to be considered essential facilities someday, \"in light of the company's current trajectory.\"</p><p>\"Essential\" is kind of a stretch, at least for now. Vendors don't have to use the Amazon Marketplace if they don't want to, and there are plenty of other choices for cloud providers.</p><p>Customers might not notice much change right away if Amazon's various platforms were declared essential facilities that are open to everyone. After all, other companies already account for half the items sold on Amazon Marketplace. But over time, the reliability of merchandise sold through Amazon might decline if the company had to accept all vendors, including crappy ones.</p><p>Another option, designating Amazon as a common carrier, would let regulators control what Amazon charges vendors for appearing on its site or using its delivery service. There again, the change might not be immediately apparent to customers, especially if regulators stepped in only to halt obviously unfair treatment.</p><p>So far we've looked at a breakup solution for Google and a regulation solution for Amazon. The Google breakup seems far-fetched, and the result of our Amazon regulation scenario is underwhelming. What else? Another solution that's being floated is to hold companies liable for the things that happen on their platforms. Let's see how that would play out for Facebook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook: Making it liable for its customers' posts</emphasis></p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been under pressure to root out offensive material and fake news on the social media behemoth.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: AP</emphasis></p><p>None other than British Prime Minister Theresa May has floated the idea of treating Facebook, Google and Twitter like news organisations, making them responsible for content appearing on their platforms. In the US Senate, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) would expose internet companies such as Facebook and Google to civil lawsuits over content created by their customers. There's a similar bill in the House of Representatives.</p><p>To turn Facebook into a publisher, Congress would have to repeal or amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The section protects social networks from lawsuits over content created by others. There's also a Good Samaritan provision, which says that if the companies do choose to kill some offensive customer-created content, they don't thereby lose their legal protection and become responsible for every other bad thing customers do on their platforms.</p><p>Notice how making Facebook liable for customers' content is very different-opposite, really-from the solution of making it and others into common carriers. A common carrier, such as a plain vanilla phone company, submits to regulation of its prices and terms of service but has pretty much complete immunity against lawsuits over customers' behaviour. No one holds the phone company responsible for things people say to each other on the phone.</p><p>It's clear that the government isn't willing to excuse Facebook for the content that has appeared on its site, from animal abuse to live-streamed suicides. The company has become far more aggressive about rooting out offensive material, including fake news, sex-trafficking and hate speech. By monitoring itself, it's hoping to dodge government control.</p><p> 'When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers' </p><p>But that's creating a whole new set of problems, including backlash from customers and activists, who say Facebook is setting itself up as an unofficial censor. Right-leaning groups accuse Facebook of a liberal bias. Facebook considers itself a marketplace of ideas and rails against the notion that it's a media company. Some critics are asserting a First Amendment right to free speech on Facebook, saying that it has become, in effect, a public space. They cite a 1946 Supreme Court decision, Marsh v. Alabama, that said a state trespassing statute couldn't prevent distribution of religious materials on the sidewalk, even in a privately owned company town.</p><p>\"A lot of people aren't thinking hard about the world they are asking [Silicon Valley] to build,\" Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, wrote in October. \"When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.\"</p><p>Facebook, in other words, is damned if it does censor and damned if it doesn't. How is this likely to evolve? One possibility is that Facebook will tire of taking the heat and voluntarily submit to government regulation. John Battelle, a tech writer and entrepreneur who helped launch Wired and the Industry Standard, has argued for just this approach.</p><p>A regulated Facebook would still have to employ people and algorithms to scour its website of forbidden materials, as it does today, but at least it could point the finger at lawmakers and regulators if questioned about its choices. The same would go for Google and some companies not covered here, such as Twitter.</p><p>But as troubling as censorship by Facebook is, censorship by the government could turn out worse: \"A lot of the people who say, 'Well, these tech giants ought to be regulated,' are also people who are quite critical of the current government. They haven't really thought through what it means to give more regulatory tools to a government they disapprove of,\" said Michael Godwin, a tech law veteran who is director of innovation policy at the R Street Institute, a free-market think tank.</p><p>That brings us to Apple, which differs from the others in that it's not mainly a platform company making money by bringing together friends and advertisers or suppliers and customers. Many of the issues that affect Google, Amazon and Facebook are less important for Apple. But one - taxation - is huge for Apple and important for all four companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple: How the taxman could get another bite out of it?</emphasis></p><p>Should governments work together to take away the tax shelters behind Apple's nearly quarter-trillion-dollar cash hoard?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Photo: Bloomberg</emphasis></p><p>Apple, the world's most valuable company, finished its last fiscal year with $US216 billion in cash and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries. As US Congress looks under the seat cushions for spare change, Apple's foreign treasure is a tempting target - especially since, in reality, the money is mostly held in the US in dollar-denominated securities such as Treasury bonds.</p><p>Right now Apple doesn't have to pay US tax on profits earned abroad until it \"repatriates\" the money, by paying a dividend or benefiting shareholders in some other way. Tax bills under consideration call for changing that system, taxing the entire sum now, although at preferential rates -7 per cent to 14 per cent in the House plan and 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the Senate's. The economic rationale for the super-low rates is shaky. In principle, although it's highly unlikely, nothing is stopping Congress from charging companies the entire 35 per cent they owe.</p><p>The Europeans are even more exercised than the Americans over how hard it is to tax Apple and the other tech giants. The European Commission claims that Apple struck a sweetheart deal with Ireland that allowed it to pay an effective tax rate in 2014 of just 0.005 per cent on its European profits. In 2016, it ordered Ireland to collect as much as ???13 billion in back taxes from Apple. Ireland, which uses a low tax rate to attract business, has balked.</p><p> 'Total political crap' </p><p>Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called the commission's order \"total political crap,\" saying his company had paid its fair share of taxes.</p><p>Until recently, tech companies have had lots of ways to minimise their taxes legally. The general idea has been to take advantage of transfer-pricing rules by deeming as much of your profits as possible to have been earned in a low-tax jurisdiction such as Ireland. But the Europeans are tightening those loopholes. Aside from the Apple case, Amazon this year was also ordered to pay ???250 million in back taxes to Luxembourg.</p><p>It's a good bet that there will be more such orders in coming years. Governments want money, and the four tech giants have a lot of it. In the meantime, while trying to come up with a better tax system, Europe is toying with the idea of taxing the tech companies' revenue rather than their profits.</p><p>The reasoning is that revenue is harder to manipulate. But revenue is a crude measure of a company's ability to pay taxes. Revenue-based taxation would be too hard on companies with lots of revenue but little profit, and too easy on companies with little revenue but lots of profit.<br/><br/> \"I liken it to a drunk looking for his keys under the lamp post because the light is better there,\" said Scott Marcus, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute. \"The mere fact that it's easier to measure revenue doesn't mean it's the right thing to tax.\"</p><p>What would be smarter would be changing the tax code to take away the incentive for companies to attribute their profits to low-tax jurisdictions. Some Europeans are discussing an idea of splitting a company's worldwide tax liability among countries, according to how much revenue the company derives in each country.</p><p>Assets or employment in a country could also be used as yardsticks. </p><p>Under an apportionment system, each country is still permitted to set its corporate tax rate however it chooses. But it will be able to charge its rate only on its little slice of the company's global profit-a slice that's determined by an agreed-upon formula. A country can no longer grab a bigger piece of a shrinking corporate-tax pie by cutting its rate below other countries'. In one stroke, the race to the bottom in tax rates is cut short.</p><p>The European Commission raised the idea in 2011 and again in 2016 in the form of something called the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. \"It's an amazing change. Ten years ago nobody talked about this,\" said??Jose Antonio Ocampo, a Columbia University professor and former Colombian finance minister who is chairman of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation.</p><p>Getting low-tax countries to go along with an apportionment system would be tough, though. No country wants to give up what makes it special. So something like the current tax system, albeit with fewer loopholes, is likely to persist for at least awhile. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon will keep finding ways to pit countries against one another.</p><p>As the four tech giants grow and invade each other's turf, it may turn out that the strongest force preventing them from abusing the public is the force of competition - i.e., each other.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bloomberg</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1027719633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R36-8WN1-JBJ7-N45N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3942\"/><timeReceived>05:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I believe one of the main reasons for that is we've yet to see a proper GDPR case being brought against big tech companies like Facebook and Google \u2014 the companies GDPR should protect us from.This isn't all too serious just yet, as findings are expected in the next few months. But Politico's extensive new investigation[2] from last week \u2014 'How one country blocks the world on data privacy' \u2014 questions the regulators independence and its willingness to apply the full force of GDPR, i.e. fines to the tune of 4 percent of guilty companies' global annual turnover, which could amount to billions of dollars.  Politico's report (which you should definitely read when you have time for 4,000 words) is quite damning and detailed; here are the key takeaways:GDPR's weakness is companies are regulated by the data protection agency (DPA) where they're headquartered (have their 'data controller') This weakens the collective force of the EU to regulate, leaving it up to smaller countries that could be more easily influenced instead For big tech, this is usually Ireland, which has a history of being overly accommodating to corporations (e.g. getting companies to set up shop in Ireland by promising little or no taxation) Ireland has already shown it has a laxer approach to Facebook and other big tech companies than Germany and France Big tech has had easy access to Irish politicians and government officials. </p><p>For example, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg got involved[3] when the current Irish Data Protection Commissioner was hiredThere's little question of whether or not the Irish government is friendly to big corporations \u2014 for example, it neglected to collect $13 billion in taxes from Apple[4] \u2014 but does that mean Irish regulators are as well? Politico's article does make it out to be, but it's important to note that the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC[5]) is an independent agency.  One of the experts quoted by Politico \u2014 data management consultant Daragh O'Brien \u2014 clarified his comments in a blog post[6], and stated he did not completely agree with the editorial angle of the piece: Do I think the DPC favours tech companies over others in an effort to support an advantage for Ireland? No. And I was clear with Politico that that was my view. Ireland has lots of other advantages and we are beyond the point where we would profit from being seen as 'light touch.' But the optics are challenging. It's clear that DPAs have a different approach to how they enforce GDPR \u2014 like Politico describes for Germany, France, UK, and Ireland \u2014 but the fact the Irish DPC has yet to issue fines doesn't necessarily mean it's not fulfilling its regulatory role.O'Brien said the process has definitely been slow in Ireland, but he chalks it up to Ireland's legal framework and the Irish DPC accumulating experience, rather than effects of outside lobbying. He also pointed out that even though the Irish DPC is far from perfect, it is separate from the Irish government (its independence is guaranteed in EU Treaty) and that Helen Dixon, the Data Protection Commissioner, does have regulatory enforcement experience, contrary to what the Politico article stated.  O'Brien was also not convinced the flashier approach of other regulators is necessarily better. He said the fact the Irish DPC has appointed staff specifically to manage the 16 investigations it's launched into Facebook's data handling indicates a 'gloves are coming off' mindset \u2014 even though it's slow.

This is an artist rendition of Facebook's planned headquarter expansion in Ireland. But what does the Irish DPC say about all of this? The Irish DPC wasn't able to provide comments to TNW before this article went live, but Graham Doyle, Head of Communications with the Irish DPC told Politico[8] the agency wasn't overly deferential to companies under its purview. He also acknowledged that data protection enforcers don't always agree on which approach is best.  To shed some light on the Irish approach, Doyle told TNW last year[9] the aim was to assist companies to get data handling right from the beginning, which would prevent any personal data from being compromised \u2014 rather than to focus solely on punishing offenders. However, Doyle added that the DPC also intended to fulfill its corrective role as investigations were ongoing, and the agency wouldn't shy away from using the tools at its disposal.  So, is the Irish DPC failing to fulfill its duties as a regulator? Well, the truth is that we've yet to see. It's always been clear that the regulator has numerous investigations going on into the practices of big tech and that the first results would be announced mid-year 2019. So we're just going to have to wait. What I do find positive about this coverage is that it shows data governance is a complicated issue, and one that we all need to keep our eyes on. We can do that with in-depth journalistic investigations like Politico's, empowering regulators, and informing ourselves about how our data is being used. All of this illustrates that we're still coming to terms with what GDPR is, how it should work, and how to mitigate the power of big tech. It's going to require constant monitoring and adjustment to get it right, and we'll see when the Irish DPC publishes its findings in the coming months whether that's on track.

Regulation might eventually slow down a behemoth such as Facebook, but the prospect of it will stop would-be competitors dead in their tracks.</p><p>But if the threat of regulation from without is something big tech has learnt to turn to its advantage, the same can't be said of threats from within.</p><p>This past month, both Google and Oracle have learnt that dealing with activist employees can be a whole lot tricker than dealing with regulators, if only because regulators, almost by definition, tend to follow well-understood rules of engagement.</p><p>Last week, an unknown number of Oracle employees walked off the job, alarmed that the company's</p><p>co-founder and executive chairman, Larry Ellison, was cosying up too much to the man ultimately in charge of all US regulators, Donald Trump.</p><p>Ellison, the world's fifth or seventh-richest person, depending on Oracle's share price, has been raising funds for Trump's re-election, which doesn't sit easy with all of Oracle's staff.</p><p>Although \"walked off the job\" is probably too strong a phrase for what happened. Such is the nature of many technology jobs nowadays that many employees don't have a job site to walk off, much less a union to help organise such an action.</p><p>They work from home, or remotely from another country, and Oracle's Employees for Ethics strike (which can't really be called a strike, either) was more of a log-off than a walk-off - which gives us a clue as to how big tech companies might approach the problem of employee activism. But don't let me give away the ending.</p><p>Google's employee activism problems are a little more endemic, in part because many of its staff joined the company before it abandoned its morals and changed its motto from \"Don't be evil\" to \"Do the right thing\" - a slogan that could be asking anything of its employees, including that they crack down on would-be activists and union organisers (which they have dutifully been doing), or that they throw their litter in the bins provided.</p><p>Some of Google's employees stand apart from its management on a number of issues, including: Google's willingness to build secret, censored versions of its search engine for the Chinese market; its participation in a secret drone program that uses Google's artificial intelligence for airborne surveillance; and more recently on the question of whether Google should be supplying technology to US Customs and Border Protection, which has been implementing Trump's policy of separating children from their parents.</p><p>Where the company once famously welcomed dissent from within, it's now suppressing it. An investigation published last week by The New York Times revealed that Google has hired consultants who specialise in preventing the workforce from organising, and that it has fired employees who speak out.</p><p>But there's an easier solution to the question of what to do with employees who grow a conscience and question your lack of ethics, and it's one that big tech is uniquely well-placed to implement: You don't have staff.

An oil painting hangs to one side of him, on the other sits a Renaissance bust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A technician ducks into shot to check his sound levels, and then Renzi is off. He starts by gurning at an off-screen audience member, greeting them in a hoarse stage whisper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then he turns on his fellow politicians. Giuseppe Conte, the current Prime Minister; Luigi Di Maio, his deputy; Carlo Calenda, a member of the European parliament - all receive the same obscene arm gesture, punctuated with a little sneer.</p><p>This performance sent some Italians straight to Twitter to voice their outrage at the ex-prime minister's diatribe. But it was not the real Renzi talking. On closer examination, the voice is different, as are the gesticulations. Even the face looks uncannily smooth.</p><p>That's because the politician's features have been algorithmically transplanted on to a comedian's, as part of a skit for Striscia la notizia, a long-running Italian satire show. The video is the latest in a series of examples of how \"deepfake\" technology - or AI-generated video designed to fool humans - has started to affect politics.</p><p>Only a few years ago, such \"deepfakes\" were a novelty, created by hobbyist coders. Today, they are increasingly commodified as yet another service available to those with even a little disposable cash.</p><p>While they may be increasingly cheap to pull off, their repercussions could be far-reaching. Fraudulent clips of business leaders could tank companies. False audio of central bankers could swing markets. Small businesses and individuals could face crippling reputational or financial risk.</p><p>And as elections approach in the US, Britain and elsewhere, deepfakes could raise the stakes once more in the electorate's struggle to know the truth.</p><p>Around the world, start-ups, academics and lawmakers are rushing to create tools to mitigate these risks. But the technology is developing faster than anyone imagined.</p><p>Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, has spent decades studying digital manipulation: \"In January 2019, deepfakes were . . . buggy and flickery. Nine months later, I've never seen anything like how fast they're going. This is the tip of the iceberg.\" On one thing, experts are clear. The mere risk of a deepfake undermines a most basic principle of humanity: can you believe your eyes?</p><p>Disinformation is as old as politics, and its practitioners have kept pace with technological changes. Where written fake news was the hallmark of the most recent election cycle in the US and Britain, images and videos are increasingly the new focus of propaganda, says Vidya Narayanan, an Oxford Research Institute researcher.</p><p>\"[They] are powerful in shaping a situation. If you see an image, it is very immediate.\" In 2018, software such as Photoshop was used to create a widely shared fake image of Emma Gonz&amp;#xE1;lez, a survivor of the Parkland shooting and a gun control activist, ripping up the US constitution.</p><p>Altered videos are not exactly new. The most famous recent example is an edit of a slowed-down Nancy Pelosi speech from earlier this year. The video spread across conservative media as critics of the Speaker of the US House of Representatives declared it evidence of her senility, alcoholism or a mental health problem.</p><p>Rudy Giuliani, US president Donald Trump's personal lawyer, retweeted the video, before deleting it but defending his choice. Trump himself posted a different altered video of Pelosi, which is still online: it has had nearly 30,000 retweets and more than 90,000 likes. The difference with a deepfake is that with an algorithm in charge, the results can be much more convincing.</p><p>The technology that powers deepfakes, known as generative adversarial networks, was invented only in 2014. GANs are made up of two rival computer networks. A synthesiser creates content, which the detector or discriminator compares to images of the real thing.</p><p>\"Let's say the synthesiser places someone's face on to someone [else]'s face,\" says Farid. \"The detector says there's an artefact [a distortion in the image], do it again.\" Through hundreds of thousands of cycles of trial and error, the two systems can create immensely lifelike videos.</p><p>This has been the year that saw deepfakes move beyond the hands of those with powerful computers, graphics cards and at least some technical expertise. The DeepNude app was released in June and the Zao app in August.</p><p>The former, now shut down, produced realistic female nudes from clothed photographs, leading to understandable outrage. The latter allowed users to plaster their faces over the protagonists of a selection of movies simply by uploading a few seconds of video to the free Chinese app.</p><p>\"These things are absolutely getting democratised, and it's happening really rapidly,\" Farid says. He is not alone in expressing shock at the rate of development from academic concept to easily accessible reality. \"We knew it was coming, but not nearly this fast,\" says David Doermann, a professor at the University of Buffalo.</p><p>Like Farid, Doermann has been in the field of computer vision and image processing for more than two decades, and is an adviser for video-verification app Amber. \"It's hard to predict where [deepfakes will] go in the next five years, given they've only been around for five years.\"</p><p>Making a deepfake from scratch is increasingly simple. Making a good deepfake, however, is another matter. The more powerful the computer and the graphics card, the more cycles a GAN can run through and the better the results.</p><p>On top of that, many of the best-looking deepfakes have been professionally touched up afterwards.</p><p>Given these limitations, it is unsurprising that a market has started to emerge. A Japanese start-up called Deepfakes Web is charging $2 an hour of processing time to create videos. On Fiverr, an online marketplace connecting freelancers with jobs, a user with the name Derpfakes offers to put customers' faces into movie clips.</p><p>Face swapping may be the most common form of deepfake, but others are more ambitious. Ricky Wong, one of the co-founders of a start-up called Humen, explains that with three minutes of footage of movement and material from professionals, his company can make anyone \"dance\". \"We're trying to bring delight and fun to people's lives,\" he says. \"Not something like a Nazi salute, that would be horrible.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, audio deepfakes are also on the rise. Modulate, a start-up based in Boston, is creating \"audio skins\", real-time voice changers for use in video games. \"There's a lot of people who spend a lot of time and money building up their persona in games,\" says Mike Pappas, the company's co-founder and chief executive.</p><p>\"Your normal voice breaks that illusion that you've spent so much time crafting.\" Part way through our phone conversation, Pappas changes to a woman's voice, and then to a co-worker's: it comes across as a little stiff but still recognisably human.</p><p>Pappas acknowledges the risks of impersonation. In August, The Wall Street Journal reported on one of the first known cases of synthetic media becoming part of a classic identity fraud scheme: scammers are believed to have used commercially available voice-changing technology to pose as a chief executive in order to swindle funds.</p><p>As services such as Modulate grow, the number of legal cases is likely to go up. Pappas says Modulate screens requests to avoid impersonation. \"We've landed on the fact that it's important to be able to sleep at night,\" he says.</p><p>The company also places a digital watermark on its audio to reduce the risk of a voice skin being recognised for the real thing.</p><p>As Henry Ajder walks through the nearly 600-year-old grounds of Queens' College, Cambridge, he describes a daily routine that involves tracking the creation and spread of deepfake videos into the darkest corners of the internet.</p><p>Ajder's job as head of communications and research analysis at start-up Deeptrace has led to him investigating everything from fake pornography to politics. In a report Deeptrace released in September, the scale of the problem was laid bare: the start-up found nearly 15,000 deepfakes online over the past seven months. Of these, 96 per cent were pornographic.</p><p>One of Ajder's political cases looked at whether a deepfake may have contributed to an attempted coup in Gabon. Ali Bongo Ondimba, the President of the African nation, was taken ill in October last year and has been in Morocco since then, with little information released on his health.</p><p>Then, in December, a surprise video of him was released, prompting speculation from political opponents. \"It just looked odd: the eyes didn't move properly, the head didn't move in a natural way - the immediate kind of response was that this is a deepfake,\" says Ajder.</p><p>A week after the video was released, junior officers attempted a coup d'&amp;#xE9;tat, which was quickly crushed.</p><p>In fact, Deeptrace did not find evidence of manipulation, but for Ajder that may be irrelevant. What was important was the uncertainty created. \"Even before these videos become very good or very widespread, we are already seeing the spectre of deepfakes haunting people,\" he says.</p><p>\"It really drives how powerful the mere doubt is . . . about any videos we already want to be fake.\"</p><p>Kanishk Karan, a researcher at the Digital Forensic Research Lab, part of the US think tank Atlantic Council, points to another potential deepfake, this time in Malaysia: a video alleging to show economic affairs minister Azmin Ali in a tryst with another minister's male aide.</p><p>Given Malaysia's colonial-era laws and persistent discrimination against LGBT communities, the footage, released in June, naturally provoked controversy. \"A lot of people were saying it's a deepfake version of him,\" says Karan. \"On the other side, the opposition is saying that it's not a deepfake, it's a real confession.\" To date, the scandal has not toppled Ali.</p><p>Deepfakes may be particularly destructive in countries such as India or Brazil. In both, there is heavy use of WhatsApp, a platform that lends itself to videos and images and whose closed nature also comes with a sense of security and trust. Both countries have large populations without basic literacy, Narayanan of the Oxford Internet Institute points out, making it difficult to generate media literacy. As is often the case with disinformation, vulnerable populations are most at risk.</p><p>\"The internet represents the peak of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. These are communities that haven't reaped the benefits of the first one - they do not have the know-how to begin to understand that a computer can create this,\" she says.</p><p>Those creating the technology to fight deepfakes on the ground are divided into two broad camps. The first is detection, identifying fake videos and images as they emerge. Deeptrace is one of the companies in that space, explains chief executive Giorgio Patrini, calling from the company's Amsterdam headquarters to demonstrate its system.</p><p>The video on my screen looks rather like an earlier version of Windows Movie Maker but in navy corporate colours. On the right-hand side are four videos. Among them is the now-famous deepfake of Mark Zuckerberg produced for a political art installation and another of Rowan Atkinson's face superimposed on Donald Trump's body.</p><p>The video Patrini drags over to the left-hand side is unfamiliar, however, and comes from a Taiwanese channel on YouTube. It features a young woman smiling and talking to the camera. Over the connection, the video comes across as slightly choppy, but hardly enough to suggest something is out of the ordinary.</p><p>When he hits play, a red box playing over her features, flashing percentages, reveals that it is a fake: a fan wearing a K-Pop singer's face. \"We've seen a couple of things that are coming out on Asian markets and are being sold for pennies on these digital marketplaces,\" says Ajder. This video is harmless, but Patrini says that (female) K-Pop singers have become major targets of fake porn.</p><p>He explains that Deeptrace's technology is trained on the thousands of deepfakes that the company has pieced together from across the internet. \"We have, to the best of our knowledge, the largest network of fake videos out there,\" Patrini says.</p><p>The job is a continuous one, though. \"Things a year ago don't compare,\" he says. \"We see thousands of people contributing to small tweaks to the technology on GitHub, doing it as a hobby.\"</p><p>Farid is also working on detection, focusing primarily on public figures, including world leaders. His system analyses hours of video of their conversations, including interviews, speeches and rallies, then focuses on the idiosyncrasies of their speech patterns and expressions.</p><p>\"When Obama would deliver bad news, he would frown, his brow would furrow and he would slightly tilt his head downwards,\" the Berkeley professor says. \"If he was being funny he would smile and look up to the left . . . Everyone has a different cadence to how their expressions change.\"</p><p>For now, Farid thinks he is one step ahead of the deepfake producers. \"I'm analysing eyebrows and head movements,\" he says. \"The GANs don't know that there's a face there.\" In the long term, however, he is pessimistic. \"It's an arms race and, at the end of the day, we know we're going to lose - but we're going to take it out of the hands of the amateur and move it into the hands of fewer people.\"</p><p>Wael Abd-Almageed, a senior scientist at the University of Southern California, represents yet another attempt at detection. His work strings together several video frames to verify whether an image is a deepfake. Nevertheless, he is quick to acknowledge that his research may unintentionally feed into improving future deepfakes.</p><p>\"My anticipation is the people who create them will see our paper and try and improve their methods to fool our detector,\" he says. \"If you think deepfakes are a problem now, they will be much harder in the next couple of years.\"</p><p>The second method of combating deepfakes focuses on improving trust in videos. Truepic, a San Diego-based start-up, has been trying to fight manipulated videos and photos for four years, with experts such as Farid on its advisory board.</p><p>Jeffrey McGregor, Truepic's chief executive, says the company launched in response to a spate of manipulated pictures online. \"Deepfakes will forever be generated . . . What Truepic is aiming to do, instead of detecting them, is establishing truth.\"</p><p>Truepic has produced a camera app for everyday usage. \"When you tap on that shutter button, we're capturing all of the geospatial data - GPS sensors, barometric pressures, the heading of the device, and securely transforming that to Truepic's verification server.\"</p><p>There, the company runs tests to check whether the image has been manipulated. If it has not, Truepic uploads a verified version to its website, which can be shared with other parties.</p><p>McGregor says Truepic has already found business uses with insurers and lenders. The company is also working with NGOs who have a particular need for verified images. \"One example is the Syrian American Medical Society - they've used Truepic to document some of the events that are happening in Syria,\" he says.</p><p>Amber, a San Francisco-based start-up, produces detection software as well as Amber Authenticate, a camera app that generates \"hashes\" - representations of the data - that are uploaded to a public blockchain as users shoot a video.</p><p>If the veracity needs to be checked - for example, in a courtroom - any differences between hashes can show whether it has been tampered with. \"Video or audio being used as evidence should not be operating in probabilities,\" says Shamir Allibhai, Amber's CEO.</p><p>Yet while entrepreneurs and academics can produce software to fight deepfakes, social media giants must also tussle with them. YouTube told the FT that it was aware of the issue and was working on it. The video platform did remove the altered video of Pelosi.</p><p>But it remains unclear what policies it might invoke that could stop users taking parody videos and reposting them as if they were real, as with the Renzi deepfake.</p><p>Of the big tech companies, it is Facebook that has started to take the lead in looking for technical solutions. In September, it announced the launch of the Deepfake Detection Challenge alongside Microsoft, academics in the US and Britain, and an industry consortium, the Partnership on AI.</p><p>\"Better late than never,\" says Farid, who is among the scientists involved. \"Yes, this is good - YouTube and Twitter should be doing this too - but there's a second part, the policy issue.\" He points to the altered video of Pelosi uploaded to Facebook as a prime example of this dimension.</p><p>\"Facebook knew it was fake within seconds. They also said, 'We are not the arbiters of truth.' \" The video stayed up.</p><p>In its refusal to act, Facebook strived to stay within the limits of the US Communications Decency Act, Section 230 - legislation from 1996. It counts websites as platforms rather than publishers, to promote free speech, but has come under increasing criticism for seemingly enabling companies to avoid liability for the content they host. The result is an often piecemeal approach to content issues.</p><p>Electoral systems are also lagging. A spokesperson for Britain's Electoral Commission says deepfakes are just one challenge posed by the rise of digital campaigning. While printed material is required by law to have imprints showing authorship, this does not apply to electronic content - a potentially dangerous loophole.</p><p>One way to deal with this would be through enacting clear regulation. Mutale Nkonde, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Centre at Harvard University, was among those involved in helping draft the Defending Each and Every Person from False Appearances by Keeping Exploitation Subject (DEEPFAKES) to Accountability Act.</p><p>\"It became incredibly important to enter a piece of legislation,\" she says. \"As we move towards 2020, we may be subject to supposed video evidence and we need a way of identifying what may look real [but is not].\" She says that there are fears that both China and Iran could turn to deepfakes as a tool to attack the US. Yet these dangers have to be dealt with in the framework of Section 230. The compromise for Nkonde and her colleagues was to treat deepfakes as a consumer-rights issue, making it about fraudulent representation.</p><p>The DEEPFAKES Accountability Act, referred to the subcommittee on crime, terrorism and homeland security in June, would make deepfakes for purposes such as fake porn, disinformation or election interference illegal.</p><p>Synthetic videos produced for purposes such as parody or education would need to be watermarked. But Nkonde says that even as someone who helped draw up the bill, she now questions its feasibility.</p><p>\"The issue with watermarking . . . is the technical architecture completely changes the video,\" she says. \"It's a completely new piece of video.\" Trying to prove something is a fake without reference to the \"real\" footage would be extremely hard. She also worries that watermarking would lead to false positives, or that canny developers could try to have real videos flagged as deepfakes.</p><p>\"We may end up having to actually favour some type of ban or moratorium until we get further research in all the different ways [videos] could be falsified,\" she says. \"We're falling foul to how fast tech is moving.\"</p><p>While the rate of progress is astounding, experts remain unconvinced about a deepfake apocalypse in the political sphere. It is the plausible deniability the technology offers that remains its greatest power.</p><p>Doermann at the University of Buffalo says that in the US at least, where public awareness of the technology is growing, an extremely high-quality deepfake would be needed to change the course of electoral history in 2020.</p><p>\"It would take a massive amount of computing power. It's not going to be a rogue person, it would be a nation state.\"</p><p>Ajder is also willing to admit that as with other advances in AI, scepticism around the technology is fair. But he is certain, nevertheless, that deepfakes, as a form of disinformation, are dangerous. \"They appeal to a different kind of truth,\" he says. \"The concept of truth has never been as solid as we like to think.\"</p><p>Voters who see a video of a politician behaving in a way they expect them to might understand it is a fake, but believe it represents an underlying reality to their character. \"We no longer have the luxury of [deciding] when we can suspend our reality,\" Ajder concludes.</p><p>That is evident in the response to the altered video of Pelosi. Many comments on The Washington Post's explainer on YouTube reflect the view that the specifics of the video do not matter. \"She still sounds drunk and really messed up at normal speed . . . can't hear no big difference,\" says one user. That comment received 564 likes.W</p><p>FINANCIAL TIMES</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc77s78drqp371tux86vo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD9-2DF1-F0J6-J16P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3530\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

An oil painting hangs to one side of him, on the other sits a Renaissance bust.</p><p>A technician ducks into shot to check his sound levels, and then Renzi is off. He starts by gurning at an off-screen audience member, greeting them in a hoarse stage whisper. </p><p>Then he turns on his fellow politicians. Giuseppe Conte, the current prime minister; Luigi Di Maio, his deputy; Carlo Calenda, a member of the European parliament \u2014 all receive the same obscene arm gesture, punctuated with a little sneer.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://observers.france24.com/en/20191008-deepfake-video-former-italian-pm-matteo-renzi-sparks-debate-italy\"> This performance </url>sent some Italians straight to Twitter to voice their outrage at the ex-prime minister\u2019s diatribe. But it was not the real Renzi talking. On closer examination, the voice is different, as are the gesticulations. Even the face looks uncannily smooth. </p><p>That\u2019s because the politician\u2019s features have been algorithmically transplanted on to a comedian\u2019s, as part of a skit for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Striscia la notizia</emphasis>, a long-running Italian satire show. The video is the latest in a series of examples of how \u201cdeepfake\u201d technology \u2014 or AI-generated videos designed to fool humans \u2014 has started to affect politics.</p><p>Only a few years ago, such \u201cdeepfakes\u201d were a novelty, created by hobbyist coders. Today, they are increasingly commodified as yet another service available to those with even a little disposable cash. </p><p>While they may be increasingly cheap to pull off, their repercussions could be far-reaching. Fraudulent clips of business leaders could tank companies. False audio of central bankers could swing markets. Small businesses and individuals could face crippling reputational or financial risk. </p><p>And, as elections approach in the US, UK and elsewhere, deepfakes could raise the stakes once more in the electorate\u2019s struggle to know the truth.</p><p>Around the world, start-ups, academics and lawmakers are rushing to create tools to mitigate these risks. But the technology itself is developing faster than anyone imagined. </p><p>Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, has spent decades studying digital manipulation: \u201cIn January 2019, deepfakes were\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009buggy and flickery. Nine months later, I\u2019ve never seen anything like how fast they\u2019re going. This is the tip of the iceberg.\u201d </p><p>On one thing, experts are clear. The mere risk of a deepfake undermines a most basic principle of humanity: can you believe your eyes?</p><p>Disinformation is as old as politics, and its practitioners have kept pace with technological changes. Where written <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/e26891d0-28f1-44da-ba99-1d148f60335b\"> fake news </url>was the hallmark of the most recent election cycle in the US and UK, images and videos are increasingly the new focus of propaganda, says Vidya Narayanan, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. </p><p>\u201c[They] are powerful in shaping a situation. If you see an image, it is very immediate.\u201d Software such as Photoshop was used to create a widely shared fake image of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh42OQ7zocw\"> Emma Gonz\u00e1lez</url>, a survivor of the Parkland shooting and a gun control activist, ripping up the US Constitution in 2018.</p><p>Altered videos are not exactly new. The most famous recent example is an edit of a slowed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/may/24/real-v-fake-debunking-the-drunk-nancy-pelosi-footage-video\"> Nancy Pelosi </url>speech from earlier this year. The video spread across conservative media as critics of the Speaker of the House of Representatives declared it evidence of her senility, alcoholism or a mental health problem. </p><p>Rudy Giuliani, US president Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, retweeted the video, before deleting it but defending his choice. Trump himself posted <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1131728912835383300?lang=en\"> a different altered video </url>of Pelosi, which is still online: it has nearly 30,000 retweets and more than 90,000 likes. The difference with a deepfake is that with an algorithm in charge, the results can be much more convincing.</p><p>The technology that powers deepfakes, known as Generative Adversarial Networks, was only invented in 2014. GANs are made up of two rival computer networks. A synthesiser creates content, which the detector or discriminator compares to images of the real thing. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say the synthesiser places someone\u2019s face on to someone [else]\u2019s face,\u201d says Farid. \u201cThe detector says there\u2019s an artefact [a distortion in the image], do it again.\u201d Through hundreds of thousands of cycles of trial and error, the two systems can create immensely lifelike videos.</p><p>This has been the year that saw deepfakes move beyond the hands of those with powerful computers, graphics cards and at least some technical expertise. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/27/deepfake_nudes_app_pulled/\"> DeepNude app </url>was released in June and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns\"> ZAO</url> app in August. </p><p>The former, now shut down, produced realistic female nudes from clothed photographs, leading to understandable outrage. The latter allowed users to plaster their faces over the protagonists of a selection of movies simply by uploading a few seconds of video to the free Chinese app. \u201cThese things are absolutely getting democratised, and it\u2019s happening really rapidly,\u201d Farid says.</p><p>He is not alone in expressing shock at the rate of development from academic concept to easily accessible reality. \u201cWe knew it was coming, but not nearly this fast,\u201d says David Doermann, a professor at the University of Buffalo. </p><p>Like Farid, Doermann has been in the field of computer vision and image processing for more than two decades, and is an adviser for video-verification app Amber. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict where [deepfakes will] go in the next five years, given they\u2019ve only been around for five years.\u201d</p><p>Making a deepfake from scratch is increasingly simple. Making a good deepfake, however, is another matter. The more powerful the computer and the graphics card, the more cycles a GAN can run through and the better the results. On top of that, many of the best-looking deepfakes have been professionally touched up afterwards.</p><p>Given these limitations, it is unsurprising that a market has started to emerge. A Japanese start-up called Deepfakes Web is charging $2 an hour of processing time to create videos. On Fiverr, an online marketplace connecting freelancers with jobs, a user with the name Derpfakes offers to put customers\u2019 faces into movie clips.</p><p>Face swapping may be the most common form of deepfake, but others are more ambitious. Ricky Wong, one of the co-founders of a start-up called Humen, explains that with three minutes of footage of movement and material from professionals, his company can make anyone \u201cdance\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring delight and fun to people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says. \u201cNot something like a Nazi salute, that would be horrible.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, audio deepfakes are also on the rise. Modulate, a start-up based in Boston, is creating \u201caudio skins\u201d, real-time voice changers for use in video games. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who spend a lot of time and money building up their persona in games,\u201d says Mike Pappas, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive. </p><p>\u201cYour normal voice breaks that illusion that you\u2019ve spent so much time crafting.\u201d Part way through our phone conversation, Pappas changes to a woman\u2019s voice, and then to a co-worker\u2019s: it comes across as a little stiff but still recognisably human.</p><p>Pappas acknowledges the risks of impersonation. In August, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402\"> The Wall Street Journal reported</url> on one of the first known cases of synthetic media becoming part of a classic identity fraud scheme: scammers are believed to have used commercially available voice-changing technology to pose as a chief executive in order to swindle funds. </p><p>As services such as Modulate grow, the number of legal cases is likely to go up. Pappas says Modulate screens requests to avoid impersonation. \u201cWe\u2019ve landed on the fact that it\u2019s important to be able to sleep at night,\u201d he says. The company also places a digital watermark on its audio to reduce the risk of a voice skin being recognised for the real thing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">As Henry Ajder walks</emphasis> through the nearly 600-year-old grounds of Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge, he describes a daily routine that involves tracking the creation and spread of deepfake videos into the darkest corners of the internet.</p><p>Ajder\u2019s job as head of communications and research analysis at start-up Deeptrace has led to him investigating everything from fake pornography to politics. In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://deeptracelabs.com/mapping-the-deepfake-landscape/\"> report Deeptrace released </url>last month, the scale of the problem was laid bare: the start-up found nearly 15,000 deepfakes online over the past seven months. Of these, 96 per cent were pornographic.</p><p>One of Ajder\u2019s political cases looked at whether or not a deepfake may have contributed to an attempted coup in Gabon. Ali Bongo Ondimba, the president of the African nation, was taken ill in October last year and has been in Morocco since then, with little information released on his health. Then, in December, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS1l3JigDhc\"> a surprise video</url> of him was released, prompting speculation from political opponents. </p><p>\u201cIt just looked odd: the eyes didn\u2019t move properly, the head didn\u2019t move in a natural way \u2014 the immediate kind of response was that this is a deepfake,\u201d says Ajder. A week after the video was released, junior officers attempted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, which was quickly crushed.</p><p>In fact, Deeptrace did not find evidence of manipulation but, for Ajder, that may be irrelevant. What was important was the uncertainty created. \u201cEven before these videos become very good or very widespread, we are already seeing the spectre of deepfakes haunting people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really drives how powerful the mere doubt is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009about any videos we already want to be fake.\u201d</p><p>Kanishk Karan, a researcher at the Digital Forensic Research Lab, part of the US think-tank Atlantic Council, points to another potential deepfake, this time in Malaysia: a video alleging to show economic affairs minister <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/one-mans-meat/2019/06/15/is-it-azmin-or-a-deepfake\"> Azmin Ali in a tryst </url>with another minister\u2019s male aide. </p><p>Given Malaysia\u2019s colonial-era laws and persistent discrimination against LGBT communities, the footage, released in June, naturally provoked controversy. \u201cA lot of people were saying it\u2019s a deepfake version of him,\u201d says Karan. \u201cOn the other side, the opposition is saying that it\u2019s not a deepfake, it\u2019s a real confession.\u201d To date, the scandal has not toppled Ali.</p><p>Deepfakes may be particularly destructive in countries such as India or Brazil. In both, there is heavy use of WhatsApp, a platform that lends itself to videos and images and whose closed nature also comes with a sense of security and trust. </p><p>Both countries have large populations without basic literacy, Narayanan of the Oxford Internet Institute points out, making it difficult to generate media literacy. As is often the case with disinformation, vulnerable populations are most at risk. </p><p>\u201cThe internet represents the peak of the fourth industrial revolution. These are communities that haven\u2019t reaped the benefits of the first one \u2014 they do not have the know-how to begin to understand that a computer can create this,\u201d she says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Those creating the technology</emphasis> to fight deep-fakes on the ground are divided into two broad camps. The first is detection, identifying fake videos and images as they emerge. Deeptrace is one of the companies in that space, explains chief executive Giorgio Patrini, as he calls from the company\u2019s Amsterdam headquarters to demonstrate its system.</p><p>The video on my screen looks rather like an earlier version of Windows Movie Maker but in navy corporate colours. On the right-hand side are four videos. Among them is the now-famous deepfake of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OObMqEzBzEw\"> Mark Zuckerberg</url> produced for a political art installation and another of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/t/blackadder/qR6WTfc\"> Rowan Atkinson\u2019s face</url> superimposed on Donald Trump\u2019s body.</p><p>The video Patrini drags over to the left-hand side is unfamiliar, however, and comes from a Taiwanese channel on YouTube. It features a young woman smiling and talking to the camera. Over the connection, the video comes across as slightly choppy, but hardly enough to suggest something is out of the ordinary. </p><p>When he hits play, a red box playing over her features, flashing percentages, reveals that it is a fake: a fan wearing a K-Pop singer\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a couple of things that are coming out on Asian markets and are being sold for pennies on these digital marketplaces,\u201d says Ajder. This video is harmless, but Patrini says that (female) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/deepfakes-nonconsensual-porn-study-kpop-895605/\"> K-Pop singers</url> have become major targets of fake porn.</p><p>Patrini explains that Deeptrace\u2019s technology is trained on the thousands of deepfakes that the company has pieced together from across the internet. \u201cWe have, to the best of our knowledge, the largest network of fake videos out there,\u201d he says. </p><p>The job is a continuous one, though. \u201cThings a year ago don\u2019t compare,\u201d he says. \u201cWe see thousands of people contributing to small tweaks to the technology on GitHub, doing it as a hobby.\u201d</p><p>Farid, the Berkeley professor, is also working on detection, focusing primarily on public figures, including world leaders. His system analyses hours of video of their conversations, including interviews, speeches and rallies. From there, it focuses on the specific idiosyncrasies of their speech patterns and expressions. </p><p>\u201cWhen Obama would deliver bad news, he would frown, his brow would furrow and he would slightly tilt his head downwards,\u201d he says. \u201cIf he was being funny he would smile and look up to the left\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Everyone has a different cadence to how their expressions change.\u201d</p><p>For now, Farid thinks he is one step ahead of the deepfake producers. \u201cI\u2019m analysing eyebrows and head movements,\u201d he says. \u201cThe GANs don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a face there.\u201d In the long term, however, he is pessimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s an arms race and, at the end of the day, we know we\u2019re going to lose \u2014 but we\u2019re going to take it out of the hands of the amateur and move it into the hands of fewer people.\u201d</p><p>Dr Wael Abd-Almageed, a senior scientist at the University of Southern California, represents yet another attempt at detection. His work strings together several video frames to verify whether an image is a deepfake. Nevertheless, he is quick to acknowledge that his research may unintentionally feed into improving future deepfakes. </p><p>\u201cMy anticipation is the people who create them will see our paper and try and improve their methods to fool our detector,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you think deepfakes are a problem now, they will be much harder in the next couple of years.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The second method of combating</emphasis> deepfakes focuses on improving trust in videos. Truepic, a San Diego-based start-up, has been trying to fight manipulated videos and photos for four years, with experts such as Farid on its advisory board. </p><p>Jeffrey McGregor, Truepic\u2019s chief executive, says the company launched in response to a spate of manipulated pictures online. \u201cDeepfakes will forever be generated\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009What Truepic is aiming to do instead of detecting them, is establishing truth.\u201d</p><p>Truepic has produced a camera app for everyday usage. \u201cWhen you tap on that shutter button, we\u2019re capturing all of the geospatial data \u2014 GPS sensors, barometric pressures, the heading of the device and securely transforming that to Truepic\u2019s verification server.\u201d </p><p>There, the company runs tests to check whether the image has been manipulated. If it has not, Truepic uploads a verified version to its website, which can be shared with other parties.</p><p>McGregor says that Truepic has already found business uses with insurers and lenders. The company is also working with NGOs who have a particular need for verified images. \u201cOne example is the Syrian American Medical Society \u2014 they\u2019ve used Truepic to document some of the events that are happening in Syria,\u201d he says.</p><p>Amber, a San Francisco-based start-up, produces detection software as well as Amber Authenticate, a camera app that generates \u201chashes\u201d \u2014 representations of the data \u2014 that are uploaded to a public blockchain as users shoot a video. </p><p>If the veracity needs to be checked \u2014 for example, in a courtroom \u2014 any differences between hashes can show whether it has been tampered with. \u201cVideo or audio being used as evidence should not be operating in probabilities,\u201d says Shamir Allibhai, Amber\u2019s CEO.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yet while entrepreneurs and academics</emphasis> can produce software to fight deepfakes, social-media giants must also tussle with them. YouTube told the FT that it was aware of the issue and was working on it. The video platform did remove the altered video of Pelosi. </p><p>It remains unclear, however, what policies it might invoke that could stop users taking parody videos and reposting them as if they were real, as with the Renzi deepfake.</p><p>Of the Big Tech companies, it is Facebook that has started to take the lead in looking for technical solutions. In September, it announced the launch of the Deepfake Detection Challenge alongside Microsoft, academics in the US and UK, and an industry consortium called the Partnership on AI. </p><p>\u201cBetter late than never,\u201d says Farid, who is among the scientists involved. \u201cYes, this is good \u2014 YouTube and Twitter should be doing this too \u2014 but there\u2019s a second part, the policy issue.\u201d He points to the altered video of Nancy Pelosi uploaded to Facebook as a prime example of this dimension. \u201cFacebook knew it was fake within seconds. They also said, \u2018We are not the arbiters of truth.\u2019\u201d The video stayed up.</p><p>In its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/24/facebook-leaves-fake-nancy-pelosi-video-on-site\"> refusal to act,</url>Facebook strived to stay within the limits of the Communication Decency Act, Section 230 \u2014 legislation from 1996. It counts websites as platforms rather than publishers, to promote free speech, but has come under increasing criticism for seeming to enable companies to avoid liability for the content they host. The result is an often piecemeal approach to content issues.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/15/deepfakes-could-be-problem-for-the-2020-election.html\"> Electoral systems </url>are also lagging. A spokesperson for the UK\u2019s Electoral Commission said that deepfakes are just one challenge posed by the rise of digital campaigning. While printed material is required by law to have imprints showing authorship, this does not apply to electronic content \u2014 a potentially dangerous loophole.</p><p>One way to deal with this would be through enacting clear regulation. Mutale Nkonde, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University, was among those involved in helping draft the Defending Each and Every Person from False Appearances by Keeping Exploitation Subject (DEEPFAKES) to Accountability Act. </p><p>\u201cIt became incredibly important to enter a piece of legislation,\u201d she says. \u201cAs we move towards 2020, we may be subject to supposed video evidence and we need a way of identifying what may look real [but is not].\u201d She says that there are fears that both China and Iran could turn to deepfakes as a tool to attack the US.</p><p>Yet these dangers have to be dealt with in the framework of Section 230. The compromise for Nkonde and her colleagues was to treat deepfakes as a consumer-rights issue, making it about fraudulent representation. </p><p>The DEEPFAKES Accountability Act, referred to the subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security in June, would make deepfakes for purposes such as fake porn, disinformation or election interference illegal. </p><p>Those synthetic videos produced for purposes such as parody or education would need to be watermarked. But Nkonde says that even as someone who helped draw up the bill, she now questions its feasibility.</p><p>\u201cThe issue with watermarking\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is the technical architecture completely changes the video,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely new piece of video.\u201d Trying to prove something is a fake without reference to the \u201creal\u201d footage would be extremely hard. She also worries that watermarking would lead to false positives, or that canny developers could try to have real videos flagged as deepfakes. </p><p>\u201cWe may end up having to actually favour some type of ban or moratorium until we get further research in all the different ways [videos] could be falsified,\u201d she suggests. \u201cWe\u2019re falling foul to how fast tech is moving.\u201d</p><p>While the rate of progress is astounding, experts remain unconvinced about a deepfake apocalypse in the political sphere. It is the plausible deniability the technology offers that remains its greatest power. </p><p>Doermann at the University of Buffalo says that in the US at least, where public awareness of the technology is growing, an extremely high-quality deepfake would be needed to change the course of electoral history in 2020. \u201cIt would take a massive amount of computing power. It\u2019s not going to be a rogue person, it would be a nation state.\u201d</p><p>Ajder is also willing to admit that as with other advances in AI, scepticism around the technology is fair. But he is certain, nevertheless, that deepfakes, as a form of disinformation, are dangerous. \u201cThey appeal to a different kind of truth,\u201d he says. \u201cThe concept of truth has never been as solid as we like to think.\u201d </p><p>Voters who see a video of a politician behaving in a way they expect them to might understand it is a fake, but believe it represents an underlying reality to their character. \u201cWe no longer have the luxury of [deciding] when we can suspend our reality,\u201d Ajder concludes.</p><p>That is evident in the response to the altered video of Pelosi. Many comments on The Washington Post\u2019s explainer on YouTube reflect the view that the specifics of the video do not matter. \u201cShe still sounds drunk and really messed up at normal speed\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009can\u2019t hear no big difference,\u201d says one user. That comment received 564 likes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan is an FT leader writer\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"> @FTMag</url> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

As Danah Boyd recently proffered, beyond simply restricting access, privacy today is about strategically controlling the availability of one's information in different social contexts, as well as its interpretation and reach.<br/> But how do we balance this with, going back to Aristotle, our inherent disposition to be social animals? Can we continue doing so online and expect a fair privacy bargain in the process?<br/> The privacy paradox -- our claim to hold privacy as a high virtue, yet part with our information for a voucher code, Farm Coins, or free Wi-Fi -- is very real. The blame for this, however, does not, try as the tech giants might, lie squarely on users, who have every right to be spooked by Cambridge Analytica, Strava or Netflix's \"creepy\" tweets -- and others that did and didn't make it to the headlines.<br/> The internet was born as a free and open space for people, who have instead been thrust into walled gardens, unwittingly and systematically misled, monetised, and offered unfair, sometimes dire, choices online. A recalibration then, was long overdue.<br/> For big tech, balancing meaningful privacy and control with business models inherently at cross purposes with the Net's ethos, is going to be an uphill task. Built around the data-for-ads value exchange, cutting off, controlling or reshaping the supply of that data has direct consequences for businesses, as Facebook, Acxiom and other stock prices reliant on maintaining that status quo have recently shown.<br/> Also challenging is the manner in which the current ecosystem has technologically been constructed. The Move-Fast-and-Break-Things dicta translate into systems designed to incentivise (over)sharing and then vacuum up, analyse and disseminate data, primarily so that it can be monetised with tremendous speed and accuracy.<br/> Imbuing these systems with respect for user-agency, contextual integrity and accounting for meaningful privacy in networked environments -- where you may choose to be a social media hermit but turn up regularly on your friend's (public) Instagram -- is going to require going back to the drawing board on several fronts.<br/> As rights go, the solution to addressing this doesn't lie in simply providing greater individual ownership and control over and consent for using data, although these are key constituents of the privacy toolkit. Preserving privacy includes balancing the data-for-services barter so it is no longer askew. Knowing what you're signing up for doesn't make up for being given a raw deal you have no choice but to agree to.<br/> An important premise of right to privacy being inviolable is that choices inconsistent with these rights cannot be presented to begin with, and they cannot simply be circumvented by burying things in fine print and engineering consent.<br/> With comprehensive new data protection regulation flowing from such rights in place and on the anvil in many parts of the world (including in India), carefully accounting for a majority of these issues, the hope this time is that the law will not have to continue to keep playing catch-up, reactively bandaging our privacy wounds one at a time.<br/> Rather, the idea is to send users out into the web forearmed with comprehensive rights, meaningfully in control of their data, and shielded by privacy -- by design and default. The shift in the privacy burden, and it is a heavy burden to bear, onto those we entrust with our data to do right with it, is what is hoped will be key to ensuring much of this.<br/> Beyond this, it is also time we as users meaningfully utilised the increased agency we're being offered.

One supported the other, since both were about freedom. But trends in two versions of capitalism-the free enterprise one of the US and the authoritarian variety of China-should force us to re-examine this hypothesis. Faced with periodic economic crises, American politicians are wooing voters with socialist rhetoric and promises of a bigger state; the authoritarian Chinese state is metamorphosing into a new kind of imperium that is inimical to democracy. China is growing richer, but neither more democratic nor responsible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The wooing of domestic audiences, whether through the ballot box in the US and Western democracies, or through an implicit social consensus in China, where citizens trade political freedoms for greater prosperity, has resulted in a blurring of the line that separates politics from economics.</p><p>Four major economic crises seem to have hastened that trend: the global financial crisis of 2008, the eurozone crisis of the subsequent period, the post-covid economic collapse this year, and the 30-year Japanese debt binge. From the current mania of endlessly printing money to appease voter anxieties, it would seem that economics is just politics by another name. Despite its flaws, capitalism works only when a free market is allowed to play its role in separating the strong from the weak; creative destruction is the key to innovation and viable growth. If deadbeat companies are allowed to remain afloat by taxpayer-financed bailouts, especially if the funds are obtained not from tax revenues but debt, then even competitive companies will end up sinking under the pressure. In short, trying to save too many bad apples could leave the whole basket rotten.</p><p>Few observers seem willing to give India's Narendra Modi government credit for trying to follow relatively sensible economics (during the first four years of its first term) and pushing unviable companies towards liquidation or sale to stronger companies. At no time in the history of India have companies owned by some of our biggest promoter groups-the Tatas, Ruias, Ambanis (the Anil Ambani part), Dhoots, Jaiprakash, Binanis, GVK, GMR-been forced to either sell their troubled companies or opt for bankruptcy proceedings. The process is far from complete, or even smooth, and unviable parts of the micro, small and medium enterprise sector are likely to see a gruesome shakeout in terms of jobs lost and loans gutted. But at the end of it all, there is a possibility that only relatively viable firms will remain afloat.</p><p>It is easy to say that \"matsya nyay\"-where the big fish swallow or kill the small-is morally reprehensible, but protection should be restricted to human beings, not companies.</p><p>In the current covid crisis, the Modi government has tried hard to protect the fisc by focusing its expenses in cash and kind only on the most vulnerable (migrant labour, the poor, etc.), and avoiding massive bailouts for the multitude of sectors now in distress. While there is little doubt that the fisc is going to be overstretched for a while, the government has so far resisted calls to open the spigots of massive debt-financed cash bailouts for all and sundry.</p><p>India is at least attempting to maintain some modicum of fiscal restraint in how it deals with the covid-induced economic crisis. We can't say that about the US, Europe or Japan.</p><p>In an article for The Wall Street Journal, Morgan Stanley's Ruchir Sharma says that the world has repeatedly been using debt to fund stimulus programmes on the assumption that all these are not only necessary, but can easily be financed in a near-zero interest rate regime. But cheap money enables even \"zombie firms\" to borrow, leading to huge losses in productivity.</p><p>The downside of such fiat money- fuelled assaults on market mechanisms is that debt keeps piling up, and this debt may be financing not good quality investment, but stock market binges or gold purchases. It enables giant monopolies to become even bigger and more menacing. If capitalism is supposed to prevent monopolies, either by allowing market forces to produce competent rivals or through sensible regulation, prolonged cheap money policies have delivered the exact opposite. Big Tech monopolies and other megacorps seem to have gained the most. The same speculators who brought on the 2008 crisis are again the prime beneficiaries of covid bailouts in the US.</p><p>Capitalism is already under attack on many fronts, from trade barriers to its curbs on the free movement of people. It hardly needs the world's big capitalist democracies to use any and every economic crisis to print more currency in the name of helping the poor and then ending up financing the speculative wealth of the richest of the rich.</p><p>The ever-growing State and push for welfarism are slowly ruining capitalism, as democratic politics requires politicians to make payouts to voters at the cost of fixing the structural problems that constrain growth. These policies could bankrupt economies as well as democratic politics.</p><p>Capitalism faces an existential crisis, just as communism did in the late 1980s.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

The sun was shining, a gentle breeze was blowing and, at a Silicon Valley coffee shop, Rep. Ro Khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject: the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's some more humility out here,\" Khanna (D-Calif.) said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh. Chris Larsen was on his third start-up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley, if not the world.</p><p>\"Realizing people hate your guts has some value,\" he joked.</p><p>For decades, Democrats and Republicans have hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way.</p><p>Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.</p><p>On a quiet weekday at a strip-mall coffee shop, the conversation between Khanna and Larsen turned to what went so wrong.</p><p>Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame.</p><p>\"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking.</p><p>Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district.</p><p>The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable. Boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year, Larsen's net worth had briefly hit $59\u00a0billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world before the currency's value fell.</p><p>Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow.</p><p>\"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\"</p><p>At some point, Larsen and Khanna worried, something was going to break.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of American capitalism. But it was Donald Trump's election and the pent-up anger it exposed that left America's billionaire class fearful for capitalism's future.</p><p>Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections.</p><p>Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late.</p><p>The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120\u00a0million conference center, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions . . . or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\"</p><p>Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p><p>Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution - not a guns revolution - but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said.</p><p>He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective started with 28\u00a0students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course.</p><p>\"What the trust surveys say is what I see,\" she said. \"They are really worried about the direction in which the U.S. and the world is heading.\"</p><p>A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading \"Winners Take All,\" a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas's book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government.</p><p>This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He slammed Mark Zuckerberg, taking aim at the Facebook founder's $100\u00a0million effort to fix Newark's faltering schools and his $3\u00a0billion push to end disease in a generation. \"I'm glad he's trying to get rid of all the diseases, [but] I wish Facebook wasn't a plague,\" Giridharadas said.</p><p>He trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\"</p><p>For many of the students, schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place, Giridharadas's ideas were both energizing and disorienting. Erika Uyterhoeven, a second-year student, recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when Giridharadas was finished.</p><p>\"So, what should we do?\" her colleague asked. \"Is he saying we shouldn't go into banking or consulting?\"</p><p>Added another student: \"There was a palpable sense of personal desperation.\"</p><p>Khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district. He grew up in an overwhelmingly white, middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. After college and Yale Law School, he moved to Silicon Valley in 2003, hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world.</p><p>In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed - in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2\u00a0million.</p><p>\"The best thing that happened to me was that I lost my 2014 election,\" he said. \"Had I won . . . maybe I would've been a traditional neoliberal. It really forced my self-reflection and it pointed out every weakness I ever had.\"</p><p>In California, Khanna's home is a small apartment around the corner from a Dollar Tree, one of only two in his district. His wife and two children live most of the year in Washington, where home values are cheaper.</p><p>His days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance.</p><p>A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf.</p><p>The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.</p><p>As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were eliminating much factory work; online commerce was decimating retail; and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think.</p><p>\"What happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor?\" said Greg Brockman, chairman of OpenAI, a company backed by several Silicon Valley billionaires. Such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research, said Brockman, 30. They could displace a large number of office jobs. Eventually, he said, the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live. Only Andrew Yang, a long-shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur, supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income. But the idea of a \"universal basic income\" was discussed regularly in the valley.</p><p>The prospect was both energizing and terrifying. OpenAI had recently added an ethicist - Brockman sometimes referred to her as a \"philosopher\" - to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations.</p><p>To Brockman, a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat, a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty. \"Once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing, my expectation is that we're going to look back at eating meat as this terrible, immoral thing,\" he said. The same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence. \"We'll look back and say, 'Wow, that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive,' \" he said.</p><p>Khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci-fi fantasy. His focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10\u00a0percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90\u00a0percent to their companies.</p><p>The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10\u00a0percent.</p><p>On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two\u00a0dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5\u00a0million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below.</p><p>Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a LinkedIn co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year.</p><p>Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of America could take part in the country's tech revolution.</p><p>The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, was a $100\u00a0million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of America. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said.</p><p>Khanna's blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions.</p><p>Khanna had a different view. He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity.</p><p>Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: Their grandparents had fought in World War II and helped build the country's industrial age economy. Now they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them.</p><p>\"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\"</p><p>Not everyone at the tech gathering was buying Khanna's analysis.</p><p>Atam Rao, a nuclear engineer, told Khanna that he had come to the United States from India 50\u00a0years earlier. Rao's son, who founded a successful video-game company in Los Angeles, was born in America. The day after Trump was elected, his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in India, just in case they needed to return someday.</p><p>\"Are we welcome here?\" he said his son asked.</p><p>He believed that Khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country.</p><p>\"They found someone to blame,\" Rao said of Trump and his backers. \"This is not going to be won by logic.\"</p><p>But that wasn't the America Khanna knew. It didn't fit with his experience growing up in suburban Philadelphia or arriving in Silicon Valley, where Indians had become rock stars and CEOs of companies such as Google. And it didn't comport with the results of the 2018 election, he said, now speaking directly to Rao.</p><p>\"The same country that elected Trump just elected the most diverse Congress in the country's history,\" Khanna said.</p><p>Khanna didn't deny the problem of racism, but like Sanders he saw the country's divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism's shortcomings and the economy, not race.</p><p>A few days after the meeting at the Cupertino mansion, Khanna was standing in front of 16,000 amped-up Sanders supporters. The San Francisco skyline rose in front of him and the Golden Gate Bridge spanned the bay behind him.</p><p>In his gray suit and pressed white shirt, the two-term congressman looked a bit out of place - an emissary from establishment Washington crashing someone else's revolution. Khanna gave a brief speech introducing Sanders, who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 Democratic primaries.</p><p>He bashed the billionaire class and its influence over American elections. \"Democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections,\" Sanders yelled in his Brooklyn growl.</p><p>\"We say no to oligarchy,\" he continued. \"Yes to democracy.\"</p><p>Khanna's eyes fixed on Steve Spinner, a big tech investor in Silicon Valley and major fundraiser for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Spinner, who chaired Khanna's congressional win, was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest.</p><p>\"We dragged him out here,\" Khanna said. \"He's about as far from Bernie as you can get.\"</p><p>Many of Khanna's billionaire supporters - even those who worried about capitalism and inequality - seemed genuinely puzzled by Khanna's affection for Sanders.</p><p>For Khanna it was simple: In Sanders, Khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country's most vexing problems: inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism.</p><p>Sanders wasn't a perfect match for Khanna. Sanders didn't really understand the tech industry - though he wasn't calling for the breakup of big tech companies like Warren and some other candidates. Warren's proposal, if executed, would hurt companies in Khanna's district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers.</p><p>Khanna wished Sanders would talk more about the greatness of the American economy and the power of the tech industry, when properly taxed and regulated, to lift people out of poverty. But on that score Khanna believed he could help Sanders.</p><p>\"We can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue,\" Khanna said. \"But I have no doubt that if Bernie Sanders was in the White House, he'd wake up every day thinking, 'How do I solve structural inequality in America?' ''</p><p>The 77-year-old socialist's speech had passed the one-hour mark and the crowd was still laughing, cheering, hooting and shouting.</p><p>\"We're probably not going to get a lot of support from the one\u00a0percent and the large profitable corporations,\" Sanders said.</p><p>A voice in the crowd screamed an expletive.</p><p>\"That's okay,\" Sanders continued, \"I don't need, and we don't want, their support.\"</p><p>The congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd, which stretched to the back of the park. Khanna saw Sanders's revolution as an imperfect solution to a near-impossible problem. For now, though, it was the best he could find.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:greg.jaffe@washpost.com\">greg.jaffe@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-74e8335a63c611e9bfad36a7eb36cb60</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VY4-F311-DXKP-J00P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3084\"/><timeReceived>11:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The often-intense debates about these policies aren't just important because they could reshape the U.S. economy. They also reflect a larger, more fundamental disagreement about capitalism itself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) believe that the American system of extractive capitalism is fundamentally broken - Sanders to the point of identifying as a democratic socialist - and see its failure as one of the forces that carried President Trump to the White House. Former vice president Joe Biden voices an opposing view: At an October fundraiser in Silicon Valley, he characterized Trump not as a product of American capitalism but rather a threat to it. \"You don't need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this - you've just got to make capitalism work like it's supposed to work,\" he said. \"We've got to save capitalism from this guy.\"</p><p>Last week, as part of the Munk Debates series in Toronto, I had the opportunity to debate capitalism and the potential alternatives to it alongside Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis, former American Enterprise Institute president (and current Post contributor) Arthur C.              Brooks and New York Times columnist David Brooks. I argued that the American system is broken in three ways.</p><p>First, it is fueling extreme inequality. Four decades of stagnant wages and upward flows of wealth in the United States have supercharged the existing wealth divide and other inequalities rooted in racial, gender and geographic differences. Productivity gains have flowed to the investor class, not to workers, and social mobility has declined. In his latest column (prepared for the debate), David Brooks countered that \"capitalism has brought about the greatest reduction of poverty in human history.\" But Oxfam International highlights a more nuanced reality: While there has been a meaningful decline in extreme poverty, hundreds of millions more people could have been lifted out of poverty if not for extreme inequalities within and across countries.</p><p>Second, capitalism is undermining democracy. In the Citizens United era, the amount of money in politics has exploded, resulting in elected officials from both parties who are more beholden to wealthy donors - and their business interests - than ever before. Corporate concentration is reducing competition and rendering both workers and consumers increasingly powerless against rising plutocracy. And this is happening as the forces of private equity and big tech conspire to annihilate the local and independent journalism that is vital to maintaining a democratic society.</p><p>It doesn't take a socialist to see capitalism's corrosive impact on democracy. In fact, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a former McKinsey consultant who was forced on Monday to finally agree to disclose his campaign bundlers, used to recognize it earlier in the campaign, saying, \"There's tension between capitalism and democracy, and negotiating that tension is probably the biggest challenge for America right now.\"</p><p>And, third, capitalism is destroying nature. As corporate lobbyists work to dismantle the regulatory apparatus, the companies they represent are irrevocably harming our environment, our health and our collective future. In pursuit of profits at any cost, corporations continue to ravage public lands, demolishing ecosystems, and poisoning the water we drink and the air we breathe. Meanwhile, even as corporate America has become more vocal about the importance of sustainability and the perils of climate change, it has opposed the dramatic policy changes needed to prevent catastrophe.</p><p>American politics is finally having a long-overdue debate about how to respond to these trends. Many of the ideas being discussed in the presidential race are undoubtedly part of the solution. But tweaking around the economy's edges won't be enough. We need a deep, structural redesign of basic institutions and functions; we need a new system to better serve the common good.</p><p>In this system, there will continue to be individual freedoms, private enterprises and small businesses. But, unlike today, those businesses will be protected from monopoly power. There will be new models of corporate ownership and governance that protect workers' rights and increase their power. There will be limits on excessive consumption. And there will be a \"plutocracy prevention\" program - not to be punitive, but to ensure that billionaires pay more in taxes than teachers and nurses, and that we have the revenue needed to rebuild decaying infrastructure, combat climate change, reverse declining social mobility and more.</p><p>Brooks writes that one of capitalism's strengths is \"creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out.\" On that we agree.

Widening inequality and declining mobility have led to an erosion of trust in the system. In a 2018 Gallup survey, only 45 percent of young adults said they supported capitalism. Fifty-one percent supported socialism.<br/>These numbers are stark, and so are the failures that underlie them, but history suggests that the failures can be addressed. Inequality has been high before, and American society found ways to reduce it; opportunity, too, can be widened by smart public choices. Fixing the system will not be easy, but we have the tools we need, if we can find the political will to use them.</p><p><br/>Capitalism faces another threat, however, and it may prove more fundamental: Americans' growing reliance on technologies-smartphones, social media, gaming consoles, shopping sites-that have become predatory and are quickly becoming more so. These gadgets and platforms have been integrated into nearly everything we do. Reaching for your phone to read a text, peruse your Instagram feed, or play a round of Candy Crush has become second nature, an involuntary response to even the shortest bout of boredom. This reliance-addiction is a better word for it-is undermining basic tenets of the American economic model.<br/>In a well-functioning market, consumers have the freedom to act in their own self-interest and to maximize their own well-being. Prices are transparent, and people have a basic level of trust that exchanges of goods, services, and money benefit all parties. Consumers, it is assumed, are discerning and rational in the face of the market's blandishments-an assumption that is crucial to the whole system's ability to produce social good. Of course, markets have never functioned in the real world exactly as they do in economics textbooks. But in the U.S., the system has tended to work, allocating resources efficiently, generating growth, and improving the living conditions and welfare of most people.<br/>But the new powers in the digital age have built their business models on strategies-enabled and turbocharged by self-improving algorithms-that actively undermine the principles that make capitalism a good deal for most people. Their aim is not merely to gain and retain customers, but to create a dependency on their products.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/?utm_source=feed\">From September 2017: Have smartphones destroyed a generation?</url>]<br/>Carmakers, appliance manufacturers, and cosmetics conglomerates have always been happy to prey upon their customers' desires and insecurities if doing so might stoke an irrational desire to buy their products. But their methods-advertising, primarily-are crude compared with the sophisticated tactics available to today's tech giants. The buzzes, badges, and streaks of social media; the personalized \"deals\" of commerce sites; the camaraderie and thrilling competition of gaming; the algorithmic precision of the recommendations on YouTube-all have been finely tuned to keep us coming back for more. And we are: The average person taps, types, swipes, and clicks on his smartphone 2,617 times a day. Ninety-three percent of people sleep with their devices within arm's reach. Seventy-five percent use them in the bathroom.<br/>The sway these technologies have over us is unhealthy, and the ways in which they can worsen our social relationships and our discourse are worthy subjects of public concern. But addiction to technology poses another threat, too. When we are too hooked on our phones and feeds to make decisions that align with our own self-interest, the free market ceases to be free.<br/>Where an affinity ends and addiction begins is not always clear, but when it comes to our relationships with technology, the signs of addiction are manifest. We are spending more and more hours online, forgoing time with loved ones. Deprived of a decent Wi-Fi connection, we grow irritable. We risk life and limb to send texts from the road. In a 2019 Common Sense Media survey of 500 parents, 45 percent confessed to feeling at least somewhat addicted to their phone. Among parents whose children had their own phone, 47 percent said they believed that their kids were addicted too.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/tech-experts-think-internet-ruining-democracy/606919/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Tech experts think the internet is ruining democracy</url>]<br/>Many technology companies engineer their products to be habit-forming. A generation of Silicon Valley executives trained at the Stanford Behavior Design Lab in the Orwellian art of manipulating the masses. The lab's founder, the experimental psychologist B. J. Fogg, has isolated the elements necessary to keep users of an app, a game, or a social network coming back for more. One former student, Nir Eyal, distilled the discipline in Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, an influential manual for developers. In it, he describes the benefits of enticements such as \"variable rewards\"-think of the rush of anticipation you experience as you wait for your Twitter feed to refresh, hoping to discover new likes and replies. Introducing such rewards to an app or a game, Eyal writes approvingly, \"suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while activating the parts associated with wanting and desire.\" Indeed, that brief lag between refresh and reveal is not Twitter crunching data-it's an intentional delay written into the code, designed to elicit the response Eyal describes.<br/>A growing chorus of critics is warning of the dangers inherent in such manipulation. Tristan Harris, a former technology designer at Google-and another former student of Fogg's-is a co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology. Harris has likened his iPhone to having \"a slot machine in my pocket,\" and indeed many of its features mimic those of the most addictive games on any casino floor.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-binge-breaker/501122/?utm_source=feed\">From November 2016: Tristan Harris believes Silicon Valley is addicting us to our phones. He's determined to make it stop.</url>]<br/>Harris has worked to reveal the tactics companies use to keep us hooked. On YouTube, for example, the auto-play function deprives viewers of a natural moment at which to disengage. But it's not just that the site keeps queuing up new clips for you to watch. YouTube's algorithms are designed to hold your interest by serving up content you can't resist, and the algorithms have gotten very good. As of 2017, users were watching a collective 1 billion hours of YouTube videos a day, more than 70 percent of which had been served to us in the form of algorithmic recommendations. Pause over that number for a moment: Nearly three-quarters of the YouTube videos we're watching have been fed to us.<br/>The advent of addiction as the business model of some of the country's largest companies-companies with which many Americans interact every day-has fundamentally shifted the balance of power between consumers and producers. This was not always the most likely outcome of the digital revolution. In many facets of our lives, technology has improved transparency and given potential buyers access to a wealth of information they previously lacked. In the analog age, a car shopper would have little more than the Kelley Blue Book-and his own time and willingness to kick tires-to guide him to the best deal. Some of us appreciate that the Instagram algorithm knows whether we are 16 or 60 and whether we prefer Timberland or Tory Burch, and markets to us accordingly.<br/>But the more reliant we become on a given app or platform, the more opportunities its makers have to observe our behavior-and the better they understand our behavior, the better they become at manipulating it to their own ends, whether their business model is serving ads or selling to us directly. It's a virtuous cycle for the producers, and a vicious one for the consumers. Often, we barely recognize that we're participating in it, because the barriers to participation are so low. Many of the most addictive platforms lure us in with the promise of a free service. But Snapchat, TikTok, and Twitch can be considered free only if we decide that our time, and the personal information we're providing, have no value.<br/>Digital life, we must remember, is still in its infancy, and the powers of the corporations that govern that life are still growing. Companies are studying what we search for, what nudges we respond to, and what times of day we engage in certain online behaviors. Soon, cameras and sensors will likely be tracking what frightens, amuses, and arouses us, allowing data collectors to know more about us than we perhaps even know about ourselves. (The Wall Street Journal has reported that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636\">popular iPhone apps that track users' heart rate and menstrual cycle were passing that information to Facebook</url>, though the social network denied using the information to its advantage.)<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/review-anna-wiener-uncanny-valley/603058/?utm_source=feed\">From January/February 2020: Inside tech's fever dream</url>]<br/>The suggestion that we need to be protected from such tactics might seem paternalistic, and if consumers were the rational actors who populate econ textbooks, it might be: A person could decide for herself whether to exchange some amount of privacy for the joy of viewing friends' photos or the convenience of tracking her heart rate. But the addiction economy relies on an asymmetrical exchange of information. Users are expected to blithely surrender their private information for access to services. The data collectors, meanwhile, fiercely guard their own privacy, typically refusing to disclose what information they have, whom they sell it to, and how they use it to manipulate our behavior.<br/>And they do, in fact, manipulate our behavior. As Harvard Business School's Shoshana Zuboff has noted, the ultimate goal of what she calls \"surveillance capitalism\" is to turn people into marionettes. In a recent New York Times essay, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html\">Zuboff pointed to the wild success of Pokmon Go</url>. Ostensibly a harmless game in which players use smartphones to stalk their neighborhoods for the eponymous cartoon creatures, the app relies on a system of rewards and punishments to herd players to McDonald's, Starbucks, and other stores that pay its developers for foot traffic. In the addiction economy, sellers can induce us to show up at their doorstep, whether they sell their wares from a website or a brick-and-mortar store. And if we're not quite in the mood to make a purchase? Well, they can manipulate that, too. As Zuboff noted in her essay, Facebook has boasted of its ability to subliminally alter our moods.<br/>The company has denied accusations that it uses this power to sell targeted ads; others, however, will surely take advantage of our vulnerabilities. Consider \"drunk shopping,\" a bad habit Americans have acquired in the age of the Buy It Now button: Various surveys have suggested that it is already a multibillion-dollar phenomenon. It's not difficult to imagine any number of technology platforms determining when we're likely to be tipsy-or discerning it from a slur in our speech or typos in our texts-and using that information to time their pitch.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/05/how-online-shopping-makes-suckers-of-us-all/521448/?utm_source=feed\">From May 2017: How online shopping makes suckers of us all</url>]<br/>Companies are also leveraging our reliance on them-and their knowledge of us-to get us to pay more for their products. By tracking our purchasing patterns (what we will shell out for an airline upgrade; how sensitive we are to surge pricing), they can make offers based on what each individual is willing to pay rather than what the market will bear. One study found that the price of headphones displayed in Google search results varied depending on users' web history, with prices going up-by a factor of four-when past searches suggested affluence. Another study, by the Brandeis economist Benjamin Reed Shiller, found that while a seller with access to basic demographic information about a specific buyer can gain 0.3 percent more profit than the market price would produce, a seller with access to an individual's browsing history can increase profit by 14.6 percent.<br/>Here, too, a fundamental benefit of capitalism is threatened. Traditionally, buyers have benefited from what economists call consumer surplus-the difference between what we would pay for a good and what sellers actually charge. With their newfound information advantage, sellers can retain far more of that surplus for themselves. Whether or not the average American understands the concept of consumer surplus, individualized pricing violates a sense of fairness: We've long assumed-but can assume no longer-that the price you pay is the price I pay.<br/>None of this is an argument against progress. Technology has helped create a world of convenience and abundance, and it will continue to do so. Properly channeled, it can improve the functioning of a market economy. But for society to harness technology's potential, we must understand how it is reshaping our lives.<br/><br/>In the past, we may not have entirely trusted General Motors or General Electric, but most people didn't believe they were warping our desires or robbing us of our time and agency. By contrast, the biggest, best-known companies in the contemporary American economy-Facebook, Amazon, Google-are now viewed with growing suspicion and mixed emotions. A Pew survey found that the percentage of Americans who think technology companies have a net positive impact on the country had fallen from 71 percent in 2015 to 50 percent in 2019. In part, such sentiments flow from the dawning realization that these and other tech behemoths have hooked us on their services in order to profit from us. But we're also beginning to recognize the scale of the time we've lost. We're dismayed with how we're spending our days, but feel powerless to abandon our new bad habits, as anyone who has deleted, then reinstalled, the Facebook app can attest.<br/>Will these discontents push people toward revolutionary backlash? Perhaps not. But that's almost beside the point. The capitalism that is taking shape in this century-predatory, manipulative, extremely effective at short-circuiting our rationality-is a different beast from the classical version taught in university classrooms. It cannot be regarded as beneficent and should not be given the benefit of the doubt. Profit motive and the means to create dependency is too dangerous a combination.<br/>American society has long treated habit-forming products differently from non-habit-forming ones. The government restricts the age at which people can buy cigarettes and alcohol, and dictates places where they can be consumed. Until recently, gambling was illegal in most places, and closely regulated. But Big Tech has largely been left alone to insinuate addictive, potentially harmful products into the daily lives of millions of Americans, including children, by giving them away for free and even posturing as if they are a social good. The most addictive new devices and apps may need to be put behind the counter, as it were-packaged with a stern warning about the dangers inherent in their use, and sold only to customers of age.<br/>Perhaps the most immediate and important change we can make is to introduce transparency-and thus, trust-to exchanges in the technological realm. At present, many of the products and services with the greatest power to manipulate us are \"free,\" in the sense that we don't pay to use them. But we are paying, in the form of giving up private data that we have not learned to properly value and that will be used in ways we don't fully understand. We should start paying for platforms like Facebook with our dollars, not our data.<br/>So far there is no better system than market-based capitalism to balance freedom, fairness, efficient allocation of goods, and growth.

The new game is to recreate using technology what the great traders, investors and bankers of the past used to carry in their heads \"\" a strong sense of who owned what, who wanted to buy, sell or issue what and how all that pent-up desire for action mapped against prevailing market conditions.Whether at banks, fintechs, trading platforms or technology companies, the new masters of the markets want to replace intangible market feel, intuition and creativity with machine learning; to ditch anecdotes and rely instead on data \"\" the bigger, the better.Artificial, not human, intelligence increasingly drives the bond and credit markets just as it does equity \"\" and so drives the cost at which governments, companies and people borrow money.Everyone in finance has to adapt. When Euromoney sits down with Ken Jacobs, chief executive of Lazard, we are expecting to talk about the great takeover battles of history. But even here, the talk is all about AI moving the markets through which the firm advises its clients how to tread.In February, Lazard announced the expansion of Lazard Asset Management's alternative investments platform with the addition of a new team, headed by Shaunak Khire and Trevor Mottl, that uses explainable AI (XAI).Before joining Lazard, Khire co-founded an AI company. Jacobs hasn't talked about this much and so Euromoney offers him the opportunity and an even greater challenge: can he explain AI to us?\"What is AI? To me, it is a series of tools to improve your ability to predict an outcome,\" he tells Euromoney. \"In financial markets, that outcome might be the performance of a stock or a basket over a set period relative to the S&amp;amp;P500 index.\"Jacobs says: \"We used to try to predict outcomes based on data in the public domain: cash flows, growth rates, earnings multiples, historic trading ranges. We could only work on what was available to us. But now AI is taking huge amounts of data and analyzing relationships that we cannot otherwise see, teaching itself in the process, and presenting an outcome \"\" a prediction that may lead to actions that are based on factors we may not have considered or can even see today.\"<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ken Jacobs, CEO of Lazard</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Jacobs is not the only senior banker Euromoney has talked to recently who hears echoes in what is happening from the wave of market activity first unleashed by the advent of computing power to analyze financial data back in the 1980s.Vikram Pandit, founder of Orogen and former chief executive of Citigroup, says that the advent of cloud computing today is a reminder of how the marginal cost of computing capacity and communications lurched down towards zero 20 years ago and led to the transformation of the cash equities business by algos and high-frequency trading.But self-learning machines are new.\"There is a reasonable probability that many of the buy and sell decisions being made in financial markets today are based on factors that algorithmic traders identify but are unknown to the users of these capabilities,\" says Jacobs.\"Explainable AI is the next step of identifying the invisible factors that the black box uses to make decisions. Ultimately, the question will be \"\" is the algorithm better alone or better with a human?\"This all comes as the bond markets continue adjusting to a post-crisis structure characterized by constrained dealer balance sheets relative to market size and customer needs, as well as a regulatory drive for more transparency that continually butts against the absence of a price tape and a central limit order book. It is a super-powerful tool that analyzes historic data in the context of how the markets are behaving right now -David Krein, MarketAxess Concerted central bank buying eased that adjustment, but markets have struggled to cope with its unwind: witness the disorder evident at the end of 2018. And the shrinking of the single-name credit default swap market since the crisis has made it harder for banks to hedge big risk positions taken on to accommodate customer flow.As one of the biggest bond trading platforms, MarketAxess has seen this change from an inside seat. It allied with BlackRock's Aladdin trading network back in 2013 as it promoted so-called open trading or all-to-all trading, in which asset managers trade not just with dealers responding to their request for quotes (RFQs) but also with each other, sometimes even providing liquidity to dealers themselves instead of the other way around.\"Historically, investors were reliant on dealers for price discovery,\" says Gareth Coltman, head of product management for Europe and Asia at MarketAxess. \"But with the availability of more data through Trace [Trade Reporting &amp;amp; Compliance Engine] in the US and Trax [the regulatory reporting and trade matching service] in Europe, investors can now do much more to independently price the liquidity that they themselves are increasingly providing to the market.\"The next step is to automate that provision, which requires a systematic way to ensure that pricing is consistent within a market context,\" he says.  Gareth Coltman, head of product management for Europe and Asia at MarketAxess And that takes us to Composite+, MarketAxess's pricing algorithm for corporate bonds, which its people call CP+ for short.This seeks to deliver a pre-trade reference for investors that will predict the clearing price for a bond by taking historic reported price data and combining it with real-time unstructured data \"\" such as indications of interest being streamed by dealers and RFQ responses sent by liquidity providers via the MarketAxess trading platform. It also extracts any other shreds of price information relevant to a particular bond that may be embedded within other sources such as CDS index prices.\"There is a huge universe of bond securities,\" says David Krein, head of research at MarketAxess. \"So even if the particular bond you would like to deal in may not have traded for several days \"\" which means pricing engines bound by hard rules to only take account of observed prices will not be much help \"\" indications of interest and the information content derived by machine learning from other instruments can provide an accurate pre-trade reference level.\"Others are trying to do similar things, offering structured and unstructured data to the self-teaching machines, including Overbond. There are obvious challenges: the infrequency of trading in many seasoned credit bonds being just one.DifferentThe fact is that there is no one price for any bond at any moment. Dealers will quote and transact at different levels for different sized lots in the same security \"\" tighter for regular institutional size trades of $2 million, wider for larger riskier trades above $5 million and for smaller ones of $150,000 that maybe look more trouble than they are worth.They may deal at different prices for different clients depending on those clients' importance to the bank.And investors themselves will have different price expectations given different priorities for any trade. They may accept some price slippage if their aim is just to get risk into or out of their portfolios as quickly as possible. Or they may instead take their time and optimize both spread \"\" sometimes dealing at the mid-price between bid and offer, sometimes even letting orders rest and capturing spread themselves \"\" and volume weighted average price.\"We have taken a very big-data approach with CP+,\" says Krein. \"It looks at every data point in the market and uses it as a potential input to the price of each individual security. Obviously when trying to price a bond, it helps to look at the most recent trades in that exact same security; then at other bonds from the same issuer; then at similarly rated issuers in the same sector. The further you go from the original security, the less relevant the information content becomes, but it is never zero. And even when the most proximate signals are missing, CP+ can learn to triangulate the less predictable features successfully.\" Managing across episodes is helped by experienced people picking up suddenly changing tones from conversations with key decision makers. I'm not convinced that artificial intelligence can do that -Lee Cumbes, Barclays The CP+ algorithm provides a two-way price for over 24,000 bonds. It recalibrates the model for pricing each of these bonds every night. The prediction engine continually learns by incorporating new historic price data and then collating incremental data through the trading day from actual transactions, indications of interest and other sources.It updates the two-way price for each security every 15 to 60 seconds: so it is not quite real time but as close as, especially for a bond that may not have traded for two weeks.\"The algorithm is self-learning,\" says Krein. \"We focus the calibration on institutional size dealer-to-client trades, but remember we put our predicted price out there pre-trade \"\" to provide a reference before we can know which clients will transact in what size and with what priorities.\"He makes an astonishing sounding claim: \"We continually compare our pricing predictions against every actual trade we then see come through Trace and Trax and find that the average difference is zero.\"Euromoney is aware that the \"average difference\" may hide some important variations, but still that sounds pretty impressive to us.Not everyone, however, is convinced about the power of AI to derive information hidden inside the iTraxx Crossover to predict the likely next price for an infrequently traded, unusual maturity bond from a little followed and infrequent corporate issuer.Euromoney calls in at Barclays to talk about the strong start to the year in debt capital markets, coming after the horrible secondary market selloff and near closure at the end of 2018.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Lee Cumbes, managing director and head</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">of public sector EMEA at Barclays</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"We are deriving historic pricing from years of central bank-supported markets with very constrained volatility,\" says Lee Cumbes, managing director and head of public sector EMEA at Barclays.\"I can tell you, as a practitioner, that in the fourth quarter of last year, predicting the price for your next deal off the last few could have led you to disaster. Investors who had previously been saying: \"~We need yield, we particularly like this name,' were suddenly saying: \"~Look, we're just done. We're not buying anything.'\"That hasn't persisted for long.Marco Baldini, head of European and Japan bond syndicate at Barclays, says: \"Fast forward to the start of this year and markets are open as never before and order books are quickly reaching record size.\"But it looks to me like issuance windows are going to snap open and shut in unpredictable ways, and that what we went through last November and December might return even though issuers, investors and bankers would all much rather the market wasn't so stop-start. It's a new primary market volatility, partly driven by lack of secondary liquidity, perhaps by automated stop-loss orders.\"Cumbes picks up the thread: \"Even if the stops don't last too long, managing across those episodes is helped by experienced people picking up suddenly changing tones from conversations with key decision makers. I'm not convinced that artificial intelligence can do that.\"It is a debate that will run for years, pitting the bankers promoting the art of the deal against the data scientists pitching big data and machine learning.Krein at MarketAxess sees the value of CP+ very differently.\"If markets are very volatile and a client is seeking to price an esoteric, rarely traded instrument, that's when it is extremely useful,\" he says. \"It is a super-powerful tool that analyzes historic data in the context of how the markets are behaving right now.\"It is important to remember that CP+ is not a trade execution algorithm. The advantage of a credible predicted price is that it provides a baseline against which to judge responses to RFQs. That baseline can also be embedded into buy-side order management systems to monitor trade execution desks' search for best execution. It gives investors a benchmark for review of responses to RFQs and enables subsequent automation of more trading.\"We can measure the average delta, or difference, between the CP+ price in typical $2 million lots and the additional cost for executing larger blocks of say $5 million to $20 million for bonds that may be less liquid or that may be on special,\" says Krein.That helps investors quantify some of the trade-offs around dealing in size and speed. Investors need to think whether it may be better to do large trades with a single dealer at a wide spread or split them and work them, which may reduce friction cost but could have a price impact.   David Krein, head of research at MarketAxess What is Krein seeing now in the credit markets?\"In the US investment grade market, the share of total market volume done in blocks seems to have come down slightly over the last 24 months, while the frequency of very large blocks is also lower than historical levels. And for anything done under block size, so below $5 million, I don't get the impression there is much risk of information leakage moving the price.\"Platforms like MarketAxess and banks like ING with Katana Lens are each seeking to provide technology tools for price discovery to the buy side.Are they going to come increasingly into competition?It's complicated.\"Banks, dealers, investors and alternative liquidity providers are all customers of CP+,\" says Coltman. \"Those with a sufficient technology capacity will seek to consume data from a variety of sources. Our unique selling point is that we have very large sets of data given our position as a leading trading platform and from Trax.\"IndependenceOne of the questions for banks as they seek to sell technology to clients, including to smaller banks, is the importance customers attach to the independence of key technology providers.You don't really want to buy from a direct competitor. How confident should you be taking software from \"\" or plugging into the risk management and price discovery systems of \"\" a bank that wants to sell you something those software packages may claim is cheap and good value or buy from you what they say is expensive and over-valued?The asset management industry provides some lessons. BlackRock developed its Aladdin trading network for its own trade execution desks first and then marketed it to other institutional investors that compete with it in the core business of managing money. BlackRock struggled to make much headway with these competitors until it folded its network into the MarketAxess all-to-all bond trading platform. We're not selling our technology as a standalone package. We seek to provide IT in combination with our market expertise and execution capability -Vittorio Nuti, Deutsche Bank Similarly, Alliance Bernstein developed Alfa, a fixed income data aggregation and market surveillance tool, for its own dealing desk but then sold it in May 2017 to Algomi, the creator of Honeycomb.Algomi Alfa provides cross-market information on liquidity and trade intent in order to give the buy side a real-time view of the whole bond market, including government bonds, investment grade, high yield, emerging market, municipal debt and structured credit.Many of the world's largest asset managers, particularly in the US, now use it, whereas some may have been reluctant to take it from Alliance Bernstein.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Usman Khan, co-founder and chief</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">technology officer of Algomi</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"Both among banks and asset managers we're seeing a desire to be much more data driven,\" says Usman Khan, co-founder and chief technology officer of Algomi.\"Banks have spent the past five years digitizing their internal stores of unstructured data \"\" not just transaction history but also prior indications of interest and RFQs received from investors that may not have led to trades \"\" and the question now is how to make best use of that.\"Algomi Alfa helps the buy side assimilate data from multiple trading venues together with their own data, such as indicated prices from the banks, prices they have previously paid and how new prices compare. This combination vastly enhances the data lake investors can access through APIs [application programme interfaces],\" he says. \"The precursor to deciding where to trade is having sufficient normalized data to identify the venue with the best price and also the best cost of trading.\"Algomi Alfa is not an execution platform. Banks have remained committed to market making in fixed income, turning over smaller dedicated balance sheets with much greater velocity rather than warehousing risk. The direction of travel is towards a more automated market \"\" albeit never as automated as equity \"\" with sell-side and buy-side algorithms that talk to each other and smart order routers that supply useful transaction cost analysis to asset managers' customers and to regulators.\"Asset managers can learn from how their own execution desks' algos have traded with various venues and start to distinguish liquidity and maybe put $5 million of a $20 million block through one venue, $5 million through another and perhaps $10 million through a third or a single dealer,\" says Khan. \"Buy-side algos can even automate negotiation of trades within certain tolerances.\"In the bond markets it is still not entirely clear how much of the over-the-counter market remains dark, with big banks crossing trades internally for different investors. But at the insistence of regulators, the market is lighting up, with at least post-trade reporting of blocks and, in Europe, even a requirement to disclose quotes received in response to an indication of interest.\"The top asset managers in the US love Algomi Alfa for the data lake and the market colour \"\" and there is strong demand in Europe,\" says Khan. \"In Europe, we'd like to integrate with the trading venues so that you can click a button on Algomi Alfa that opens up a trade on one of the venues.\"The banks that used to prioritize their single-dealer platforms are realizing that aggregators like Algomi are where they now need to provide their content and are good venues to meet the buy side.\"ChallengeFintechs of all types and size continue to challenge the banks, although in secret, Euromoney suspects, the biggest banks are not too alarmed.We talk to Samir Assaf, chief executive of global banking and markets at HSBC.\"Technology is just a tool to bridge issuers and investors,\" he says. \"Every five or 10 years there's a cycle of innovation, which is a challenge for banks \"\" and newcomers say the banks are finished. We saw it with the internet 20 years ago and we're seeing it with fintech today. But I'm not worried about fintechs. We will deal with them as clients and partners.\"He is worried about something else \"\" and it is not AI and machine learning.\"The difference today is the big established tech companies running in parallel to the big banks,\" he says. \"The whole world is a client of Amazon and Facebook. The banks' clients are all on their platforms: that is a potential challenge we banks have not seen before.\"But it is a challenge for the big tech companies as well. What do they want to do in banking? What might they be allowed to do? If they want to compete, they may face constraints. And what impact might it have on their stock prices. Amazon's market cap is huge, more than five times that of HSBC, but its profit is a fifth of ours while its price-to-earnings ratio is a multiple of ours.\"FICCSo, perhaps, that takes us back for one last crack at the question: can banks provide technology to customers? They are spending enough on it, after all.Inside fixed income, currencies and commodities divisions, the path to bank-developed in-house trading technology being provided to customers has been trodden before, by FX dealers.It is five years since Barclays, a technology pioneer through its Barx system, developed Gator, an aggregator tool for its own FX dealers to test the ability to successfully execute trades in an increasingly fragmented FX market with 50 or more electronic communication networks all displaying prices, which often proved to be phantom liquidity.Behind the advertised prices were often the same few liquidity providers and they could withdraw on last look. By constantly testing each venue with large and small trades Barclays became confident in its own traders' ability to work orders across multiple venues, splitting them to achieve best price. It then, after considerable internal debate, chose to provide the same tool to its customers.FX has developed closer to equities than bonds. Voice trading gave way to tech firms 20 years ago to build an array of complex market making engines.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Vittorio Nuti,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deutsche Bank</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>\"The FX market is now so quant-driven that it is often hard to decipher trends in a digestible format,\" says Vittorio Nuti, head of algo and segregated execution at Deutsche Bank. \"Every end customer wants to be able to do large volumes immediately at zero spread, but only very rarely is that actually possible.</p><p>\"We are developing apps that give a real-time quantitative view of the market, like volumes or impacts. We aim to exemplify through our pre-trade tools the trade-offs customers might consider on speed, price and spread. Those tools empower customers to decide when they should execute a trade and how they should execute it.\"</p><p>Its position as a leading market maker in FX has given Deutsche the building blocks on which to base this technology.</p><p>\"The quality of data is the crucial problem,\" says Nuti. \"Given our strong history in FX, we have created market-making engines to provide prices to our clients, enabling us to perfect our data quality and modelling, with which other banks and technology vendors may not be so well equipped.\"</p><p>And the bank is not just a data warehouse, it is also a centre of IT development.</p><p>\"Some of the tech we use in FX originated on the rates side,\" says Nuti. \"We have a central IT support staff that ensures consistency in tech development and enables re-use.\"</p><p>And how does Deutsche get paid for providing technology first developed for internal users to clients of the bank? After all, this technology, such as its new FX market-colour app within Autobahn, takes a lot of development and quantitative analysis.</p><p>\"Our return is in volume,\" says Nuti, \"while in the algo business we charge a fee. Clients need to have transparency on what they are paying for and how they are paying for it.\"</p><p>So, what of the role of banks as pure technology providers?</p><p>\"I think some banks may be tempted to try what Goldman did with Redi,\" says Nuti.</p><p>This was the equity execution management system Goldman Sachs first acquired from Spear, Leeds &amp;amp; Kellogg in 2000 and then built up over the next 13 years into a leading single-dealer platform, across which hedge funds and other investors accessed its order execution algorithms.</p><p>But the tide turned against single-dealer platforms and Goldman first sounded out other banks to take stakes and then spun Redi off in 2013. Thomson Reuters bought it in 2017.</p><p>\"We're not selling our technology as a standalone package,\" says Nuti. \"We seek to provide IT in combination with our market expertise and execution capability.\"</p><p>For now, banks' provision of financial services and associated enabling technology remains bundled. But regulators are pushing them to unbundle, market structures are changing and the banks' own search for new revenues in recompense for their hefty tech investments may yet take them in surprising directions.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1dwnrt2dzbv8b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0K-MBB1-JD1P-T4TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009Y2A</classCode><className>ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000360</classCode><className>COMPUTER TRADING SYSTEMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X6T</classCode><className>DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp;

Good morning, everyone, happy Tuesday to you. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, July, 30th. Your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Major data breach, Capital One hacked, affecting more than 100 million customers, what you need to know, coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the world is waiting on the Federal Reserve, day one of the two-day meeting they one of the two-day meeting, kicking off today. Investors are waiting for it a rate cut tomorrow, more on what to expect, and an impact on markets, coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S.-China trade talks are resuming this week. Negotiations getting a new way today in Shanghai, as U.S. companies continue to express concern over tariffs.</p><p>And then round two of the Democratic debates beginning tonight, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the top two candidates to watch. The big issues expected to take the spotlight and who has the most to lose, coming up.</p><p>Plus, Beyond Meat shares are plunging this morning, even though sales are up, find out why, right now. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>All right, we've got a big show this Tuesday morning. Joining the conversation this morning, FOX News contributor and columnist with the Hill, Liz Peek is here. The editor-in-chief of the Daily Caller, Christopher Bedford is here, along with the Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes, great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, big week, in fact. We've got the Democratic debates, we've got the Federal Reserve, we've got the PMIs coming out, Purchasing Managers' Index, which is where we first saw that weakness in the economy.</p><p>FORBES: The thing to watch for, though, is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: -- Hong Kong. You know these trade talks are supposedly separate. If you get a bad situation in Hong Kong, that's going to affect the trade negotiations and a lot of other things as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm so glad you brought that out. I had Jimmy Lai on about a week and a half ago, and he was so adamant in terms of -- if this extradition bill goes through, it's the end of Hong Kong.</p><p>FORBES: It is. But the demonstrators also realize that Beijing has been engaged in step-by-step, trying to squeeze Hong Kong more and more. They don't have the ability to go to Vancouver or other places around the world. This is it for them. So, there's a desperation there that could lead to something that is not going to be good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and what I also think is important to notice is (INAUDIBLE) a lot of young people coming out.</p><p>FORBES: Yes. Well, there's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's who the protesters are. They see their future, you know, threatened by all of this.</p><p>FORBES: Absolutely. And they don't have a place to go. This is it for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The question is, does Xi Jinping really feel threatened by this affront to Beijing's power. And, I think, to your point, the trade agreement certainly are the trade talks where they are going to be, somewhat, influenced by that.</p><p>But I was on her show last night with Gordon Chang, you know, he thinks this is completely unlike 2015. This is a really serious pressure point for Beijing administration. That -- I think that's pretty serious. And to your point, Maria, it's a different crowd coming out. It feels very different in terms of the crowd, the way they're behaving, et cetera. So, I think, it's a really significant deal.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER: But it's still direct action against one of the most powerful chairman since Mao, and I would -- it's a very dangerous proposition to be on the frontlines of those protests.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We've got a lot to talk about including that this morning. Joining the conversation, former White House trade official and Akin Gump partner, Clete Willems is with us this morning. CoreCivic president and CEO, U.S. Immigration Detention Center CEO, Damon Hininger is here as well.</p><p>Former president -- Pennsylvania governor, rather, pardon me, is here and the Special Counsel of Ballard Spahr, former DNC Chairman Ed Rendell, joining the conversation this morning.</p><p>Along with Wyoming senator, Senate Republican Conference chair and member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Energy Committee, John Barrasso joining us this morning, along with former assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs, former assistant secretary under Steven Mnuchin, Tony Sayegh, joining us as well.</p><p>Big show ahead, don't miss a moment of it. This three hours, coming up.</p><p>And our top story this hour is the massive Capital One data breach. A hacker stole personal information, addresses, dates of birth, income, on more than 100 million customers at one of the country's largest banks. Police in Seattle said the suspect, Paige Thompson, is a software engineer who reportedly used to work for Amazon, another major breach, Liz.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, well, and we know from the Equifax history now, that there actually is a penalty for this. So, look, I think that these breaches, they have become regular events with these companies. Companies have got to get smarter, they've got to get tougher and every single company in America is now under the gun to protect the data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, normally --</p><p>FORBES: Amazing thing is how could one person --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was just going to say that. I was just going to say that normally, you see the bad actors, Russia, China, people we don't know, but we know that it's somebody in Russia and China. But this is an American citizen?</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One person decided that they wanted to get all of these address, what does this person going to do with it?</p><p>PEEK: Sell it.</p><p>FORBES: Probably sell it.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: Remember when Snowden took some of our greatest intelligence secrets and gave them abroad. Now, before, they've -- Amazon blamed cloud hacks and company mistakes. They did that with Uber. They did that with Time Warner.</p><p>But this one seems like it's going to be pretty difficult to blame on just internal problems when they've got one of their own former engineers who's involved in this hack. And like you said, a single person able to take all of this data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. All right, all eyes on the Federal Reserve, obviously, big week this week. We've got day one of the two-day meeting beginning today, with the Central Bank widely expected to announce a rate cut. The rate cut tomorrow, that would be the first one in nearly a decade.</p><p>Steve, we're all talking about how great the economy is, and yet, we're talking about 25-basis-point cut today, and perhaps, another one, maybe even 50-basis-points, what do you make of all of this?</p><p>FORBES: The Fed is floundering. It overdid it last year, said they're going to have three or four rate increases this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Did a total reversal in December or January. And they, sort of, promised, oh, we're going to get a rate cut, so they can't back off from it, if it's -- they'll do 25-basis-points, but if they don't -- the question is, what do they do afterwards?</p><p>And they shouldn't even be in the business of doing interest rates manipulation in the first place, its price control. The idea that they can precisely influence the economy is preposterous, destructive, and that, sort of, the credit markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love the op-ed in the Journal this morning. The title is, The Confusing Federal Reserve, and this is my favorite line, on the available evidence, the Fed is making a policy on the fly.</p><p>FORBES: Well, that's a polite way to put it. They don't know what they're doing. And the reversals and, you know, the president goes after him and they say, oh, data change, we're going to back off.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: I mean, it's not confidence building.</p><p>PEEK: That data that changed is at seven hikes, actually had an impact on the economy began to slow things down. I mean, I think the mistake was last year, not this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Definitely.</p><p>PEEK: And, you know, if President Trump was talking about that, a lot of us were talking about that, that, you know, the situation overseas really should have been taken into account, and I think that's what they're doing now. Because the truth is, in Europe, they can't get out of their own way. Europe growth rate has stagnated again. And I think that is what the Federal Reserve is looking at now.</p><p>FORBES: Well, this gets us something very important and that is, in Europe, and in a little bit in this country. It is structural problems that impede growth not the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank. Europe is right with labor laws, high taxes. And in this country, the overhang on trade has started and has an impact.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, at this point, the Federal Reserve has to keep step with some of these Central Banks around the world (INAUDIBLE) you got Europe trying to stimulate. You got Asian Central Banks trying to stimulate. That's the -- that's the consensus from money managers out there who say, OK, well, maybe the economy isn't necessarily in need of a rate cut, but the rest of the world is impacting our dollar.</p><p>FORBES: Fed should let the interest rates float. Let the markets set the rates. They do in the treasury market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see. I think there's 80 percent chance that we are going to see 25-basis-points today -- tomorrow, rather. 2020 Democratic hopefuls, ready to take the stage tonight in Detroit, senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the big names to watch. Chris, what are you going to be looking for tonight on that stage?</p><p>BEDFORD: Warren versus Sanders. I'm not expecting too many fireworks. So, I think, one of the big things that you're going to see for the last time, tonight, most likely in any debate, is John Hickenlooper, Tim Ryan, John Delaney, Marianne Williamson, and a couple of these folks because this is the last debate where you can have -- be under two percent and still be competing in the national stage.</p><p>I don't think that many of them are going to make that big, big splash. Also, Pete Buttigieg, it's his -- maybe his moment to try and overcome. He's doing better in New Hampshire and Iowa than his national polls, but he still has to try and push himself apart from both Sanders and Warren. And Warren and Sanders are neck and neck in the first states and nationally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And then -- and then tomorrow night, we'll see what Kamala Harris has to say --</p><p>BEDFORD: Versus Joe Biden.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- after she took on Joe Biden.</p><p>PEEK: And Cory Booker.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Cory Booker.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, standing on either side of Joe Biden. It's going to be an interesting pincer movement.</p><p>BEDFORD: Biden and Harris.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: Those are two of the big names that aren't on the stage right now because they are -- Harris is sailing and Biden is the colossus.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll see if any of this moves markets in the next couple of days. Meanwhile, we're watching Apple this morning. Apple in focus, technology giant is reporting third quarter earnings after the bell tonight. It is expected that the earnings will be $2.10 a share, revenue of just over $53 billion. Stock is at 208 and change, Steve Forbes, down this morning, your expectations here?</p><p>FORBES: I think they'll be OK, but the fact is, they are depending on dividends and stock buybacks to really goose that stock. I think investors going to look, what's the big thing for the future? That's what he's going to reveal, more than the earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: What is the future of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Particularly, given this China fight.</p><p>FORBES: You bet, and the fact that they're not going to get any exemption in terms of tariffs, given the political standing of the fangs in Washington, forget it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No exemptions. And you know this neck tranche of $325 billion if the president puts tariffs on that. Apple's going to see a major impact.</p><p>FORBES: They're not going to be the only ones. We're all going to feel that one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll all feel that. All right, we will talk about all of that. Then, of course, this is the post-Mueller last week and, of course, the border fight. But when we come back, we're going to take a look at China. The trade is in focus, negotiations picking up today in Shanghai, what's at stake for U.S. companies as this China-U.S. debacle goes on, still concerned about tariffs, coming up.</p><p>Then, soaring beyond, Beyond Meat sales skyrocketed, but the stock is struggling this morning, it's down 12-1/2 percent. We'll tell you what the problem is when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Police are still looking for answers this morning, days after the deadly shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, Cheryl Casone with headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. Investigators are searching the 19-year-old gunman's vehicle and his home as they search for any kind of motive. The suspect, Santino William Legan had criticized the festival on social media before the shooting.</p><p>Sunday's mass shooting left 3 dead and 15 others wounded, the community remembering the victims with a vigil outside of Gilroy's City Hall where police were praised for their quick response. Officers shot and killed the gunman who purchased his weapon while in Las Vegas.</p><p>Well, some big shake ups at ride-sharing companies, as pressure is mounting from Wall Street. Uber says it is cutting one-third of its marketing department, that's about 400 jobs. And then Lyft, their chief operating officer, Jon McNeill, a former Tesla executive, we should add, is leaving. His roles are being spread out to other executives.</p><p>Beyond Meat shares, sharply lower in the premarket, down almost 12-1/2 right now, this as extending losses from yesterday. They announced plans for another stock offering just three months after the IPO. Beyond Meat wants to sell an additional 3.25 million shares in the secondary offering, the company posting mixed second quarter results.</p><p>They had a loss of 0.24 cents per share, but revenue nearly quadrupled to $67.3 million dollars. That did beat the estimate. But as you know, Maria, so much excitement over the IPO, earlier this year, now the pressure is on to deliver to Wall Street.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and both of them. There is Beyond Meat and then there's Impossible Meat.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, there's Impossible Burger, yes. So, it's becoming a very crowded field, popular, but crowded.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Cheryl, thank you. We'll take a break, when we come back, China trade talks are resuming this week. U.S. officials are in Shanghai now for the latest round of negotiations. We're going to check on what is on tap there, see if it is going to have an impact.</p><p>Then, puppies and prosecco, we will tell you about a hotel package, that's the dream for any dog lover. This, as we're waiting Eli Lilly earnings, all that, right after this, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. U.S.-China trade in focus this week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, in Shanghai today, with the latest round of negotiations. Expectations are set to be low after talks between the two sides broke down back in May.</p><p>Joining us right now is former White House trade official and Akin Gump partner, Clete Willems, Clete, it's good to have you on the program back with us, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>CLETE WILLEMS, PARTNER, AKIN GUMP: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think we're going to get a deal with China?</p><p>WILLEMS: I think we'll eventually get a deal, but I think it's going to take a while. And, you know, expectations are low for this week and that makes sense, you know, the two sides haven't talked for a while. And what they really need to do is feel each other out, and figure out what is the baseline, moving forward?</p><p>What worries me, though, about a deal, is if China isn't going to go back to where we were in May, the U.S. has a packed agenda. We've got USMCA, we've got Japan, we've got the E.U., we've got the WTO reform, and if China isn't going to go back to where we need them to be, I think you're going to see U.S. attention diverted elsewhere.</p><p>But I'm going to come back to this and say, we still get a deal because I think the politics for it are right. There's a lot of chatter out there. People saying, oh, the president doesn't really need a deal because he can show that he's tough going to the election, and I don't buy that.</p><p>If he can show that he's the dealmaker and chief, if he can get a deal that really moves the ball on these structural issues, that's the place where the U.S. wants to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but that's the question. Will it move on the structural issues, Steve? I mean, the Chinese walked away from things like, putting into law, you're not allowed to cheat and steal I.P. from the west. They reneged on that.</p><p>FORBES: Well, that gets to the whole thing, does China want a deal? Does -- do they really want one? Doesn't look like it. They may think they can wait President Trump out. What do you think, Clete?</p><p>WILLEMS: I hear that coming from China, but I don't think it reflects reality. Let's talk about this for a second. If you look at China, you're seeing stories every day of companies starting to move their supply chains out of there. And that's something that China doesn't want to see happen.</p><p>You have the CICC, a major China investment bank, just a couple of days ago, released a report saying that this trade dispute has cost China over 2 million jobs in the industrial sector. And so, even though China, a couple weeks ago now, reporting the lowest GDP number they've reported in 25 years.</p><p>And I know that some of those books are cooked, but the fact that they were going out there and saying it's as low as it has been in 25 years, tells you something. So, I do think that they are in a position where they do need a deal.</p><p>And I do think that once we get back to the table -- that they're going to hopefully show some flexibility so that we can get to yes, because ultimately, I think this will benefit both sides. And that's why I'm going to stay optimistic even if that's not the conventional wisdom at the moment.</p><p>FORBES: Is China pursuing alternative strategy as well, of trying to do a free trade deal without the United States in the area, tying those countries even more to Beijing and cutting us out?</p><p>WILLEMS: No, of course. That is absolutely part of their strategy. There's a whole series of negotiations that are involved with the one that most people are familiar with, it's called the ARSAP, where they're basically trying to lower tariffs with about 15 or 16 countries in the region.</p><p>So, you are going to see them pursuing that to try to show they don't need a deal with the U.S. But like I said, I do think this is hurting them, and ultimately, they will have to come back to the table and make some -- make some moves.</p><p>PEEK: You talked about -- Clete, good morning. You talked about the slowdown in GDP growth in China. Some people think that, in fact, it's much worse than that. And you do read almost every day about countries -- companies going bankrupt in China. What's your read of the actual economic situation there?</p><p>WILLEMS: Well, I think that they're holding on right now, but the reason they're holding on is because they're pumping a lot of bad credit --</p><p>PEEK: Right.</p><p>WILLEMS: -- into the market. And I don't -- that can't last forever. Most of the real serious economists that I talk to, say that, you know, this is a little bit of a -- I don't know, of a sugar high, is the right way to describe it, but this is certainly a temporary fix for them.</p><p>So, I don't think they are quite yet in desperate straits, but at some point, they're going to run out of those bullets. They're going to run out the ability to pump credit into their market and they're going to have a real problem. And they're going to need a deal before that happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your take on USMCA, Clete? Trade Representative Lighthizer and House Democrats have already met four times, apparently, to talk about the proposed agreement with Canada and Mexico, most recently, this past Friday. Both sides are saying that they are making progress, but some House Democrats are aiming for a vote before the end of the year.</p><p>It's up to Nancy Pelosi. How do you see it?</p><p>WILLEMS: Well, this -- there has never been an agreement more deserving of bipartisan support. You know, Ambassador Lighthizer and the Trump administration did a great job here of drafting an agreement that's going to create a lot of jobs in the U.S., in particular in the U.S. auto sector.</p><p>But, also, that hits the key Democratic priorities for years, things like labor, things like environment, things like currency. Now, I've heard good vibes coming out of the talks between Lighthizer and Pelosi where they're trying to, you know, enhance some these elements of the deal. And I think that, ultimately, they're going to get there in the fall.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>WILLEMS: A lot of people say, politically, they're never going to give the president a win. But, look, we just had a deal last week on the budget, so these sides can work together when it's in their mutual interests.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So, you -- so, you think it comes to the floor in the fall. We'll be -- if it doesn't come to the floor in the fall, this is going to have big problems, because if you can't make a trade deal with your friends, I mean, what about the other trade deals we're talking about.</p><p>WILLEMS: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chris Bedford, jump in here because we want to talk 2020 and trade. Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, rolls out her trade policy plan.</p><p>Before endorsing any deal, the Democratic hopeful says she'd require negotiators to invite labor and environmental groups to trade advisory committees and require the U.S. International Trade Commission to analyze how the deal would affect the entire country.</p><p>Clete, let's get Chris' thoughts on this, and then please, yours as well.</p><p>WILLEMS: Sure.</p><p>BEDFORD: Well, it's just a classic far-left trade plan, which is, the people I want at this table are international bodies, environmentalists, and union activists. Those are not typically the folks that should be at the front. Though, often those things ought to be considered.</p><p>And when the president, right now, is really focused on America first and focused on jobs and manufacturing in this country, and instead, the focus over here, is on environmentalism and on the Green New Deal and on extensions of that.</p><p>That's a stunning contrast. And one that -- she falls into the example of someone who would not want to see President Trump's trade deal pass, because she rather have her own.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I feel like they have to do that because if they talk about the economy, it's all happy talk.</p><p>BEDFORD: And how do the environmentalists and labor guys get along anymore? They're at each other's throats. The environmentalists are trying to shut down work -- public works projects all over the country. That coalition is becoming more and more difficult to hold together every day.</p><p>FORBES: That could be a prime issue for Donald Trump in 2020. Why does is it take 10 years to do a highway, where you could do it in 2 years? What are all the obstacles? Well, we know what it is, all of these regulatory reviews that are absolutely unnecessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's why he came out with that big, you know, pomp and circumstance when he cut all the regulations. Remember that, with the piles and piles of regulations. Clete, real quick on that 2020 and Elizabeth Warren's plans here.</p><p>WILLEMS: Right. So, I mean, the fact that labor and environment are in there, I mean, that's traditional Democratic policy, so I'm not surprised by that. What was troubling to me was just the way that it was brought in and this notion that, oh, if you're not up party to the Paris agreement --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>WILLEMS: -- we can't do a trade talk with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WILLEMS: That means we're not, you know, it's going to be really hard for us to do deals and further, I think it's really was just an attack on corporations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WILLEMS: You know, corporations are businesses --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That makes sense.</p><p>WILLEMS: -- that apply millions of Americans and I don't think that's the way to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Clete, thank you so much.</p><p>WILLEMS: We should be opening up markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Clete Willems --</p><p>WILLEMS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- it's great to see you this morning, thank you. Eli Lilly just posted quarterly earnings. Let's go back to Ashley Webster with the number, Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK BUSINESS NEWS JOURNALIST: Yes, our first blush, Maria good morning, looks pretty good. Let's get right to it. Earnings per share for Eli Lilly coming in at $1.50, beating the estimate by 0.5 cents, revenue up 5.64 billion, that also beats revenue estimates of 5.59, also raising its guidance for the rest of the year in 2019, that's good.</p><p>The big drop for Eli Lilly is Trulicity. This is a once a week injection treatment for Type II diabetes, that bringing in just over $1 billion in the quarter. This is a company, of course, that has also Cialis, Methadone, Prozac, all of those drugs.</p><p>And overall, you should see this stock moving up about half a percent in the premarket. So, pretty good report from Eli Lilly, and most importantly, raising its guidance, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. And then one of the stories -- top stories in the Journal this morning, is corporate profits proving to be more resilient than expected.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Allaying some investor anxieties. We were expecting a down quarter in terms of S&amp;P profits, looks like it's going to be flat to up, Ashley, overall.</p><p>WEBSTER: I think so, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WEBSTER: Much better than expected.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Ashley, thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a short break. When we come back, all eyes on the Federal Reserve this week, it is day one of a high stakes two-day meeting that could end with a crucial decision about interest rates. We're taking a look, examining all of that when we come back.</p><p>And then officers, hacked, Los Angeles city computers, compromised, exposing important data, more on all of that right after this, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Tuesday. It is Tuesday, July 30th.</p><p>Your top stories right now. 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast. The world is waiting on the Federal Reserve. It is day one of a two-day meeting today. Kicking off, this two-day meeting, investors are waiting fora rate cut tomorrow.</p><p>More on what to expect, we are expecting a quarter-point cut when the Fed announces that tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. Futures this morning are lower headed into the meeting. Take a look at markets where we are expecting a lower opening to the broader averages.</p><p>Dow Futures down 55 points, S&amp;P Futures down 7-1/4, and the Nasdaq Futures lowered by 30. This on top of a mixed bag yesterday with the Dow up on the session. And the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P lower as investors weighed out this Fed decision.</p><p>Dow Industrials yesterday up 28 points, the Nasdaq was lower by 36. We're just getting earnings from Xerox and we are looking at revenue a miss but earnings a beat. We'll get that -- get to that in a second.</p><p>Global markets this morning, meanwhile, look like this. European Indices are mixed with the FT-100 up four points, the CAC Quarante down 42, and the DAX Index in Germany, taking a tough hit, down 1.3 percent that's 172 points lower, in Germany.</p><p>Some economic data there that will tell you about coming up.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were higher on trade hopes. We are also looking at the Bank of Japan, announcing it is leaving monetary policy unchanged, keeping extremely low rates through, at least, the spring of 2020, the BOJ meeting to having the Nikkei average up half a percent.</p><p>Another big day for earnings, Dow Components Merck and Procter &amp; Gamble out later this morning before the open. We'll have all the numbers.</p><p>Then, after the close tonight, Apple, we'll take a look at what to expect before the announcements on Apple this morning.</p><p>Plus, this LAPD data breach. Personal information from thousands of officers and applicants exposed.</p><p>Then, a puppy party. One hotel will bring a bunch of furry friends to your room along with the other treats for you to enjoy. What a perk. All those details coming up this morning. Hotel puppy party.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half-an-hour. Federal Reserve is in focus this week. Fed Chairman Jay Powell is expected to announce the first interest rate cut in more than a decade.</p><p>First one since 2008, we're expecting that tomorrow. The move is coming as the United States is experiencing record-low unemployment and solid economic growth, 2.1 percent last week from the GDP.</p><p>The president tweeted this yesterday. Slamming the Fed for raising rates in the first place. Joining me right now is National Holdings Corporation chief market strategist Art Hogan. And Art, that's the dilemma, isn't it? The economy is doing well, 51-year low on unemployment, growth, the 2.1 percent in the second quarter on top of 3.1 percent of the first quarter. So, what am I talking about a rate cut for?</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION: Well, you know it's interesting. The Fed is really struggling with what the neutral rates should be and I think they're struggling with that because inflation has been looking so low for so long.</p><p>So, finding what the new normal is, and the Phillips curve seems to be broken or, at least, not as effective. We've got very, very low unemployment, and yet, we're not seeing significant wage-price pressure and not seeing a big push up at inflation.</p><p>So, I think the Fed looks at this and says, you know what? What we thought was normal for the last couple of years is probably a little bit too high. We need to back that off a little bit. And also, at the same time, the economy around the globe is slowing a little bit, let's get out in front of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but I mentioned this op-ed in the Journal earlier. And the editorial board writes this, this morning in the Wall Street Journal. \"The Confusing Federal Reserve.\" In it, they write this. \"On the available evidence, the Fed is making up policy on-the-fly. Chairman Jay Powell likes to say the Fed's decisions are data-dependent, but to us, it looks more like the Central Bank is dependent on no particular data at all.</p><p>This contributes to the suspicion in markets that the Fed is really trying to accommodate Mr. Trump's public demands for rate cuts. We'd like to think that's not true, and it's dangerous for the Feds credibility if it is.\" What do you think about that?</p><p>HOGAN: It's interesting. So, this Fed since December has gone from being an autopilot and hawkish. We're going to raise rates three times, this year probably. Here to wind down the balance sheet to a certain level.</p><p>And then they became patient, and what happened? What changed it between? Was really a slowdown of global economic activity? China's GDP rate coming in from eight percent to six percent. We're seeing all sorts of signs that the global economy is slowing. Now, is that one of our mandates? No. But can that show up on our shores? Probably.</p><p>I think the other thing that has really changed is, in the entire 10 years that the Fed has been low on interest rates, we've seen no real inflation push. And that's that come under. What has happened to inflation? And what drives that higher?</p><p>Now, I agree that all of the data that they've seen since we've become dovish and probably we'll cut in at the meetings tomorrow has been better. We've seen a better jobs number, better jobless claims number, durable goods, retail sales, across the board, the data has been better.</p><p>At the same time, what is going on around us, right? What is it that, you know, that could happen and end up -- end up on our shores? And that's a slower global economy, and I think that's what their concern.</p><p>Let's get out in front of this because we don't have that many bullets to shoot, so let's take one now.</p><p>PEEK: You're applause, there was just a little take up at inflation. Or I mean, it didn't -- it didn't last long and apparently, it's already gone. I did think it was very sort of generous of Janet Yellen to come out in favor of a rate cut which, you know, that sort of gave you a bipartisan flavor -- it's not just about Trump, it just perhaps, the right thing to do.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, and I think -- I think that, that crew sticks together a little bit too. So, I think when you, you know --</p><p>PEEK: Right.</p><p>HOGAN: Jay-Powell and Janet Yellen work together for a long time, they have a lot of respect for each other.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>HOGAN: Janet Yellen can make the case. But, you know, I think you made the case for anything. The tricky part is, you know, are we actually using some of our ammunition now that we may need later, and why are we using it now if, in fact, the economy seems to be fine.</p><p>Unemployment extreme -- you know, a 50-year low in unemployment. The consumer -- the conundrum is, the consumer is actually doing pretty well. The corporates not doing as well. So, when you look at this earnings season, it's been all about the consumer, consumer-facing companies have done better. But, manufacturing and business-facing companies just haven't done as well, and perhaps, that's where the concern is.</p><p>PEEK: And housing.</p><p>HOGAN: And housing all very, very true. Housing (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>PEEK: That's also a weak, weak point, which -- you know, maybe this helps a little bit on the mortgage rate, who knows? But --</p><p>HOGAN: Right, right. Lower mortgage rates that certainly haven't changed that dynamic. It's an inventory shuffle, it's really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: That's not -- I mean --</p><p>FORBES: Are -- why -- what is the Federal Reserve still worship the Phillips curve which (INAUDIBLE) president for decades?</p><p>HOGAN: Absolutely. It's actually -- that's it's been dead and dying for a couple of decades now. And the problem with that is then, what is it the address policy after that? If not for that, how do we -- how do we figure out what full employment is right now?</p><p>FORBES: Why should the Fed be trying to do that in the first place?</p><p>HOGAN: Right, do you -- we bring up a good point, but they've got two mandates, and one of them is employment. They have to have some barometer --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: Some -- yes, but sometimes if you leave the economy alone, it would on its own.</p><p>HOGAN: Right, right.</p><p>FORBES: Seem the regulation of the tax cuts have done. That's had nothing to do at this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOGAN: It seems to be the case for the last, the last couple of years, seem that it seems to be the case. But then, and I think that's what Central Banks are struggling with its globally too, we're not alone in this. It's not as though we're the only country that's looking at this and saying, we've gotten the wrong about inflation.</p><p>But remember, when this started eight years ago, everyone was saying the other things, it was like you can't have rates that this low, we'll have rampant inflation, and that never happens. So, I think we're all --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: All because they made it impossible for banks to lend.</p><p>HOGAN: Right.</p><p>FORBES: You had 50,000 compliance officers suddenly appearing on the scene.</p><p>HOGAN: Right, absolutely, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would you put new money in stocks today? Would you -- would you buy this marketer?</p><p>HOGAN: I would buy this marketer, oh, absolutely. But, you know, understand at a near new all-time high is in the middle of a catalyst filled week like we have right now. I don't know that this is the time to do.</p><p>We never actually advocate making big changes around earning season because there's a lot of volatility that tends to settle that stuff out. In a week or two, you know, even if we're here or higher, I think this market is in - - is in very good shape. And the alternatives around the planet and certainly around the asset classes don't look that good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Art, it's great to see you.</p><p>HOGAN: Good to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Art Hogan, with the latest there. Be sure to tune in to our special coverage this week on the Fed decision, that's tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. here on FOX Business.</p><p>I'll be joining my colleagues to talk about the Federal Reserve's moves. That's tomorrow, 2:00 p.m. I'll join Charles Payne and his guests tomorrow.</p><p>Meanwhile, presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard is suing Google for temporarily suspending her campaign ads. Cheryl Casone with that and headlines now. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right, Maria. The Hawaiian congresswoman and 2020 hopeful says that she was the most searched Democratic candidate after the first debate. Gabbard told our Tucker Carlson that if Google can censor her, they can censor anyone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TULSI GABBARD (D-HI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is really about the unchecked power that these big tech monopolies have over our public discourse. And how this is a real threat to our freedom of speech and to our fair elections. We all have to stand, united, to protect our freedom of speech because look, today, it's me, tomorrow, it could be you or someone else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, Gabbard claims that the tech giant is interfering in our elections with secret algorithms to regulate certain voices.</p><p>This network has lost 31,000 satellite T.V. and sling T.V. subscribers for the second quarter. But that is far less than analysts' estimate of a loss of 250,000. This recently agreed to buy prepaid businesses from T-Mobile and Sprint to create a wireless carrier. Company plans to invest billions of dollars in building out its own 5G network.</p><p>And let's talk about puppy. Puppy is delivered to your hotel room in celebration of national dog day which is August 26th. The Kimpton Hotel Monaco in Denver is doing something kind of special.</p><p>Guests can go for a package includes a private puppy party. This features six to 10 dogs and some sparkling wine. Prosecco to be more specific. Guests are also going to have the option to rescue these adaptable and probably adorable pets. Because, you know, Maria, everybody needs a Bella Dusty in their lives, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: I mean, come on. Puppies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was posting about Dusty this weekend.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that idea, puppies and Prosecco. Oh, there she is. This Dusty I rescue, who is doing great, loves her new home in New York. Who would leave this beauty on the streets of Houston?</p><p>FORBES: But though dogs are coming into their own. I attended a Chicago White Sox game several weeks ago, they had part of the stadium sectioned off to bring your dog to the ball game.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, good grief.</p><p>FORBES: (INAUDIBLE) Instead of a hotdog, bring the real dog.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, I like that. Well, dogs, you make everything better. Dusty has made my life better.</p><p>Real quick on Tulsi Gabbard on Tucker the other night, talking about her. It's being censored by Google. This is a real issue going into 2020.</p><p>FORBES: This shows how brain-dead Google is politically -- they go after Prager University.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Veritas. Why? Why put yourself out there like that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: And she's got a good point because law -- even companies like ours, the Daily Caller, does millions of dollars in business every year with Facebook and Google.</p><p>We -- and she as presidential candidate can't get a hearing, they shut it down arbitrarily, they just say all right it's over they suspend accounts. And most people have no recourse at all. She's able to go on \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\".</p><p>PEEK: Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: She's able to speak nationally, and we're able to talk to you, our political connections in Washington D.C. But for all the other folks, we're getting shut down left and right. They have no recourse.</p><p>PEEK: There is some accountability in the future for this kind of behavior. And I don't know how it's going to happen because our legislators seem totally behind the curve and trying to deal with this issue, but it's going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't forget what Peter Thiel said the other day about Google working with China.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Devin Nunes -- Congressman Nunes is suing Twitter. There are a lot of issues here. There's the issue of privacy which Kevin McCarthy is trying to push.</p><p>PEEK: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Legislation to make sure everybody knows what they're doing with their data. But then, there's this that Tulsi Gabbard is talking about and that is censoring conservatives.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is going to ramp up going into the election.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, they are doing the opposite of what AT&amp;T used to do in their monopoly days, they went out of their way to be fair to everybody. And Google should remember that because they're going to pay a political consequence for it, big time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I agree with you. I agree.</p><p>A quick break, and then, big banks at the border. Some lenders won't extend credit for detention centers. Well, one CEO says it hurts everybody involved.</p><p>And then, officers hacked. Los Angeles City computers compromised exposing important data. That story next right after this. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Breaking news right now. Merck is out with its quarterly earnings. Ashley Webster with the numbers. Ashley?</p><p>WEBSTER: Hey, Maria. Another nice beat for Merck. Earnings coming in at $1.30 a per share. The estimate was run 16, the revenue at 11.76 billion. The estimate was 10.9 billion. So, nice beat on the top and bottom line. Just going through the numbers here, they're also narrowing and raising their earnings estimates for the rest of the year. The same story on revenue to between 45.2 and 46.2 billion, narrowing and raising their revenue outlook.</p><p>And among the key drugs, Keytruda, which is a cancer drug that's had very strong sales. Sales in second for that up 58 percent. Annual health sales -- they do quite a few pharmaceutical sales in that area, that is up three percent. But pharmaceutical sales overall for the company, up 13 percent. So, overall much like Eli Lily, a strong report and these stocks up, Maria, more than 1-1/3 percent in pre-market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Ashley, thank you. Pretty good tone for the pharmaceutical companies so far. Meanwhile, headlines across America this morning.</p><p>The Orlando Sentinel reporting this morning: \"Florida mosquito watch shows more cases of West Nile virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis this morning.\" Residents being reminded that Florida has more dangers than just sharks, alligators, and flesh-eating bacteria. Mosquitos carry a variety of diseases and they should take precautions.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times this morning writes: \"City computers breached. Data potentially stolen from 20,000 LAPD applicants.\" The day the theft potentially involving personal information of about 20,000 applications to the police department, including hundreds who already work there.</p><p>And the Denver Post this morning reporting: \"Colorado proposes new controls on oil and gas industry in an effort to combat air pollution.\" Health officials proposing controls on the oil and gas industry to help clear the air as Colorado aims to comply with Federal ozone limits. Obey lawmakers who ordered a clean-up and get the state in line with ongoing efforts to contain climate change, according to paper.</p><p>President Trump just tweeted this, this morning. The president writes: \"Despite the Democrats wanting very unsafe open borders and refusing to change the loopholes and asylum, tremendous progress is being made at the Southern Border. We all waited because we assumed the Dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible immigration laws -- they didn't,\" writes the president. Yesterday or Sunday, I spoke with the DHS secretary and he said that 54 miles have already been built and he is expecting 200-miles-plus at the end of next year.</p><p>Coming up, banks and the border crisis. Certain lenders choosing not to extend credit for detention centers. Why one CEO says, well, that's a bad idea and everybody gets hurt. That's next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What was behind that decision to exit ties of those companies working with the detention centers?</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: Well, to focus on the decision first, I think you have to think about how we make this. We have a group that senior business people that think about the decision. We make it reluctantly. But we really try to base it on what our teammates tell us. And so, we had teammates because of their backgrounds and their thoughts, that we're very upset about the, the broader issues of prison reform and sentencing reform, some of which went through in the last few weeks on a bipartisan basis and the border. And you know, they basically said that we should make a statement here and it rolled through the system and made it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, they sure did make a statement. That was Bank of America's Chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan, with me about a week and half ago explaining the bank's decision to stop all funding to private prison companies that run detention centers. My next guest says that, that decision actually hurts all parties involved including the activists who are fighting to stop border detention. Joining me right now is Corecivic President and CEO Damon Hininger. And it is good to have you on the program, Damon. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>DAMON HININGER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CORECIVIC: Maria, thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Were you one of the recipients of funding from Bank of America.</p><p>HININGER: Absolutely. We've had a 20-year relationship with Bank of America. So, it's been very frustrating that these banks, you know, are trying to listen to the people that they think would be most impacted by banking or not banking with our companies. I mean, they're hurting those people. And we have a wonderful record of helping a lot of folks -- not on the federal lever, but state and local level with the new facilities, helping with overcrowding and proving the quality of peer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tell me about your business. I mean, why would this be something that the chairman and CEO of Bank of America and JPMorgan has to get involved with?</p><p>HININGER: So, we've been around 35 years based in Nashville, Tennessee and we've been doing work with federal government to state government to all that time. And what we do is, really, a couple of key things: we provide facilities that we own and operate to improve the quality of care, but also provide cost savings for our customers. We also provide just a real estate. So, for example, we're building a new prison in Kansas, that's going to replace a 155-year-old prison. That's very old, (INAUDIBLE), no air conditioning, no program space. And then, finally, we do community facilities or (INAUDIBLE). These are facilities helping people in the last six to 12 months before release. We're helping them getting employed. So, these facilities are really, really important to the criminal justice system but also immigration and Marshall service.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, not only that, but if you're upset about the way detainees are being treated at these detention centers and you stop funding, who does that hurt? It hurts the people being detained.</p><p>HININGER: Absolutely. I mean, our facilities are very safe, they're modern, they've got programs, they've got medical care, they got all the key services to serve this population. So, yes, if these banks step away, that's the people they're hurting. They're hurting these people that are coming across the border and need a very safe and human place to reside while they --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because there's nowhere else to get the funding.</p><p>HININGER: Exactly right. And you know, another example, our largest -- or longest -- largest state partners in the last years is state of California. So, you know the history there. California was at 200 percent capacity about 10-12 years ago. We helped them reduce overcrowding. And that's the point of making these banks, is that you're hurting those states that are critical at a time where they've got overcrowded and they need to reduce overcrowding. We need the capital-built capacity for them to help reduce that overcrowding and get more humane and normalized environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You would think. What else do you need for better conditions for some of the migrants -- I mean, what -- in terms of that region?</p><p>HININGER: So, we -- we're very thoughtful on talking with ICE, exactly kind of what the needs are. So, for example, in 2014, we built a facility in (INAUDIBLE), Texas, and we built it day one for families. So, not a traditional or what you think a detention center or a correctional facility. This is built -- and you look at it, it looks like a community college campus. It's very open, very spacious, got programs, got some soccer fields, medical. And so, we try to be very purposeful on the front end and try to see it, kind of, what the is for the population we're going to house there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What did you do as a result of losing the funding? How are you making things whole?</p><p>HININGER: So, the big banks that made these expression talks is very frustrating, it's very, very political. But I will tell you, Maria, we've got banks, larger regional banks, community banks that want to do business with us. And so, our phone is going to ring off the hook one (INAUDIBLE), the work we do and also serve this mission.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Damon, great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>HININGER: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Damon Hininger, joining us. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
