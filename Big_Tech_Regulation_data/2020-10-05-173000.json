Still, losses in five of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors, including consumer staples (-0.7%), have kept the broader market in check.</p><p>The market is also missing the influential leadership from some of its largest tech companies, which are currently holding modest losses after the Department of Justice announced an antitrust review into the \"market-leading online platforms.\"</p><p>Big-tech scrutiny is nothing new, but it does show legitimate efforts to oversee the influence of market leaders like Facebook (FB 201.40, -0.94, -0.5%), Amazon (AMZN 1991.50, -2.99, -0.2%), Alphabet (GOOG 1133.77, -12.44, -1.1%), and Apple (AAPL 208.13, -0.70, -0.3%).

UPS (UPS 114.00, +8.73, +8.3%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC 337.20, +13.22, +4.1%), however, have provided strong support for the sector after pleasing investors with their results.</p><p>Similarly, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.5%, rising on the back of solid results from Texas Instruments (TXN 127.99, +7.92, +6.6%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348669853</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HKS1-DYRK-9494-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4284\"/><timeReceived>3:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Nasdaq Composite (+0.5%) is currently trading at its all-time intraday high.</p><p>Today's advance has been concentrated among the cyclical sectors -- financials (+0.7%), industrials (+0.5%), information technology (+0.5%), energy (+0.5%), and consumer discretionary (+0.3%). The communication services sector (+0.7%) has been another leader as investors buy the dip in Netflix (NFLX 319.42, +12.12, +4.0%).</p><p>Looking ahead, notable companies that will report earnings after today's close include Facebook (FB 203.19, +0.83, +0.4%), Ford Motor (F 10.32, +0.15, +1.4%), PayPal (PYPL 120.77, +0.55, +0.5%), and Tesla (TSLA 262.65, +2.48, +1.0%).</p><p>14:30 ET</p><p>Dow -118.60 at 27230.59, Nasdaq +37.92 at 8289.33, S&amp;P +6.95 at 3012.42</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite notched session highs in the last half hour, up 0.23% and 0.46%, respectively.</p><p>Positive action in the S&amp;P 500 is led by earnings movers like Discover Financial Services (DFS 92.13, +7.65, +9.06%), Edwards Lifesciences (EW 211.97, +16.51, +8.45%), and Grainger (GWW 301.54, +22.76, +8.16%).</p><p>Conversely, Rollins (ROL 34.35, -3.80, -9.96%) sits at the bottom of the index in light of this morning's in-line Q2 results.</p><p>14:00 ET</p><p>Dow -124.98 at 27224.21, Nasdaq +31.96 at 8283.37, S&amp;P +4.50 at 3009.97</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] Again, the major averages have held their lines in the last half hour with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite still within shouting distance of session highs.</p><p>Gold futures gave up most of their morning advance though still settled 0.1% higher to $1,423.60/oz on Wednesday in view of this morning's less than stellar Manufacturing PMI reading.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index has traded mostly sideways today, down less than 0.1% at the moment to 97.66.</p><p>13:30 ET</p><p>Dow -116.45 at 27232.74, Nasdaq +32.39 at 8283.8, S&amp;P +4.58 at 3010.05</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages sit little changed in the last half hour with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still in a hole, down about 116 points now.</p><p>Aside from the widely-covered losses from Dow Jones Industrial Average components Boeing (BA 362.35, -10.72, -2.87%) &amp; Caterpillar (CAT 131.93, -6.127, -4.47%) shares of UnitedHealth (UNH 252.51, -2.50, -0.98%), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG 112.73, -1.12, -0.98%), and Pfizer (PFE 42.68, -0.41, -0.95%) sit modestly lower.</p><p>Conversely, semiconductor giant Intel (INTC 52.72, +0.97, +1.87%) sits atop the index due in part to broader strength in tech and chips.</p><p>The DJIA gives back almost all of yesterday's decently higher session, now 0.29% higher on the week.</p><p>Elsewhere, at the top of the hour, the Treasury's $41 bln 5-year note auction drew a high yield of 1.824% on a bid-to-cover of 2.26.</p><p>12:55 ET</p><p>Dow -116.01 at 27233.18, Nasdaq +31.88 at 8283.29, S&amp;P +3.92 at 3009.39</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market trades mixed today. Strong gains in the semiconductor stocks have contributed to the positive disposition in the S&amp;P 500 (+0.1%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.4%), but noticeable losses in shares of Boeing (BA 363.44, -9.60, -2.6%) and Caterpillar (CAT 132.34, -5.77, -4.2%) have pressured the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.4%).</p><p>Outside of Caterpillar, which missed earnings estimates and lowered its full-year EPS guidance, earnings results have continued to come in mostly better than expected.

Visa (V 180.68, -0.22, -0.1%) beat estimates and raised guidance, but reaction has been muted.</p><p>Texas Instruments' report has spurred big gains in the semiconductor stocks, many of which are contributing to the leadership of the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector (+0.5%) and Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.9%). Still, losses in five of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors, including consumer staples (-0.7%), have kept the broader market in check.</p><p>The market is also missing the influential leadership from some of its largest tech companies, which are currently holding modest losses after the Department of Justice announced an antitrust review into the \"market-leading online platforms.\"</p><p>Big-tech scrutiny is nothing new, but it does show legitimate efforts to oversee the influence of market leaders like Facebook (FB 201.40, -0.94, -0.5%), Amazon (AMZN 1991.50, -2.99, -0.2%), Alphabet (GOOG 1133.77, -12.44, -1.1%), and Apple (AAPL 208.13, -0.70, -0.3%). On a related note, the FTC confirmed that Facebook will pay $5 billion for its privacy mishaps.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries have edged higher, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield are down two basis points each to 1.81% and 2.05%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.64.</p><p>Reviewing today's economic data, which included New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:</p><p>New home sales increased 7.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 646,000 (Briefing.com consensus 660,000) from a downwardly revised 604,000 (from 626,000) in May. Sales for April and March were also revised lower.The key takeaway from the report is that overall sales activity remains tepid despite the fundamental supports of low mortgage rates, low unemployment, and a tight supply of existing homes for sale.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 1.9% following a 1.1% decline in the prior week. ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1949/905. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1963/986.</p><p>12:25 ET</p><p>Dow -124.36 at 27224.83, Nasdaq +22.75 at 8274.16, S&amp;P +1.41 at 3006.88</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades just above its flat line, holding steady above the 3000 level. The Nasdaq outperforms with a gain of 0.3%, while the Dow trades lower by 0.4%.</p><p>Looking at the FAANG stocks shows Netflix (NFLX 314.65, +7.39, +2.4%) finally receiving some reprieve after disappointing investors last week. Conversely, Facebook (FB 201.71, -0.65, -0.4%), Apple (AAPL 207.95, -0.89, -0.4%), Amazon (AMZN 1991.43, -3.06, -0.2%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1135.29, -10.92, -1.0%) remain in the red amid the regulatory overhang from the DoJ.</p><p>Overseas, the major European indices closed mixed.

That move has been instrumental in lending support to the broader market.</p><p>One can sense, however, that selling activity in the broader market might pick up some steam if the semiconductor shares start to roll over, so this will be a closely-watched area as the day progresses.</p><p>Overall, there aren't any standout moves from a sector standpoint. Six sectors are up, and five sectors are down, with the performance range spanning -0.5% (health care) to +0.3% (energy).</p><p>Separately, Treasuries continue to hold modest gains, with yields down one to three basis points in maturities ranging from the 2-yr note to the 30-yr bond.</p><p>11:25 ET</p><p>Dow -129.99 at 27219.2, Nasdaq +7.03 at 8258.44, S&amp;P -1.62 at 3003.85</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] It's currently a mixed market with six S&amp;P 500 sectors trading lower and five sectors trading higher. The benchmark index currently trades just below its flat line.</p><p>The flattish disposition isn't too bad considering the negative tone in the market prior to the open. Some of that negativity stemmed from weakening manufacturing flash PMI readings out of Europe, the DoJ antitrust probe into the largest online companies, and disappointing guidance from Caterpillar (CAT 132.69, -5.37, -3.9%).</p><p>These are legitimate points for investors to be concerned about, but the fact that earnings have come in mostly better than expected has been a positive consideration. The outperformance of the S&amp;P 500 energy sector (+0.8%) amid higher oil prices ($57.08, -$0.30, -0.5%) has also been an area of support for the broader market.</p><p>10:55 ET</p><p>Dow -135.83 at 27213.36, Nasdaq -11.98 at 8239.43, S&amp;P +1.62 at 3007.09</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades higher 0.1% after beginning the day on a lower note. The outperformance in several industrial companies and the semiconductor stocks has contributed to the positive disposition.</p><p>Like the broader market, the industrials sector (+0.3%) began the day lower amid weakness in shares of Boeing (BA 367.34, -5.69, -1.5%) and Caterpillar (CAT 132.38, -5.67, -4.1%) after disappointing investors with results and/or guidance. UPS (UPS 114.00, +8.73, +8.3%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC 337.20, +13.22, +4.1%), however, have provided strong support for the sector after pleasing investors with their results.</p><p>Similarly, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.5%, rising on the back of solid results from Texas Instruments (TXN 127.99, +7.92, +6.6%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors.

The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro.

Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348669853</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HMD1-JC8H-K18S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4284\"/><timeReceived>3:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

Strikingly, despite the recent losses in the stock market, the VIX never made a convincing move to its recent May 5 high of 23.38.</p><p>Looking ahead, Salesforce (CRM 148.90, +3.80, +2.6%) will report its earnings report after today's close.</p><p>14:25 ET</p><p>Dow +430.82 at 25250.6, Nasdaq +159.91 at 7492.9, S&amp;P +47.95 at 2792.4</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] There has been little to sway the market's decision to rally today. The S&amp;P 500 continues to trade near session highs with a gain of 1.7%.</p><p>A look inside the S&amp;P 500 shows Mattel Inc (MAT 10.71, +1.06, +10.9%), Wynn Resorts (WYNN 111.38, +7.81, +7.5%), and MGM Resorts International (MGM 25.35, +1.48, +6.2%) among today's biggest gainers. Mattel announced an international licensing agreement with Sanrio, Inc. WYNN and MGM are benefiting from the prevailing view that stocks were primed for a bounce from short-term oversold conditions.</p><p>On the other hand, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR 32.72, -1.34, -3.9%) has been left out of today's rally, as investors take some profits from yesterday's 8.8% surge.</p><p>14:00 ET</p><p>Dow +451.73 at 25271.51, Nasdaq +163.67 at 7496.66, S&amp;P +48.88 at 2793.33</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] In the last half hour the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 both made session highs with the Nasdaq's lead growing, now up 2.23% on the day.</p><p>Gold futures settled higher for a fifth straight session on Tuesday, but only just so, up less than 0.1% to $1,328.70/oz.</p><p>The U.S. Dollar Index sits little changed at 97.13, but spent a good portion of the morning in negative territory.</p><p>13:30 ET</p><p>Dow +438.51 at 25258.29, Nasdaq +157.30 at 7490.29, S&amp;P +47.80 at 2792.25</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages have held their ground in the last half hour, little changed with the Nasdaq Composite still in the lead, up 2.15%.</p><p>Inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average action has held its broadly higher bias with NIKE (NKE 80.66, +2.70, +3.46%), Dow (DOW 49.56, +1.60, +3.34%) &amp; Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 51.52, +1.61, +3.23%) leading the move.</p><p>Conversely, Coca-Cola (KO 49.88, -0.10, -0.20%) is the lone decliner in the Dow 30.</p><p>The DJIA sits near a six-day high at this moment, now up 1.79% on the month.</p><p>13:00 ET</p><p>Dow +454.12 at 25273.9, Nasdaq +156.06 at 7489.05, S&amp;P +47.84 at 2792.29</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The stock market has made a nice run so far today, bolstered by broad-based buying interest and an opportunistic trade rooted in the idea that it was primed to rebound from a short-term oversold condition. The major indices, led by a 2.3% gain in the Russell 2000, are all up at least 1.8% and trading at session highs.</p><p>Today's move began in earnest at the sound of the opening bell, as market participants reacted favorably to headlines that seemingly cooled down the temperature surrounding the trade dispute with China, and provided some cover to think the tariff on imported goods from Mexico could be averted, either due to a deal with the U.S. ahead of the June 10 deadline or a possible vote in Congress to forestall the action, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>In reality, the mood of the market had been lifted on Monday when the S&amp;P 500 exhibited some relative strength in the face of large losses suffered by Alphabet (GOOG 1051.22, +14.99, +1.5%), Facebook (FB 166.54, +2.39, +1.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1723.80, +31.11, +1.8%), and Apple (AAPL 178.68, +5.37, +3.1%), which fell prone to some regulatory angst on the part of investors.</p><p>Those mega-cap stocks have managed to bounce back some today on the belief that any investigation into their business practices is likely to be a drawn out one; moreover, there is some underlying hope that none of the companies would eventually be broken up by the government.</p><p>Their gains today have helped bolster the broader market, yet the buying interest has been widespread. The information technology (+2.6%), financials (+2.3%), industrials (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+2.1%) sectors are all up at least 2.0%. The only sectors not participating today are the defensive-oriented real estate (-1.1%) and utilities (-1.0%) sectors.</p><p>Some of the fallout for the latter two sectors hearkens back to the Treasury market, where yields have risen noticeably across the curve on a counter-trade rooted in the idea that Treasuries were primed for a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.</p><p>The 2-yr note yield has spiked seven basis points to 1.90% while the 10-yr note yield has jumped five basis points to 2.14%.</p><p>The losses in the Treasury market have unfolded despite some softening CPI data out of the eurozone and a 0.8% decline in U.S. factory orders for April.</p><p>The non-response in the Treasury market to otherwise disappointing economic data and some seemingly supportive remarks from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, underscores how the Treasury market is succumbing to the overbought perspective.</p><p>Neither Mr. Powell nor Mr. Evans promised a rate cut soon while speaking at a conference in Chicago, yet both paid heed to the risks of undershooting the 2.0% inflation target and the risks of the trade uncertainty, which has been construed by some today as a dovish policy leaning.</p><p>Separately, there was no mistaking the leaning in the analyst community with respect to Uber (UBER 42.17, +0.92, +2.2%). No fewer than 20 firms initiated coverage of the stock after its IPO, 16 of which had the equivalent of a Buy recommendation.</p><p>12:25 ET</p><p>Dow +403.11 at 25222.89, Nasdaq +141.44 at 7474.43, S&amp;P +42.97 at 2787.42</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover near their recently established session highs. The Nasdaq (+1.9%) remains in the lead while the S&amp;P 500 (+1.6%) follows a bit behind. The Nasdaq's outperformance comes after the tech-heavy index displayed relative weakness on Monday.</p><p>Accordingly, the Nasdaq's outperformance has been supported by a 2.3% gain in the technology sector. The top-weighted group is today's best performer with chipmakers doing their part. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 3.0% with all 30 components trading in the green. NVIDIA (NVDA 140.84, +7.06, +5.3%) is up 5.3%, pacing the group's advance after recording eight consecutive losses.</p><p>Treasuries sit a bit above their morning lows with the 10-yr yield up five basis points at 2.14%.</p><p>11:55 ET</p><p>Dow +422.01 at 25241.79, Nasdaq +150.99 at 7483.98, S&amp;P +44.89 at 2789.34</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to push higher with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.7%, the Nasdaq up 2.1%, and the Dow up 1.7%. Contributing to today's bullish bias are supportive comments from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters.</p><p>Mr. Powell said that the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the economic expansion.

The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

The May reading is the lowest since October 2016. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a deceleration in national manufacturing activity that will contribute to the burgeoning growth concerns for the U.S. economy. According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345213545</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8C-0J11-JC8H-K1NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3944\"/><timeReceived>3:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348671335</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HKS1-DYRK-9495-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4415\"/><timeReceived>3:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348671335</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HMD1-JC8H-K18T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4415\"/><timeReceived>3:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The major indices, led by a 2.3% gain in the Russell 2000, are all up at least 1.8% and trading at session highs.</p><p>Today's move began in earnest at the sound of the opening bell, as market participants reacted favorably to headlines that seemingly cooled down the temperature surrounding the trade dispute with China, and provided some cover to think the tariff on imported goods from Mexico could be averted, either due to a deal with the U.S. ahead of the June 10 deadline or a possible vote in Congress to forestall the action, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>In reality, the mood of the market had been lifted on Monday when the S&amp;P 500 exhibited some relative strength in the face of large losses suffered by Alphabet (GOOG 1051.22, +14.99, +1.5%), Facebook (FB 166.54, +2.39, +1.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1723.80, +31.11, +1.8%), and Apple (AAPL 178.68, +5.37, +3.1%), which fell prone to some regulatory angst on the part of investors.</p><p>Those mega-cap stocks have managed to bounce back some today on the belief that any investigation into their business practices is likely to be a drawn out one; moreover, there is some underlying hope that none of the companies would eventually be broken up by the government.</p><p>Their gains today have helped bolster the broader market, yet the buying interest has been widespread. The information technology (+2.6%), financials (+2.3%), industrials (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+2.1%) sectors are all up at least 2.0%. The only sectors not participating today are the defensive-oriented real estate (-1.1%) and utilities (-1.0%) sectors.</p><p>Some of the fallout for the latter two sectors hearkens back to the Treasury market, where yields have risen noticeably across the curve on a counter-trade rooted in the idea that Treasuries were primed for a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.</p><p>The 2-yr note yield has spiked seven basis points to 1.90% while the 10-yr note yield has jumped five basis points to 2.14%.</p><p>The losses in the Treasury market have unfolded despite some softening CPI data out of the eurozone and a 0.8% decline in U.S. factory orders for April.</p><p>The non-response in the Treasury market to otherwise disappointing economic data and some seemingly supportive remarks from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, underscores how the Treasury market is succumbing to the overbought perspective.</p><p>Neither Mr. Powell nor Mr. Evans promised a rate cut soon while speaking at a conference in Chicago, yet both paid heed to the risks of undershooting the 2.0% inflation target and the risks of the trade uncertainty, which has been construed by some today as a dovish policy leaning.</p><p>Separately, there was no mistaking the leaning in the analyst community with respect to Uber (UBER 42.17, +0.92, +2.2%). No fewer than 20 firms initiated coverage of the stock after its IPO, 16 of which had the equivalent of a Buy recommendation.</p><p>12:25 ET</p><p>Dow +403.11 at 25222.89, Nasdaq +141.44 at 7474.43, S&amp;P +42.97 at 2787.42</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover near their recently established session highs. The Nasdaq (+1.9%) remains in the lead while the S&amp;P 500 (+1.6%) follows a bit behind. The Nasdaq's outperformance comes after the tech-heavy index displayed relative weakness on Monday.</p><p>Accordingly, the Nasdaq's outperformance has been supported by a 2.3% gain in the technology sector. The top-weighted group is today's best performer with chipmakers doing their part. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 3.0% with all 30 components trading in the green. NVIDIA (NVDA 140.84, +7.06, +5.3%) is up 5.3%, pacing the group's advance after recording eight consecutive losses.</p><p>Treasuries sit a bit above their morning lows with the 10-yr yield up five basis points at 2.14%.</p><p>11:55 ET</p><p>Dow +422.01 at 25241.79, Nasdaq +150.99 at 7483.98, S&amp;P +44.89 at 2789.34</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to push higher with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.7%, the Nasdaq up 2.1%, and the Dow up 1.7%. Contributing to today's bullish bias are supportive comments from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters.</p><p>Mr. Powell said that the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the economic expansion. Mr. Evans said the \"fundamentals\" of the economy remain in good footing and is open to a change in policy if necessary. There was no promise of a rate cut, but both did acknowledge concerns about low inflation.</p><p>Separately, shares of Box (BOX 16.61, -1.33) have dropped 7.4% after the company guided Q2 revenue below consensus and lowered its FY20 revenue below consensus. On a related note, the stock was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Canaccord Genuity with a price target of $16.</p><p>11:25 ET</p><p>Dow +419.65 at 25239.43, Nasdaq +137.40 at 7470.39, S&amp;P +41.50 at 2785.95</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades near session highs with a gain of 1.5%.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1860/990. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1654/1418.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345215909</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8C-0J11-JC8H-K1P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4118\"/><timeReceived>3:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The utilities (-1.3%) and financials (-0.8%) sectors were the lone holdouts.</p><p>Material stocks benefited from higher metal prices, including the continued breakout of gold ($1931.70/ozt, $34.20 +1.8%) amid a weakening U.S. Dollar Index (93.71, -0.72, -0.8%). The tech sector was lifted by mega-cap leadership and strong gains in the semiconductor space. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 3.2%.</p><p>Amazon (AMZN 3055.21, +46.30, +1.5%), Apple (AAPL 379.24, +8.78, +2.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1530.20, +18.33, +1.2%), and Facebook (FB 233.50, +2.79, +1.2%) outperformed in front of high-profile events this week. Specifically, the CEOs of these companies will testify before lawmakers on Wednesday regarding regulatory concerns, and the companies will report earnings on Thursday.</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 83.25, +9.35, +12.7%) stood out with a 12.7% gain amid speculation that Intel (INTC 49.57, -1.02, -2.0%) might order chips from the company to get around its internal production issues.</p><p>In other corporate news, Moderna (MRNA 79.91, +6.70, +9.2%) received an additional $472 million from the government to advance its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 39.94, -0.67, -1.7%) announced its CEO will step down, and Hasbro (HAS 71.84, -5.75, -7.4%) missed top and bottom-line estimates.</p><p>Elsewhere, U.S. Treasuries finished little changed while investors continued to await the details of $1 trillion coronavirus relief bill from Republican Senators. The 2-yr yield was flat at 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.60%.

Excluding transportation, orders jumped 3.3%, as expected, after a downwardly revised 3.6% increase (from 4.0%) for May. The key takeaway from the report is that business spending picked up in June, evidenced by a 3.3% increase in new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects.

Friday's 1.3% decline in the S&amp;P 500 sent it below its 200-day moving average (2776) and extended its weekly decline to 2.6%.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.4%), the Nasdaq Composite (-1.5%), and the Russell 2000 (-1.4%) extended their weekly losses to 3.0%, 2.4%, and 3.2%.</p><p>The 5% tariff rate will go into effect on June 10 and will increase incrementally during the summer to reach 25% on Oct. 1. The White House could remove these tariffs altogether if Mexico makes a concerted effort to curb the flow of undocumented migrants entering the U.S.</p><p>The news catalyzed de-risking efforts, leading to eight of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finishing with losses over 1.0%. The utilities (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.8%) sectors finished higher amid a steep drop in U.S. Treasury yields.</p><p>Another trade dispute on top of a U.S.-China trade war with no clear end in sight fueled ongoing concerns that trade tensions will lower economic, and earnings, growth prospects.</p><p>China added to these fears after it announced that it is drafting a list of unreliable foreign entities that harm the interests of its firms, increasing speculation about Chinese retaliation against the U.S. On a related note, China's manufacturing sector slipped into contraction in May.</p><p>Global growth concerns were transparent by the 5.2% drop in WTI crude ($53.48/bbl, -$2.92) and by investors seeking safety in a crowded U.S. Treasury market. The 2-yr yield dropped 12 basis points to 1.94%, and the 10-yr yield dropped nine basis points to 2.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.4% to 97.76.</p><p>In corporate news, shares of General Motors (GM 33.34, -1.48, -4.3%) underperformed on the Mexico tariff threat. Dell Technologies (DELL 59.55, -6.86, -10.3%), Gap (GPS 18.68, -1.92, -9.3%), and VMware (VMW 176.98, -14.11, -7.4%) disappointed investors with their earnings results, while Uber (UBER 40.41, +0.61, +1.5%) pleased investors with its results.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included Personal Income and Spending data for April, the PCE Price Index for April, the final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for May, and the Chicago PMI for April:</p><p>Personal income increased 0.5% in April (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a 0.1% increase in March. Personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an upwardly revised 1.1% increase (from 0.9%) in March. The PCE Price Index was up 0.3% m/m, as expected, while the core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, as expected.The key takeaway from the report is that real PCE was unchanged in April. That will be another data point that leads to forecasts calling for much slower real GDP growth in the second quarter than the 3.1% real GDP growth seen in the first quarter.The final May reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment checked in at 100.0 (Briefing.com consensus 101.5) versus the preliminary reading of 97.2.The key takeaway from the report was the acknowledgment that \"confidence significantly eroded in the last two weeks of May\" on account of concerns about the tariff actions.The Chicago PMI for May increased to 54.2 from 52.6 in April.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +12.3% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.8% YTDRussell 2000 +8.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 890/1981. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 777/2348.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345143698</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W85-17M1-DYRK-920G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5033\"/><timeReceived>4:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22. WTI crude decreased 0.5% to $53.25/bbl, giving up an intraday rebound effort.</p><p>In other corporate news, German company Infineon announced plans to acquire Cypress Semiconductor (CY 22.07, +4.25, +23.9%) for approximately $10 billion, or $23.85 per share, in cash. The offer represents a 33.8% premium to CY's Friday closing price.

The May reading is the lowest since October 2016.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a deceleration in national manufacturing activity that will contribute to the burgeoning growth concerns for the U.S. economy. According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +8.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1860/990. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1654/1418.</p><p>15:45 ET</p><p>Dow -102.77 at 24712.27, Nasdaq -153.73 at 7299.39, S&amp;P -20.61 at 2731.45</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] Crude Oil futures closed at a four-month low as concerns over demand and global growth stem from trade disruptions.

Friday's 1.3% decline in the S&amp;P 500 sent it below its 200-day moving average (2776) and extended its weekly decline to 2.6%.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.4%), the Nasdaq Composite (-1.5%), and the Russell 2000 (-1.4%) extended their weekly losses to 3.0%, 2.4%, and 3.2%.</p><p>The 5% tariff rate will go into effect on June 10 and will increase incrementally during the summer to reach 25% on Oct. 1. The White House could remove these tariffs altogether if Mexico makes a concerted effort to curb the flow of undocumented migrants entering the U.S.</p><p>The news catalyzed de-risking efforts, leading to eight of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finishing with losses over 1.0%. The utilities (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.8%) sectors finished higher amid a steep drop in U.S. Treasury yields.</p><p>Another trade dispute on top of a U.S.-China trade war with no clear end in sight fueled ongoing concerns that trade tensions will lower economic, and earnings, growth prospects.</p><p>China added to these fears after it announced that it is drafting a list of unreliable foreign entities that harm the interests of its firms, increasing speculation about Chinese retaliation against the U.S. On a related note, China's manufacturing sector slipped into contraction in May.</p><p>Global growth concerns were transparent by the 5.2% drop in WTI crude ($53.48/bbl, -$2.92) and by investors seeking safety in a crowded U.S. Treasury market. The 2-yr yield dropped 12 basis points to 1.94%, and the 10-yr yield dropped nine basis points to 2.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.4% to 97.76.</p><p>In corporate news, shares of General Motors (GM 33.34, -1.48, -4.3%) underperformed on the Mexico tariff threat.

Personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an upwardly revised 1.1% increase (from 0.9%) in March. The PCE Price Index was up 0.3% m/m, as expected, while the core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, as expected.The key takeaway from the report is that real PCE was unchanged in April. That will be another data point that leads to forecasts calling for much slower real GDP growth in the second quarter than the 3.1% real GDP growth seen in the first quarter.The final May reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment checked in at 100.0 (Briefing.com consensus 101.5) versus the preliminary reading of 97.2.The key takeaway from the report was the acknowledgment that \"confidence significantly eroded in the last two weeks of May\" on account of concerns about the tariff actions.The Chicago PMI for May increased to 54.2 from 52.6 in April.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +12.3% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.8% YTDRussell 2000 +8.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 890/1981. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 777/2348.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345143698</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W85-17K1-JC8H-K55H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5033\"/><timeReceived>4:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22. WTI crude decreased 0.5% to $53.25/bbl, giving up an intraday rebound effort.</p><p>In other corporate news, German company Infineon announced plans to acquire Cypress Semiconductor (CY 22.07, +4.25, +23.9%) for approximately $10 billion, or $23.85 per share, in cash. The offer represents a 33.8% premium to CY's Friday closing price. Humana (HUM 250.32, +5.46, +2.2%) said it will not make a competing bid to acquire Centene (CNC 51.82, -5.93, -10.3%).</p><p>Reviewing Monday's economic data, which included the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April:</p><p>The ISM Manufacturing Index for May checked in at 52.1% (Briefing.com consensus 52.6%), down from 52.8% in April. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a deceleration in national manufacturing activity that will contribute to the burgeoning growth concerns for the U.S. economy. According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1860/990. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1654/1418.</p><p>15:45 ET</p><p>Dow -102.77 at 24712.27, Nasdaq -153.73 at 7299.39, S&amp;P -20.61 at 2731.45</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] Crude Oil futures closed at a four-month low as concerns over demand and global growth stem from trade disruptions.

Personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an upwardly revised 1.1% increase (from 0.9%) in March. The PCE Price Index was up 0.3% m/m, as expected, while the core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, as expected.The key takeaway from the report is that real PCE was unchanged in April. That will be another data point that leads to forecasts calling for much slower real GDP growth in the second quarter than the 3.1% real GDP growth seen in the first quarter.The final May reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment checked in at 100.0 (Briefing.com consensus 101.5) versus the preliminary reading of 97.2.The key takeaway from the report was the acknowledgment that \"confidence significantly eroded in the last two weeks of May\" on account of concerns about the tariff actions.The Chicago PMI for May increased to 54.2 from 52.6 in April.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +12.3% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.8% YTDRussell 2000 +8.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 890/1981. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 777/2348.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345143896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W85-17M1-DYRK-920H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5069\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22.

Japan's Nikkei -0.9%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.03%, China's Shanghai Composite -0.3%, India's Sensex +1.4%, South Korea's Kospi +1.3%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -1.3%.In economic data:China's May Caixin Manufacturing PMI 50.2 (expected 50.0; last 50.2)Japan's May Manufacturing PMI 49.8 (expected 49.6; last 49.6); Capital Spending 6.1% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 5.7%)Australia's May Manufacturing PMI 51.0 (expected 51.1; last 50.9)South Korea's May Nikkei Manufacturing PMI 48.4 (expected 49.5; last 50.2)In news:Lots of attention this morning on a White Paper out of China that places blame on U.S. for the negotiations unraveling. Nothing particularly new there, although the paper reasserts China isn't going to compromise on its key principles, which adds to sense this trade dispute could persist for some time.The increased tariff rate on the $200 billion tranche of Chinese exports to the U.S. and the $60 billion tranche of U.S. exports to China went into effect June 1. Separately, the U.S. has ended India's designation as a beneficiary developing nation, which means it is likely to lose ability to exports products to U.S. without tariffs.Manufacturing PMI data out of the region, including China's Caixin Manufacturing PMI, reflected softer growth environment in May.Major European indices are starting the week on a cautious note.

Friday's 1.3% decline in the S&amp;P 500 sent it below its 200-day moving average (2776) and extended its weekly decline to 2.6%.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.4%), the Nasdaq Composite (-1.5%), and the Russell 2000 (-1.4%) extended their weekly losses to 3.0%, 2.4%, and 3.2%.</p><p>The 5% tariff rate will go into effect on June 10 and will increase incrementally during the summer to reach 25% on Oct. 1. The White House could remove these tariffs altogether if Mexico makes a concerted effort to curb the flow of undocumented migrants entering the U.S.</p><p>The news catalyzed de-risking efforts, leading to eight of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finishing with losses over 1.0%. The utilities (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.8%) sectors finished higher amid a steep drop in U.S. Treasury yields.</p><p>Another trade dispute on top of a U.S.-China trade war with no clear end in sight fueled ongoing concerns that trade tensions will lower economic, and earnings, growth prospects.</p><p>China added to these fears after it announced that it is drafting a list of unreliable foreign entities that harm the interests of its firms, increasing speculation about Chinese retaliation against the U.S. On a related note, China's manufacturing sector slipped into contraction in May.</p><p>Global growth concerns were transparent by the 5.2% drop in WTI crude ($53.48/bbl, -$2.92) and by investors seeking safety in a crowded U.S. Treasury market. The 2-yr yield dropped 12 basis points to 1.94%, and the 10-yr yield dropped nine basis points to 2.14%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.4% to 97.76.</p><p>In corporate news, shares of General Motors (GM 33.34, -1.48, -4.3%) underperformed on the Mexico tariff threat. Dell Technologies (DELL 59.55, -6.86, -10.3%), Gap (GPS 18.68, -1.92, -9.3%), and VMware (VMW 176.98, -14.11, -7.4%) disappointed investors with their earnings results, while Uber (UBER 40.41, +0.61, +1.5%) pleased investors with its results.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included Personal Income and Spending data for April, the PCE Price Index for April, the final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for May, and the Chicago PMI for April:</p><p>Personal income increased 0.5% in April (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a 0.1% increase in March. Personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an upwardly revised 1.1% increase (from 0.9%) in March. The PCE Price Index was up 0.3% m/m, as expected, while the core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, as expected.The key takeaway from the report is that real PCE was unchanged in April. That will be another data point that leads to forecasts calling for much slower real GDP growth in the second quarter than the 3.1% real GDP growth seen in the first quarter.The final May reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment checked in at 100.0 (Briefing.com consensus 101.5) versus the preliminary reading of 97.2.The key takeaway from the report was the acknowledgment that \"confidence significantly eroded in the last two weeks of May\" on account of concerns about the tariff actions.The Chicago PMI for May increased to 54.2 from 52.6 in April.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +12.3% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.8% YTDRussell 2000 +8.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 890/1981. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 777/2348.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345143896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W85-17K1-JC8H-K55J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5069\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22.

The May reading is the lowest since October 2016.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a deceleration in national manufacturing activity that will contribute to the burgeoning growth concerns for the U.S. economy. According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1860/990. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1654/1418.</p><p>15:45 ET</p><p>Dow -102.77 at 24712.27, Nasdaq -153.73 at 7299.39, S&amp;P -20.61 at 2731.45</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] Crude Oil futures closed at a four-month low as concerns over demand and global growth stem from trade disruptions.

The White House could remove these tariffs altogether if Mexico makes a concerted effort to curb the flow of undocumented migrants entering the U.S.</p><p>The news catalyzed de-risking efforts, leading to eight of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finishing with losses over 1.0%. The utilities (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.8%) sectors finished higher amid a steep drop in U.S. Treasury yields.</p><p>Another trade dispute on top of a U.S.-China trade war with no clear end in sight fueled ongoing concerns that trade tensions will lower economic, and earnings, growth prospects.</p><p>China added to these fears after it announced that it is drafting a list of unreliable foreign entities that harm the interests of its firms, increasing speculation about Chinese retaliation against the U.S. On a related note, China's manufacturing sector slipped into contraction in May.</p><p>Global growth concerns were transparent by the 5.2% drop in WTI crude ($53.48/bbl, -$2.92) and by investors seeking safety in a crowded U.S. Treasury market.

The PCE Price Index was up 0.3% m/m, as expected, while the core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, as expected.The key takeaway from the report is that real PCE was unchanged in April. That will be another data point that leads to forecasts calling for much slower real GDP growth in the second quarter than the 3.1% real GDP growth seen in the first quarter.The final May reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment checked in at 100.0 (Briefing.com consensus 101.5) versus the preliminary reading of 97.2.The key takeaway from the report was the acknowledgment that \"confidence significantly eroded in the last two weeks of May\" on account of concerns about the tariff actions.The Chicago PMI for May increased to 54.2 from 52.6 in April.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +12.3% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.8% YTDRussell 2000 +8.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 890/1981. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 777/2348.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345144139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W85-17M1-DYRK-920J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5070\"/><timeReceived>4:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22. WTI crude decreased 0.5% to $53.25/bbl, giving up an intraday rebound effort.</p><p>In other corporate news, German company Infineon announced plans to acquire Cypress Semiconductor (CY 22.07, +4.25, +23.9%) for approximately $10 billion, or $23.85 per share, in cash. The offer represents a 33.8% premium to CY's Friday closing price. Humana (HUM 250.32, +5.46, +2.2%) said it will not make a competing bid to acquire Centene (CNC 51.82, -5.93, -10.3%).</p><p>Reviewing Monday's economic data, which included the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April:</p><p>The ISM Manufacturing Index for May checked in at 52.1% (Briefing.com consensus 52.6%), down from 52.8% in April. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a deceleration in national manufacturing activity that will contribute to the burgeoning growth concerns for the U.S. economy. According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1860/990. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1654/1418.</p><p>15:45 ET</p><p>Dow -102.77 at 24712.27, Nasdaq -153.73 at 7299.39, S&amp;P -20.61 at 2731.45</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] Crude Oil futures closed at a four-month low as concerns over demand and global growth stem from trade disruptions.

Dell Technologies (DELL 59.55, -6.86, -10.3%), Gap (GPS 18.68, -1.92, -9.3%), and VMware (VMW 176.98, -14.11, -7.4%) disappointed investors with their earnings results, while Uber (UBER 40.41, +0.61, +1.5%) pleased investors with its results.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included Personal Income and Spending data for April, the PCE Price Index for April, the final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for May, and the Chicago PMI for April:</p><p>Personal income increased 0.5% in April (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a 0.1% increase in March. Personal spending rose 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%) on top of an upwardly revised 1.1% increase (from 0.9%) in March. The PCE Price Index was up 0.3% m/m, as expected, while the core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, jumped 0.2%, as expected.The key takeaway from the report is that real PCE was unchanged in April. That will be another data point that leads to forecasts calling for much slower real GDP growth in the second quarter than the 3.1% real GDP growth seen in the first quarter.The final May reading for the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment checked in at 100.0 (Briefing.com consensus 101.5) versus the preliminary reading of 97.2.The key takeaway from the report was the acknowledgment that \"confidence significantly eroded in the last two weeks of May\" on account of concerns about the tariff actions.The Chicago PMI for May increased to 54.2 from 52.6 in April.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +12.3% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.8% YTDRussell 2000 +8.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 890/1981. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 777/2348.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345144139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W85-17K1-JC8H-K55K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5070\"/><timeReceived>4:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.6%.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, lost 0.3% amid noticeable losses in Boeing (BA 361.43, -11.54, -3.1%) and Caterpillar (CAT 131.91, -6.19, -4.5%) following disappointing earnings reports.</p><p>Today's advance was forged in the afternoon, as the market began to shake off several early concerns and instead rally around the host of companies that did provide good earnings news. Some of those concerns included the Department of Justice announcing a probe into the \"market-leading online platforms,\" the weaker-than-expected eurozone flash manufacturing PMI for July, and Caterpillar lowering its full-year EPS guidance.</p><p>Notable earnings-related gainers included Visa (V 183.33, +2.43, +1.3%), UPS (UPS 114.39, +9.12, +8.7%), Texas Instruments (TXN 129.00, +8.93, +7.4%), Northrop Grumman (NOC 342.97, +18.98, +5.9%), ChipotleMexican Grill (CMG 777.96, +38.36, +5.2%), and Snap (SNAP 17.61, +2.78, +18.8%). The market's ability to find support in these companies was encouraging for investors worried about market leadership being too concentrated among a handful of tech giants.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 communication services (+0.9%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors were the day's best-performing sectors. Semiconductor stocks had a field day, rallying on Texas Instruments' solid results. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index advanced 3.1%, boosting its year-to-date gain to a staggering 40%.</p><p>Conversely, the consumer staples (-0.6%), real estate (-0.1%), and materials (-0.02%) sectors finished lower.</p><p>Separately, for most of the day, the DoJ regulatory threat weighed on shares of Facebook (FB 204.66, +2.30, +1.1%), Amazon (AMZN 2000.81, +6.32, +0.3%), Alphabet (GOOG 1137.81, -8.40, -0.7%), and Apple (AAPL 208.67, -0.17, -0.1%). The FTC also confirmed that Facebook will pay a $5 billion fine for its privacy mishaps, but the stock still rallied heading into its earnings report after the close.</p><p>Although the probe added to the uncertainty facing these companies, the positive mood in the market helped shares recoup a bulk of their early losses. In addition, the fact that interest rates remain low should remain a positive consideration for risk assets.</p><p>U.S. Treasury yields finished lower on Wednesday. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.82%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index was unchanged at 97.72.

Sales for April and March were also revised lower.The key takeaway from the report is that overall sales activity remains tepid despite the fundamental supports of low mortgage rates, low unemployment, and a tight supply of existing homes for sale.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 1.9% following a 1.1% decline in the prior week.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June, the weekly Initial and Continuing claims report, and the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories for June on Thursday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +25.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +20.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.9% YTDRussell 2000 +17.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2119/784. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2197/878.</p><p>15:30 ET</p><p>Dow -100.36 at 27248.83, Nasdaq +65.54 at 8316.95, S&amp;P +11.61 at 3017.08</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] Metals Settlement Prices:Aug gold settled today's session $1.90 higher (+0.1%) at $1423.60/ozSept silver settled today's session $0.15 higher (+0.1%) at $16.63/ozSept copper settled $0.01 higher (+0.3%) at $2.71/lbAgriculture Settlement Prices:Sept corn settled $0.03 lower at $4.22/bushelSept wheat settled $0.10 higher at $4.97/bushelAug soybeans settled $0.03 higher at $8.89/bushelEnergy Settlement Prices:Aug Crude Oil futures fell $0.79 (-1.4%) to $55.93/barrelAug Natural Gas settled $0.07 lower (-3.0%) at $2.21/MMBtuAug RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 lower (-0.4%) at $1.81/gallonAug Heating oil futures settled unch at $1.92/gallon ..NYSE Adv/Dec 799/1.5 bln. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2163/860.</p><p>14:55 ET</p><p>Dow -108.23 at 27240.96, Nasdaq +45.13 at 8296.54, S&amp;P +8.58 at 3014.05</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades higher by 0.3%, nearing its all-time high, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 1.2%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348674387</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HKS1-DYRK-9497-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5035\"/><timeReceived>4:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.6%.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, lost 0.3% amid noticeable losses in Boeing (BA 361.43, -11.54, -3.1%) and Caterpillar (CAT 131.91, -6.19, -4.5%) following disappointing earnings reports.</p><p>Today's advance was forged in the afternoon, as the market began to shake off several early concerns and instead rally around the host of companies that did provide good earnings news. Some of those concerns included the Department of Justice announcing a probe into the \"market-leading online platforms,\" the weaker-than-expected eurozone flash manufacturing PMI for July, and Caterpillar lowering its full-year EPS guidance.</p><p>Notable earnings-related gainers included Visa (V 183.33, +2.43, +1.3%), UPS (UPS 114.39, +9.12, +8.7%), Texas Instruments (TXN 129.00, +8.93, +7.4%), Northrop Grumman (NOC 342.97, +18.98, +5.9%), ChipotleMexican Grill (CMG 777.96, +38.36, +5.2%), and Snap (SNAP 17.61, +2.78, +18.8%). The market's ability to find support in these companies was encouraging for investors worried about market leadership being too concentrated among a handful of tech giants.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 communication services (+0.9%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors were the day's best-performing sectors. Semiconductor stocks had a field day, rallying on Texas Instruments' solid results. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index advanced 3.1%, boosting its year-to-date gain to a staggering 40%.</p><p>Conversely, the consumer staples (-0.6%), real estate (-0.1%), and materials (-0.02%) sectors finished lower.</p><p>Separately, for most of the day, the DoJ regulatory threat weighed on shares of Facebook (FB 204.66, +2.30, +1.1%), Amazon (AMZN 2000.81, +6.32, +0.3%), Alphabet (GOOG 1137.81, -8.40, -0.7%), and Apple (AAPL 208.67, -0.17, -0.1%). The FTC also confirmed that Facebook will pay a $5 billion fine for its privacy mishaps, but the stock still rallied heading into its earnings report after the close.</p><p>Although the probe added to the uncertainty facing these companies, the positive mood in the market helped shares recoup a bulk of their early losses. In addition, the fact that interest rates remain low should remain a positive consideration for risk assets.</p><p>U.S. Treasury yields finished lower on Wednesday. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.82%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index was unchanged at 97.72. WTI crude lost 1.4% to $55.93/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:</p><p>New home sales increased 7.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 646,000 (Briefing.com consensus 660,000) from a downwardly revised 604,000 (from 626,000) in May.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348674037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HMD1-JC8H-K18V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5040\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.6%.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, lost 0.3% amid noticeable losses in Boeing (BA 361.43, -11.54, -3.1%) and Caterpillar (CAT 131.91, -6.19, -4.5%) following disappointing earnings reports.</p><p>Today's advance was forged in the afternoon, as the market began to shake off several early concerns and instead rally around the host of companies that did provide good earnings news. Some of those concerns included the Department of Justice announcing a probe into the \"market-leading online platforms,\" the weaker-than-expected eurozone flash manufacturing PMI for July, and Caterpillar lowering its full-year EPS guidance.</p><p>Notable earnings-related gainers included Visa (V 183.33, +2.43, +1.3%), UPS (UPS 114.39, +9.12, +8.7%), Texas Instruments (TXN 129.00, +8.93, +7.4%), Northrop Grumman (NOC 342.97, +18.98, +5.9%), ChipotleMexican Grill (CMG 777.96, +38.36, +5.2%), and Snap (SNAP 17.61, +2.78, +18.8%). The market's ability to find support in these companies was encouraging for investors worried about market leadership being too concentrated among a handful of tech giants.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 communication services (+0.9%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors were the day's best-performing sectors. Semiconductor stocks had a field day, rallying on Texas Instruments' solid results. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index advanced 3.1%, boosting its year-to-date gain to a staggering 40%.</p><p>Conversely, the consumer staples (-0.6%), real estate (-0.1%), and materials (-0.02%) sectors finished lower.</p><p>Separately, for most of the day, the DoJ regulatory threat weighed on shares of Facebook (FB 204.66, +2.30, +1.1%), Amazon (AMZN 2000.81, +6.32, +0.3%), Alphabet (GOOG 1137.81, -8.40, -0.7%), and Apple (AAPL 208.67, -0.17, -0.1%). The FTC also confirmed that Facebook will pay a $5 billion fine for its privacy mishaps, but the stock still rallied heading into its earnings report after the close.</p><p>Although the probe added to the uncertainty facing these companies, the positive mood in the market helped shares recoup a bulk of their early losses. In addition, the fact that interest rates remain low should remain a positive consideration for risk assets.</p><p>U.S. Treasury yields finished lower on Wednesday. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.82%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index was unchanged at 97.72. WTI crude lost 1.4% to $55.93/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Wednesday's economic data, which included New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:</p><p>New home sales increased 7.0% m/m to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 646,000 (Briefing.com consensus 660,000) from a downwardly revised 604,000 (from 626,000) in May. Sales for April and March were also revised lower.The key takeaway from the report is that overall sales activity remains tepid despite the fundamental supports of low mortgage rates, low unemployment, and a tight supply of existing homes for sale.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 1.9% following a 1.1% decline in the prior week.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June, the weekly Initial and Continuing claims report, and the Advance reports for International Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories for June on Thursday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +25.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +20.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +16.9% YTDRussell 2000 +17.2% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2119/784. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2197/878.</p><p>15:30 ET</p><p>Dow -100.36 at 27248.83, Nasdaq +65.54 at 8316.95, S&amp;P +11.61 at 3017.08</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] Metals Settlement Prices:Aug gold settled today's session $1.90 higher (+0.1%) at $1423.60/ozSept silver settled today's session $0.15 higher (+0.1%) at $16.63/ozSept copper settled $0.01 higher (+0.3%) at $2.71/lbAgriculture Settlement Prices:Sept corn settled $0.03 lower at $4.22/bushelSept wheat settled $0.10 higher at $4.97/bushelAug soybeans settled $0.03 higher at $8.89/bushelEnergy Settlement Prices:Aug Crude Oil futures fell $0.79 (-1.4%) to $55.93/barrelAug Natural Gas settled $0.07 lower (-3.0%) at $2.21/MMBtuAug RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 lower (-0.4%) at $1.81/gallonAug Heating oil futures settled unch at $1.92/gallon ..NYSE Adv/Dec 799/1.5 bln. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2163/860.</p><p>14:55 ET</p><p>Dow -108.23 at 27240.96, Nasdaq +45.13 at 8296.54, S&amp;P +8.58 at 3014.05</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades higher by 0.3%, nearing its all-time high, while the Russell 2000 trades higher by 1.2%.

The Russell 2000 rose 1.6%.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, lost 0.3% amid noticeable losses in Boeing (BA 361.43, -11.54, -3.1%) and Caterpillar (CAT 131.91, -6.19, -4.5%) following disappointing earnings reports.</p><p>Today's advance was forged in the afternoon, as the market began to shake off several early concerns and instead rally around the host of companies that did provide good earnings news. Some of those concerns included the Department of Justice announcing a probe into the \"market-leading online platforms,\" the weaker-than-expected eurozone flash manufacturing PMI for July, and Caterpillar lowering its full-year EPS guidance.</p><p>Notable earnings-related gainers included Visa (V 183.33, +2.43, +1.3%), UPS (UPS 114.39, +9.12, +8.7%), Texas Instruments (TXN 129.00, +8.93, +7.4%), Northrop Grumman (NOC 342.97, +18.98, +5.9%), ChipotleMexican Grill (CMG 777.96, +38.36, +5.2%), and Snap (SNAP 17.61, +2.78, +18.8%). The market's ability to find support in these companies was encouraging for investors worried about market leadership being too concentrated among a handful of tech giants.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 communication services (+0.9%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors were the day's best-performing sectors. Semiconductor stocks had a field day, rallying on Texas Instruments' solid results. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index advanced 3.1%, boosting its year-to-date gain to a staggering 40%.</p><p>Conversely, the consumer staples (-0.6%), real estate (-0.1%), and materials (-0.02%) sectors finished lower.</p><p>Separately, for most of the day, the DoJ regulatory threat weighed on shares of Facebook (FB 204.66, +2.30, +1.1%), Amazon (AMZN 2000.81, +6.32, +0.3%), Alphabet (GOOG 1137.81, -8.40, -0.7%), and Apple (AAPL 208.67, -0.17, -0.1%). The FTC also confirmed that Facebook will pay a $5 billion fine for its privacy mishaps, but the stock still rallied heading into its earnings report after the close.</p><p>Although the probe added to the uncertainty facing these companies, the positive mood in the market helped shares recoup a bulk of their early losses. In addition, the fact that interest rates remain low should remain a positive consideration for risk assets.</p><p>U.S. Treasury yields finished lower on Wednesday. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.82%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index was unchanged at 97.72.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348674037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HKS1-DYRK-9496-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5040\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

Each of the major averages rose at least 2.0%, led by the 2.7% gain in the Nasdaq Composite, and the S&amp;P 500 (+2.1%) climbed back above its 200-day moving average (2775).</p><p>Tuesday's advance was rooted in yesterday's ability in the broader market to withstand heavy losses from Apple (AAPL 179.64, +6.34, +3.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1729.56, +36.87, +2.2%), Alphabet (GOOG 1053.05, +16.82, +1.6%), and Facebook (FB 167.50, +3.35, +2.0%), which all fell on antitrust concerns.</p><p>The turnaround in these mega-cap stocks ensured there was little to impede the rebound effort, especially when given the seemingly supportive comments from the Fed.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, acknowledged the trade uncertainty and the persistently low inflation levels. Although no rate cut was promised, Mr. Powell said that the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the economic expansion, assuring the market that the Fed is still on its side.</p><p>Cyclical sectors led the rally with the S&amp;P 500 information technology (+3.3%), materials (+2.8%), financials (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+2.6%), and industrials (+2.4%) sectors all finishing with gains over 2.0%. The defensive-oriented utilities (unch) and real estate (-0.6%) sectors were left out of the rally.</p><p>Favorable trade headlines were pointed as having an early effect on the market. China said it wants dialogue and mutual respect in talks with the U.S. while speculation arose that President Trump's Mexico tariffs could be blocked by Congress. However, China's comments were largely in-line with prior rhetoric, and The Hill reported that President Trump is weighing a national emergency to implement new tariffs on Mexico.</p><p>Counter to the view that the stock market was oversold on a short-term basis, the Treasury market exhibited weakness on the view that it had gotten overbought on a short-term basis. The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.88%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 2.12%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.10. WTI crude increased 0.5% to $53.53/bbl.</p><p>Separately, Uber (UBER 42.75, +1.50, +3.6%) was rated positively by a host of firms on Tuesday. According to data from Briefing.com, 16 firms initiated the stock with the equivalent of a Buy rating.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's lone economic report, Factory Orders for April:</p><p>Factory orders declined 0.8% m/m in April (Briefing.com consensus -0.9%) following a downwardly revised 1.3% increase (from 1.9%) in March. Excluding transportation, orders increased 0.3%.The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that business investment was weak in April, evidenced by the 1.0% m/m decline in nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the ADP Employment Change report for May, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for May, the Fed's Beige Book for June, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index for May on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +13.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +11.8% YTDRussell 2000 +11.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +8.6% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2365/538. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2312/782.</p><p>15:30 ET</p><p>Dow +452.14 at 25271.92, Nasdaq +170.50 at 7503.49, S&amp;P +50.85 at 2795.3</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] Metals closing prices:Jun gold settled today's session $6.55 higher (+0.5%) at $1329.25/ozJul silver settled $0.02 higher at $14.76/ozJul copper settled $0.02 higher (+0.8%) at $2.67/lbAgriculture Settlement Prices:July corn settled $0.02 higher (+0.5%) at $4.23/bushelJuly wheat settled $0.15 lower (-2.9%) at $5.06/bushelJuly soybeans settled $0.03 higher (+0.3%) at $8.80/bushel Energy settlement prices:July Crude Oil futures settled $0.28 higher (+0.5) to $53.53/barrelJuly Natural Gas settled $0.02 higher (+0.8%) at $2.42/MMBtuJuly RBOB Gasoline settled $0.01 lower (-0.6%) at $1.73/gallonJuly Heating oil futures settled $0.01 higher (+0.6%) at $1.82/gallon ..NYSE Adv/Dec 2245/580. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 2243/805.</p><p>14:55 ET</p><p>Dow +436.07 at 25255.85, Nasdaq +163.33 at 7496.32, S&amp;P +48.30 at 2792.75</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades higher by 1.7%, and the Russell 2000 trades higher by 1.8%.</p><p>The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX 17.52, -1.34, -7.2%) has declined noticeably today as buying conviction for equities holds firm.

The major indices, led by a 2.3% gain in the Russell 2000, are all up at least 1.8% and trading at session highs.</p><p>Today's move began in earnest at the sound of the opening bell, as market participants reacted favorably to headlines that seemingly cooled down the temperature surrounding the trade dispute with China, and provided some cover to think the tariff on imported goods from Mexico could be averted, either due to a deal with the U.S. ahead of the June 10 deadline or a possible vote in Congress to forestall the action, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>In reality, the mood of the market had been lifted on Monday when the S&amp;P 500 exhibited some relative strength in the face of large losses suffered by Alphabet (GOOG 1051.22, +14.99, +1.5%), Facebook (FB 166.54, +2.39, +1.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1723.80, +31.11, +1.8%), and Apple (AAPL 178.68, +5.37, +3.1%), which fell prone to some regulatory angst on the part of investors.</p><p>Those mega-cap stocks have managed to bounce back some today on the belief that any investigation into their business practices is likely to be a drawn out one; moreover, there is some underlying hope that none of the companies would eventually be broken up by the government.</p><p>Their gains today have helped bolster the broader market, yet the buying interest has been widespread. The information technology (+2.6%), financials (+2.3%), industrials (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+2.1%) sectors are all up at least 2.0%. The only sectors not participating today are the defensive-oriented real estate (-1.1%) and utilities (-1.0%) sectors.</p><p>Some of the fallout for the latter two sectors hearkens back to the Treasury market, where yields have risen noticeably across the curve on a counter-trade rooted in the idea that Treasuries were primed for a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.</p><p>The 2-yr note yield has spiked seven basis points to 1.90% while the 10-yr note yield has jumped five basis points to 2.14%.</p><p>The losses in the Treasury market have unfolded despite some softening CPI data out of the eurozone and a 0.8% decline in U.S. factory orders for April.</p><p>The non-response in the Treasury market to otherwise disappointing economic data and some seemingly supportive remarks from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, underscores how the Treasury market is succumbing to the overbought perspective.</p><p>Neither Mr. Powell nor Mr. Evans promised a rate cut soon while speaking at a conference in Chicago, yet both paid heed to the risks of undershooting the 2.0% inflation target and the risks of the trade uncertainty, which has been construed by some today as a dovish policy leaning.</p><p>Separately, there was no mistaking the leaning in the analyst community with respect to Uber (UBER 42.17, +0.92, +2.2%). No fewer than 20 firms initiated coverage of the stock after its IPO, 16 of which had the equivalent of a Buy recommendation.</p><p>12:25 ET</p><p>Dow +403.11 at 25222.89, Nasdaq +141.44 at 7474.43, S&amp;P +42.97 at 2787.42</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover near their recently established session highs.

Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

The May reading is the lowest since October 2016. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a deceleration in national manufacturing activity that will contribute to the burgeoning growth concerns for the U.S. economy. According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1860/990. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1654/1418.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345219717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8C-0J11-JC8H-K1P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4683\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

Each of the major averages rose at least 2.0%, led by the 2.7% gain in the Nasdaq Composite, and the S&amp;P 500 (+2.1%) climbed back above its 200-day moving average (2775).</p><p>Tuesday's advance was rooted in yesterday's ability in the broader market to withstand heavy losses from Apple (AAPL 179.64, +6.34, +3.7%), Amazon (AMZN 1729.56, +36.87, +2.2%), Alphabet (GOOG 1053.05, +16.82, +1.6%), and Facebook (FB 167.50, +3.35, +2.0%), which all fell on antitrust concerns.</p><p>The turnaround in these mega-cap stocks ensured there was little to impede the rebound effort, especially when given the seemingly supportive comments from the Fed.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, acknowledged the trade uncertainty and the persistently low inflation levels. Although no rate cut was promised, Mr. Powell said that the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the economic expansion, assuring the market that the Fed is still on its side.</p><p>Cyclical sectors led the rally with the S&amp;P 500 information technology (+3.3%), materials (+2.8%), financials (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+2.6%), and industrials (+2.4%) sectors all finishing with gains over 2.0%. The defensive-oriented utilities (unch) and real estate (-0.6%) sectors were left out of the rally.</p><p>Favorable trade headlines were pointed as having an early effect on the market. China said it wants dialogue and mutual respect in talks with the U.S. while speculation arose that President Trump's Mexico tariffs could be blocked by Congress. However, China's comments were largely in-line with prior rhetoric, and The Hill reported that President Trump is weighing a national emergency to implement new tariffs on Mexico.</p><p>Counter to the view that the stock market was oversold on a short-term basis, the Treasury market exhibited weakness on the view that it had gotten overbought on a short-term basis. The 2-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.88%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 2.12%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.10.

CSCO typically reports 5 minutes after the close. The current S&amp;P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.74 (down 11% yr/yr) and revenue of $12.09 bln (down 10% yr/yr). Cisco typically guides for EPS and revenue (on a percentage basis) for the next quarter. Last quarter, Cisco guided to Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.72-0.74 and a revenue decline of -11.5% to -8.5%, which computes as $11.884-12.287 bln. Cisco tends to be conservative with guidance so we're not surprised to see analysts on the higher end of EPS guidance. Current guidance for non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is 31.5-32.5%. Cisco is a particularly important tech name to watch with earnings. Because it's so large and touches so many areas, it's a great barometer to get a general sense for enterprise sending levels on IT. It's also the first big tech name to report that includes the month of July, so we should get a better sense of how briskly enterprises are spending this summer. Last quarter, Cisco reported nice upside, but was still pretty harshly impacted by the pandemic. Infrastructure Platform sales were down 15% due to supply chain challenges. Switching and routing revenue also declined. Applications segment sales were down 5%, however, this segment saw strong double-digit growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. The main bright spot was booming demand for its Webex video conferencing platform which in April was running at 3x February's capacity. Something that stood out to us on the last call was Cisco saying that the pandemic had caused a lot of customers to realize they have a lot of aged equipment. Many of those customers have said this is a wakeup call and the crisis has provided cover to talk to senior leadership about upgrading to more modernized infrastructure. We'll see if that panned out in Q4. In terms of how Cisco performs relative to consensus, it typically beats modestly on EPS in the $0.01-0.03 range with modest revenue upside. As such, the $0.08 beat in Q3 was unusually strong but that may have been caused by analysts being overly pessimistic due to the pandemic. CSCO has not missed on EPS or revs in the past five years, so if it did so, that would be notable. (PVIEW)</p><p>14:05 ET</p><p>Kornit Digital is benefiting from an inflection point in the textile industry:</p><p>Kornit Digital (KRNT +4%) is printing a nice gain today on a strong Q2 report and a bullish outlook for 2H20. The company, which makes digital printing systems for the apparel and textile industries, has been hit hard by the pandemic but it's clearly showing signs of emerging from the downturn. KRNT reported a loss in Q2 and revenue fell 17.4% yr/yr, but both headline numbers were better than expected. What stood out to us most was KRNT saying it believes it's in the midst of a sharp V-shaped recovery. KRNT remains very confident in its business outlook not only for 2H20 but into 2021 as well. While KRNT did not provide specific 2H20 guidance, the company did raise its 2H20 revenue growth outlook to the low teens from prior guidance of high-single-digits. In addition to earnings, KRNT also announced the acquisition of Custom Gateway, a provider of cloud-based software workflow systems for on-demand production business models.</p><p>There have been a lot of cloud computing names that have surged during the pandemic as businesses adapt to the pandemic. We would add KRNT to that list. The vast majority of printed textile industry output is still made using analog print methods. Digital printing accounts for just 3% of output but this number is growing quickly and KRNT is a pure play on that trend.</p><p>What stands out to us is that KRNT says the broader market disruption of the last few months has created an inflection point in the textile industry, further accelerating the shift to e-commerce. The pandemic is driving an increased need for on-demand digital production and decoration of textiles.</p><p>In sum, KRNT is not the first name you might think of as a pandemic beneficiary, but it seems the pandemic-fueled rapid move to ecommerce is reaching all the way to the old school textile/apparel industry. With KRNT's bullish comment on 2H20 and 2021, it seems like business is picking up nicely.</p><p>11:51 ET</p><p>Lyft earnings preview - Uber's report sets low bar to hurdle; focus turns to 2H20 rebound:</p><p>After the close today, Lyft (LYFT) is scheduled to report 2Q20 results. Following Uber's (UBER) dreary report on August 6, which included a 66% nose-dive in mobility revenue, expectations are low for LYFT's earnings report. The muted sentiment is reflected in LYFT's stock price, which is down nearly 30% on the year.</p><p>Analysts are expecting LYFT to report a loss per share of ($0.97) on revenue of $349.4 mln, equating to a yr/yr decline of nearly 60%.UBER's high-growth food delivery business has helped insulate the company from the virus-induced plunge in ride-sharing. As a ride-sharing pure-play, LYFT doesn't enjoy that benefit.On the other hand, LYFT's cost structure is more simplified and the company has managed expenses well. Last quarter, LYFT slashed R&amp;D expenses by 60%, enabling the company to generate EBITDA of ($85) mln, representing a 61% yr/yr improvement.</p><p>On June 2, LYFT provided a business update, disclosing that rides for the month of May increased 26% compared to April, when rides plummeted by 70%. The improvement in rides coincided with the reopening of businesses within local economies. The positive momentum likely stalled in mid-to-late June as virus cases increased, causing many local governments to reinstate strict social distancing rules.</p><p>In the same press release, LYFT stated that Adjusted EBITDA loss for Q2 is not expected to exceed $325 mln if average daily ride-share volume in June is unchanged versus May levels. That forecast equated to a ~10% improvement compared to LYFT's prior guidance for adjusted EBITDA loss to not exceed $360 mln.</p><p>Ever since LYFT went public in March of 2019, investors have been focused on the company's path to profitability. Before the pandemic hit, the company believed it would reach profitability on an EBITDA basis by the end of 2021.</p><p>The virus has likely pushed that timeline out, but the company has levers to pull that can keep it moving in the right direction. Through lower payroll and insurance costs, LYFT believes it can shed an additional $300 mln beyond its original 2020 expectations.</p><p>The wild card is whether the recent ruling in California, which requires LYFT and UBER to stop classifying their drivers as independent contractors, will create a major headwind. Both companies will appeal the decision and the matter will also be included on voting ballots in November.</p><p>If the appeal is unsuccessful and if voters agree with the state that drivers should be classified as employees, LYFT and UBER's expenses will sharply rise because the companies will need to provide costly benefits.</p><p>Lastly, a meaningful recovery for the ride-sharing business largely rests on the widespread availability of a vaccine. There has been plenty of positive news on the vaccine front recently, offering hope for a rebound in ride volume later this year.</p><p>11:15 ET</p><p>Tesla joins the stock split party, will others follow? Maybe AMZN?: Tesla (TSLA +8%) is zooming higher as the electric car maker declared a 5-for-1 stock split last night. We know it should not matter what the actual price of the stock is as the valuation metrics and earnings are computed on a per share basis. But it does matter to a lot of investors, especially retail investors who buy in smaller increments or just psychologically would rather own a $300 stock instead of a $1,500 stock. Tesla is actually the second huge name to announce a split in as many weeks as Apple (AAPL) declared a 4-for-1 split on July 30 along with its JunQ earnings report. With Apple and now Tesla, maybe there is a trend starting where companies are becoming more open to stock splits.Of course, the big name most people would like to see split is Amazon (AMZN), which trades above $3000. BKNG ($1,818), GOOG ($1,511), AZO ($1,192), CMG ($1,163) and NFLX ($476) are other names we think are ripe for a split.</p><p>10:20 ET</p><p>Brinker is satisfying investors' appetite with a solid JunQ result and SepQ guidance:</p><p>Brinker Intl (EAT +4%) is serving up some delicious Q4 (Jun) results for investors. We had concerns regarding how the pandemic would impact EAT since it is an operator of casual restaurant chains, including its flagship Chili's brand. While the company certainly took a hit from restaurants closing due to the pandemic, the loss was much narrower than expected. Overall, it was a mixed quarter as the adjusted loss of $(0.88) per share was much better than the $(1.37) consensus although revenue was a bit light of expectations. The best news was the guidance for Q1 (Sep) as the loss of $(0.40)-$(0.25) was a good bit narrower than consensus of $(0.56). Q1 comps are expected to be down in the low to mid-teens, a nice improvement from -38.6% comps in Q4. It's Just Wings, a virtual offering through EAT's partnership with Doordash, launched nationally in 1,050 company-owned restaurants on June 23. It's Just Wings sales are included in comps for restaurants operating the virtual brand.</p><p>Of all the casual restaurant chains, we think EAT is among the best positioned to ride out the pandemic since EAT focuses on value offerings. For example, its value-priced 2-for-$25 menu has been a hit with consumers. Also, Chili's has really stepped up its digital and delivery offerings in recent quarters, just in time for the pandemic.</p><p>We also think this It's Just Wings virtual delivery-only offering is pretty genius and should be a nice tailwind for comps in coming quarters. What's smart about the offering is that it has a simple, quick to prepare menu and the wings are prepared using existing capacity at Chili's kitchens, so there are no upfront costs. Also, Wingstop (WING) has seen a surge of sales during the pandemic and we see this offering as tapping into that wing potential.</p><p>Overall, this was a solid quarter. It did not blow us away but the EPS upside and especially the SepQ guidance provides reassurance that EAT is handling the pandemic pretty well.</p><p>09:51 ET</p><p>Moderna lands major vaccine supply agreement with U.S government, lifting shares higher: Positive vaccine-related headlines have allowed investors to look past gloomy economic data in anticipation of an eventual return to normalcy. Today, the stock market received more good news: the U.S government has secured a supply agreement with Moderna (MRNA) for the company's COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273.</p><p>The order calls for an initial delivery of 100 mln doses with the option to purchase up to 400 mln more doses. In total, the contract is worth up to $1.525 bln.</p><p>After rocketing higher by as much as 385% this year, shares of MRNA have cooled off over the past few weeks. Encouraging clinical trial data from other COVID-19 vaccine producers like Pfizer (PFE)/BioNTech(BNTX) and AstraZeneca (AZN)/Oxford University, combined with profit-taking and valuation concerns, tentatively stymied MRNA's rally.</p><p>However, today's news has the stock back in rally mode.</p><p>The near-term outlook does indeed look bright for MRNA. While the company will likely ultimately share the stage with other pharmaceutical companies, MRNA is in good position to launch a vaccine first.</p><p>When the company reported Q2 results on August 5, CEO Stphane Bancel stated that enrollment for MRNA's Phase 3 study was on track to be completed in September. Assuming that the company reaches that goal, Bancel believes that trial data will be available in October and November.</p><p>MRNA appears to be neck-in-neck with the PFE/BNTX and AZN/Oxford teams, both of which are also conducting late-stage trials. During PFE's earnings conference call on July 28, CEO Albert Bourla commented that he expects the vaccine (BNT162b2) to be ready to seek emergency use authorization, or some form of regulatory approval, as early as this October.</p><p>Whether MRNA wins this race remains to be seen. What's more certain, though, is that the company is in solid financial condition, thanks to the flood of capital it has obtained.</p><p>MRNA ended Q2 with $3.1 bln in cash, and the company received ~$400 mln of customer deposits for the potential supply of mRNA-1273. That amount is prior to today's agreement with the U.S. government.</p><p>Based on a presumed regulatory approval, analysts are predicting that MRNA will generate revenue of $4.5 bln in FY21, lifting the company into profitability. The top-line estimate translates into a 1-year forward P/S of about 6x, which is reasonable in our view. The primary risk, though, is that the stock has already priced in FDA approval for the vaccine.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-369305906</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K4-BXS1-JC8H-K4GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2192\"/><timeReceived>2:42 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

CSCO typically reports 5 minutes after the close. The current S&amp;P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.74 (down 11% yr/yr) and revenue of $12.09 bln (down 10% yr/yr). Cisco typically guides for EPS and revenue (on a percentage basis) for the next quarter. Last quarter, Cisco guided to Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.72-0.74 and a revenue decline of -11.5% to -8.5%, which computes as $11.884-12.287 bln. Cisco tends to be conservative with guidance so we're not surprised to see analysts on the higher end of EPS guidance. Current guidance for non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is 31.5-32.5%. Cisco is a particularly important tech name to watch with earnings. Because it's so large and touches so many areas, it's a great barometer to get a general sense for enterprise sending levels on IT. It's also the first big tech name to report that includes the month of July, so we should get a better sense of how briskly enterprises are spending this summer. Last quarter, Cisco reported nice upside, but was still pretty harshly impacted by the pandemic. Infrastructure Platform sales were down 15% due to supply chain challenges. Switching and routing revenue also declined. Applications segment sales were down 5%, however, this segment saw strong double-digit growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. The main bright spot was booming demand for its Webex video conferencing platform which in April was running at 3x February's capacity. Something that stood out to us on the last call was Cisco saying that the pandemic had caused a lot of customers to realize they have a lot of aged equipment. Many of those customers have said this is a wakeup call and the crisis has provided cover to talk to senior leadership about upgrading to more modernized infrastructure. We'll see if that panned out in Q4. In terms of how Cisco performs relative to consensus, it typically beats modestly on EPS in the $0.01-0.03 range with modest revenue upside. As such, the $0.08 beat in Q3 was unusually strong but that may have been caused by analysts being overly pessimistic due to the pandemic. CSCO has not missed on EPS or revs in the past five years, so if it did so, that would be notable. (PVIEW)</p><p>14:05 ET</p><p>Kornit Digital is benefiting from an inflection point in the textile industry:</p><p>Kornit Digital (KRNT +4%) is printing a nice gain today on a strong Q2 report and a bullish outlook for 2H20. The company, which makes digital printing systems for the apparel and textile industries, has been hit hard by the pandemic but it's clearly showing signs of emerging from the downturn. KRNT reported a loss in Q2 and revenue fell 17.4% yr/yr, but both headline numbers were better than expected. What stood out to us most was KRNT saying it believes it's in the midst of a sharp V-shaped recovery. KRNT remains very confident in its business outlook not only for 2H20 but into 2021 as well. While KRNT did not provide specific 2H20 guidance, the company did raise its 2H20 revenue growth outlook to the low teens from prior guidance of high-single-digits. In addition to earnings, KRNT also announced the acquisition of Custom Gateway, a provider of cloud-based software workflow systems for on-demand production business models.</p><p>There have been a lot of cloud computing names that have surged during the pandemic as businesses adapt to the pandemic. We would add KRNT to that list. The vast majority of printed textile industry output is still made using analog print methods. Digital printing accounts for just 3% of output but this number is growing quickly and KRNT is a pure play on that trend.</p><p>What stands out to us is that KRNT says the broader market disruption of the last few months has created an inflection point in the textile industry, further accelerating the shift to e-commerce. The pandemic is driving an increased need for on-demand digital production and decoration of textiles.</p><p>In sum, KRNT is not the first name you might think of as a pandemic beneficiary, but it seems the pandemic-fueled rapid move to ecommerce is reaching all the way to the old school textile/apparel industry. With KRNT's bullish comment on 2H20 and 2021, it seems like business is picking up nicely.</p><p>11:51 ET</p><p>Lyft earnings preview - Uber's report sets low bar to hurdle; focus turns to 2H20 rebound:</p><p>After the close today, Lyft (LYFT) is scheduled to report 2Q20 results. Following Uber's (UBER) dreary report on August 6, which included a 66% nose-dive in mobility revenue, expectations are low for LYFT's earnings report. The muted sentiment is reflected in LYFT's stock price, which is down nearly 30% on the year.</p><p>Analysts are expecting LYFT to report a loss per share of ($0.97) on revenue of $349.4 mln, equating to a yr/yr decline of nearly 60%.UBER's high-growth food delivery business has helped insulate the company from the virus-induced plunge in ride-sharing. As a ride-sharing pure-play, LYFT doesn't enjoy that benefit.On the other hand, LYFT's cost structure is more simplified and the company has managed expenses well. Last quarter, LYFT slashed R&amp;D expenses by 60%, enabling the company to generate EBITDA of ($85) mln, representing a 61% yr/yr improvement.</p><p>On June 2, LYFT provided a business update, disclosing that rides for the month of May increased 26% compared to April, when rides plummeted by 70%. The improvement in rides coincided with the reopening of businesses within local economies. The positive momentum likely stalled in mid-to-late June as virus cases increased, causing many local governments to reinstate strict social distancing rules.</p><p>In the same press release, LYFT stated that Adjusted EBITDA loss for Q2 is not expected to exceed $325 mln if average daily ride-share volume in June is unchanged versus May levels. That forecast equated to a ~10% improvement compared to LYFT's prior guidance for adjusted EBITDA loss to not exceed $360 mln.</p><p>Ever since LYFT went public in March of 2019, investors have been focused on the company's path to profitability. Before the pandemic hit, the company believed it would reach profitability on an EBITDA basis by the end of 2021.</p><p>The virus has likely pushed that timeline out, but the company has levers to pull that can keep it moving in the right direction. Through lower payroll and insurance costs, LYFT believes it can shed an additional $300 mln beyond its original 2020 expectations.</p><p>The wild card is whether the recent ruling in California, which requires LYFT and UBER to stop classifying their drivers as independent contractors, will create a major headwind. Both companies will appeal the decision and the matter will also be included on voting ballots in November.</p><p>If the appeal is unsuccessful and if voters agree with the state that drivers should be classified as employees, LYFT and UBER's expenses will sharply rise because the companies will need to provide costly benefits.</p><p>Lastly, a meaningful recovery for the ride-sharing business largely rests on the widespread availability of a vaccine. There has been plenty of positive news on the vaccine front recently, offering hope for a rebound in ride volume later this year.</p><p>11:15 ET</p><p>Tesla joins the stock split party, will others follow? Maybe AMZN?: Tesla (TSLA +8%) is zooming higher as the electric car maker declared a 5-for-1 stock split last night. We know it should not matter what the actual price of the stock is as the valuation metrics and earnings are computed on a per share basis. But it does matter to a lot of investors, especially retail investors who buy in smaller increments or just psychologically would rather own a $300 stock instead of a $1,500 stock. Tesla is actually the second huge name to announce a split in as many weeks as Apple (AAPL) declared a 4-for-1 split on July 30 along with its JunQ earnings report. With Apple and now Tesla, maybe there is a trend starting where companies are becoming more open to stock splits.Of course, the big name most people would like to see split is Amazon (AMZN), which trades above $3000. BKNG ($1,818), GOOG ($1,511), AZO ($1,192), CMG ($1,163) and NFLX ($476) are other names we think are ripe for a split.</p><p>10:20 ET</p><p>Brinker is satisfying investors' appetite with a solid JunQ result and SepQ guidance:</p><p>Brinker Intl (EAT +4%) is serving up some delicious Q4 (Jun) results for investors. We had concerns regarding how the pandemic would impact EAT since it is an operator of casual restaurant chains, including its flagship Chili's brand. While the company certainly took a hit from restaurants closing due to the pandemic, the loss was much narrower than expected. Overall, it was a mixed quarter as the adjusted loss of $(0.88) per share was much better than the $(1.37) consensus although revenue was a bit light of expectations. The best news was the guidance for Q1 (Sep) as the loss of $(0.40)-$(0.25) was a good bit narrower than consensus of $(0.56). Q1 comps are expected to be down in the low to mid-teens, a nice improvement from -38.6% comps in Q4. It's Just Wings, a virtual offering through EAT's partnership with Doordash, launched nationally in 1,050 company-owned restaurants on June 23. It's Just Wings sales are included in comps for restaurants operating the virtual brand.</p><p>Of all the casual restaurant chains, we think EAT is among the best positioned to ride out the pandemic since EAT focuses on value offerings. For example, its value-priced 2-for-$25 menu has been a hit with consumers. Also, Chili's has really stepped up its digital and delivery offerings in recent quarters, just in time for the pandemic.</p><p>We also think this It's Just Wings virtual delivery-only offering is pretty genius and should be a nice tailwind for comps in coming quarters. What's smart about the offering is that it has a simple, quick to prepare menu and the wings are prepared using existing capacity at Chili's kitchens, so there are no upfront costs. Also, Wingstop (WING) has seen a surge of sales during the pandemic and we see this offering as tapping into that wing potential.</p><p>Overall, this was a solid quarter. It did not blow us away but the EPS upside and especially the SepQ guidance provides reassurance that EAT is handling the pandemic pretty well.</p><p>09:51 ET</p><p>Moderna lands major vaccine supply agreement with U.S government, lifting shares higher: Positive vaccine-related headlines have allowed investors to look past gloomy economic data in anticipation of an eventual return to normalcy. Today, the stock market received more good news: the U.S government has secured a supply agreement with Moderna (MRNA) for the company's COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273.</p><p>The order calls for an initial delivery of 100 mln doses with the option to purchase up to 400 mln more doses. In total, the contract is worth up to $1.525 bln.</p><p>After rocketing higher by as much as 385% this year, shares of MRNA have cooled off over the past few weeks. Encouraging clinical trial data from other COVID-19 vaccine producers like Pfizer (PFE)/BioNTech(BNTX) and AstraZeneca (AZN)/Oxford University, combined with profit-taking and valuation concerns, tentatively stymied MRNA's rally.</p><p>However, today's news has the stock back in rally mode.</p><p>The near-term outlook does indeed look bright for MRNA. While the company will likely ultimately share the stage with other pharmaceutical companies, MRNA is in good position to launch a vaccine first.</p><p>When the company reported Q2 results on August 5, CEO Stphane Bancel stated that enrollment for MRNA's Phase 3 study was on track to be completed in September. Assuming that the company reaches that goal, Bancel believes that trial data will be available in October and November.</p><p>MRNA appears to be neck-in-neck with the PFE/BNTX and AZN/Oxford teams, both of which are also conducting late-stage trials. During PFE's earnings conference call on July 28, CEO Albert Bourla commented that he expects the vaccine (BNT162b2) to be ready to seek emergency use authorization, or some form of regulatory approval, as early as this October.</p><p>Whether MRNA wins this race remains to be seen. What's more certain, though, is that the company is in solid financial condition, thanks to the flood of capital it has obtained.</p><p>MRNA ended Q2 with $3.1 bln in cash, and the company received ~$400 mln of customer deposits for the potential supply of mRNA-1273. That amount is prior to today's agreement with the U.S. government.</p><p>Based on a presumed regulatory approval, analysts are predicting that MRNA will generate revenue of $4.5 bln in FY21, lifting the company into profitability. The top-line estimate translates into a 1-year forward P/S of about 6x, which is reasonable in our view. The primary risk, though, is that the stock has already priced in FDA approval for the vaccine.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-369308116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K4-BXS1-JC8H-K4H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2192\"/><timeReceived>4:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

CSCO typically reports 5 minutes after the close. The current S&amp;P CapitalIQ consensus is for adjusted EPS of $0.74 (down 11% yr/yr) and revenue of $12.09 bln (down 10% yr/yr). Cisco typically guides for EPS and revenue (on a percentage basis) for the next quarter. Last quarter, Cisco guided to Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.72-0.74 and a revenue decline of -11.5% to -8.5%, which computes as $11.884-12.287 bln. Cisco tends to be conservative with guidance so we're not surprised to see analysts on the higher end of EPS guidance. Current guidance for non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is 31.5-32.5%. Cisco is a particularly important tech name to watch with earnings. Because it's so large and touches so many areas, it's a great barometer to get a general sense for enterprise sending levels on IT. It's also the first big tech name to report that includes the month of July, so we should get a better sense of how briskly enterprises are spending this summer. Last quarter, Cisco reported nice upside, but was still pretty harshly impacted by the pandemic. Infrastructure Platform sales were down 15% due to supply chain challenges. Switching and routing revenue also declined. Applications segment sales were down 5%, however, this segment saw strong double-digit growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. The main bright spot was booming demand for its Webex video conferencing platform which in April was running at 3x February's capacity. Something that stood out to us on the last call was Cisco saying that the pandemic had caused a lot of customers to realize they have a lot of aged equipment. Many of those customers have said this is a wakeup call and the crisis has provided cover to talk to senior leadership about upgrading to more modernized infrastructure. We'll see if that panned out in Q4. In terms of how Cisco performs relative to consensus, it typically beats modestly on EPS in the $0.01-0.03 range with modest revenue upside. As such, the $0.08 beat in Q3 was unusually strong but that may have been caused by analysts being overly pessimistic due to the pandemic. CSCO has not missed on EPS or revs in the past five years, so if it did so, that would be notable. (PVIEW)</p><p>14:05 ET</p><p>Kornit Digital is benefiting from an inflection point in the textile industry:</p><p>Kornit Digital (KRNT +4%) is printing a nice gain today on a strong Q2 report and a bullish outlook for 2H20. The company, which makes digital printing systems for the apparel and textile industries, has been hit hard by the pandemic but it's clearly showing signs of emerging from the downturn. KRNT reported a loss in Q2 and revenue fell 17.4% yr/yr, but both headline numbers were better than expected. What stood out to us most was KRNT saying it believes it's in the midst of a sharp V-shaped recovery. KRNT remains very confident in its business outlook not only for 2H20 but into 2021 as well. While KRNT did not provide specific 2H20 guidance, the company did raise its 2H20 revenue growth outlook to the low teens from prior guidance of high-single-digits. In addition to earnings, KRNT also announced the acquisition of Custom Gateway, a provider of cloud-based software workflow systems for on-demand production business models.</p><p>There have been a lot of cloud computing names that have surged during the pandemic as businesses adapt to the pandemic. We would add KRNT to that list. The vast majority of printed textile industry output is still made using analog print methods. Digital printing accounts for just 3% of output but this number is growing quickly and KRNT is a pure play on that trend.</p><p>What stands out to us is that KRNT says the broader market disruption of the last few months has created an inflection point in the textile industry, further accelerating the shift to e-commerce. The pandemic is driving an increased need for on-demand digital production and decoration of textiles.</p><p>In sum, KRNT is not the first name you might think of as a pandemic beneficiary, but it seems the pandemic-fueled rapid move to ecommerce is reaching all the way to the old school textile/apparel industry. With KRNT's bullish comment on 2H20 and 2021, it seems like business is picking up nicely.</p><p>11:51 ET</p><p>Lyft earnings preview - Uber's report sets low bar to hurdle; focus turns to 2H20 rebound:</p><p>After the close today, Lyft (LYFT) is scheduled to report 2Q20 results. Following Uber's (UBER) dreary report on August 6, which included a 66% nose-dive in mobility revenue, expectations are low for LYFT's earnings report. The muted sentiment is reflected in LYFT's stock price, which is down nearly 30% on the year.</p><p>Analysts are expecting LYFT to report a loss per share of ($0.97) on revenue of $349.4 mln, equating to a yr/yr decline of nearly 60%.UBER's high-growth food delivery business has helped insulate the company from the virus-induced plunge in ride-sharing. As a ride-sharing pure-play, LYFT doesn't enjoy that benefit.On the other hand, LYFT's cost structure is more simplified and the company has managed expenses well. Last quarter, LYFT slashed R&amp;D expenses by 60%, enabling the company to generate EBITDA of ($85) mln, representing a 61% yr/yr improvement.</p><p>On June 2, LYFT provided a business update, disclosing that rides for the month of May increased 26% compared to April, when rides plummeted by 70%. The improvement in rides coincided with the reopening of businesses within local economies. The positive momentum likely stalled in mid-to-late June as virus cases increased, causing many local governments to reinstate strict social distancing rules.</p><p>In the same press release, LYFT stated that Adjusted EBITDA loss for Q2 is not expected to exceed $325 mln if average daily ride-share volume in June is unchanged versus May levels. That forecast equated to a ~10% improvement compared to LYFT's prior guidance for adjusted EBITDA loss to not exceed $360 mln.</p><p>Ever since LYFT went public in March of 2019, investors have been focused on the company's path to profitability. Before the pandemic hit, the company believed it would reach profitability on an EBITDA basis by the end of 2021.</p><p>The virus has likely pushed that timeline out, but the company has levers to pull that can keep it moving in the right direction. Through lower payroll and insurance costs, LYFT believes it can shed an additional $300 mln beyond its original 2020 expectations.</p><p>The wild card is whether the recent ruling in California, which requires LYFT and UBER to stop classifying their drivers as independent contractors, will create a major headwind. Both companies will appeal the decision and the matter will also be included on voting ballots in November.</p><p>If the appeal is unsuccessful and if voters agree with the state that drivers should be classified as employees, LYFT and UBER's expenses will sharply rise because the companies will need to provide costly benefits.</p><p>Lastly, a meaningful recovery for the ride-sharing business largely rests on the widespread availability of a vaccine. There has been plenty of positive news on the vaccine front recently, offering hope for a rebound in ride volume later this year.</p><p>11:15 ET</p><p>Tesla joins the stock split party, will others follow? Maybe AMZN?: Tesla (TSLA +8%) is zooming higher as the electric car maker declared a 5-for-1 stock split last night. We know it should not matter what the actual price of the stock is as the valuation metrics and earnings are computed on a per share basis. But it does matter to a lot of investors, especially retail investors who buy in smaller increments or just psychologically would rather own a $300 stock instead of a $1,500 stock. Tesla is actually the second huge name to announce a split in as many weeks as Apple (AAPL) declared a 4-for-1 split on July 30 along with its JunQ earnings report. With Apple and now Tesla, maybe there is a trend starting where companies are becoming more open to stock splits.Of course, the big name most people would like to see split is Amazon (AMZN), which trades above $3000. BKNG ($1,818), GOOG ($1,511), AZO ($1,192), CMG ($1,163) and NFLX ($476) are other names we think are ripe for a split.</p><p>10:20 ET</p><p>Brinker is satisfying investors' appetite with a solid JunQ result and SepQ guidance:</p><p>Brinker Intl (EAT +4%) is serving up some delicious Q4 (Jun) results for investors. We had concerns regarding how the pandemic would impact EAT since it is an operator of casual restaurant chains, including its flagship Chili's brand. While the company certainly took a hit from restaurants closing due to the pandemic, the loss was much narrower than expected. Overall, it was a mixed quarter as the adjusted loss of $(0.88) per share was much better than the $(1.37) consensus although revenue was a bit light of expectations. The best news was the guidance for Q1 (Sep) as the loss of $(0.40)-$(0.25) was a good bit narrower than consensus of $(0.56). Q1 comps are expected to be down in the low to mid-teens, a nice improvement from -38.6% comps in Q4. It's Just Wings, a virtual offering through EAT's partnership with Doordash, launched nationally in 1,050 company-owned restaurants on June 23. It's Just Wings sales are included in comps for restaurants operating the virtual brand.</p><p>Of all the casual restaurant chains, we think EAT is among the best positioned to ride out the pandemic since EAT focuses on value offerings. For example, its value-priced 2-for-$25 menu has been a hit with consumers. Also, Chili's has really stepped up its digital and delivery offerings in recent quarters, just in time for the pandemic.</p><p>We also think this It's Just Wings virtual delivery-only offering is pretty genius and should be a nice tailwind for comps in coming quarters. What's smart about the offering is that it has a simple, quick to prepare menu and the wings are prepared using existing capacity at Chili's kitchens, so there are no upfront costs. Also, Wingstop (WING) has seen a surge of sales during the pandemic and we see this offering as tapping into that wing potential.</p><p>Overall, this was a solid quarter. It did not blow us away but the EPS upside and especially the SepQ guidance provides reassurance that EAT is handling the pandemic pretty well.</p><p>09:51 ET</p><p>Moderna lands major vaccine supply agreement with U.S government, lifting shares higher: Positive vaccine-related headlines have allowed investors to look past gloomy economic data in anticipation of an eventual return to normalcy. Today, the stock market received more good news: the U.S government has secured a supply agreement with Moderna (MRNA) for the company's COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273.</p><p>The order calls for an initial delivery of 100 mln doses with the option to purchase up to 400 mln more doses. In total, the contract is worth up to $1.525 bln.</p><p>After rocketing higher by as much as 385% this year, shares of MRNA have cooled off over the past few weeks. Encouraging clinical trial data from other COVID-19 vaccine producers like Pfizer (PFE)/BioNTech(BNTX) and AstraZeneca (AZN)/Oxford University, combined with profit-taking and valuation concerns, tentatively stymied MRNA's rally.</p><p>However, today's news has the stock back in rally mode.</p><p>The near-term outlook does indeed look bright for MRNA. While the company will likely ultimately share the stage with other pharmaceutical companies, MRNA is in good position to launch a vaccine first.</p><p>When the company reported Q2 results on August 5, CEO Stphane Bancel stated that enrollment for MRNA's Phase 3 study was on track to be completed in September. Assuming that the company reaches that goal, Bancel believes that trial data will be available in October and November.</p><p>MRNA appears to be neck-in-neck with the PFE/BNTX and AZN/Oxford teams, both of which are also conducting late-stage trials. During PFE's earnings conference call on July 28, CEO Albert Bourla commented that he expects the vaccine (BNT162b2) to be ready to seek emergency use authorization, or some form of regulatory approval, as early as this October.</p><p>Whether MRNA wins this race remains to be seen. What's more certain, though, is that the company is in solid financial condition, thanks to the flood of capital it has obtained.</p><p>MRNA ended Q2 with $3.1 bln in cash, and the company received ~$400 mln of customer deposits for the potential supply of mRNA-1273. That amount is prior to today's agreement with the U.S. government.</p><p>Based on a presumed regulatory approval, analysts are predicting that MRNA will generate revenue of $4.5 bln in FY21, lifting the company into profitability. The top-line estimate translates into a 1-year forward P/S of about 6x, which is reasonable in our view. The primary risk, though, is that the stock has already priced in FDA approval for the vaccine.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-369306960</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K4-BXS1-JC8H-K4GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2192\"/><timeReceived>3:17 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

Current CapitalIQ consensus for EPS is $1.11 and for revenue it's $18.55 bln. Intel typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter in the press release. In April, Intel guided to Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approx. $1.10 and revenue of approx. $18.50 bln. Expectations for semiconductor companies are running high this earnings season as several companies have reported strong results (like TXN on Tuesday and MU in late June) while several others have increased guidance in the past couple of weeks or so, including ADI, MXIM, IMOS, FORM, MXL, XLNX. In fairness, Intel is not a direct comparison as it does more than make chips. INTC has been transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, the latter of which accounted for 48% of revenue in 2019. Its data center segment is focused on cloud computing, network infrastructure, and intelligent edge applications as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G. The PC side is not seeing a lot of growth but Intel recently began shipping its 10nm Intel Core processors, which feature a new core architecture. INTC is on track to launch its first 7nm-based product, a discrete GPU, at the end of 2021. Intel's top line growth tends to be pretty modest. However, the company also tends to be consistent relative to consensus estimates as it has not missed on EPS in any quarter over the past five years. And its EPS beats have been getting larger in recent quarters, with four consecutive double digit EPS beats. Overall, some big tech names have reported, but we are still early in the tech reporting cycle.We think Intel should have pretty good results. IBM had a nice quarter and said large enterprise customers are still spending. TXN's quarter is a good sign for Intel as well. Also, Microsoft (MSFT) had a mixed quarter, but its consumer/PC side did well with more people working at home. This is good news for Intel's PC business.</p><p>14:14 ET</p><p>AutoNation and LAD prove our point that car dealerships will be among first to recover:</p><p>AutoNation (AN +8%) is in the driver's seat today as it reported a ridiculously strong Q2 earnings report this morning, which followed a very strong Q1 result in May. As the nation's largest auto retailer with 325 car dealerships from coast to coast, AutoNation has been right in the crosshairs of the pandemic.</p><p>We had to do a double take when the earnings hit this morning. Analysts were expecting a 69% yr/yr decline in EPS. However, AN wound up posting 18% EPS growth at $1.41, way ahead of the $0.37 consensus estimate. Revenue fell 15.2% yr/yr to $4.53 bln, but that also was well ahead of the $4.09 bln consensus.</p><p>This was not just a one-off situation. Another nationwide car dealership, Lithia Motors (LAD +7%), also reported blowout results last night. LAD reported adjusted EPS of $3.72, also well ahead of the $1.54 consensus. LAD also reported strong upside revenue.</p><p>When we published our story stock on AN in May, we hypothesized that car dealerships would see a relatively quicker rebound than industries like air travel, hotels, restaurants, movie theatres, and especially cruise lines. That prediction seems to be coming to fruition with these reports today. Low interest rates and a consumer preference shift toward cars and away from public transit are clearly helping drive demand.</p><p>12:39 ET</p><p>Union Pacific derailed by soft volumes across multiple business groups:</p><p>Heading into this morning's earnings report, shares of Union Pacific (UNP) had rallied nearly 50% off their March lows. The rally, presumably based off hopes of an improving economy, has hit a roadblock as UNP's mixed results and cautious outlook has reset investors' expectations.</p><p>Through solid cost containment efforts, the railroad operator managed to outpace analysts' earnings expectations, generating EPS of $1.67 vs. the $1.56 consensus estimate. While the execution is commendable, the main story resides on the top-line where revenue fell by 24% yr/yr to $4.24 bln.</p><p>The drop was fueled by a 20% decrease in volumes, coupled with a 6% dip in average revenue per car, as negative COVID-19 effects rippled across business groups.</p><p>Main areas of weakness were not surprising, and included automotive (volume -64%), coal (-24%), and energy products (-26%). In order, auto plant shutdowns, weak export demand and low natural gas prices, and depressed oil prices pressured volumes in these segments.</p><p>While facing this very difficult business climate, UNP implemented several cost-cutting and productivity initiatives to help mitigate the demand erosion.</p><p>For instance, the company reduced its train and engine workforce by 32%, outpacing volume declines. Additionally, UNP increased train sizes and put more product on fewer trains, boosting efficiency.</p><p>Lower diesel fuel prices and reduced volumes also pushed fuel expenses lower by 56%.</p><p>Despite these positive factors, UNP's operating ratio deteriorated by 140 bps yr/yr to 61%. UNP is not alone in reporting a downturn in its operating ratio. CSX (CSX) and Canadian National Railway (CNI) reported operating ratios of 63.3% and 60.4% compared to 57.4% and 57.5%, respectively, a year ago. As a reminder, a lower operating ratio is better, illustrating the company's efficiency in generating profits.</p><p>Looking ahead, UNP expects 2020 volumes to be down by about 10% from 2019 levels. The company still sees considerable economic uncertainty due to the virus, especially as local economies reverse recent re-openings.</p><p>On the positive side, UNP has experienced a recent rebound in the automotive segment as vehicle manufacturing plants have reopened and as vehicle demand has strengthened. eCommerce is another area of strength that is likely to continue. Overall, though, UNP remains cautious about business conditions for the remainder of the year.</p><p>11:31 ET</p><p>Chipotle is rolling lower today as the burrito chain broke its string of huge beats:</p><p>Chipotle (CMG -2%) is rolling a bit lower today following its Q2 earnings report last night. There was some consternation heading into this report because CMG did not provide a mid-quarter update as some burger chains had.</p><p>Overall, the results were decent but did not blow us away. Not surprisingly, analysts were expecting a big drop in EPS on a yr/yr basis due to the pandemic and limitations on in-premise dining. That's what happened as adjusted EPS fell 90% yr/yr to $0.40. What's a bit odd is that EPS was right on the button with analyst expectations, which is surprising and rare given the lack of guidance and so many variables related to the pandemic. The unfortunate part of this is that CMG broke its string of seven consecutive double-digit EPS beats. The revenue decline was much more muted as it fell 4.8% yr/yr to $1.36 bln, slightly above analyst expectations.</p><p>In Q2, comps came in at -9.8%, down from +3.3% in Q1. As we said in our preview, investors were likely expecting a weak comp in Q2, but they would want to see at least gradual improvement as the quarter went on. CMG came through in this regard: March (part of Q1, but including here for context) at -16.0%; April -24.4%, May -7.0%, June +2.0%, and July (Q3) so far is +6.4% and that's despite CMG lapping a robust +10% comp in July 2019.</p><p>It's definitely a positive to see CMG back to positive comps the past couple of months. CMG is at a bit of a disadvantage relative to other fast food chains because it does not have a big drive-thru presence that consumers could use to avoid going into a restaurant during the pandemic.</p><p>However, CMG does deserve credit for getting customers to use its digital app and delivery service. Digital sales grew 216.3% yr/yr in Q2 and accounted for 60.7% of sales for the quarter. What's very encouraging, and we've said this in past comments, is that digital sales tend to be sticky. Once people get used to the app, they keep using it. Since sales troughed in late March, CMG has retained 70-80% of its digital sales gains while recovering 40-50% of in-store sales.</p><p>Despite the monthly comp improvement, the stock is lower today. We think the in-line EPS/revenue is being seen as a bit of a disappointment given CMG's penchant for reporting big beats. Also, the stock made a big move in recent months (from $415 at its mid-March low to $1180 heading into this report). We cautioned in our preview that a lot of good news is already priced in, so any stumble/in-line results could take a bite out of the stock. We are seeing a bit of that today.</p><p>10:43 ET</p><p>Tesla electrifies investors with blow-out results and potential inclusion in S&amp;P 500: With shares nearly doubling since Tesla (TSLA) last reported earnings on April 29, the company faced an exceptionally high bar to hurdle regarding its 2Q20 performance. To avoid a likely steep sell-off, blow-out results and another profitable quarter was needed.</p><p>TSLA delivered just that, generating EPS of $2.34, crushing the ($0.16) consensus estimate. In an environment in which the auto industry suffered a 30% decline in 1H20, TSLA's Q2 revenue only fell by 5% to $6.04 bln, easily beating the $5.31 bln forecast.</p><p>The GAAP profit of $104 mln marks the company's fourth straight quarterly profit, paving the way for TSLA to be included in the S&amp;P 500. The meteoric rise in TSLA's stock price suggests that this bullish development was mostly priced into shares. Still, TSLA's evolution to profitability is a significant fundamental achievement that makes the stock more appealing to a wider base of investors.</p><p>TSLA reported solid, better-than-expected Q2 vehicle deliveries of 90,650 on July 2. What was unknown was whether lower operating efficiency, resulting from plant shut-downs, would prevent the company from posting a profit.</p><p>Adjusted automotive gross margin did slide to 18.7% from 20.0% last quarter. However, this dip was mitigated by record regulatory tax credit sales of $428 mln. TSLA sells these government issued credits to its competitors, which they use to offset the cost of making zero emission vehicles.</p><p>If one wants to nit-pick at TSLA's report, one could argue that the quality of the earnings beat is somewhat questionable due to inflated regulatory tax credit sales. Indeed, the degree of TSLA's upside performance wouldn't have been as impressive without this inflation, but this doesn't negate the overall strong performance in our view.</p><p>Improvements in product and manufacturing costs, and a 12.5% yr/yr reduction in operating expenses to $951 mln, also positively impacted the company's profitability.</p><p>In addition to the quarterly results, TSLA had important news to share regarding its next production facility.</p><p>The company has chosen Austin, TX as the location for its fourth plant. The 2,000 acre facility will house production for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, which is expected to be available for delivery in 2021. Also, Model 3 and Model Y sedans for the eastern U.S. market will be produced there.</p><p>Given the sky-high expectations, TSLA needed to astonish investors with strong Q2 results, while spurring excitement for future growth opportunities. The company achieved both goals, as reflected in the stock's move higher.</p><p>10:10 ET</p><p>Microsoft reports a solid quarter but a few areas like Azure were not as robust as in MarQ:</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) reported another solid beat, and yet the stock trades modestly lower. That response makes sense if you dig into the quarter a bit. In terms of revenue, MSFT did quite well overall, reporting upside relative to prior guidance in two of its three segments - Intelligent Cloud (IC) and More Personal Computing (MPC) - while Productivity and Business Processes' (PBP) result was in-line. A slight negative is that growth rates declined from MarQ in PBP (15% to 6%) and IC (27% to 17%). Offsetting that was MPC (+3% to +14%), which saw an acceleration as Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefitted from more people at home. In terms of EPS, MSFT broke its string of double digit EPS beats at five in a row. The $0.08 upside this quarter was good, but it was not quite as robust as the beats delivered in recent quarters. Probably more troubling was a modest degradation in growth in several key areas: Most prominently, in MSFT's Azure cloud computing business, its crown jewel, growth slowed a bit to 47% in JunQ from 59% in MarQ. Office Commercial products and cloud services slowed to +5% from +13% in MarQ. IC Server products and cloud services slowed to +19% in JunQ from +30% in MarQ. LinkedIn growth slowed to +10% in JunQ from +21% in MarQ, as it was impacted by a weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. Transactional license purchasing continued to slow, particularly in small and medium businesses.</p><p>Overall, this was still a very good quarter, with a solid beat on revenue and EPS. The primary culprits for the stock's move lower, we think, is lackluster PBP segment growth coupled with Azure's performance. While Azure had great growth, with so many companies and consumers using the cloud as they work/learn from home, the Azure number was a slight letdown. This may be a slight cause for concern for Amazon (AMZN) and its rival AWS unit, which reports on July 30.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368389330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-WN31-DYRK-90TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2266\"/><timeReceived>3:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

Current CapitalIQ consensus for EPS is $1.11 and for revenue it's $18.55 bln. Intel typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter in the press release. In April, Intel guided to Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approx. $1.10 and revenue of approx. $18.50 bln. Expectations for semiconductor companies are running high this earnings season as several companies have reported strong results (like TXN on Tuesday and MU in late June) while several others have increased guidance in the past couple of weeks or so, including ADI, MXIM, IMOS, FORM, MXL, XLNX. In fairness, Intel is not a direct comparison as it does more than make chips. INTC has been transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, the latter of which accounted for 48% of revenue in 2019. Its data center segment is focused on cloud computing, network infrastructure, and intelligent edge applications as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G. The PC side is not seeing a lot of growth but Intel recently began shipping its 10nm Intel Core processors, which feature a new core architecture. INTC is on track to launch its first 7nm-based product, a discrete GPU, at the end of 2021. Intel's top line growth tends to be pretty modest. However, the company also tends to be consistent relative to consensus estimates as it has not missed on EPS in any quarter over the past five years. And its EPS beats have been getting larger in recent quarters, with four consecutive double digit EPS beats. Overall, some big tech names have reported, but we are still early in the tech reporting cycle.We think Intel should have pretty good results. IBM had a nice quarter and said large enterprise customers are still spending. TXN's quarter is a good sign for Intel as well. Also, Microsoft (MSFT) had a mixed quarter, but its consumer/PC side did well with more people working at home. This is good news for Intel's PC business.</p><p>14:14 ET</p><p>AutoNation and LAD prove our point that car dealerships will be among first to recover:</p><p>AutoNation (AN +8%) is in the driver's seat today as it reported a ridiculously strong Q2 earnings report this morning, which followed a very strong Q1 result in May. As the nation's largest auto retailer with 325 car dealerships from coast to coast, AutoNation has been right in the crosshairs of the pandemic.</p><p>We had to do a double take when the earnings hit this morning. Analysts were expecting a 69% yr/yr decline in EPS. However, AN wound up posting 18% EPS growth at $1.41, way ahead of the $0.37 consensus estimate. Revenue fell 15.2% yr/yr to $4.53 bln, but that also was well ahead of the $4.09 bln consensus.</p><p>This was not just a one-off situation. Another nationwide car dealership, Lithia Motors (LAD +7%), also reported blowout results last night. LAD reported adjusted EPS of $3.72, also well ahead of the $1.54 consensus. LAD also reported strong upside revenue.</p><p>When we published our story stock on AN in May, we hypothesized that car dealerships would see a relatively quicker rebound than industries like air travel, hotels, restaurants, movie theatres, and especially cruise lines. That prediction seems to be coming to fruition with these reports today. Low interest rates and a consumer preference shift toward cars and away from public transit are clearly helping drive demand.</p><p>12:39 ET</p><p>Union Pacific derailed by soft volumes across multiple business groups:</p><p>Heading into this morning's earnings report, shares of Union Pacific (UNP) had rallied nearly 50% off their March lows. The rally, presumably based off hopes of an improving economy, has hit a roadblock as UNP's mixed results and cautious outlook has reset investors' expectations.</p><p>Through solid cost containment efforts, the railroad operator managed to outpace analysts' earnings expectations, generating EPS of $1.67 vs. the $1.56 consensus estimate. While the execution is commendable, the main story resides on the top-line where revenue fell by 24% yr/yr to $4.24 bln.</p><p>The drop was fueled by a 20% decrease in volumes, coupled with a 6% dip in average revenue per car, as negative COVID-19 effects rippled across business groups.</p><p>Main areas of weakness were not surprising, and included automotive (volume -64%), coal (-24%), and energy products (-26%). In order, auto plant shutdowns, weak export demand and low natural gas prices, and depressed oil prices pressured volumes in these segments.</p><p>While facing this very difficult business climate, UNP implemented several cost-cutting and productivity initiatives to help mitigate the demand erosion.</p><p>For instance, the company reduced its train and engine workforce by 32%, outpacing volume declines. Additionally, UNP increased train sizes and put more product on fewer trains, boosting efficiency.</p><p>Lower diesel fuel prices and reduced volumes also pushed fuel expenses lower by 56%.</p><p>Despite these positive factors, UNP's operating ratio deteriorated by 140 bps yr/yr to 61%. UNP is not alone in reporting a downturn in its operating ratio. CSX (CSX) and Canadian National Railway (CNI) reported operating ratios of 63.3% and 60.4% compared to 57.4% and 57.5%, respectively, a year ago. As a reminder, a lower operating ratio is better, illustrating the company's efficiency in generating profits.</p><p>Looking ahead, UNP expects 2020 volumes to be down by about 10% from 2019 levels. The company still sees considerable economic uncertainty due to the virus, especially as local economies reverse recent re-openings.</p><p>On the positive side, UNP has experienced a recent rebound in the automotive segment as vehicle manufacturing plants have reopened and as vehicle demand has strengthened. eCommerce is another area of strength that is likely to continue. Overall, though, UNP remains cautious about business conditions for the remainder of the year.</p><p>11:31 ET</p><p>Chipotle is rolling lower today as the burrito chain broke its string of huge beats:</p><p>Chipotle (CMG -2%) is rolling a bit lower today following its Q2 earnings report last night. There was some consternation heading into this report because CMG did not provide a mid-quarter update as some burger chains had.</p><p>Overall, the results were decent but did not blow us away. Not surprisingly, analysts were expecting a big drop in EPS on a yr/yr basis due to the pandemic and limitations on in-premise dining. That's what happened as adjusted EPS fell 90% yr/yr to $0.40. What's a bit odd is that EPS was right on the button with analyst expectations, which is surprising and rare given the lack of guidance and so many variables related to the pandemic. The unfortunate part of this is that CMG broke its string of seven consecutive double-digit EPS beats. The revenue decline was much more muted as it fell 4.8% yr/yr to $1.36 bln, slightly above analyst expectations.</p><p>In Q2, comps came in at -9.8%, down from +3.3% in Q1. As we said in our preview, investors were likely expecting a weak comp in Q2, but they would want to see at least gradual improvement as the quarter went on. CMG came through in this regard: March (part of Q1, but including here for context) at -16.0%; April -24.4%, May -7.0%, June +2.0%, and July (Q3) so far is +6.4% and that's despite CMG lapping a robust +10% comp in July 2019.</p><p>It's definitely a positive to see CMG back to positive comps the past couple of months. CMG is at a bit of a disadvantage relative to other fast food chains because it does not have a big drive-thru presence that consumers could use to avoid going into a restaurant during the pandemic.</p><p>However, CMG does deserve credit for getting customers to use its digital app and delivery service. Digital sales grew 216.3% yr/yr in Q2 and accounted for 60.7% of sales for the quarter. What's very encouraging, and we've said this in past comments, is that digital sales tend to be sticky. Once people get used to the app, they keep using it. Since sales troughed in late March, CMG has retained 70-80% of its digital sales gains while recovering 40-50% of in-store sales.</p><p>Despite the monthly comp improvement, the stock is lower today. We think the in-line EPS/revenue is being seen as a bit of a disappointment given CMG's penchant for reporting big beats. Also, the stock made a big move in recent months (from $415 at its mid-March low to $1180 heading into this report). We cautioned in our preview that a lot of good news is already priced in, so any stumble/in-line results could take a bite out of the stock. We are seeing a bit of that today.</p><p>10:43 ET</p><p>Tesla electrifies investors with blow-out results and potential inclusion in S&amp;P 500: With shares nearly doubling since Tesla (TSLA) last reported earnings on April 29, the company faced an exceptionally high bar to hurdle regarding its 2Q20 performance. To avoid a likely steep sell-off, blow-out results and another profitable quarter was needed.</p><p>TSLA delivered just that, generating EPS of $2.34, crushing the ($0.16) consensus estimate. In an environment in which the auto industry suffered a 30% decline in 1H20, TSLA's Q2 revenue only fell by 5% to $6.04 bln, easily beating the $5.31 bln forecast.</p><p>The GAAP profit of $104 mln marks the company's fourth straight quarterly profit, paving the way for TSLA to be included in the S&amp;P 500. The meteoric rise in TSLA's stock price suggests that this bullish development was mostly priced into shares. Still, TSLA's evolution to profitability is a significant fundamental achievement that makes the stock more appealing to a wider base of investors.</p><p>TSLA reported solid, better-than-expected Q2 vehicle deliveries of 90,650 on July 2. What was unknown was whether lower operating efficiency, resulting from plant shut-downs, would prevent the company from posting a profit.</p><p>Adjusted automotive gross margin did slide to 18.7% from 20.0% last quarter. However, this dip was mitigated by record regulatory tax credit sales of $428 mln. TSLA sells these government issued credits to its competitors, which they use to offset the cost of making zero emission vehicles.</p><p>If one wants to nit-pick at TSLA's report, one could argue that the quality of the earnings beat is somewhat questionable due to inflated regulatory tax credit sales. Indeed, the degree of TSLA's upside performance wouldn't have been as impressive without this inflation, but this doesn't negate the overall strong performance in our view.</p><p>Improvements in product and manufacturing costs, and a 12.5% yr/yr reduction in operating expenses to $951 mln, also positively impacted the company's profitability.</p><p>In addition to the quarterly results, TSLA had important news to share regarding its next production facility.</p><p>The company has chosen Austin, TX as the location for its fourth plant. The 2,000 acre facility will house production for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, which is expected to be available for delivery in 2021. Also, Model 3 and Model Y sedans for the eastern U.S. market will be produced there.</p><p>Given the sky-high expectations, TSLA needed to astonish investors with strong Q2 results, while spurring excitement for future growth opportunities. The company achieved both goals, as reflected in the stock's move higher.</p><p>10:10 ET</p><p>Microsoft reports a solid quarter but a few areas like Azure were not as robust as in MarQ:</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) reported another solid beat, and yet the stock trades modestly lower. That response makes sense if you dig into the quarter a bit. In terms of revenue, MSFT did quite well overall, reporting upside relative to prior guidance in two of its three segments - Intelligent Cloud (IC) and More Personal Computing (MPC) - while Productivity and Business Processes' (PBP) result was in-line. A slight negative is that growth rates declined from MarQ in PBP (15% to 6%) and IC (27% to 17%). Offsetting that was MPC (+3% to +14%), which saw an acceleration as Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefitted from more people at home. In terms of EPS, MSFT broke its string of double digit EPS beats at five in a row. The $0.08 upside this quarter was good, but it was not quite as robust as the beats delivered in recent quarters. Probably more troubling was a modest degradation in growth in several key areas: Most prominently, in MSFT's Azure cloud computing business, its crown jewel, growth slowed a bit to 47% in JunQ from 59% in MarQ. Office Commercial products and cloud services slowed to +5% from +13% in MarQ. IC Server products and cloud services slowed to +19% in JunQ from +30% in MarQ. LinkedIn growth slowed to +10% in JunQ from +21% in MarQ, as it was impacted by a weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. Transactional license purchasing continued to slow, particularly in small and medium businesses.</p><p>Overall, this was still a very good quarter, with a solid beat on revenue and EPS. The primary culprits for the stock's move lower, we think, is lackluster PBP segment growth coupled with Azure's performance. While Azure had great growth, with so many companies and consumers using the cloud as they work/learn from home, the Azure number was a slight letdown. This may be a slight cause for concern for Amazon (AMZN) and its rival AWS unit, which reports on July 30.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368388665</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-WN31-DYRK-90TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2266\"/><timeReceived>2:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

Current CapitalIQ consensus for EPS is $1.11 and for revenue it's $18.55 bln. Intel typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter in the press release. In April, Intel guided to Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approx. $1.10 and revenue of approx. $18.50 bln. Expectations for semiconductor companies are running high this earnings season as several companies have reported strong results (like TXN on Tuesday and MU in late June) while several others have increased guidance in the past couple of weeks or so, including ADI, MXIM, IMOS, FORM, MXL, XLNX. In fairness, Intel is not a direct comparison as it does more than make chips. INTC has been transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, the latter of which accounted for 48% of revenue in 2019. Its data center segment is focused on cloud computing, network infrastructure, and intelligent edge applications as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G. The PC side is not seeing a lot of growth but Intel recently began shipping its 10nm Intel Core processors, which feature a new core architecture. INTC is on track to launch its first 7nm-based product, a discrete GPU, at the end of 2021. Intel's top line growth tends to be pretty modest. However, the company also tends to be consistent relative to consensus estimates as it has not missed on EPS in any quarter over the past five years. And its EPS beats have been getting larger in recent quarters, with four consecutive double digit EPS beats. Overall, some big tech names have reported, but we are still early in the tech reporting cycle.We think Intel should have pretty good results. IBM had a nice quarter and said large enterprise customers are still spending. TXN's quarter is a good sign for Intel as well. Also, Microsoft (MSFT) had a mixed quarter, but its consumer/PC side did well with more people working at home. This is good news for Intel's PC business.</p><p>14:14 ET</p><p>AutoNation and LAD prove our point that car dealerships will be among first to recover:</p><p>AutoNation (AN +8%) is in the driver's seat today as it reported a ridiculously strong Q2 earnings report this morning, which followed a very strong Q1 result in May. As the nation's largest auto retailer with 325 car dealerships from coast to coast, AutoNation has been right in the crosshairs of the pandemic.</p><p>We had to do a double take when the earnings hit this morning. Analysts were expecting a 69% yr/yr decline in EPS. However, AN wound up posting 18% EPS growth at $1.41, way ahead of the $0.37 consensus estimate. Revenue fell 15.2% yr/yr to $4.53 bln, but that also was well ahead of the $4.09 bln consensus.</p><p>This was not just a one-off situation. Another nationwide car dealership, Lithia Motors (LAD +7%), also reported blowout results last night. LAD reported adjusted EPS of $3.72, also well ahead of the $1.54 consensus. LAD also reported strong upside revenue.</p><p>When we published our story stock on AN in May, we hypothesized that car dealerships would see a relatively quicker rebound than industries like air travel, hotels, restaurants, movie theatres, and especially cruise lines. That prediction seems to be coming to fruition with these reports today. Low interest rates and a consumer preference shift toward cars and away from public transit are clearly helping drive demand.</p><p>12:39 ET</p><p>Union Pacific derailed by soft volumes across multiple business groups:</p><p>Heading into this morning's earnings report, shares of Union Pacific (UNP) had rallied nearly 50% off their March lows. The rally, presumably based off hopes of an improving economy, has hit a roadblock as UNP's mixed results and cautious outlook has reset investors' expectations.</p><p>Through solid cost containment efforts, the railroad operator managed to outpace analysts' earnings expectations, generating EPS of $1.67 vs. the $1.56 consensus estimate. While the execution is commendable, the main story resides on the top-line where revenue fell by 24% yr/yr to $4.24 bln.</p><p>The drop was fueled by a 20% decrease in volumes, coupled with a 6% dip in average revenue per car, as negative COVID-19 effects rippled across business groups.</p><p>Main areas of weakness were not surprising, and included automotive (volume -64%), coal (-24%), and energy products (-26%). In order, auto plant shutdowns, weak export demand and low natural gas prices, and depressed oil prices pressured volumes in these segments.</p><p>While facing this very difficult business climate, UNP implemented several cost-cutting and productivity initiatives to help mitigate the demand erosion.</p><p>For instance, the company reduced its train and engine workforce by 32%, outpacing volume declines. Additionally, UNP increased train sizes and put more product on fewer trains, boosting efficiency.</p><p>Lower diesel fuel prices and reduced volumes also pushed fuel expenses lower by 56%.</p><p>Despite these positive factors, UNP's operating ratio deteriorated by 140 bps yr/yr to 61%. UNP is not alone in reporting a downturn in its operating ratio. CSX (CSX) and Canadian National Railway (CNI) reported operating ratios of 63.3% and 60.4% compared to 57.4% and 57.5%, respectively, a year ago. As a reminder, a lower operating ratio is better, illustrating the company's efficiency in generating profits.</p><p>Looking ahead, UNP expects 2020 volumes to be down by about 10% from 2019 levels. The company still sees considerable economic uncertainty due to the virus, especially as local economies reverse recent re-openings.</p><p>On the positive side, UNP has experienced a recent rebound in the automotive segment as vehicle manufacturing plants have reopened and as vehicle demand has strengthened. eCommerce is another area of strength that is likely to continue. Overall, though, UNP remains cautious about business conditions for the remainder of the year.</p><p>11:31 ET</p><p>Chipotle is rolling lower today as the burrito chain broke its string of huge beats:</p><p>Chipotle (CMG -2%) is rolling a bit lower today following its Q2 earnings report last night. There was some consternation heading into this report because CMG did not provide a mid-quarter update as some burger chains had.</p><p>Overall, the results were decent but did not blow us away. Not surprisingly, analysts were expecting a big drop in EPS on a yr/yr basis due to the pandemic and limitations on in-premise dining. That's what happened as adjusted EPS fell 90% yr/yr to $0.40. What's a bit odd is that EPS was right on the button with analyst expectations, which is surprising and rare given the lack of guidance and so many variables related to the pandemic. The unfortunate part of this is that CMG broke its string of seven consecutive double-digit EPS beats. The revenue decline was much more muted as it fell 4.8% yr/yr to $1.36 bln, slightly above analyst expectations.</p><p>In Q2, comps came in at -9.8%, down from +3.3% in Q1. As we said in our preview, investors were likely expecting a weak comp in Q2, but they would want to see at least gradual improvement as the quarter went on. CMG came through in this regard: March (part of Q1, but including here for context) at -16.0%; April -24.4%, May -7.0%, June +2.0%, and July (Q3) so far is +6.4% and that's despite CMG lapping a robust +10% comp in July 2019.</p><p>It's definitely a positive to see CMG back to positive comps the past couple of months. CMG is at a bit of a disadvantage relative to other fast food chains because it does not have a big drive-thru presence that consumers could use to avoid going into a restaurant during the pandemic.</p><p>However, CMG does deserve credit for getting customers to use its digital app and delivery service. Digital sales grew 216.3% yr/yr in Q2 and accounted for 60.7% of sales for the quarter. What's very encouraging, and we've said this in past comments, is that digital sales tend to be sticky. Once people get used to the app, they keep using it. Since sales troughed in late March, CMG has retained 70-80% of its digital sales gains while recovering 40-50% of in-store sales.</p><p>Despite the monthly comp improvement, the stock is lower today. We think the in-line EPS/revenue is being seen as a bit of a disappointment given CMG's penchant for reporting big beats. Also, the stock made a big move in recent months (from $415 at its mid-March low to $1180 heading into this report). We cautioned in our preview that a lot of good news is already priced in, so any stumble/in-line results could take a bite out of the stock. We are seeing a bit of that today.</p><p>10:43 ET</p><p>Tesla electrifies investors with blow-out results and potential inclusion in S&amp;P 500: With shares nearly doubling since Tesla (TSLA) last reported earnings on April 29, the company faced an exceptionally high bar to hurdle regarding its 2Q20 performance. To avoid a likely steep sell-off, blow-out results and another profitable quarter was needed.</p><p>TSLA delivered just that, generating EPS of $2.34, crushing the ($0.16) consensus estimate. In an environment in which the auto industry suffered a 30% decline in 1H20, TSLA's Q2 revenue only fell by 5% to $6.04 bln, easily beating the $5.31 bln forecast.</p><p>The GAAP profit of $104 mln marks the company's fourth straight quarterly profit, paving the way for TSLA to be included in the S&amp;P 500. The meteoric rise in TSLA's stock price suggests that this bullish development was mostly priced into shares. Still, TSLA's evolution to profitability is a significant fundamental achievement that makes the stock more appealing to a wider base of investors.</p><p>TSLA reported solid, better-than-expected Q2 vehicle deliveries of 90,650 on July 2. What was unknown was whether lower operating efficiency, resulting from plant shut-downs, would prevent the company from posting a profit.</p><p>Adjusted automotive gross margin did slide to 18.7% from 20.0% last quarter. However, this dip was mitigated by record regulatory tax credit sales of $428 mln. TSLA sells these government issued credits to its competitors, which they use to offset the cost of making zero emission vehicles.</p><p>If one wants to nit-pick at TSLA's report, one could argue that the quality of the earnings beat is somewhat questionable due to inflated regulatory tax credit sales. Indeed, the degree of TSLA's upside performance wouldn't have been as impressive without this inflation, but this doesn't negate the overall strong performance in our view.</p><p>Improvements in product and manufacturing costs, and a 12.5% yr/yr reduction in operating expenses to $951 mln, also positively impacted the company's profitability.</p><p>In addition to the quarterly results, TSLA had important news to share regarding its next production facility.</p><p>The company has chosen Austin, TX as the location for its fourth plant. The 2,000 acre facility will house production for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, which is expected to be available for delivery in 2021. Also, Model 3 and Model Y sedans for the eastern U.S. market will be produced there.</p><p>Given the sky-high expectations, TSLA needed to astonish investors with strong Q2 results, while spurring excitement for future growth opportunities. The company achieved both goals, as reflected in the stock's move higher.</p><p>10:10 ET</p><p>Microsoft reports a solid quarter but a few areas like Azure were not as robust as in MarQ:</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) reported another solid beat, and yet the stock trades modestly lower. That response makes sense if you dig into the quarter a bit. In terms of revenue, MSFT did quite well overall, reporting upside relative to prior guidance in two of its three segments - Intelligent Cloud (IC) and More Personal Computing (MPC) - while Productivity and Business Processes' (PBP) result was in-line. A slight negative is that growth rates declined from MarQ in PBP (15% to 6%) and IC (27% to 17%). Offsetting that was MPC (+3% to +14%), which saw an acceleration as Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefitted from more people at home. In terms of EPS, MSFT broke its string of double digit EPS beats at five in a row. The $0.08 upside this quarter was good, but it was not quite as robust as the beats delivered in recent quarters. Probably more troubling was a modest degradation in growth in several key areas: Most prominently, in MSFT's Azure cloud computing business, its crown jewel, growth slowed a bit to 47% in JunQ from 59% in MarQ. Office Commercial products and cloud services slowed to +5% from +13% in MarQ. IC Server products and cloud services slowed to +19% in JunQ from +30% in MarQ. LinkedIn growth slowed to +10% in JunQ from +21% in MarQ, as it was impacted by a weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. Transactional license purchasing continued to slow, particularly in small and medium businesses.</p><p>Overall, this was still a very good quarter, with a solid beat on revenue and EPS. The primary culprits for the stock's move lower, we think, is lackluster PBP segment growth coupled with Azure's performance. While Azure had great growth, with so many companies and consumers using the cloud as they work/learn from home, the Azure number was a slight letdown. This may be a slight cause for concern for Amazon (AMZN) and its rival AWS unit, which reports on July 30.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368389834</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-WN31-DYRK-90TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2266\"/><timeReceived>4:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

Current CapitalIQ consensus for EPS is $1.11 and for revenue it's $18.55 bln. Intel typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter in the press release. In April, Intel guided to Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approx. $1.10 and revenue of approx. $18.50 bln. Expectations for semiconductor companies are running high this earnings season as several companies have reported strong results (like TXN on Tuesday and MU in late June) while several others have increased guidance in the past couple of weeks or so, including ADI, MXIM, IMOS, FORM, MXL, XLNX. In fairness, Intel is not a direct comparison as it does more than make chips. INTC has been transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, the latter of which accounted for 48% of revenue in 2019. Its data center segment is focused on cloud computing, network infrastructure, and intelligent edge applications as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G. The PC side is not seeing a lot of growth but Intel recently began shipping its 10nm Intel Core processors, which feature a new core architecture. INTC is on track to launch its first 7nm-based product, a discrete GPU, at the end of 2021. Intel's top line growth tends to be pretty modest. However, the company also tends to be consistent relative to consensus estimates as it has not missed on EPS in any quarter over the past five years. And its EPS beats have been getting larger in recent quarters, with four consecutive double digit EPS beats. Overall, some big tech names have reported, but we are still early in the tech reporting cycle.We think Intel should have pretty good results. IBM had a nice quarter and said large enterprise customers are still spending. TXN's quarter is a good sign for Intel as well. Also, Microsoft (MSFT) had a mixed quarter, but its consumer/PC side did well with more people working at home. This is good news for Intel's PC business.</p><p>14:14 ET</p><p>AutoNation and LAD prove our point that car dealerships will be among first to recover:</p><p>AutoNation (AN +8%) is in the driver's seat today as it reported a ridiculously strong Q2 earnings report this morning, which followed a very strong Q1 result in May. As the nation's largest auto retailer with 325 car dealerships from coast to coast, AutoNation has been right in the crosshairs of the pandemic.</p><p>We had to do a double take when the earnings hit this morning. Analysts were expecting a 69% yr/yr decline in EPS. However, AN wound up posting 18% EPS growth at $1.41, way ahead of the $0.37 consensus estimate. Revenue fell 15.2% yr/yr to $4.53 bln, but that also was well ahead of the $4.09 bln consensus.</p><p>This was not just a one-off situation. Another nationwide car dealership, Lithia Motors (LAD +7%), also reported blowout results last night. LAD reported adjusted EPS of $3.72, also well ahead of the $1.54 consensus. LAD also reported strong upside revenue.</p><p>When we published our story stock on AN in May, we hypothesized that car dealerships would see a relatively quicker rebound than industries like air travel, hotels, restaurants, movie theatres, and especially cruise lines. That prediction seems to be coming to fruition with these reports today. Low interest rates and a consumer preference shift toward cars and away from public transit are clearly helping drive demand.</p><p>12:39 ET</p><p>Union Pacific derailed by soft volumes across multiple business groups:</p><p>Heading into this morning's earnings report, shares of Union Pacific (UNP) had rallied nearly 50% off their March lows. The rally, presumably based off hopes of an improving economy, has hit a roadblock as UNP's mixed results and cautious outlook has reset investors' expectations.</p><p>Through solid cost containment efforts, the railroad operator managed to outpace analysts' earnings expectations, generating EPS of $1.67 vs. the $1.56 consensus estimate. While the execution is commendable, the main story resides on the top-line where revenue fell by 24% yr/yr to $4.24 bln.</p><p>The drop was fueled by a 20% decrease in volumes, coupled with a 6% dip in average revenue per car, as negative COVID-19 effects rippled across business groups.</p><p>Main areas of weakness were not surprising, and included automotive (volume -64%), coal (-24%), and energy products (-26%). In order, auto plant shutdowns, weak export demand and low natural gas prices, and depressed oil prices pressured volumes in these segments.</p><p>While facing this very difficult business climate, UNP implemented several cost-cutting and productivity initiatives to help mitigate the demand erosion.</p><p>For instance, the company reduced its train and engine workforce by 32%, outpacing volume declines. Additionally, UNP increased train sizes and put more product on fewer trains, boosting efficiency.</p><p>Lower diesel fuel prices and reduced volumes also pushed fuel expenses lower by 56%.</p><p>Despite these positive factors, UNP's operating ratio deteriorated by 140 bps yr/yr to 61%. UNP is not alone in reporting a downturn in its operating ratio. CSX (CSX) and Canadian National Railway (CNI) reported operating ratios of 63.3% and 60.4% compared to 57.4% and 57.5%, respectively, a year ago. As a reminder, a lower operating ratio is better, illustrating the company's efficiency in generating profits.</p><p>Looking ahead, UNP expects 2020 volumes to be down by about 10% from 2019 levels. The company still sees considerable economic uncertainty due to the virus, especially as local economies reverse recent re-openings.</p><p>On the positive side, UNP has experienced a recent rebound in the automotive segment as vehicle manufacturing plants have reopened and as vehicle demand has strengthened. eCommerce is another area of strength that is likely to continue. Overall, though, UNP remains cautious about business conditions for the remainder of the year.</p><p>11:31 ET</p><p>Chipotle is rolling lower today as the burrito chain broke its string of huge beats:</p><p>Chipotle (CMG -2%) is rolling a bit lower today following its Q2 earnings report last night. There was some consternation heading into this report because CMG did not provide a mid-quarter update as some burger chains had.</p><p>Overall, the results were decent but did not blow us away. Not surprisingly, analysts were expecting a big drop in EPS on a yr/yr basis due to the pandemic and limitations on in-premise dining. That's what happened as adjusted EPS fell 90% yr/yr to $0.40. What's a bit odd is that EPS was right on the button with analyst expectations, which is surprising and rare given the lack of guidance and so many variables related to the pandemic. The unfortunate part of this is that CMG broke its string of seven consecutive double-digit EPS beats. The revenue decline was much more muted as it fell 4.8% yr/yr to $1.36 bln, slightly above analyst expectations.</p><p>In Q2, comps came in at -9.8%, down from +3.3% in Q1. As we said in our preview, investors were likely expecting a weak comp in Q2, but they would want to see at least gradual improvement as the quarter went on. CMG came through in this regard: March (part of Q1, but including here for context) at -16.0%; April -24.4%, May -7.0%, June +2.0%, and July (Q3) so far is +6.4% and that's despite CMG lapping a robust +10% comp in July 2019.</p><p>It's definitely a positive to see CMG back to positive comps the past couple of months. CMG is at a bit of a disadvantage relative to other fast food chains because it does not have a big drive-thru presence that consumers could use to avoid going into a restaurant during the pandemic.</p><p>However, CMG does deserve credit for getting customers to use its digital app and delivery service. Digital sales grew 216.3% yr/yr in Q2 and accounted for 60.7% of sales for the quarter. What's very encouraging, and we've said this in past comments, is that digital sales tend to be sticky. Once people get used to the app, they keep using it. Since sales troughed in late March, CMG has retained 70-80% of its digital sales gains while recovering 40-50% of in-store sales.</p><p>Despite the monthly comp improvement, the stock is lower today. We think the in-line EPS/revenue is being seen as a bit of a disappointment given CMG's penchant for reporting big beats. Also, the stock made a big move in recent months (from $415 at its mid-March low to $1180 heading into this report). We cautioned in our preview that a lot of good news is already priced in, so any stumble/in-line results could take a bite out of the stock. We are seeing a bit of that today.</p><p>10:43 ET</p><p>Tesla electrifies investors with blow-out results and potential inclusion in S&amp;P 500: With shares nearly doubling since Tesla (TSLA) last reported earnings on April 29, the company faced an exceptionally high bar to hurdle regarding its 2Q20 performance. To avoid a likely steep sell-off, blow-out results and another profitable quarter was needed.</p><p>TSLA delivered just that, generating EPS of $2.34, crushing the ($0.16) consensus estimate. In an environment in which the auto industry suffered a 30% decline in 1H20, TSLA's Q2 revenue only fell by 5% to $6.04 bln, easily beating the $5.31 bln forecast.</p><p>The GAAP profit of $104 mln marks the company's fourth straight quarterly profit, paving the way for TSLA to be included in the S&amp;P 500. The meteoric rise in TSLA's stock price suggests that this bullish development was mostly priced into shares. Still, TSLA's evolution to profitability is a significant fundamental achievement that makes the stock more appealing to a wider base of investors.</p><p>TSLA reported solid, better-than-expected Q2 vehicle deliveries of 90,650 on July 2. What was unknown was whether lower operating efficiency, resulting from plant shut-downs, would prevent the company from posting a profit.</p><p>Adjusted automotive gross margin did slide to 18.7% from 20.0% last quarter. However, this dip was mitigated by record regulatory tax credit sales of $428 mln. TSLA sells these government issued credits to its competitors, which they use to offset the cost of making zero emission vehicles.</p><p>If one wants to nit-pick at TSLA's report, one could argue that the quality of the earnings beat is somewhat questionable due to inflated regulatory tax credit sales. Indeed, the degree of TSLA's upside performance wouldn't have been as impressive without this inflation, but this doesn't negate the overall strong performance in our view.</p><p>Improvements in product and manufacturing costs, and a 12.5% yr/yr reduction in operating expenses to $951 mln, also positively impacted the company's profitability.</p><p>In addition to the quarterly results, TSLA had important news to share regarding its next production facility.</p><p>The company has chosen Austin, TX as the location for its fourth plant. The 2,000 acre facility will house production for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, which is expected to be available for delivery in 2021. Also, Model 3 and Model Y sedans for the eastern U.S. market will be produced there.</p><p>Given the sky-high expectations, TSLA needed to astonish investors with strong Q2 results, while spurring excitement for future growth opportunities. The company achieved both goals, as reflected in the stock's move higher.</p><p>10:10 ET</p><p>Microsoft reports a solid quarter but a few areas like Azure were not as robust as in MarQ:</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) reported another solid beat, and yet the stock trades modestly lower. That response makes sense if you dig into the quarter a bit. In terms of revenue, MSFT did quite well overall, reporting upside relative to prior guidance in two of its three segments - Intelligent Cloud (IC) and More Personal Computing (MPC) - while Productivity and Business Processes' (PBP) result was in-line. A slight negative is that growth rates declined from MarQ in PBP (15% to 6%) and IC (27% to 17%). Offsetting that was MPC (+3% to +14%), which saw an acceleration as Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefitted from more people at home. In terms of EPS, MSFT broke its string of double digit EPS beats at five in a row. The $0.08 upside this quarter was good, but it was not quite as robust as the beats delivered in recent quarters. Probably more troubling was a modest degradation in growth in several key areas: Most prominently, in MSFT's Azure cloud computing business, its crown jewel, growth slowed a bit to 47% in JunQ from 59% in MarQ. Office Commercial products and cloud services slowed to +5% from +13% in MarQ. IC Server products and cloud services slowed to +19% in JunQ from +30% in MarQ. LinkedIn growth slowed to +10% in JunQ from +21% in MarQ, as it was impacted by a weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. Transactional license purchasing continued to slow, particularly in small and medium businesses.</p><p>Overall, this was still a very good quarter, with a solid beat on revenue and EPS. The primary culprits for the stock's move lower, we think, is lackluster PBP segment growth coupled with Azure's performance. While Azure had great growth, with so many companies and consumers using the cloud as they work/learn from home, the Azure number was a slight letdown. This may be a slight cause for concern for Amazon (AMZN) and its rival AWS unit, which reports on July 30.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368388665</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-WN41-JC8H-K013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2266\"/><timeReceived>2:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

Current CapitalIQ consensus for EPS is $1.11 and for revenue it's $18.55 bln. Intel typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter in the press release. In April, Intel guided to Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approx. $1.10 and revenue of approx. $18.50 bln. Expectations for semiconductor companies are running high this earnings season as several companies have reported strong results (like TXN on Tuesday and MU in late June) while several others have increased guidance in the past couple of weeks or so, including ADI, MXIM, IMOS, FORM, MXL, XLNX. In fairness, Intel is not a direct comparison as it does more than make chips. INTC has been transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, the latter of which accounted for 48% of revenue in 2019. Its data center segment is focused on cloud computing, network infrastructure, and intelligent edge applications as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G. The PC side is not seeing a lot of growth but Intel recently began shipping its 10nm Intel Core processors, which feature a new core architecture. INTC is on track to launch its first 7nm-based product, a discrete GPU, at the end of 2021. Intel's top line growth tends to be pretty modest. However, the company also tends to be consistent relative to consensus estimates as it has not missed on EPS in any quarter over the past five years. And its EPS beats have been getting larger in recent quarters, with four consecutive double digit EPS beats. Overall, some big tech names have reported, but we are still early in the tech reporting cycle.We think Intel should have pretty good results. IBM had a nice quarter and said large enterprise customers are still spending. TXN's quarter is a good sign for Intel as well. Also, Microsoft (MSFT) had a mixed quarter, but its consumer/PC side did well with more people working at home. This is good news for Intel's PC business.</p><p>14:14 ET</p><p>AutoNation and LAD prove our point that car dealerships will be among first to recover:</p><p>AutoNation (AN +8%) is in the driver's seat today as it reported a ridiculously strong Q2 earnings report this morning, which followed a very strong Q1 result in May. As the nation's largest auto retailer with 325 car dealerships from coast to coast, AutoNation has been right in the crosshairs of the pandemic.</p><p>We had to do a double take when the earnings hit this morning. Analysts were expecting a 69% yr/yr decline in EPS. However, AN wound up posting 18% EPS growth at $1.41, way ahead of the $0.37 consensus estimate. Revenue fell 15.2% yr/yr to $4.53 bln, but that also was well ahead of the $4.09 bln consensus.</p><p>This was not just a one-off situation. Another nationwide car dealership, Lithia Motors (LAD +7%), also reported blowout results last night. LAD reported adjusted EPS of $3.72, also well ahead of the $1.54 consensus. LAD also reported strong upside revenue.</p><p>When we published our story stock on AN in May, we hypothesized that car dealerships would see a relatively quicker rebound than industries like air travel, hotels, restaurants, movie theatres, and especially cruise lines. That prediction seems to be coming to fruition with these reports today. Low interest rates and a consumer preference shift toward cars and away from public transit are clearly helping drive demand.</p><p>12:39 ET</p><p>Union Pacific derailed by soft volumes across multiple business groups:</p><p>Heading into this morning's earnings report, shares of Union Pacific (UNP) had rallied nearly 50% off their March lows. The rally, presumably based off hopes of an improving economy, has hit a roadblock as UNP's mixed results and cautious outlook has reset investors' expectations.</p><p>Through solid cost containment efforts, the railroad operator managed to outpace analysts' earnings expectations, generating EPS of $1.67 vs. the $1.56 consensus estimate. While the execution is commendable, the main story resides on the top-line where revenue fell by 24% yr/yr to $4.24 bln.</p><p>The drop was fueled by a 20% decrease in volumes, coupled with a 6% dip in average revenue per car, as negative COVID-19 effects rippled across business groups.</p><p>Main areas of weakness were not surprising, and included automotive (volume -64%), coal (-24%), and energy products (-26%). In order, auto plant shutdowns, weak export demand and low natural gas prices, and depressed oil prices pressured volumes in these segments.</p><p>While facing this very difficult business climate, UNP implemented several cost-cutting and productivity initiatives to help mitigate the demand erosion.</p><p>For instance, the company reduced its train and engine workforce by 32%, outpacing volume declines. Additionally, UNP increased train sizes and put more product on fewer trains, boosting efficiency.</p><p>Lower diesel fuel prices and reduced volumes also pushed fuel expenses lower by 56%.</p><p>Despite these positive factors, UNP's operating ratio deteriorated by 140 bps yr/yr to 61%. UNP is not alone in reporting a downturn in its operating ratio. CSX (CSX) and Canadian National Railway (CNI) reported operating ratios of 63.3% and 60.4% compared to 57.4% and 57.5%, respectively, a year ago. As a reminder, a lower operating ratio is better, illustrating the company's efficiency in generating profits.</p><p>Looking ahead, UNP expects 2020 volumes to be down by about 10% from 2019 levels. The company still sees considerable economic uncertainty due to the virus, especially as local economies reverse recent re-openings.</p><p>On the positive side, UNP has experienced a recent rebound in the automotive segment as vehicle manufacturing plants have reopened and as vehicle demand has strengthened. eCommerce is another area of strength that is likely to continue. Overall, though, UNP remains cautious about business conditions for the remainder of the year.</p><p>11:31 ET</p><p>Chipotle is rolling lower today as the burrito chain broke its string of huge beats:</p><p>Chipotle (CMG -2%) is rolling a bit lower today following its Q2 earnings report last night. There was some consternation heading into this report because CMG did not provide a mid-quarter update as some burger chains had.</p><p>Overall, the results were decent but did not blow us away. Not surprisingly, analysts were expecting a big drop in EPS on a yr/yr basis due to the pandemic and limitations on in-premise dining. That's what happened as adjusted EPS fell 90% yr/yr to $0.40. What's a bit odd is that EPS was right on the button with analyst expectations, which is surprising and rare given the lack of guidance and so many variables related to the pandemic. The unfortunate part of this is that CMG broke its string of seven consecutive double-digit EPS beats. The revenue decline was much more muted as it fell 4.8% yr/yr to $1.36 bln, slightly above analyst expectations.</p><p>In Q2, comps came in at -9.8%, down from +3.3% in Q1. As we said in our preview, investors were likely expecting a weak comp in Q2, but they would want to see at least gradual improvement as the quarter went on. CMG came through in this regard: March (part of Q1, but including here for context) at -16.0%; April -24.4%, May -7.0%, June +2.0%, and July (Q3) so far is +6.4% and that's despite CMG lapping a robust +10% comp in July 2019.</p><p>It's definitely a positive to see CMG back to positive comps the past couple of months. CMG is at a bit of a disadvantage relative to other fast food chains because it does not have a big drive-thru presence that consumers could use to avoid going into a restaurant during the pandemic.</p><p>However, CMG does deserve credit for getting customers to use its digital app and delivery service. Digital sales grew 216.3% yr/yr in Q2 and accounted for 60.7% of sales for the quarter. What's very encouraging, and we've said this in past comments, is that digital sales tend to be sticky. Once people get used to the app, they keep using it. Since sales troughed in late March, CMG has retained 70-80% of its digital sales gains while recovering 40-50% of in-store sales.</p><p>Despite the monthly comp improvement, the stock is lower today. We think the in-line EPS/revenue is being seen as a bit of a disappointment given CMG's penchant for reporting big beats. Also, the stock made a big move in recent months (from $415 at its mid-March low to $1180 heading into this report). We cautioned in our preview that a lot of good news is already priced in, so any stumble/in-line results could take a bite out of the stock. We are seeing a bit of that today.</p><p>10:43 ET</p><p>Tesla electrifies investors with blow-out results and potential inclusion in S&amp;P 500: With shares nearly doubling since Tesla (TSLA) last reported earnings on April 29, the company faced an exceptionally high bar to hurdle regarding its 2Q20 performance. To avoid a likely steep sell-off, blow-out results and another profitable quarter was needed.</p><p>TSLA delivered just that, generating EPS of $2.34, crushing the ($0.16) consensus estimate. In an environment in which the auto industry suffered a 30% decline in 1H20, TSLA's Q2 revenue only fell by 5% to $6.04 bln, easily beating the $5.31 bln forecast.</p><p>The GAAP profit of $104 mln marks the company's fourth straight quarterly profit, paving the way for TSLA to be included in the S&amp;P 500. The meteoric rise in TSLA's stock price suggests that this bullish development was mostly priced into shares. Still, TSLA's evolution to profitability is a significant fundamental achievement that makes the stock more appealing to a wider base of investors.</p><p>TSLA reported solid, better-than-expected Q2 vehicle deliveries of 90,650 on July 2. What was unknown was whether lower operating efficiency, resulting from plant shut-downs, would prevent the company from posting a profit.</p><p>Adjusted automotive gross margin did slide to 18.7% from 20.0% last quarter. However, this dip was mitigated by record regulatory tax credit sales of $428 mln. TSLA sells these government issued credits to its competitors, which they use to offset the cost of making zero emission vehicles.</p><p>If one wants to nit-pick at TSLA's report, one could argue that the quality of the earnings beat is somewhat questionable due to inflated regulatory tax credit sales. Indeed, the degree of TSLA's upside performance wouldn't have been as impressive without this inflation, but this doesn't negate the overall strong performance in our view.</p><p>Improvements in product and manufacturing costs, and a 12.5% yr/yr reduction in operating expenses to $951 mln, also positively impacted the company's profitability.</p><p>In addition to the quarterly results, TSLA had important news to share regarding its next production facility.</p><p>The company has chosen Austin, TX as the location for its fourth plant. The 2,000 acre facility will house production for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, which is expected to be available for delivery in 2021. Also, Model 3 and Model Y sedans for the eastern U.S. market will be produced there.</p><p>Given the sky-high expectations, TSLA needed to astonish investors with strong Q2 results, while spurring excitement for future growth opportunities. The company achieved both goals, as reflected in the stock's move higher.</p><p>10:10 ET</p><p>Microsoft reports a solid quarter but a few areas like Azure were not as robust as in MarQ:</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) reported another solid beat, and yet the stock trades modestly lower. That response makes sense if you dig into the quarter a bit. In terms of revenue, MSFT did quite well overall, reporting upside relative to prior guidance in two of its three segments - Intelligent Cloud (IC) and More Personal Computing (MPC) - while Productivity and Business Processes' (PBP) result was in-line. A slight negative is that growth rates declined from MarQ in PBP (15% to 6%) and IC (27% to 17%). Offsetting that was MPC (+3% to +14%), which saw an acceleration as Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefitted from more people at home. In terms of EPS, MSFT broke its string of double digit EPS beats at five in a row. The $0.08 upside this quarter was good, but it was not quite as robust as the beats delivered in recent quarters. Probably more troubling was a modest degradation in growth in several key areas: Most prominently, in MSFT's Azure cloud computing business, its crown jewel, growth slowed a bit to 47% in JunQ from 59% in MarQ. Office Commercial products and cloud services slowed to +5% from +13% in MarQ. IC Server products and cloud services slowed to +19% in JunQ from +30% in MarQ. LinkedIn growth slowed to +10% in JunQ from +21% in MarQ, as it was impacted by a weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. Transactional license purchasing continued to slow, particularly in small and medium businesses.</p><p>Overall, this was still a very good quarter, with a solid beat on revenue and EPS. The primary culprits for the stock's move lower, we think, is lackluster PBP segment growth coupled with Azure's performance. While Azure had great growth, with so many companies and consumers using the cloud as they work/learn from home, the Azure number was a slight letdown. This may be a slight cause for concern for Amazon (AMZN) and its rival AWS unit, which reports on July 30.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368389330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-WN41-JC8H-K017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2266\"/><timeReceived>3:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

Current CapitalIQ consensus for EPS is $1.11 and for revenue it's $18.55 bln. Intel typically guides for EPS and revenue for the next quarter in the press release. In April, Intel guided to Q2 non-GAAP EPS of approx. $1.10 and revenue of approx. $18.50 bln. Expectations for semiconductor companies are running high this earnings season as several companies have reported strong results (like TXN on Tuesday and MU in late June) while several others have increased guidance in the past couple of weeks or so, including ADI, MXIM, IMOS, FORM, MXL, XLNX. In fairness, Intel is not a direct comparison as it does more than make chips. INTC has been transforming from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company, the latter of which accounted for 48% of revenue in 2019. Its data center segment is focused on cloud computing, network infrastructure, and intelligent edge applications as well as artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G. The PC side is not seeing a lot of growth but Intel recently began shipping its 10nm Intel Core processors, which feature a new core architecture. INTC is on track to launch its first 7nm-based product, a discrete GPU, at the end of 2021. Intel's top line growth tends to be pretty modest. However, the company also tends to be consistent relative to consensus estimates as it has not missed on EPS in any quarter over the past five years. And its EPS beats have been getting larger in recent quarters, with four consecutive double digit EPS beats. Overall, some big tech names have reported, but we are still early in the tech reporting cycle.We think Intel should have pretty good results. IBM had a nice quarter and said large enterprise customers are still spending. TXN's quarter is a good sign for Intel as well. Also, Microsoft (MSFT) had a mixed quarter, but its consumer/PC side did well with more people working at home. This is good news for Intel's PC business.</p><p>14:14 ET</p><p>AutoNation and LAD prove our point that car dealerships will be among first to recover:</p><p>AutoNation (AN +8%) is in the driver's seat today as it reported a ridiculously strong Q2 earnings report this morning, which followed a very strong Q1 result in May. As the nation's largest auto retailer with 325 car dealerships from coast to coast, AutoNation has been right in the crosshairs of the pandemic.</p><p>We had to do a double take when the earnings hit this morning. Analysts were expecting a 69% yr/yr decline in EPS. However, AN wound up posting 18% EPS growth at $1.41, way ahead of the $0.37 consensus estimate. Revenue fell 15.2% yr/yr to $4.53 bln, but that also was well ahead of the $4.09 bln consensus.</p><p>This was not just a one-off situation. Another nationwide car dealership, Lithia Motors (LAD +7%), also reported blowout results last night. LAD reported adjusted EPS of $3.72, also well ahead of the $1.54 consensus. LAD also reported strong upside revenue.</p><p>When we published our story stock on AN in May, we hypothesized that car dealerships would see a relatively quicker rebound than industries like air travel, hotels, restaurants, movie theatres, and especially cruise lines. That prediction seems to be coming to fruition with these reports today. Low interest rates and a consumer preference shift toward cars and away from public transit are clearly helping drive demand.</p><p>12:39 ET</p><p>Union Pacific derailed by soft volumes across multiple business groups:</p><p>Heading into this morning's earnings report, shares of Union Pacific (UNP) had rallied nearly 50% off their March lows. The rally, presumably based off hopes of an improving economy, has hit a roadblock as UNP's mixed results and cautious outlook has reset investors' expectations.</p><p>Through solid cost containment efforts, the railroad operator managed to outpace analysts' earnings expectations, generating EPS of $1.67 vs. the $1.56 consensus estimate. While the execution is commendable, the main story resides on the top-line where revenue fell by 24% yr/yr to $4.24 bln.</p><p>The drop was fueled by a 20% decrease in volumes, coupled with a 6% dip in average revenue per car, as negative COVID-19 effects rippled across business groups.</p><p>Main areas of weakness were not surprising, and included automotive (volume -64%), coal (-24%), and energy products (-26%). In order, auto plant shutdowns, weak export demand and low natural gas prices, and depressed oil prices pressured volumes in these segments.</p><p>While facing this very difficult business climate, UNP implemented several cost-cutting and productivity initiatives to help mitigate the demand erosion.</p><p>For instance, the company reduced its train and engine workforce by 32%, outpacing volume declines. Additionally, UNP increased train sizes and put more product on fewer trains, boosting efficiency.</p><p>Lower diesel fuel prices and reduced volumes also pushed fuel expenses lower by 56%.</p><p>Despite these positive factors, UNP's operating ratio deteriorated by 140 bps yr/yr to 61%. UNP is not alone in reporting a downturn in its operating ratio. CSX (CSX) and Canadian National Railway (CNI) reported operating ratios of 63.3% and 60.4% compared to 57.4% and 57.5%, respectively, a year ago. As a reminder, a lower operating ratio is better, illustrating the company's efficiency in generating profits.</p><p>Looking ahead, UNP expects 2020 volumes to be down by about 10% from 2019 levels. The company still sees considerable economic uncertainty due to the virus, especially as local economies reverse recent re-openings.</p><p>On the positive side, UNP has experienced a recent rebound in the automotive segment as vehicle manufacturing plants have reopened and as vehicle demand has strengthened. eCommerce is another area of strength that is likely to continue. Overall, though, UNP remains cautious about business conditions for the remainder of the year.</p><p>11:31 ET</p><p>Chipotle is rolling lower today as the burrito chain broke its string of huge beats:</p><p>Chipotle (CMG -2%) is rolling a bit lower today following its Q2 earnings report last night. There was some consternation heading into this report because CMG did not provide a mid-quarter update as some burger chains had.</p><p>Overall, the results were decent but did not blow us away. Not surprisingly, analysts were expecting a big drop in EPS on a yr/yr basis due to the pandemic and limitations on in-premise dining. That's what happened as adjusted EPS fell 90% yr/yr to $0.40. What's a bit odd is that EPS was right on the button with analyst expectations, which is surprising and rare given the lack of guidance and so many variables related to the pandemic. The unfortunate part of this is that CMG broke its string of seven consecutive double-digit EPS beats. The revenue decline was much more muted as it fell 4.8% yr/yr to $1.36 bln, slightly above analyst expectations.</p><p>In Q2, comps came in at -9.8%, down from +3.3% in Q1. As we said in our preview, investors were likely expecting a weak comp in Q2, but they would want to see at least gradual improvement as the quarter went on. CMG came through in this regard: March (part of Q1, but including here for context) at -16.0%; April -24.4%, May -7.0%, June +2.0%, and July (Q3) so far is +6.4% and that's despite CMG lapping a robust +10% comp in July 2019.</p><p>It's definitely a positive to see CMG back to positive comps the past couple of months. CMG is at a bit of a disadvantage relative to other fast food chains because it does not have a big drive-thru presence that consumers could use to avoid going into a restaurant during the pandemic.</p><p>However, CMG does deserve credit for getting customers to use its digital app and delivery service. Digital sales grew 216.3% yr/yr in Q2 and accounted for 60.7% of sales for the quarter. What's very encouraging, and we've said this in past comments, is that digital sales tend to be sticky. Once people get used to the app, they keep using it. Since sales troughed in late March, CMG has retained 70-80% of its digital sales gains while recovering 40-50% of in-store sales.</p><p>Despite the monthly comp improvement, the stock is lower today. We think the in-line EPS/revenue is being seen as a bit of a disappointment given CMG's penchant for reporting big beats. Also, the stock made a big move in recent months (from $415 at its mid-March low to $1180 heading into this report). We cautioned in our preview that a lot of good news is already priced in, so any stumble/in-line results could take a bite out of the stock. We are seeing a bit of that today.</p><p>10:43 ET</p><p>Tesla electrifies investors with blow-out results and potential inclusion in S&amp;P 500: With shares nearly doubling since Tesla (TSLA) last reported earnings on April 29, the company faced an exceptionally high bar to hurdle regarding its 2Q20 performance. To avoid a likely steep sell-off, blow-out results and another profitable quarter was needed.</p><p>TSLA delivered just that, generating EPS of $2.34, crushing the ($0.16) consensus estimate. In an environment in which the auto industry suffered a 30% decline in 1H20, TSLA's Q2 revenue only fell by 5% to $6.04 bln, easily beating the $5.31 bln forecast.</p><p>The GAAP profit of $104 mln marks the company's fourth straight quarterly profit, paving the way for TSLA to be included in the S&amp;P 500. The meteoric rise in TSLA's stock price suggests that this bullish development was mostly priced into shares. Still, TSLA's evolution to profitability is a significant fundamental achievement that makes the stock more appealing to a wider base of investors.</p><p>TSLA reported solid, better-than-expected Q2 vehicle deliveries of 90,650 on July 2. What was unknown was whether lower operating efficiency, resulting from plant shut-downs, would prevent the company from posting a profit.</p><p>Adjusted automotive gross margin did slide to 18.7% from 20.0% last quarter. However, this dip was mitigated by record regulatory tax credit sales of $428 mln. TSLA sells these government issued credits to its competitors, which they use to offset the cost of making zero emission vehicles.</p><p>If one wants to nit-pick at TSLA's report, one could argue that the quality of the earnings beat is somewhat questionable due to inflated regulatory tax credit sales. Indeed, the degree of TSLA's upside performance wouldn't have been as impressive without this inflation, but this doesn't negate the overall strong performance in our view.</p><p>Improvements in product and manufacturing costs, and a 12.5% yr/yr reduction in operating expenses to $951 mln, also positively impacted the company's profitability.</p><p>In addition to the quarterly results, TSLA had important news to share regarding its next production facility.</p><p>The company has chosen Austin, TX as the location for its fourth plant. The 2,000 acre facility will house production for the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi, which is expected to be available for delivery in 2021. Also, Model 3 and Model Y sedans for the eastern U.S. market will be produced there.</p><p>Given the sky-high expectations, TSLA needed to astonish investors with strong Q2 results, while spurring excitement for future growth opportunities. The company achieved both goals, as reflected in the stock's move higher.</p><p>10:10 ET</p><p>Microsoft reports a solid quarter but a few areas like Azure were not as robust as in MarQ:</p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) reported another solid beat, and yet the stock trades modestly lower. That response makes sense if you dig into the quarter a bit. In terms of revenue, MSFT did quite well overall, reporting upside relative to prior guidance in two of its three segments - Intelligent Cloud (IC) and More Personal Computing (MPC) - while Productivity and Business Processes' (PBP) result was in-line. A slight negative is that growth rates declined from MarQ in PBP (15% to 6%) and IC (27% to 17%). Offsetting that was MPC (+3% to +14%), which saw an acceleration as Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefitted from more people at home. In terms of EPS, MSFT broke its string of double digit EPS beats at five in a row. The $0.08 upside this quarter was good, but it was not quite as robust as the beats delivered in recent quarters. Probably more troubling was a modest degradation in growth in several key areas: Most prominently, in MSFT's Azure cloud computing business, its crown jewel, growth slowed a bit to 47% in JunQ from 59% in MarQ. Office Commercial products and cloud services slowed to +5% from +13% in MarQ. IC Server products and cloud services slowed to +19% in JunQ from +30% in MarQ. LinkedIn growth slowed to +10% in JunQ from +21% in MarQ, as it was impacted by a weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. Transactional license purchasing continued to slow, particularly in small and medium businesses.</p><p>Overall, this was still a very good quarter, with a solid beat on revenue and EPS. The primary culprits for the stock's move lower, we think, is lackluster PBP segment growth coupled with Azure's performance. While Azure had great growth, with so many companies and consumers using the cloud as they work/learn from home, the Azure number was a slight letdown. This may be a slight cause for concern for Amazon (AMZN) and its rival AWS unit, which reports on July 30.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368389834</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-WN41-JC8H-K01C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2266\"/><timeReceived>4:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

It reported a large miss and announced a delay with its 777X program.</p><p>The top-line numbers were actually pretty good relative to consensus as BA reported a core (non-GAAP) loss of $(5.82) per share while revenue fell 35.1% yr/yr to $15.75 bln. Both metrics saw big declines yr/yr but came in well ahead of consensus estimates. Boeing's well known 737 MAX issues and delays caused the large loss and revenue decline this quarter.</p><p>Investors who have followed Boeing over the long term know that its annual guidance is very important to monitor. However, BA suspended its full year guidance last quarter due to the MAX issues and that is still the case now. It sounds like it may be a while before we get annual guidance again.</p><p>So why is the stock down? We do not think it's the headline numbers as most investors expected big losses from the MAX. The culprit seems to a delay in its 777X program. Boeing is delaying first flight until early 2020 vs earlier guidance of late 2019. It's still progressing well through pre-flight testing and BA is still targeting late 2020 for first delivery of the 777X. However, BA now says there is significant risk to this schedule given engine challenges at its GE supplier.</p><p>The 737 MAX gets most of the attention, but investors have also been eagerly awaiting the 777X, which will be the world's largest and most efficient twin-engine jet. Other planes are larger, but they require four engines. The 777X needs just two engines despite its larger size and its spacious, widebody cabin.</p><p>In sum, the stock is down on the Q2 report. While some investors are likely focusing on the large loss, which is very unusual for Boeing, we think the 777X delay is the main reason the stock is lower today. With the 737 MAX issues and now 777X, it sort of seems like BA is playing whack-a-mole as it works through these issues.</p><p>The weakness was further exacerbated on the call this morning as the company said it expected the MAX issues will hurt cash flow for several years with it being more front-end loaded in the first few years.</p><p>We continue to like the long-term potential for Boeing. Specifically, BA thinks the worldwide fleet will double over the longer term as more countries with emerging economies boost air travel. Also, there is a large replacement cycle expected in the next few years. However, we think there will be a cloud over this stock until we get more clarity on when the 737 MAX will return to the air.</p><p>13:34 ET</p><p>Chipotle rolls higher on strong EPS upside; new CEO seems to be making progress:</p><p>ChipotleMexican Grill (CMG) is trading higher today following a strong Q2 report last night. Non-GAAP EPS Jumped 39% yr/yr to $3.99 while revenue rose 13.2% yr/yr to $1.43 bln. Both results were better than expected with EPS coming in well ahead of expectations.</p><p>The metric that really stands out to us is the same-store comps coming in a robust +10%, with +7% coming from a higher number of transactions and +3.5% from higher average check (mostly menu price increases). What's notable is that the Q2 comps have accelerated in recent quarters. In Q1, comps were +9.9%, and were at +6.1% in Q4 and +1.0% in Q3.</p><p>Chipotle has made a remarkable turnaround and these results are the product of a number of new initiatives being implemented by the company. CMG hired a new CEO in March 2018. Brian Niccol was tasked with turning around the struggling burrito chain.</p><p>Prior to joining Chipotle, Brian Niccol was at Taco Bell from 2011 and served as CEO from January 2015. He successfully repositioned Taco Bell as a lifestyle brand and successfully launched numerous product initiatives, including the new breakfast daypart which is the fastest growing daypart in the industry. He also transformed Taco Bell into a social media leader and revolutionized its digital approach. According to Eater,com, he was \"largely credited with helping turning the brand into a #brand, using social platforms like Snapchat and Twitter to lure a more youthful demographic into late-night drive-thru runs for Doritos Locos tacos and fried chicken shell tacos.\"</p><p>The company has been busy revamping its marketing message (focusing more on real ingredients), building out its digital capabilities, launching its delivery service (now available at 95% of locations), and launching a new loyalty program, which is exceeding internal expectations, according to the company on the call last night.</p><p>There also are some menu additions on the way. On the call, CEO Niccol said that carne asada is the new addition that is furthest along. It \"is nearing validation through our stage-gate process, after which we will decide on the timing of a potential national launch.\" Niccol also said CMG has a quesadilla pilot going on as well and it's getting high marks from customers. Desserts and nachos are also in the works. Also, catering is a tiny part of its business, but CMG sees tremendous opportunity for that sales channel.</p><p>In sum, CMG is ramping higher today. The strong EPS upside accounts for part of it, but it seems the excitement about changes ahead are just as responsible for the big move today. Upcoming menu changes, catering, delivery etc. are whetting investors' appetites. We have to tip our cap to the new CEO as he seems to be doing a good job in turning Chipotle around.</p><p>12:26 ET</p><p>Visa's growth accelerates on stronger consumer spending, ongoing shift towards digital payments: Visa (V) posted solid Q3 results after the close last night. The company reported EPS of $1.37 vs. the $1.32 consensus, extending its winning streak vs. analysts' expectations to fifteen straight quarters.</p><p>Growth accelerated during the quarter with revenue increasing by 13% on a constant currency basis to $5.84 bln, edging the $5.7 bln expectation. That represents an up-tick from last quarter's 9.5% top-line growth.</p><p>The better-than-expected Q3 results, combined with the integration of a few acquisitions and the continuing trend towards electronic payments, provided the confidence for Visa to slightly raise its outlook for FY19.</p><p>Visa now expects to generate EPS growth in the \"mid-to-high teens\" compared to its prior guidance of \"high end of mid-teens\".</p><p>Click here to access Visa's earnings press release.</p><p>All of Visa's key demand-related operating metrics showed improvement. Payment volume was up 9% on a constant currency basis vs. 8% in Q2. Cross-border volume was higher by 7% compared to 4% last quarter. Processed transactions grew by 12%, up from 11% in Q2, driven primarily by stronger growth in the U.S. and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina.</p><p>There were a few main catalysts underlying Visa's performance.</p><p>First, consumer credit is expanding. Specifically, April U.S. consumer credit increased by $17.5 bln, followed by a $17.1 bln increase in May. This indicates that consumers are willing to spend and borrow money and they are confident in their ability to repay debt. Therefore, the growth in consumer credit is both a positive factor for Visa and the economy.</p><p>Second, Visa also benefited from lower-than-expected client incentives as well as a more favorable timing of Easter, relative to last year, which does temper some enthusiasm regarding its results.</p><p>Last, Visa has been very aggressive on the acquisition front.</p><p>On June 25, Visa acquired the token services and ticketing business from Rambus. This ties in with Visa's strategy to become a leader in blockchain technologies which would support cryptocurrencies like Facebook's (FB) Libra. In fact, Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Foundation that is working to launch that currency.</p><p>A few days following that acquisition, Visa purchased Verify, the owner of a dispute resolution platform that will bolster Visa's risk and fraud management solutions.</p><p>Key Takeaways: Visa's strong results are driven by a potent secular trend towards digitization of commerce and a healthy consumer. The pick-up in growth -- albeit modest -- provides confidence that the global economy hasn't significantly deteriorated.</p><p>From a company-specific standpoint, Visa's strategy revolves around acquisitions that enhance and diversify its payment processing capabilities.</p><p>11:11 ET</p><p>UPS moves higher as next-day delivery demand aligns with strategic investments:</p><p>Shares of UPS (UPS +9%) are taking off after the company reported better than expected second quarter results this morning.</p><p>Earnings grew 1% on a 3% increase in revenue. The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month. FedEx continues to struggle with European exposure brought about by the TNT Express acquisition.</p><p>UPS stock is attempting to break out from its slight downtrend as it approaches resistance from its April highs.</p><p>07:01 ET</p><p>Big tech stocks fall after DOJ announces broad antitrust review:</p><p>Big technology stocks are trading lower premarket after the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>We already knew that regulators were swarming big technology companies, but this news confirms that the Federal government is serious about potentially reigning in the power of the technology behemoths.</p><p>This is separate from the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets that was announced in early June. Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce. They are the three bigest advertisers on the internet. Apple seems to be the least at risk, although iOS and the app store give it tremendous power over the technology sector. Ironically, the largest U.S. tech company, Microsoft (MSFT), does not seem to be at risk.</p><p>The four primary targets of regulators account for just over 33% of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and nearly 12% of the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). Clearly, these four stocks have considerable influence over the US stock market.</p><p>Politicians have been calling for regulations on Silicon Valley for some time, but we are now finally seeing the wheels set into motion to potentially curb the influence of the most powerful companies in the Western world.</p><p>A regulatory overhang will likely be in place for a while as investigations will take time to play out.</p><p>Facebook will report second quarter results this afternoon; Alphabet and Amazon will report Thursday afternoon and Apple reports on the afternoon of July 30.</p><p>Tech giants premarket: FB -1.2% GOOG/L -1.1% AMZN -0.8% AAPL -0.5%.</p><p>Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.3%.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348670302</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HKS1-DYRK-949K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2167\"/><timeReceived>3:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month. FedEx continues to struggle with European exposure brought about by the TNT Express acquisition.</p><p>UPS stock is attempting to break out from its slight downtrend as it approaches resistance from its April highs.</p><p>07:01 ET</p><p>Big tech stocks fall after DOJ announces broad antitrust review:</p><p>Big technology stocks are trading lower premarket after the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>We already knew that regulators were swarming big technology companies, but this news confirms that the Federal government is serious about potentially reigning in the power of the technology behemoths.</p><p>This is separate from the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets that was announced in early June. Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce. They are the three bigest advertisers on the internet. Apple seems to be the least at risk, although iOS and the app store give it tremendous power over the technology sector. Ironically, the largest U.S. tech company, Microsoft (MSFT), does not seem to be at risk.</p><p>The four primary targets of regulators account for just over 33% of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and nearly 12% of the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). Clearly, these four stocks have considerable influence over the US stock market.</p><p>Politicians have been calling for regulations on Silicon Valley for some time, but we are now finally seeing the wheels set into motion to potentially curb the influence of the most powerful companies in the Western world.</p><p>A regulatory overhang will likely be in place for a while as investigations will take time to play out.</p><p>Facebook will report second quarter results this afternoon; Alphabet and Amazon will report Thursday afternoon and Apple reports on the afternoon of July 30.</p><p>Tech giants premarket: FB -1.2% GOOG/L -1.1% AMZN -0.8% AAPL -0.5%.</p><p>Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.3%.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348659373</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J611-JC8H-K4KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><timeReceived>12:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month. FedEx continues to struggle with European exposure brought about by the TNT Express acquisition.</p><p>UPS stock is attempting to break out from its slight downtrend as it approaches resistance from its April highs.</p><p>07:01 ET</p><p>Big tech stocks fall after DOJ announces broad antitrust review:</p><p>Big technology stocks are trading lower premarket after the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>We already knew that regulators were swarming big technology companies, but this news confirms that the Federal government is serious about potentially reigning in the power of the technology behemoths.</p><p>This is separate from the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets that was announced in early June. Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce. They are the three bigest advertisers on the internet. Apple seems to be the least at risk, although iOS and the app store give it tremendous power over the technology sector. Ironically, the largest U.S. tech company, Microsoft (MSFT), does not seem to be at risk.</p><p>The four primary targets of regulators account for just over 33% of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and nearly 12% of the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). Clearly, these four stocks have considerable influence over the US stock market.</p><p>Politicians have been calling for regulations on Silicon Valley for some time, but we are now finally seeing the wheels set into motion to potentially curb the influence of the most powerful companies in the Western world.</p><p>A regulatory overhang will likely be in place for a while as investigations will take time to play out.</p><p>Facebook will report second quarter results this afternoon; Alphabet and Amazon will report Thursday afternoon and Apple reports on the afternoon of July 30.</p><p>Tech giants premarket: FB -1.2% GOOG/L -1.1% AMZN -0.8% AAPL -0.5%.</p><p>Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.3%.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348659373</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K40G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><timeReceived>12:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The company reported EPS of $1.37 vs. the $1.32 consensus, extending its winning streak vs. analysts' expectations to fifteen straight quarters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Growth accelerated during the quarter with revenue increasing by 13% on a constant currency basis to $5.84 bln, edging the $5.7 bln expectation. That represents an up-tick from last quarter's 9.5% top-line growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The better-than-expected Q3 results, combined with the integration of a few acquisitions and the continuing trend towards electronic payments, provided the confidence for Visa to slightly raise its outlook for FY19.</p><p>Visa now expects to generate EPS growth in the \"mid-to-high teens\" compared to its prior guidance of \"high end of mid-teens\".</p><p>Click here to access Visa's earnings press release.</p><p>All of Visa's key demand-related operating metrics showed improvement. Payment volume was up 9% on a constant currency basis vs. 8% in Q2. Cross-border volume was higher by 7% compared to 4% last quarter. Processed transactions grew by 12%, up from 11% in Q2, driven primarily by stronger growth in the U.S. and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina.</p><p>There were a few main catalysts underlying Visa's performance.</p><p>First, consumer credit is expanding. Specifically, April U.S. consumer credit increased by $17.5 bln, followed by a $17.1 bln increase in May. This indicates that consumers are willing to spend and borrow money and they are confident in their ability to repay debt. Therefore, the growth in consumer credit is both a positive factor for Visa and the economy.</p><p>Second, Visa also benefited from lower-than-expected client incentives as well as a more favorable timing of Easter, relative to last year, which does temper some enthusiasm regarding its results.</p><p>Last, Visa has been very aggressive on the acquisition front.</p><p>On June 25, Visa acquired the token services and ticketing business from Rambus. This ties in with Visa's strategy to become a leader in blockchain technologies which would support cryptocurrencies like Facebook's (FB) Libra. In fact, Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Foundation that is working to launch that currency.</p><p>A few days following that acquisition, Visa purchased Verify, the owner of a dispute resolution platform that will bolster Visa's risk and fraud management solutions.</p><p>Key Takeaways: Visa's strong results are driven by a potent secular trend towards digitization of commerce and a healthy consumer. The pick-up in growth -- albeit modest -- provides confidence that the global economy hasn't significantly deteriorated.</p><p>From a company-specific standpoint, Visa's strategy revolves around acquisitions that enhance and diversify its payment processing capabilities.</p><p>11:11 ET</p><p>UPS moves higher as next-day delivery demand aligns with strategic investments:</p><p>Shares of UPS (UPS +9%) are taking off after the company reported better than expected second quarter results this morning.</p><p>Earnings grew 1% on a 3% increase in revenue. The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month. FedEx continues to struggle with European exposure brought about by the TNT Express acquisition.</p><p>UPS stock is attempting to break out from its slight downtrend as it approaches resistance from its April highs.</p><p>07:01 ET</p><p>Big tech stocks fall after DOJ announces broad antitrust review:</p><p>Big technology stocks are trading lower premarket after the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>We already knew that regulators were swarming big technology companies, but this news confirms that the Federal government is serious about potentially reigning in the power of the technology behemoths.</p><p>This is separate from the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets that was announced in early June. Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce. They are the three bigest advertisers on the internet. Apple seems to be the least at risk, although iOS and the app store give it tremendous power over the technology sector. Ironically, the largest U.S. tech company, Microsoft (MSFT), does not seem to be at risk.</p><p>The four primary targets of regulators account for just over 33% of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and nearly 12% of the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). Clearly, these four stocks have considerable influence over the US stock market.</p><p>Politicians have been calling for regulations on Silicon Valley for some time, but we are now finally seeing the wheels set into motion to potentially curb the influence of the most powerful companies in the Western world.</p><p>A regulatory overhang will likely be in place for a while as investigations will take time to play out.</p><p>Facebook will report second quarter results this afternoon; Alphabet and Amazon will report Thursday afternoon and Apple reports on the afternoon of July 30.</p><p>Tech giants premarket: FB -1.2% GOOG/L -1.1% AMZN -0.8% AAPL -0.5%.</p><p>Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.3%.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348660143</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K40H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1257\"/><timeReceived>12:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

It reported a large miss and announced a delay with its 777X program.</p><p>The top-line numbers were actually pretty good relative to consensus as BA reported a core (non-GAAP) loss of $(5.82) per share while revenue fell 35.1% yr/yr to $15.75 bln. Both metrics saw big declines yr/yr but came in well ahead of consensus estimates. Boeing's well known 737 MAX issues and delays caused the large loss and revenue decline this quarter.</p><p>Investors who have followed Boeing over the long term know that its annual guidance is very important to monitor. However, BA suspended its full year guidance last quarter due to the MAX issues and that is still the case now. It sounds like it may be a while before we get annual guidance again.</p><p>So why is the stock down? We do not think it's the headline numbers as most investors expected big losses from the MAX. The culprit seems to a delay in its 777X program. Boeing is delaying first flight until early 2020 vs earlier guidance of late 2019. It's still progressing well through pre-flight testing and BA is still targeting late 2020 for first delivery of the 777X. However, BA now says there is significant risk to this schedule given engine challenges at its GE supplier.</p><p>The 737 MAX gets most of the attention, but investors have also been eagerly awaiting the 777X, which will be the world's largest and most efficient twin-engine jet. Other planes are larger, but they require four engines. The 777X needs just two engines despite its larger size and its spacious, widebody cabin.</p><p>In sum, the stock is down on the Q2 report. While some investors are likely focusing on the large loss, which is very unusual for Boeing, we think the 777X delay is the main reason the stock is lower today. With the 737 MAX issues and now 777X, it sort of seems like BA is playing whack-a-mole as it works through these issues.</p><p>The weakness was further exacerbated on the call this morning as the company said it expected the MAX issues will hurt cash flow for several years with it being more front-end loaded in the first few years.</p><p>We continue to like the long-term potential for Boeing. Specifically, BA thinks the worldwide fleet will double over the longer term as more countries with emerging economies boost air travel. Also, there is a large replacement cycle expected in the next few years. However, we think there will be a cloud over this stock until we get more clarity on when the 737 MAX will return to the air.</p><p>13:34 ET</p><p>Chipotle rolls higher on strong EPS upside; new CEO seems to be making progress:</p><p>ChipotleMexican Grill (CMG) is trading higher today following a strong Q2 report last night. Non-GAAP EPS Jumped 39% yr/yr to $3.99 while revenue rose 13.2% yr/yr to $1.43 bln. Both results were better than expected with EPS coming in well ahead of expectations.</p><p>The metric that really stands out to us is the same-store comps coming in a robust +10%, with +7% coming from a higher number of transactions and +3.5% from higher average check (mostly menu price increases). What's notable is that the Q2 comps have accelerated in recent quarters. In Q1, comps were +9.9%, and were at +6.1% in Q4 and +1.0% in Q3.</p><p>Chipotle has made a remarkable turnaround and these results are the product of a number of new initiatives being implemented by the company. CMG hired a new CEO in March 2018. Brian Niccol was tasked with turning around the struggling burrito chain.</p><p>Prior to joining Chipotle, Brian Niccol was at Taco Bell from 2011 and served as CEO from January 2015. He successfully repositioned Taco Bell as a lifestyle brand and successfully launched numerous product initiatives, including the new breakfast daypart which is the fastest growing daypart in the industry. He also transformed Taco Bell into a social media leader and revolutionized its digital approach. According to Eater,com, he was \"largely credited with helping turning the brand into a #brand, using social platforms like Snapchat and Twitter to lure a more youthful demographic into late-night drive-thru runs for Doritos Locos tacos and fried chicken shell tacos.\"</p><p>The company has been busy revamping its marketing message (focusing more on real ingredients), building out its digital capabilities, launching its delivery service (now available at 95% of locations), and launching a new loyalty program, which is exceeding internal expectations, according to the company on the call last night.</p><p>There also are some menu additions on the way. On the call, CEO Niccol said that carne asada is the new addition that is furthest along. It \"is nearing validation through our stage-gate process, after which we will decide on the timing of a potential national launch.\" Niccol also said CMG has a quesadilla pilot going on as well and it's getting high marks from customers. Desserts and nachos are also in the works. Also, catering is a tiny part of its business, but CMG sees tremendous opportunity for that sales channel.</p><p>In sum, CMG is ramping higher today. The strong EPS upside accounts for part of it, but it seems the excitement about changes ahead are just as responsible for the big move today. Upcoming menu changes, catering, delivery etc. are whetting investors' appetites. We have to tip our cap to the new CEO as he seems to be doing a good job in turning Chipotle around.</p><p>12:26 ET</p><p>Visa's growth accelerates on stronger consumer spending, ongoing shift towards digital payments: Visa (V) posted solid Q3 results after the close last night. The company reported EPS of $1.37 vs. the $1.32 consensus, extending its winning streak vs. analysts' expectations to fifteen straight quarters.</p><p>Growth accelerated during the quarter with revenue increasing by 13% on a constant currency basis to $5.84 bln, edging the $5.7 bln expectation. That represents an up-tick from last quarter's 9.5% top-line growth.</p><p>The better-than-expected Q3 results, combined with the integration of a few acquisitions and the continuing trend towards electronic payments, provided the confidence for Visa to slightly raise its outlook for FY19.</p><p>Visa now expects to generate EPS growth in the \"mid-to-high teens\" compared to its prior guidance of \"high end of mid-teens\".</p><p>Click here to access Visa's earnings press release.</p><p>All of Visa's key demand-related operating metrics showed improvement. Payment volume was up 9% on a constant currency basis vs. 8% in Q2. Cross-border volume was higher by 7% compared to 4% last quarter. Processed transactions grew by 12%, up from 11% in Q2, driven primarily by stronger growth in the U.S. and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina.</p><p>There were a few main catalysts underlying Visa's performance.</p><p>First, consumer credit is expanding. Specifically, April U.S. consumer credit increased by $17.5 bln, followed by a $17.1 bln increase in May. This indicates that consumers are willing to spend and borrow money and they are confident in their ability to repay debt. Therefore, the growth in consumer credit is both a positive factor for Visa and the economy.</p><p>Second, Visa also benefited from lower-than-expected client incentives as well as a more favorable timing of Easter, relative to last year, which does temper some enthusiasm regarding its results.</p><p>Last, Visa has been very aggressive on the acquisition front.</p><p>On June 25, Visa acquired the token services and ticketing business from Rambus. This ties in with Visa's strategy to become a leader in blockchain technologies which would support cryptocurrencies like Facebook's (FB) Libra. In fact, Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Foundation that is working to launch that currency.</p><p>A few days following that acquisition, Visa purchased Verify, the owner of a dispute resolution platform that will bolster Visa's risk and fraud management solutions.</p><p>Key Takeaways: Visa's strong results are driven by a potent secular trend towards digitization of commerce and a healthy consumer. The pick-up in growth -- albeit modest -- provides confidence that the global economy hasn't significantly deteriorated.</p><p>From a company-specific standpoint, Visa's strategy revolves around acquisitions that enhance and diversify its payment processing capabilities.</p><p>11:11 ET</p><p>UPS moves higher as next-day delivery demand aligns with strategic investments:</p><p>Shares of UPS (UPS +9%) are taking off after the company reported better than expected second quarter results this morning.</p><p>Earnings grew 1% on a 3% increase in revenue. The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month. FedEx continues to struggle with European exposure brought about by the TNT Express acquisition.</p><p>UPS stock is attempting to break out from its slight downtrend as it approaches resistance from its April highs.</p><p>07:01 ET</p><p>Big tech stocks fall after DOJ announces broad antitrust review:</p><p>Big technology stocks are trading lower premarket after the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>We already knew that regulators were swarming big technology companies, but this news confirms that the Federal government is serious about potentially reigning in the power of the technology behemoths.</p><p>This is separate from the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets that was announced in early June. Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce. They are the three bigest advertisers on the internet. Apple seems to be the least at risk, although iOS and the app store give it tremendous power over the technology sector. Ironically, the largest U.S. tech company, Microsoft (MSFT), does not seem to be at risk.</p><p>The four primary targets of regulators account for just over 33% of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and nearly 12% of the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). Clearly, these four stocks have considerable influence over the US stock market.</p><p>Politicians have been calling for regulations on Silicon Valley for some time, but we are now finally seeing the wheels set into motion to potentially curb the influence of the most powerful companies in the Western world.</p><p>A regulatory overhang will likely be in place for a while as investigations will take time to play out.</p><p>Facebook will report second quarter results this afternoon; Alphabet and Amazon will report Thursday afternoon and Apple reports on the afternoon of July 30.</p><p>Tech giants premarket: FB -1.2% GOOG/L -1.1% AMZN -0.8% AAPL -0.5%.</p><p>Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.3%.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348670302</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HMD1-JC8H-K198-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2167\"/><timeReceived>3:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

It reported a large miss and announced a delay with its 777X program.</p><p>The top-line numbers were actually pretty good relative to consensus as BA reported a core (non-GAAP) loss of $(5.82) per share while revenue fell 35.1% yr/yr to $15.75 bln. Both metrics saw big declines yr/yr but came in well ahead of consensus estimates. Boeing's well known 737 MAX issues and delays caused the large loss and revenue decline this quarter.</p><p>Investors who have followed Boeing over the long term know that its annual guidance is very important to monitor. However, BA suspended its full year guidance last quarter due to the MAX issues and that is still the case now. It sounds like it may be a while before we get annual guidance again.</p><p>So why is the stock down? We do not think it's the headline numbers as most investors expected big losses from the MAX. The culprit seems to a delay in its 777X program. Boeing is delaying first flight until early 2020 vs earlier guidance of late 2019. It's still progressing well through pre-flight testing and BA is still targeting late 2020 for first delivery of the 777X. However, BA now says there is significant risk to this schedule given engine challenges at its GE supplier.</p><p>The 737 MAX gets most of the attention, but investors have also been eagerly awaiting the 777X, which will be the world's largest and most efficient twin-engine jet. Other planes are larger, but they require four engines. The 777X needs just two engines despite its larger size and its spacious, widebody cabin.</p><p>In sum, the stock is down on the Q2 report. While some investors are likely focusing on the large loss, which is very unusual for Boeing, we think the 777X delay is the main reason the stock is lower today. With the 737 MAX issues and now 777X, it sort of seems like BA is playing whack-a-mole as it works through these issues.</p><p>The weakness was further exacerbated on the call this morning as the company said it expected the MAX issues will hurt cash flow for several years with it being more front-end loaded in the first few years.</p><p>We continue to like the long-term potential for Boeing. Specifically, BA thinks the worldwide fleet will double over the longer term as more countries with emerging economies boost air travel. Also, there is a large replacement cycle expected in the next few years. However, we think there will be a cloud over this stock until we get more clarity on when the 737 MAX will return to the air.</p><p>13:34 ET</p><p>Chipotle rolls higher on strong EPS upside; new CEO seems to be making progress:</p><p>ChipotleMexican Grill (CMG) is trading higher today following a strong Q2 report last night. Non-GAAP EPS Jumped 39% yr/yr to $3.99 while revenue rose 13.2% yr/yr to $1.43 bln. Both results were better than expected with EPS coming in well ahead of expectations.</p><p>The metric that really stands out to us is the same-store comps coming in a robust +10%, with +7% coming from a higher number of transactions and +3.5% from higher average check (mostly menu price increases). What's notable is that the Q2 comps have accelerated in recent quarters. In Q1, comps were +9.9%, and were at +6.1% in Q4 and +1.0% in Q3.</p><p>Chipotle has made a remarkable turnaround and these results are the product of a number of new initiatives being implemented by the company. CMG hired a new CEO in March 2018. Brian Niccol was tasked with turning around the struggling burrito chain.</p><p>Prior to joining Chipotle, Brian Niccol was at Taco Bell from 2011 and served as CEO from January 2015. He successfully repositioned Taco Bell as a lifestyle brand and successfully launched numerous product initiatives, including the new breakfast daypart which is the fastest growing daypart in the industry. He also transformed Taco Bell into a social media leader and revolutionized its digital approach. According to Eater,com, he was \"largely credited with helping turning the brand into a #brand, using social platforms like Snapchat and Twitter to lure a more youthful demographic into late-night drive-thru runs for Doritos Locos tacos and fried chicken shell tacos.\"</p><p>The company has been busy revamping its marketing message (focusing more on real ingredients), building out its digital capabilities, launching its delivery service (now available at 95% of locations), and launching a new loyalty program, which is exceeding internal expectations, according to the company on the call last night.</p><p>There also are some menu additions on the way. On the call, CEO Niccol said that carne asada is the new addition that is furthest along. It \"is nearing validation through our stage-gate process, after which we will decide on the timing of a potential national launch.\" Niccol also said CMG has a quesadilla pilot going on as well and it's getting high marks from customers. Desserts and nachos are also in the works. Also, catering is a tiny part of its business, but CMG sees tremendous opportunity for that sales channel.</p><p>In sum, CMG is ramping higher today. The strong EPS upside accounts for part of it, but it seems the excitement about changes ahead are just as responsible for the big move today. Upcoming menu changes, catering, delivery etc. are whetting investors' appetites. We have to tip our cap to the new CEO as he seems to be doing a good job in turning Chipotle around.</p><p>12:26 ET</p><p>Visa's growth accelerates on stronger consumer spending, ongoing shift towards digital payments: Visa (V) posted solid Q3 results after the close last night. The company reported EPS of $1.37 vs. the $1.32 consensus, extending its winning streak vs. analysts' expectations to fifteen straight quarters.</p><p>Growth accelerated during the quarter with revenue increasing by 13% on a constant currency basis to $5.84 bln, edging the $5.7 bln expectation. That represents an up-tick from last quarter's 9.5% top-line growth.</p><p>The better-than-expected Q3 results, combined with the integration of a few acquisitions and the continuing trend towards electronic payments, provided the confidence for Visa to slightly raise its outlook for FY19.</p><p>Visa now expects to generate EPS growth in the \"mid-to-high teens\" compared to its prior guidance of \"high end of mid-teens\".</p><p>Click here to access Visa's earnings press release.</p><p>All of Visa's key demand-related operating metrics showed improvement. Payment volume was up 9% on a constant currency basis vs. 8% in Q2. Cross-border volume was higher by 7% compared to 4% last quarter. Processed transactions grew by 12%, up from 11% in Q2, driven primarily by stronger growth in the U.S. and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina.</p><p>There were a few main catalysts underlying Visa's performance.</p><p>First, consumer credit is expanding. Specifically, April U.S. consumer credit increased by $17.5 bln, followed by a $17.1 bln increase in May. This indicates that consumers are willing to spend and borrow money and they are confident in their ability to repay debt. Therefore, the growth in consumer credit is both a positive factor for Visa and the economy.</p><p>Second, Visa also benefited from lower-than-expected client incentives as well as a more favorable timing of Easter, relative to last year, which does temper some enthusiasm regarding its results.</p><p>Last, Visa has been very aggressive on the acquisition front.</p><p>On June 25, Visa acquired the token services and ticketing business from Rambus. This ties in with Visa's strategy to become a leader in blockchain technologies which would support cryptocurrencies like Facebook's (FB) Libra. In fact, Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Foundation that is working to launch that currency.</p><p>A few days following that acquisition, Visa purchased Verify, the owner of a dispute resolution platform that will bolster Visa's risk and fraud management solutions.</p><p>Key Takeaways: Visa's strong results are driven by a potent secular trend towards digitization of commerce and a healthy consumer. The pick-up in growth -- albeit modest -- provides confidence that the global economy hasn't significantly deteriorated.</p><p>From a company-specific standpoint, Visa's strategy revolves around acquisitions that enhance and diversify its payment processing capabilities.</p><p>11:11 ET</p><p>UPS moves higher as next-day delivery demand aligns with strategic investments:</p><p>Shares of UPS (UPS +9%) are taking off after the company reported better than expected second quarter results this morning.</p><p>Earnings grew 1% on a 3% increase in revenue. The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month. FedEx continues to struggle with European exposure brought about by the TNT Express acquisition.</p><p>UPS stock is attempting to break out from its slight downtrend as it approaches resistance from its April highs.</p><p>07:01 ET</p><p>Big tech stocks fall after DOJ announces broad antitrust review:</p><p>Big technology stocks are trading lower premarket after the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>We already knew that regulators were swarming big technology companies, but this news confirms that the Federal government is serious about potentially reigning in the power of the technology behemoths.</p><p>This is separate from the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets that was announced in early June. Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce. They are the three bigest advertisers on the internet. Apple seems to be the least at risk, although iOS and the app store give it tremendous power over the technology sector. Ironically, the largest U.S. tech company, Microsoft (MSFT), does not seem to be at risk.</p><p>The four primary targets of regulators account for just over 33% of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and nearly 12% of the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). Clearly, these four stocks have considerable influence over the US stock market.</p><p>Politicians have been calling for regulations on Silicon Valley for some time, but we are now finally seeing the wheels set into motion to potentially curb the influence of the most powerful companies in the Western world.</p><p>A regulatory overhang will likely be in place for a while as investigations will take time to play out.</p><p>Facebook will report second quarter results this afternoon; Alphabet and Amazon will report Thursday afternoon and Apple reports on the afternoon of July 30.</p><p>Tech giants premarket: FB -1.2% GOOG/L -1.1% AMZN -0.8% AAPL -0.5%.</p><p>Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.3%.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348672812</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HMD1-JC8H-K19D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2167\"/><timeReceived>4:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The company reported EPS of $1.37 vs. the $1.32 consensus, extending its winning streak vs. analysts' expectations to fifteen straight quarters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Growth accelerated during the quarter with revenue increasing by 13% on a constant currency basis to $5.84 bln, edging the $5.7 bln expectation. That represents an up-tick from last quarter's 9.5% top-line growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The better-than-expected Q3 results, combined with the integration of a few acquisitions and the continuing trend towards electronic payments, provided the confidence for Visa to slightly raise its outlook for FY19.</p><p>Visa now expects to generate EPS growth in the \"mid-to-high teens\" compared to its prior guidance of \"high end of mid-teens\".</p><p>Click here to access Visa's earnings press release.</p><p>All of Visa's key demand-related operating metrics showed improvement. Payment volume was up 9% on a constant currency basis vs. 8% in Q2. Cross-border volume was higher by 7% compared to 4% last quarter. Processed transactions grew by 12%, up from 11% in Q2, driven primarily by stronger growth in the U.S. and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina.</p><p>There were a few main catalysts underlying Visa's performance.</p><p>First, consumer credit is expanding. Specifically, April U.S. consumer credit increased by $17.5 bln, followed by a $17.1 bln increase in May. This indicates that consumers are willing to spend and borrow money and they are confident in their ability to repay debt. Therefore, the growth in consumer credit is both a positive factor for Visa and the economy.</p><p>Second, Visa also benefited from lower-than-expected client incentives as well as a more favorable timing of Easter, relative to last year, which does temper some enthusiasm regarding its results.</p><p>Last, Visa has been very aggressive on the acquisition front.</p><p>On June 25, Visa acquired the token services and ticketing business from Rambus. This ties in with Visa's strategy to become a leader in blockchain technologies which would support cryptocurrencies like Facebook's (FB) Libra. In fact, Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Foundation that is working to launch that currency.</p><p>A few days following that acquisition, Visa purchased Verify, the owner of a dispute resolution platform that will bolster Visa's risk and fraud management solutions.</p><p>Key Takeaways: Visa's strong results are driven by a potent secular trend towards digitization of commerce and a healthy consumer. The pick-up in growth -- albeit modest -- provides confidence that the global economy hasn't significantly deteriorated.</p><p>From a company-specific standpoint, Visa's strategy revolves around acquisitions that enhance and diversify its payment processing capabilities.</p><p>11:11 ET</p><p>UPS moves higher as next-day delivery demand aligns with strategic investments:</p><p>Shares of UPS (UPS +9%) are taking off after the company reported better than expected second quarter results this morning.</p><p>Earnings grew 1% on a 3% increase in revenue. The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month.

The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month. FedEx continues to struggle with European exposure brought about by the TNT Express acquisition.</p><p>UPS stock is attempting to break out from its slight downtrend as it approaches resistance from its April highs.</p><p>07:01 ET</p><p>Big tech stocks fall after DOJ announces broad antitrust review:</p><p>Big technology stocks are trading lower premarket after the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>We already knew that regulators were swarming big technology companies, but this news confirms that the Federal government is serious about potentially reigning in the power of the technology behemoths.</p><p>This is separate from the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets that was announced in early June. Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce. They are the three bigest advertisers on the internet. Apple seems to be the least at risk, although iOS and the app store give it tremendous power over the technology sector. Ironically, the largest U.S. tech company, Microsoft (MSFT), does not seem to be at risk.</p><p>The four primary targets of regulators account for just over 33% of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and nearly 12% of the S&amp;P 500 (SPY).

Non-GAAP EPS Jumped 39% yr/yr to $3.99 while revenue rose 13.2% yr/yr to $1.43 bln. Both results were better than expected with EPS coming in well ahead of expectations.</p><p>The metric that really stands out to us is the same-store comps coming in a robust +10%, with +7% coming from a higher number of transactions and +3.5% from higher average check (mostly menu price increases). What's notable is that the Q2 comps have accelerated in recent quarters. In Q1, comps were +9.9%, and were at +6.1% in Q4 and +1.0% in Q3.</p><p>Chipotle has made a remarkable turnaround and these results are the product of a number of new initiatives being implemented by the company. CMG hired a new CEO in March 2018. Brian Niccol was tasked with turning around the struggling burrito chain.</p><p>Prior to joining Chipotle, Brian Niccol was at Taco Bell from 2011 and served as CEO from January 2015. He successfully repositioned Taco Bell as a lifestyle brand and successfully launched numerous product initiatives, including the new breakfast daypart which is the fastest growing daypart in the industry. He also transformed Taco Bell into a social media leader and revolutionized its digital approach. According to Eater,com, he was \"largely credited with helping turning the brand into a #brand, using social platforms like Snapchat and Twitter to lure a more youthful demographic into late-night drive-thru runs for Doritos Locos tacos and fried chicken shell tacos.\"</p><p>The company has been busy revamping its marketing message (focusing more on real ingredients), building out its digital capabilities, launching its delivery service (now available at 95% of locations), and launching a new loyalty program, which is exceeding internal expectations, according to the company on the call last night.</p><p>There also are some menu additions on the way. On the call, CEO Niccol said that carne asada is the new addition that is furthest along. It \"is nearing validation through our stage-gate process, after which we will decide on the timing of a potential national launch.\" Niccol also said CMG has a quesadilla pilot going on as well and it's getting high marks from customers. Desserts and nachos are also in the works. Also, catering is a tiny part of its business, but CMG sees tremendous opportunity for that sales channel.</p><p>In sum, CMG is ramping higher today. The strong EPS upside accounts for part of it, but it seems the excitement about changes ahead are just as responsible for the big move today. Upcoming menu changes, catering, delivery etc. are whetting investors' appetites. We have to tip our cap to the new CEO as he seems to be doing a good job in turning Chipotle around.</p><p>12:26 ET</p><p>Visa's growth accelerates on stronger consumer spending, ongoing shift towards digital payments: Visa (V) posted solid Q3 results after the close last night. The company reported EPS of $1.37 vs. the $1.32 consensus, extending its winning streak vs. analysts' expectations to fifteen straight quarters.</p><p>Growth accelerated during the quarter with revenue increasing by 13% on a constant currency basis to $5.84 bln, edging the $5.7 bln expectation. That represents an up-tick from last quarter's 9.5% top-line growth.</p><p>The better-than-expected Q3 results, combined with the integration of a few acquisitions and the continuing trend towards electronic payments, provided the confidence for Visa to slightly raise its outlook for FY19.</p><p>Visa now expects to generate EPS growth in the \"mid-to-high teens\" compared to its prior guidance of \"high end of mid-teens\".</p><p>Click here to access Visa's earnings press release.</p><p>All of Visa's key demand-related operating metrics showed improvement. Payment volume was up 9% on a constant currency basis vs. 8% in Q2. Cross-border volume was higher by 7% compared to 4% last quarter. Processed transactions grew by 12%, up from 11% in Q2, driven primarily by stronger growth in the U.S. and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina.</p><p>There were a few main catalysts underlying Visa's performance.</p><p>First, consumer credit is expanding. Specifically, April U.S. consumer credit increased by $17.5 bln, followed by a $17.1 bln increase in May. This indicates that consumers are willing to spend and borrow money and they are confident in their ability to repay debt. Therefore, the growth in consumer credit is both a positive factor for Visa and the economy.</p><p>Second, Visa also benefited from lower-than-expected client incentives as well as a more favorable timing of Easter, relative to last year, which does temper some enthusiasm regarding its results.</p><p>Last, Visa has been very aggressive on the acquisition front.</p><p>On June 25, Visa acquired the token services and ticketing business from Rambus. This ties in with Visa's strategy to become a leader in blockchain technologies which would support cryptocurrencies like Facebook's (FB) Libra. In fact, Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Foundation that is working to launch that currency.</p><p>A few days following that acquisition, Visa purchased Verify, the owner of a dispute resolution platform that will bolster Visa's risk and fraud management solutions.</p><p>Key Takeaways: Visa's strong results are driven by a potent secular trend towards digitization of commerce and a healthy consumer. The pick-up in growth -- albeit modest -- provides confidence that the global economy hasn't significantly deteriorated.</p><p>From a company-specific standpoint, Visa's strategy revolves around acquisitions that enhance and diversify its payment processing capabilities.</p><p>11:11 ET</p><p>UPS moves higher as next-day delivery demand aligns with strategic investments:</p><p>Shares of UPS (UPS +9%) are taking off after the company reported better than expected second quarter results this morning.</p><p>Earnings grew 1% on a 3% increase in revenue. The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month. FedEx continues to struggle with European exposure brought about by the TNT Express acquisition.</p><p>UPS stock is attempting to break out from its slight downtrend as it approaches resistance from its April highs.</p><p>07:01 ET</p><p>Big tech stocks fall after DOJ announces broad antitrust review:</p><p>Big technology stocks are trading lower premarket after the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>We already knew that regulators were swarming big technology companies, but this news confirms that the Federal government is serious about potentially reigning in the power of the technology behemoths.</p><p>This is separate from the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets that was announced in early June. Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce. They are the three bigest advertisers on the internet. Apple seems to be the least at risk, although iOS and the app store give it tremendous power over the technology sector.

Non-GAAP EPS Jumped 39% yr/yr to $3.99 while revenue rose 13.2% yr/yr to $1.43 bln. Both results were better than expected with EPS coming in well ahead of expectations.</p><p>The metric that really stands out to us is the same-store comps coming in a robust +10%, with +7% coming from a higher number of transactions and +3.5% from higher average check (mostly menu price increases). What's notable is that the Q2 comps have accelerated in recent quarters. In Q1, comps were +9.9%, and were at +6.1% in Q4 and +1.0% in Q3.</p><p>Chipotle has made a remarkable turnaround and these results are the product of a number of new initiatives being implemented by the company. CMG hired a new CEO in March 2018. Brian Niccol was tasked with turning around the struggling burrito chain.</p><p>Prior to joining Chipotle, Brian Niccol was at Taco Bell from 2011 and served as CEO from January 2015. He successfully repositioned Taco Bell as a lifestyle brand and successfully launched numerous product initiatives, including the new breakfast daypart which is the fastest growing daypart in the industry. He also transformed Taco Bell into a social media leader and revolutionized its digital approach. According to Eater,com, he was \"largely credited with helping turning the brand into a #brand, using social platforms like Snapchat and Twitter to lure a more youthful demographic into late-night drive-thru runs for Doritos Locos tacos and fried chicken shell tacos.\"</p><p>The company has been busy revamping its marketing message (focusing more on real ingredients), building out its digital capabilities, launching its delivery service (now available at 95% of locations), and launching a new loyalty program, which is exceeding internal expectations, according to the company on the call last night.</p><p>There also are some menu additions on the way. On the call, CEO Niccol said that carne asada is the new addition that is furthest along. It \"is nearing validation through our stage-gate process, after which we will decide on the timing of a potential national launch.\" Niccol also said CMG has a quesadilla pilot going on as well and it's getting high marks from customers. Desserts and nachos are also in the works. Also, catering is a tiny part of its business, but CMG sees tremendous opportunity for that sales channel.</p><p>In sum, CMG is ramping higher today. The strong EPS upside accounts for part of it, but it seems the excitement about changes ahead are just as responsible for the big move today. Upcoming menu changes, catering, delivery etc. are whetting investors' appetites. We have to tip our cap to the new CEO as he seems to be doing a good job in turning Chipotle around.</p><p>12:26 ET</p><p>Visa's growth accelerates on stronger consumer spending, ongoing shift towards digital payments: Visa (V) posted solid Q3 results after the close last night. The company reported EPS of $1.37 vs. the $1.32 consensus, extending its winning streak vs. analysts' expectations to fifteen straight quarters.</p><p>Growth accelerated during the quarter with revenue increasing by 13% on a constant currency basis to $5.84 bln, edging the $5.7 bln expectation. That represents an up-tick from last quarter's 9.5% top-line growth.</p><p>The better-than-expected Q3 results, combined with the integration of a few acquisitions and the continuing trend towards electronic payments, provided the confidence for Visa to slightly raise its outlook for FY19.</p><p>Visa now expects to generate EPS growth in the \"mid-to-high teens\" compared to its prior guidance of \"high end of mid-teens\".</p><p>Click here to access Visa's earnings press release.</p><p>All of Visa's key demand-related operating metrics showed improvement. Payment volume was up 9% on a constant currency basis vs. 8% in Q2. Cross-border volume was higher by 7% compared to 4% last quarter. Processed transactions grew by 12%, up from 11% in Q2, driven primarily by stronger growth in the U.S. and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina.</p><p>There were a few main catalysts underlying Visa's performance.</p><p>First, consumer credit is expanding. Specifically, April U.S. consumer credit increased by $17.5 bln, followed by a $17.1 bln increase in May. This indicates that consumers are willing to spend and borrow money and they are confident in their ability to repay debt. Therefore, the growth in consumer credit is both a positive factor for Visa and the economy.</p><p>Second, Visa also benefited from lower-than-expected client incentives as well as a more favorable timing of Easter, relative to last year, which does temper some enthusiasm regarding its results.</p><p>Last, Visa has been very aggressive on the acquisition front.</p><p>On June 25, Visa acquired the token services and ticketing business from Rambus. This ties in with Visa's strategy to become a leader in blockchain technologies which would support cryptocurrencies like Facebook's (FB) Libra. In fact, Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Foundation that is working to launch that currency.</p><p>A few days following that acquisition, Visa purchased Verify, the owner of a dispute resolution platform that will bolster Visa's risk and fraud management solutions.</p><p>Key Takeaways: Visa's strong results are driven by a potent secular trend towards digitization of commerce and a healthy consumer. The pick-up in growth -- albeit modest -- provides confidence that the global economy hasn't significantly deteriorated.</p><p>From a company-specific standpoint, Visa's strategy revolves around acquisitions that enhance and diversify its payment processing capabilities.</p><p>11:11 ET</p><p>UPS moves higher as next-day delivery demand aligns with strategic investments:</p><p>Shares of UPS (UPS +9%) are taking off after the company reported better than expected second quarter results this morning.</p><p>Earnings grew 1% on a 3% increase in revenue. The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month. FedEx continues to struggle with European exposure brought about by the TNT Express acquisition.</p><p>UPS stock is attempting to break out from its slight downtrend as it approaches resistance from its April highs.</p><p>07:01 ET</p><p>Big tech stocks fall after DOJ announces broad antitrust review:</p><p>Big technology stocks are trading lower premarket after the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>We already knew that regulators were swarming big technology companies, but this news confirms that the Federal government is serious about potentially reigning in the power of the technology behemoths.</p><p>This is separate from the House Judiciary Committee bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets that was announced in early June. Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce.

It reported a large miss and announced a delay with its 777X program.</p><p>The top-line numbers were actually pretty good relative to consensus as BA reported a core (non-GAAP) loss of $(5.82) per share while revenue fell 35.1% yr/yr to $15.75 bln. Both metrics saw big declines yr/yr but came in well ahead of consensus estimates. Boeing's well known 737 MAX issues and delays caused the large loss and revenue decline this quarter.</p><p>Investors who have followed Boeing over the long term know that its annual guidance is very important to monitor. However, BA suspended its full year guidance last quarter due to the MAX issues and that is still the case now. It sounds like it may be a while before we get annual guidance again.</p><p>So why is the stock down? We do not think it's the headline numbers as most investors expected big losses from the MAX. The culprit seems to a delay in its 777X program. Boeing is delaying first flight until early 2020 vs earlier guidance of late 2019. It's still progressing well through pre-flight testing and BA is still targeting late 2020 for first delivery of the 777X. However, BA now says there is significant risk to this schedule given engine challenges at its GE supplier.</p><p>The 737 MAX gets most of the attention, but investors have also been eagerly awaiting the 777X, which will be the world's largest and most efficient twin-engine jet. Other planes are larger, but they require four engines. The 777X needs just two engines despite its larger size and its spacious, widebody cabin.</p><p>In sum, the stock is down on the Q2 report. While some investors are likely focusing on the large loss, which is very unusual for Boeing, we think the 777X delay is the main reason the stock is lower today. With the 737 MAX issues and now 777X, it sort of seems like BA is playing whack-a-mole as it works through these issues.</p><p>The weakness was further exacerbated on the call this morning as the company said it expected the MAX issues will hurt cash flow for several years with it being more front-end loaded in the first few years.</p><p>We continue to like the long-term potential for Boeing. Specifically, BA thinks the worldwide fleet will double over the longer term as more countries with emerging economies boost air travel. Also, there is a large replacement cycle expected in the next few years. However, we think there will be a cloud over this stock until we get more clarity on when the 737 MAX will return to the air.</p><p>13:34 ET</p><p>Chipotle rolls higher on strong EPS upside; new CEO seems to be making progress:</p><p>ChipotleMexican Grill (CMG) is trading higher today following a strong Q2 report last night. Non-GAAP EPS Jumped 39% yr/yr to $3.99 while revenue rose 13.2% yr/yr to $1.43 bln. Both results were better than expected with EPS coming in well ahead of expectations.</p><p>The metric that really stands out to us is the same-store comps coming in a robust +10%, with +7% coming from a higher number of transactions and +3.5% from higher average check (mostly menu price increases). What's notable is that the Q2 comps have accelerated in recent quarters. In Q1, comps were +9.9%, and were at +6.1% in Q4 and +1.0% in Q3.</p><p>Chipotle has made a remarkable turnaround and these results are the product of a number of new initiatives being implemented by the company. CMG hired a new CEO in March 2018. Brian Niccol was tasked with turning around the struggling burrito chain.</p><p>Prior to joining Chipotle, Brian Niccol was at Taco Bell from 2011 and served as CEO from January 2015. He successfully repositioned Taco Bell as a lifestyle brand and successfully launched numerous product initiatives, including the new breakfast daypart which is the fastest growing daypart in the industry. He also transformed Taco Bell into a social media leader and revolutionized its digital approach. According to Eater,com, he was \"largely credited with helping turning the brand into a #brand, using social platforms like Snapchat and Twitter to lure a more youthful demographic into late-night drive-thru runs for Doritos Locos tacos and fried chicken shell tacos.\"</p><p>The company has been busy revamping its marketing message (focusing more on real ingredients), building out its digital capabilities, launching its delivery service (now available at 95% of locations), and launching a new loyalty program, which is exceeding internal expectations, according to the company on the call last night.</p><p>There also are some menu additions on the way. On the call, CEO Niccol said that carne asada is the new addition that is furthest along. It \"is nearing validation through our stage-gate process, after which we will decide on the timing of a potential national launch.\" Niccol also said CMG has a quesadilla pilot going on as well and it's getting high marks from customers. Desserts and nachos are also in the works. Also, catering is a tiny part of its business, but CMG sees tremendous opportunity for that sales channel.</p><p>In sum, CMG is ramping higher today. The strong EPS upside accounts for part of it, but it seems the excitement about changes ahead are just as responsible for the big move today. Upcoming menu changes, catering, delivery etc. are whetting investors' appetites. We have to tip our cap to the new CEO as he seems to be doing a good job in turning Chipotle around.</p><p>12:26 ET</p><p>Visa's growth accelerates on stronger consumer spending, ongoing shift towards digital payments: Visa (V) posted solid Q3 results after the close last night. The company reported EPS of $1.37 vs. the $1.32 consensus, extending its winning streak vs. analysts' expectations to fifteen straight quarters.</p><p>Growth accelerated during the quarter with revenue increasing by 13% on a constant currency basis to $5.84 bln, edging the $5.7 bln expectation. That represents an up-tick from last quarter's 9.5% top-line growth.</p><p>The better-than-expected Q3 results, combined with the integration of a few acquisitions and the continuing trend towards electronic payments, provided the confidence for Visa to slightly raise its outlook for FY19.</p><p>Visa now expects to generate EPS growth in the \"mid-to-high teens\" compared to its prior guidance of \"high end of mid-teens\".</p><p>Click here to access Visa's earnings press release.</p><p>All of Visa's key demand-related operating metrics showed improvement. Payment volume was up 9% on a constant currency basis vs. 8% in Q2. Cross-border volume was higher by 7% compared to 4% last quarter. Processed transactions grew by 12%, up from 11% in Q2, driven primarily by stronger growth in the U.S. and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina.</p><p>There were a few main catalysts underlying Visa's performance.</p><p>First, consumer credit is expanding. Specifically, April U.S. consumer credit increased by $17.5 bln, followed by a $17.1 bln increase in May. This indicates that consumers are willing to spend and borrow money and they are confident in their ability to repay debt. Therefore, the growth in consumer credit is both a positive factor for Visa and the economy.</p><p>Second, Visa also benefited from lower-than-expected client incentives as well as a more favorable timing of Easter, relative to last year, which does temper some enthusiasm regarding its results.</p><p>Last, Visa has been very aggressive on the acquisition front.</p><p>On June 25, Visa acquired the token services and ticketing business from Rambus. This ties in with Visa's strategy to become a leader in blockchain technologies which would support cryptocurrencies like Facebook's (FB) Libra. In fact, Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Foundation that is working to launch that currency.</p><p>A few days following that acquisition, Visa purchased Verify, the owner of a dispute resolution platform that will bolster Visa's risk and fraud management solutions.</p><p>Key Takeaways: Visa's strong results are driven by a potent secular trend towards digitization of commerce and a healthy consumer. The pick-up in growth -- albeit modest -- provides confidence that the global economy hasn't significantly deteriorated.</p><p>From a company-specific standpoint, Visa's strategy revolves around acquisitions that enhance and diversify its payment processing capabilities.</p><p>11:11 ET</p><p>UPS moves higher as next-day delivery demand aligns with strategic investments:</p><p>Shares of UPS (UPS +9%) are taking off after the company reported better than expected second quarter results this morning.</p><p>Earnings grew 1% on a 3% increase in revenue. The company says that it turned rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the US while leveraging asset-light and proven cost management strategies in its International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. Total operating profit grew 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments; adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.</p><p>The US Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume, which was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. Demand for next day service in the US is surging, and UPS made timely strategic investments in that capacity.</p><p>The nation's largest courier also saw an inflection point in operating leverage in the US as its strategic investments started to pay off. UPS expects US operating margin improvement to continue.</p><p>UPS also announced an extensive roll-out of new customer services and capabilities, including the introduction of new Sunday service starting in 2020. The new solutions are designed to capture growth opportunities in certain strategic markets: small- and medium-sized businesses, e-commerce, high-growth international countries, and healthcare and life sciences.</p><p>Analysts were skeptical of UPS's fiscal 2019 earnings guidance, but today's encouraging results may appear to ease those concerns.</p><p>These results compare favorably to FedEx's (FDX) more cautious outlook from last month.

Last month, we learned that the DOJ has taken authority regarding potential antitrust issues at Alphabet (GOOG/L) and Apple (AAPL) while the FTC will oversee Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).</p><p>Yesterday's news confirms that the DOJ will take a holistic review of potential antitrust matters.</p><p>The DOJ has yet to confirm that is already investigating anti-competitive practices at Alphabet specifically. The US government closed an investigation into the company without taking action in 2013, but the company's market position has continued to strengthen since then.</p><p>Google dominates search, Facebookdominates social media and Amazon dominates eCommerce. They are the three bigest advertisers on the internet. Apple seems to be the least at risk, although iOS and the app store give it tremendous power over the technology sector.

(CTAS, +8.5%) is trading nicely higher today after following the company's Q4 (May) earnings report last night. The report provided a first look at the company's FY20 guidance, which turned out to be strong as well. The stock has been a huge mover, so Cintas really needed to come in with strong results, and it seems to have done just that.</p><p>Cintas is the largest supplier of work uniforms in the US, operating primarily on a rental basis and supplying clients ranging from food service industry workers, with customers including McDonald's and Starbucks, to mechanics and workers on oil and gas rigs, who require more durable uniforms. The company offers more than just uniforms, though, as it has smartly branched into adjacent areas, including floor care, restroom supplies, first aid, and fire extinguishers.</p><p>Non-GAAP EPS rose 17% yr/yr to $2.07 while revenue rose 7.4% yr/yr to $1.79 bln. EPS was well above market expectations (its largest EPS beat in seven quarters) while revenue had some modest upside to market expectations. In terms of guidance for FY20, Cintas expects EPS of $8.30-8.45 and revenue of $7.24-7.31 bln. The mid-point of the EPS guidance was nicely above expectations while revenue guidance was basically in-line.</p><p>We were a bit nervous heading into this earnings report because the stock had made such a huge run recently, which told us that investor expectations were running pretty high, so anything short of a large beat-and-raise might have led the stock sell-off. Also, we sensed that there was some nervousness among investors, as the stock traded lower yesterday heading into this report.</p><p>These results were good overall, and FY19 did well on a full year basis all things considered. Something to be aware of is that Cintas is still digesting its largest acquisition ever -- it bought its rival G&amp;K Services in 2017 for $2.1 bln. On top of that, Cintas has been transitioning from a decades-old platform to a new ERP platform (SAP) for the entire company, which has required changing processes and retraining employees. It's still a work-in-progress, as about 65% of operations are now on SAP, with remaining locations expected to be onboarded in FY20. Essentially, Cintas is currently undergoing a lot of change.</p><p>As we said in our preview, Cintas' outlook is helpful to know even beyond its implications for the company's stock. The company's business is very closely tied to the health of the economy generally. Cintas CFO Michael Hansen said on the call that that management \"feel[s] pretty good about the macro still.\" He added, \"Job growth has continued to be pretty good... we like the momentum in the business.\"</p><p>In sum, we would rather have seen revenue come in with a stronger beat, but the result is pretty typical for Cintas, as the company is not known for large top line upside. Cintas is known for steady, but not spectacular, EPS and revenue growth, but that's ok with most investors. We were holding our breath as we got out first look at FY20 guidance, and it came in better than expected. Cintas is clearly benefiting from a strong overall economy and the fact that the unemployment rate has been falling. More workers means more uniform rentals.</p><p>11:42 ET</p><p>United Airlines next carrier to post solid results, demonstrating resiliency in tough climate: On the heels of Delta's (DAL) strong Q2 results and American Airlines' (AAL) raised guidance last week, United Airlines (UAL) posted solid quarterly results last night. For the quarter, it generated EPS of $4.21, surpassing the $4.09 consensus, with revenue up 5.8% yr/yr to $11.4 bln.</p><p>Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), also known as unit revenue, is a key metric that measures sales efficiency across its total flight capacity. It came in at +2.5%, the high end of its +0.5-2.5% guidance range.</p><p>UAL's upside EPS result also provided enough confidence for management to raise its FY19 EPS guidance to $10.50-$12.00 from $10-$12.</p><p>Click here to access UAL's earnings press release.</p><p>The set of positive reports from UAL and its peers exhibit an impressive resiliency as they come in the face of potent headwinds. Most notably, these include the grounding of Boeing's (BA) 737 MAX aircraft and the trade disputes/tariffs that have created uncertainty for businesses.</p><p>The encouraging quarterly results from UAL's peers, along with lower crude oil prices, propelled UAL's stock higher into its report last night. The 20% surge higher since early June is one reason why shares have struggled to gain altitude today.</p><p>Another cause for the muted reaction is that UAL guided for Q3 unit revenue (PRASM) growth of +0.5-2.5%. At the mid-point, this represents a decline from Q2's +2.5%. Additionally, the company raised its FY19 unit cost to 0.5-1.0% from flat and lowered its capacity growth to +3-4% from +4-5%.</p><p>Still, UAL is performing quite well in a challenging environment.</p><p>CEO Oscar Munoz credits this to the company's strategic plan to add more flights between its mid-continent hubs (Chicago, Denver, Houston) and smaller cities where it can charge higher fares. The premise is that it would bolster margins and profitability. With UAL posting $1.4 bln in pre-tax earnings - a quarterly record - it appears the strategy is working.</p><p>Last, while the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft has caused disruptions across the industry, UAL's exposure is very light.</p><p>For instance, UAL has 14 of these aircraft (1% of fleet) while Southwest Airlines (LUV) has 34 (6% of fleet). The higher exposure at LUV and other airlines has been a positive for UAL as passengers are forced to change flights and carriers.</p><p>Key Takeaway: The word that comes to mind when describing UAL and other airlines' financial performance is \"resilient.\" Despite global economic uncertainty stemming from trade disputes and tariffs, and the ongoing issues surrounding the 737 MAX aircraft, UAL delivered solid Q2 results.</p><p>UAL believes that its strategy to expand flight coverage into smaller destinations has provided a competitive advantage and a boost to profits. Its lighter exposure to the 737 MAX is another positive factor.</p><p>09:04 ET</p><p>IPO market reopens on soft note as DouYu prices at low end of expectations: After a two week pause, the IPO market is back in business this morning. However, it didn't return in overly emphatic fashion as China-based DouYu (DOYU) priced its 67.39 mln ADS deal at $11.50, the low end of the $11.50-$14.00 range. Given the concerns swirling around trade disputes and tariffs, and the softening economy in China, sentiment for Chinese IPOs hasn't been very bullish.</p><p>For instance, three of the most recent Chinese IPOs -- Jiayin Group (JFIN), So-Young International (SY), and Ruhnn Holding (RUHN) -- are trading 16%, 18%, and 69% below their IPO opening prices.</p><p>Therefore, we wouldn't equate DOYU's weak pricing to any material change in the underlying IPO market.</p><p>Tomorrow morning, we will have a better sense whether conditions shifted during the break with several deals expected to price. Considering that the indices are hovering around all-time high levels, we would expect most of the IPOs to draw healthy demand.</p><p>As for DOYU, it offered 44.9 mln ADS in this deal, raising $516.4 mln in total gross proceeds. The company plans to use the capital to expand its eSports content and content genres, to strengthen technologies and big data analytic capabilities, and to invest in marketing activities.</p><p>The lead underwriters on the deal are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, and CMBI.</p><p>Shares are set to open for trading later this morning on the Nasdaq.</p><p>Overview</p><p>DOYU is the largest game-centric live streaming platform in China operating its platform both on PC and mobile apps.

(CTAS, +8.5%) is trading nicely higher today after following the company's Q4 (May) earnings report last night. The report provided a first look at the company's FY20 guidance, which turned out to be strong as well. The stock has been a huge mover, so Cintas really needed to come in with strong results, and it seems to have done just that.</p><p>Cintas is the largest supplier of work uniforms in the US, operating primarily on a rental basis and supplying clients ranging from food service industry workers, with customers including McDonald's and Starbucks, to mechanics and workers on oil and gas rigs, who require more durable uniforms. The company offers more than just uniforms, though, as it has smartly branched into adjacent areas, including floor care, restroom supplies, first aid, and fire extinguishers.</p><p>Non-GAAP EPS rose 17% yr/yr to $2.07 while revenue rose 7.4% yr/yr to $1.79 bln. EPS was well above market expectations (its largest EPS beat in seven quarters) while revenue had some modest upside to market expectations. In terms of guidance for FY20, Cintas expects EPS of $8.30-8.45 and revenue of $7.24-7.31 bln. The mid-point of the EPS guidance was nicely above expectations while revenue guidance was basically in-line.</p><p>We were a bit nervous heading into this earnings report because the stock had made such a huge run recently, which told us that investor expectations were running pretty high, so anything short of a large beat-and-raise might have led the stock sell-off. Also, we sensed that there was some nervousness among investors, as the stock traded lower yesterday heading into this report.</p><p>These results were good overall, and FY19 did well on a full year basis all things considered. Something to be aware of is that Cintas is still digesting its largest acquisition ever -- it bought its rival G&amp;K Services in 2017 for $2.1 bln. On top of that, Cintas has been transitioning from a decades-old platform to a new ERP platform (SAP) for the entire company, which has required changing processes and retraining employees. It's still a work-in-progress, as about 65% of operations are now on SAP, with remaining locations expected to be onboarded in FY20. Essentially, Cintas is currently undergoing a lot of change.</p><p>As we said in our preview, Cintas' outlook is helpful to know even beyond its implications for the company's stock. The company's business is very closely tied to the health of the economy generally. Cintas CFO Michael Hansen said on the call that that management \"feel[s] pretty good about the macro still.\" He added, \"Job growth has continued to be pretty good... we like the momentum in the business.\"</p><p>In sum, we would rather have seen revenue come in with a stronger beat, but the result is pretty typical for Cintas, as the company is not known for large top line upside. Cintas is known for steady, but not spectacular, EPS and revenue growth, but that's ok with most investors. We were holding our breath as we got out first look at FY20 guidance, and it came in better than expected. Cintas is clearly benefiting from a strong overall economy and the fact that the unemployment rate has been falling. More workers means more uniform rentals.</p><p>11:42 ET</p><p>United Airlines next carrier to post solid results, demonstrating resiliency in tough climate: On the heels of Delta's (DAL) strong Q2 results and American Airlines' (AAL) raised guidance last week, United Airlines (UAL) posted solid quarterly results last night. For the quarter, it generated EPS of $4.21, surpassing the $4.09 consensus, with revenue up 5.8% yr/yr to $11.4 bln.</p><p>Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), also known as unit revenue, is a key metric that measures sales efficiency across its total flight capacity. It came in at +2.5%, the high end of its +0.5-2.5% guidance range.</p><p>UAL's upside EPS result also provided enough confidence for management to raise its FY19 EPS guidance to $10.50-$12.00 from $10-$12.</p><p>Click here to access UAL's earnings press release.</p><p>The set of positive reports from UAL and its peers exhibit an impressive resiliency as they come in the face of potent headwinds. Most notably, these include the grounding of Boeing's (BA) 737 MAX aircraft and the trade disputes/tariffs that have created uncertainty for businesses.</p><p>The encouraging quarterly results from UAL's peers, along with lower crude oil prices, propelled UAL's stock higher into its report last night. The 20% surge higher since early June is one reason why shares have struggled to gain altitude today.</p><p>Another cause for the muted reaction is that UAL guided for Q3 unit revenue (PRASM) growth of +0.5-2.5%. At the mid-point, this represents a decline from Q2's +2.5%. Additionally, the company raised its FY19 unit cost to 0.5-1.0% from flat and lowered its capacity growth to +3-4% from +4-5%.</p><p>Still, UAL is performing quite well in a challenging environment.</p><p>CEO Oscar Munoz credits this to the company's strategic plan to add more flights between its mid-continent hubs (Chicago, Denver, Houston) and smaller cities where it can charge higher fares. The premise is that it would bolster margins and profitability. With UAL posting $1.4 bln in pre-tax earnings - a quarterly record - it appears the strategy is working.</p><p>Last, while the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft has caused disruptions across the industry, UAL's exposure is very light.</p><p>For instance, UAL has 14 of these aircraft (1% of fleet) while Southwest Airlines (LUV) has 34 (6% of fleet). The higher exposure at LUV and other airlines has been a positive for UAL as passengers are forced to change flights and carriers.</p><p>Key Takeaway: The word that comes to mind when describing UAL and other airlines' financial performance is \"resilient.\" Despite global economic uncertainty stemming from trade disputes and tariffs, and the ongoing issues surrounding the 737 MAX aircraft, UAL delivered solid Q2 results.</p><p>UAL believes that its strategy to expand flight coverage into smaller destinations has provided a competitive advantage and a boost to profits. Its lighter exposure to the 737 MAX is another positive factor.</p><p>09:04 ET</p><p>IPO market reopens on soft note as DouYu prices at low end of expectations: After a two week pause, the IPO market is back in business this morning. However, it didn't return in overly emphatic fashion as China-based DouYu (DOYU) priced its 67.39 mln ADS deal at $11.50, the low end of the $11.50-$14.00 range. Given the concerns swirling around trade disputes and tariffs, and the softening economy in China, sentiment for Chinese IPOs hasn't been very bullish.</p><p>For instance, three of the most recent Chinese IPOs -- Jiayin Group (JFIN), So-Young International (SY), and Ruhnn Holding (RUHN) -- are trading 16%, 18%, and 69% below their IPO opening prices.</p><p>Therefore, we wouldn't equate DOYU's weak pricing to any material change in the underlying IPO market.</p><p>Tomorrow morning, we will have a better sense whether conditions shifted during the break with several deals expected to price.

Specifically, its 6.5 million ADS IPO priced at $7.50, at the low end of the $7.50-$8.50 expected price range. In all, the deal generated about $49 million in total gross proceeds.</p><p>In addition to some lingering angst about the stock market in general, investor sentiment has been rather sour on Chinese IPOs, with the trade wars and slowing economy there working against them. For instance, on October 19, Niu Technologies (NIU) was forced to decrease its deal size while its IPO also priced at the low end of expectations. Before that, Qutoutiao (QTT) also had to cut back on its deal size and its IPO also priced at the low end of expectations. A few other examples of Chinese IPOs generating weak demand in 111, Inc. (YI), and X Financial (XYF).</p><p>Furthermore, from a company specific standpoint, CNF's financial performance is highly correlated to the economic health and growth in China. As we discuss in more detail below, its most recent financial results reflect a macroeconomic slowdown in China and growing uncertainties about conditions going forward.</p><p>As for the IPO, it was led by Roth Capital Markets and Shenwan Hongyuan Securities. The stock is now open for trading on the NYSE, currently lower by about 2%.</p><p>Company Overview</p><p>CNF is a home equity loan service provider in China. In fact, according to industry research reports, it is the second largest home equity loan service provider among non-traditional financial institutions in China in terms of outstanding loan principal. As of the publication of its IPO prospectus, it had established a national network of 75 branches and sub-branches in over 40 cities in China.</p><p>The company facilitates loans by connecting micro-and small-enterprise (MSEs) owners with its funding partners. MSEs refer to both individual business owners and registered micro-and small-enterprises with annual revenue of less than RMB20 million.</p><p>Its primary targets borrower segment is MSE owners who own real properties in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in China. CNF originated home equity loans for 12,983 and 23,705 borrowers in 2016 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of 82.6%. Furthermore, it believes that its target borrowers are underserved by traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions often impose stringent and inflexible loan application requirements designed for large corporations, making it difficult for MSE owners to meet such requirements.</p><p>The loans it facilitates are primarily funded through a trust lending model with its trust company partners. The trust company partners are well-established with sufficient funding sources and have licenses to engage in lending business nationwide. Also, its trust company partners are regulated by CBIRC and all the trust plans are registered with the CBIRC. This structure provides it with stable funding sources. Under the trust lending model, its trust company partners set up trust plans and acquire funding from their investors.</p><p>CNF says it has a rigorous and robust risk management system with a risk mitigation mechanism that is embedded into the design of its loan products, supported by an integrated online and offline process focusing on risks of both borrowers and collateral and further enhanced by effective post-loan management procedures. Additionally, its home equity loan products are typically installment loans which require monthly payments comprising principal and interests repayments. The company monitors borrowers' credit status, which enables it to take actions quickly if it believes there is a risk of default.</p><p>Financials</p><p>In its IPO prospectus, the company provides some preliminary results for 3Q18. The company's loan origination volume decreased from RMB3.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to RMB2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2018, representing a decrease of approximately 27.7%. CNF's outstanding loan principal amount remained relatively stable at RMB17.7 billion as of September 30, 2018.</p><p>Of some concern, its delinquency ratio and NPL ratio increased from 11.5% and 1.8% as of June 30, 2018 to 12.1% and 1.9% as of September 30, 2018, respectively. Consequentially, the performance of certain financial metrics, such as net income, has also been adversely affected by the lower loan origination volume. Its net income decreased by 2.7% to RMB234.9 million (US$35.5 million) in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a growth rate of 22.6% from RMB196.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to RMB241.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018.</p><p>In the prospectus, CNF noted that macroeconomic uncertainties had negatively impacted its results. Consequently, the company has been strategically balancing its business growth and loan quality. In particular, it has proactively strengthened risk assessment on loans for its trust company partners, which had resulted in a more selective loan approval process and lower LTV ratio.</p><p>10:19 ET</p><p>Michael Kors sinks to 52-week low after mixed bag quarter, disappointing comp outlook:</p><p>Luxury fashion brand Michael Kors (KORS 49.55, -7.90, -13.8%) cracked fresh 52-week lows today in reaction to the company's underwhelming third quarter and full year comparable sales expectations.</p><p>In short, management's expectation for full year reported comparable store sales down in the low single digits, primarily driven by an unfavorable currency impact, and guidance for third quarter comparable store sales on a reported basis declining in the low single digits weren't up to snuff. Management's full year guidance is a cut from prior expectations for flat comparable store sales.</p><p>Despite the lowered comp outlook for the year Michael Kors modestly upped its profit guidance as the company is now looking for FY2019 earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $4.95-5.05, up from the prior $4.90-5.00 expectation, owing to the better than expected Q2 operating performance. The total revenue outlook remained unchanged at approximately $5.125 billion on slightly higher guidance for operating margin to of about 18.2% vs 18.0% prior.</p><p>For Q3 then, Michael Kors sees worth than expected total revenue of approximately $1.46 billion, including approximately $165 million of incremental revenue from Jimmy Choo. The company expects Q3 retail revenue for Michael Kors to grow in the low single digits. As mentioned, Michael Kors expects comparable store sales on a reported basis to decline in the low single digits, primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact. Wholesale revenue is expected to decrease in the high single digits, and licensing revenue to decline in the mid-teens. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 20.8%. Michael Kors also outlined worse than expected guidance for Q3 EPS in the range of $1.52-1.57, which includes approximately $0.04 to $0.06 of accretion from Jimmy Choo.</p><p>Swinging back to the current quarter's report then, Michael Kors announced better than expected Q2 EPS of $1.27 on revenue growth of 9.3% to $1.25 billion on adjusted gross margin growth of 80 basis points to 61.0%. Inventory for the Michael Kors brand at September 29, 2018 was $619.7 million, an 11% decrease as compared to the prior year. Management stated that inventory levels were a bit lean in the quarter and anticipates getting into a better inventory position toward the end of Q3.</p><p>Q2 Michael Kors Retail revenue was approximately flat at $643.9 million on comparable store sales which fell 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, comparable store sales decreased 1.3%. Michael Kors Wholesale revenue declined 1.3% to $457.8 million compared to the prior year. Michael Kors Licensing revenue decreased 6.8% to $35.4 million compared to the prior year.</p><p>Results in Europe were weak in the quarter. Specifically in Europe, Michael Kors' sales declined double digits for the quarter in line with the company's plans to decrease inventory and drive higher full-price sell-through. Europe retail comp store sales declined in the mid-single digits, which was better than expected. Wholesale revenues in Europe declined double digits in the quarter. To put itself in a better position on Europe Michael Kors is inching closer to closing its deal to buy Versace, which the company announced on September 25, and is now slated for a Q4 close.</p><p>After opening 14.9% lower shares of KORS sank to down 17.4% at their worst levels, though now modestly pare those losses. Still, the stock made a fresh 52-week low during the session and has extended its YTD decline to about 21.5% with today's move lower. Technically KORS is forming a death cross today, when the shorter term moving average crosses below the longer term, a chart pattern the stock hasn't seen since October of 2016.</p><p>10:03 ET</p><p>Five9 up sharply on Q3 results; a play on market still in early innings of growth:</p><p>Five9 (FIVN) is trading sharply higher today (+13%) after reporting Q3 results last night. Since you're probably not familiar, Five9 is a provider of cloud software for contact centers. FIVN's Virtual Contact Center (VCC) cloud platform enables clients to seamlessly engage with their customers through voice, video, website, mobile, chat, email, click-to-call, callback, social and messaging.</p><p>FIVN sees a big opportunity as cloud penetration of the contact center market in North America is just 10-15% but it's growing rapidly. Companies typically refresh their contact center systems every 8-10 years, which provides an opportunity for cloud providers to replace legacy on-premise systems when these replacement decisions arise.</p><p>Turning to the Q3 results, non-GAAP EPS jumped 350% YoY to $0.18 from just $0.04 a year ago. The $0.18 was well above prior guidance of $0.13-0.14. Revenue rose 30.3% year/year to $65.3 mln, which was slightly below prior guidance of $65.8-66.8 mln. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 19.6%, a big improvement from 10.3% last year. In terms of guidance for Q4, FIVN expects non-GAAP EPS of $0.13-0.14 and revenue of $65.8-66.8 mln. Both are slightly above market expectations.</p><p>That 30% revenue growth was the fastest for FIVN since it went public in 2014. The strong growth is being driven by its Enterprise business, which makes up 76% of LTM revenue. Its Commercial business, which represents the other 24%, saw growth of 10% YoY. Recurring revenue again accounted for 93% of revenue while the other 7% was from Professional Services.</p><p>Moving upstream to bigger, enterprise customers has been a key focus for FIVN. Enterprise customers tend to be larger deals and have healthy renewal rates. Also, it provides a high degree of recurring and thus predictable revenue for FIVN. Enterprise subscription revenue is FIVN's fastest growing and most profitable part of its business. It seems the company is making good progress in terms of building up the enterprise segment.</p><p>In sum, this was another good quarter for FIVN and it sounds like more growth lies ahead. The bigger picture to remember here is that this market is still in the early days of a massive shift to the cloud. What strikes us is that Q3 feels like an acceleration of growth. We have been following FIVN for years, since its IPO. It always struck us as a small but steady grower. And now it feels like it's stepping on the gas, becoming a large player in this burgeoning market.</p><p>It's probably not a coincidence that FIVN seems to be stepping on the gas, just months after it hired a new CEO. Earlier this year, Rowan Trollope took the reins. He was formerly SVP &amp; General Manager of Cisco's (CSCO) Applications Group. The new CEO seems like a good fit, it's always good to see someone come over from a big tech company like Cisco in this case. It shows that he sees good potential here and it seems he has been instrumental in perhaps taking FIVN to the next level.</p><p>08:50 ET</p><p>Delphi Technologies Tracks Lower Start After Mixed Quarter and Cautious Earnings Guidance:</p><p>Delphi Technologies (DLPH 20.00, -1.67) has surrendered 7.7% in pre-market after reporting mixed quarterly results and issuing disappointing guidance. The pre-market weakness has sent the stock to a fresh low for the year, extending its year-to-date decline to 61.8%. Keep in mind that Delphi Technologies was spun off from Delphi Automotive in December 2017. Prior to the spin-off, Delphi Technologies was known as the Powertrain Systems segment of Delphi Automotive.</p><p>The manufacturer of technology solutions for the automotive industry reported below-consensus third quarter earnings of $0.72 per share on a 3.8% year-over-year decline in revenue to $1.16 billion, which was ahead of estimates.</p><p>Going forward, Delphi expects that earnings for the fiscal year will be between $4.20 per share and $4.30 per share, which is below market expectations. However, the midpoint of the company's revenue guidance for sales between $4.85 billion and $4.90 billion is essentially in-line with market expectations. In addition, the company noted it expects that revenue growth during fiscal 2019 will be between 1.0% and 2.0%.</p><p>Delphi Technologies interim CEO Hari Nair said that the while the company faced a challenging environment in China during the third quarter, the company's Power Electronics technology has seen strong revenue growth so far in 2018.</p><p>Delphi's revenue decline was mostly due to currency headwinds. On an adjusted basis, Powertrain Systems revenue fell 2.0% while Delphi Technologies Aftermarket revenue declined 1.0%. Adjusted revenue growth was recorded in all geographies, except for Asia, where sales declined 13.0%. Sales in Europe, North America, and South America increased 5.0%, 3.0%, and 15.0%, respectively.</p><p>Adjusted operating income margin weakened to 9.3% from 12.2% one year ago due to an unfavorable product mix and costs related with becoming a stand-alone public company. Interest expense grew to $20 million in the third quarter from $1 million one year ago due to payments related to $1.55 billion of debt that was added during 2017 due to the company's separation from Delphi Automotive.</p><p>08:02 ET</p><p>Strong quarter and Special dividend offset by soft fourth quarter outlook for Match:</p><p>Match (MTCH) is trading 8% lower premarket after the company reported strong third quarter results but issued downside guidance for the fourth quarter yesterday afternoon.</p><p>Third quarter revenue grew 29% to $444 million vs. $430-440 million guidance. Average Subscribers increased 23% to 8.1 million as average revenue per user grew 6% to $0.57.</p><p>Strong results continue to be driven by Tinder, which added 344K paid subscribers during the quarter. Match had said subscriber additions would be similar to the second quarter, when the company added 299K subs. Tinder paid subs are up 61% year-over-year to 4.11 million.</p><p>As a result, third quarter EBITDA grew 38% to $165 million versus $160-165 million guidance. The company has exceeded EBITDA guidance seven quarters in a row.</p><p>Despite guiding fiscal 2018 results toward the high end of its prior range, guidance for the fourth quarter was just below estimates. The company cited foreign exchange, indirect (advertising) softness due to GDPR (European data privacy regulation) and lower impressions on the top-line. Meanwhile, the company forecasted marketing spend up 20% due to major marketing campaigns at Tinder, Pairs and the recently acquired Hinge, as well as higher litigation expense.</p><p>Match also announced a $2/share special cash dividend, funded by cash on hand. Free Cash Flow increased 94% to $404 million through the first nine months of the year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company will continue to look for compelling acquisition targets in the online dating space.</p><p>Management will host a call at 8:30 this morning. The Tinder subscriber outlook and any commentary on next year will be important.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-330728149</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNS-7YP1-DYRK-934B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2725\"/><timeReceived>10:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Briefing.com, Inc.

It could be argued that TWLO delivered its best quarter as a publicly traded company, as revenue growth also accelerated to its highest levels since its June 2016 IPO. As a result, the stock is soaring higher today, up more than 30% to new all-time highs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Background</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before diving into its quarterly results, we wanted to provide a little background on the company itself. TWLO owns and operates a platform that develops APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable customers' software developers to add voice communications, text messaging, video, and now email, thanks to its October 15 acquisition of SendGrid, into their software applications.</p><p>Its two largest customers are Uber and Whatsapp, accounting for 6% and 4% of total revenue, respectively. When using Uber, for example, TWLO provides the technology within that app that allows you to communicate with the driver. As another example, when you make a dinner reservation using OpenTable, and you receive a text confirmation saying that your table is ready, that is also powered by TWLO.</p><p>3Q18 Review</p><p>Now, circling back to its Q3 results, TWLO posted EPS of $0.07, beating analysts' expectations by $0.05, with revenue surging by 68% to $168.9 million, easily topping the $151.6 million consensus. But, what's perhaps the most impressive is that revenue growth actually improved from last quarter's 54% mark. In fact, revenue growth has been trending higher over the past few quarters, going from 40.5% in 4Q17, to 47.8% in 1Q18, then 54.1% last quarter, and finally 68.0% this quarter. This is extremely rare for a high-growth tech IPO. Typically when a company goes public, it has already -- or is nearing -- the height of its growth curve.</p><p>Driving the strong growth was a 32% jump in Total Active Customer to 61,153. During the quarter, TWLO announced the general availability of its new \"Flex\" product, which is a contact center application platform. It describes the product this way: \"Flex combines the scalability and reliability of our cloud platform with the ability to programmatically customize every element of the contact center experience.\"</p><p>Demand for Flex was solid as it signed a number of deals in the quarter. Most notably, Uber competitor Lyft - which is already a TWLO customer - added Flex to bolster its customer support capabilities. Additionally, TWLO added high growth cloud software Medallia to their customer base.</p><p>The addition of these two new deals, along with other significant wins in the financial services sector, pushed its dollar-base net expansion rate to a robust 145%, up sharply from 122% in the year ago quarter.</p><p>Another positive was that gross margin came in at 55%, which is above its recent performance over the past several quarters. With the surge in topline growth, and the improved gross margin, TWLO generated Non-GAAP operating income of $4.3 million, compared to an operating loss of ($7.7) million in 3Q17.</p><p>That said, during the earnings call last night, management did comment that its focus right now is not to maximize gross margin, but, rather, it is on growing the business. Therefore, investors should expect some volatility around gross margin. For example, starting in 1Q19, Verizon will be creating a new service which will tack on a $0.0025 for each person-to-person text, for each business with Application to Person messaging services. TWLO estimates that this will negatively impact its gross margin by about 100 basis points on a quarterly basis, when it goes into effect in February.</p><p>Outlook &amp; Conclusion</p><p>Turing to its guidance, TWLO is forecasting Q4 EPS of $0.03-$0.04 vs. the $0.02 consensus, on revenue of $183-$185 million versus the $160.6 million consensus. At the mid-point, this would represent year/year growth of 60%, fairly consistent with its Q3 performance. In addition to the aforementioned SendGrid acquisition, and the successful launch of its Flex product, the company is also expecting artificial intelligence to provide another growth catalyst for the company. TWLO recently announced its first machine learning product, \"Understand\", and at this year's SIGNAL conference, it also launched \"AutoPilot\", the next evolution of Understand, with a natural language understanding engine, a conversational application platform and an omni-channel hub.</p><p>To conclude, TWLO is clearly hitting on all cylinders right now, and it has established itself as one of the premier growth names in the technology space. With a 1-year forward P/S of about 11.5x, the stock certainly isn't cheap. But, the stock also deserves a premium valuation due to its superior growth rates and growth potential.</p><p>All in all, there was very little complain about in regards to TWLO's performance and the underlying momentum in the stock suggests more happy days ahead for TWLO investors.</p><p>10:37 ET</p><p>CNF Finance, a China-based Home Equity Loan Provider, Prices IPO at Low End of Expectations: While the stock market has been in recovery mode over the past week, which has consequently improved underlying conditions for IPOs, China-based CNF Finance (CNF) still had a difficult time garnering a lot of demand for its IPO. Specifically, its 6.5 million ADS IPO priced at $7.50, at the low end of the $7.50-$8.50 expected price range. In all, the deal generated about $49 million in total gross proceeds.</p><p>In addition to some lingering angst about the stock market in general, investor sentiment has been rather sour on Chinese IPOs, with the trade wars and slowing economy there working against them. For instance, on October 19, Niu Technologies (NIU) was forced to decrease its deal size while its IPO also priced at the low end of expectations. Before that, Qutoutiao (QTT) also had to cut back on its deal size and its IPO also priced at the low end of expectations. A few other examples of Chinese IPOs generating weak demand in 111, Inc. (YI), and X Financial (XYF).</p><p>Furthermore, from a company specific standpoint, CNF's financial performance is highly correlated to the economic health and growth in China. As we discuss in more detail below, its most recent financial results reflect a macroeconomic slowdown in China and growing uncertainties about conditions going forward.</p><p>As for the IPO, it was led by Roth Capital Markets and Shenwan Hongyuan Securities. The stock is now open for trading on the NYSE, currently lower by about 2%.</p><p>Company Overview</p><p>CNF is a home equity loan service provider in China. In fact, according to industry research reports, it is the second largest home equity loan service provider among non-traditional financial institutions in China in terms of outstanding loan principal. As of the publication of its IPO prospectus, it had established a national network of 75 branches and sub-branches in over 40 cities in China.</p><p>The company facilitates loans by connecting micro-and small-enterprise (MSEs) owners with its funding partners. MSEs refer to both individual business owners and registered micro-and small-enterprises with annual revenue of less than RMB20 million.</p><p>Its primary targets borrower segment is MSE owners who own real properties in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in China. CNF originated home equity loans for 12,983 and 23,705 borrowers in 2016 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of 82.6%. Furthermore, it believes that its target borrowers are underserved by traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions often impose stringent and inflexible loan application requirements designed for large corporations, making it difficult for MSE owners to meet such requirements.</p><p>The loans it facilitates are primarily funded through a trust lending model with its trust company partners. The trust company partners are well-established with sufficient funding sources and have licenses to engage in lending business nationwide. Also, its trust company partners are regulated by CBIRC and all the trust plans are registered with the CBIRC. This structure provides it with stable funding sources. Under the trust lending model, its trust company partners set up trust plans and acquire funding from their investors.</p><p>CNF says it has a rigorous and robust risk management system with a risk mitigation mechanism that is embedded into the design of its loan products, supported by an integrated online and offline process focusing on risks of both borrowers and collateral and further enhanced by effective post-loan management procedures. Additionally, its home equity loan products are typically installment loans which require monthly payments comprising principal and interests repayments. The company monitors borrowers' credit status, which enables it to take actions quickly if it believes there is a risk of default.</p><p>Financials</p><p>In its IPO prospectus, the company provides some preliminary results for 3Q18. The company's loan origination volume decreased from RMB3.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to RMB2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2018, representing a decrease of approximately 27.7%. CNF's outstanding loan principal amount remained relatively stable at RMB17.7 billion as of September 30, 2018.</p><p>Of some concern, its delinquency ratio and NPL ratio increased from 11.5% and 1.8% as of June 30, 2018 to 12.1% and 1.9% as of September 30, 2018, respectively. Consequentially, the performance of certain financial metrics, such as net income, has also been adversely affected by the lower loan origination volume. Its net income decreased by 2.7% to RMB234.9 million (US$35.5 million) in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a growth rate of 22.6% from RMB196.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to RMB241.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018.</p><p>In the prospectus, CNF noted that macroeconomic uncertainties had negatively impacted its results. Consequently, the company has been strategically balancing its business growth and loan quality. In particular, it has proactively strengthened risk assessment on loans for its trust company partners, which had resulted in a more selective loan approval process and lower LTV ratio.</p><p>10:19 ET</p><p>Michael Kors sinks to 52-week low after mixed bag quarter, disappointing comp outlook:</p><p>Luxury fashion brand Michael Kors (KORS 49.55, -7.90, -13.8%) cracked fresh 52-week lows today in reaction to the company's underwhelming third quarter and full year comparable sales expectations.</p><p>In short, management's expectation for full year reported comparable store sales down in the low single digits, primarily driven by an unfavorable currency impact, and guidance for third quarter comparable store sales on a reported basis declining in the low single digits weren't up to snuff. Management's full year guidance is a cut from prior expectations for flat comparable store sales.</p><p>Despite the lowered comp outlook for the year Michael Kors modestly upped its profit guidance as the company is now looking for FY2019 earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $4.95-5.05, up from the prior $4.90-5.00 expectation, owing to the better than expected Q2 operating performance. The total revenue outlook remained unchanged at approximately $5.125 billion on slightly higher guidance for operating margin to of about 18.2% vs 18.0% prior.</p><p>For Q3 then, Michael Kors sees worth than expected total revenue of approximately $1.46 billion, including approximately $165 million of incremental revenue from Jimmy Choo. The company expects Q3 retail revenue for Michael Kors to grow in the low single digits. As mentioned, Michael Kors expects comparable store sales on a reported basis to decline in the low single digits, primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact. Wholesale revenue is expected to decrease in the high single digits, and licensing revenue to decline in the mid-teens. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 20.8%. Michael Kors also outlined worse than expected guidance for Q3 EPS in the range of $1.52-1.57, which includes approximately $0.04 to $0.06 of accretion from Jimmy Choo.</p><p>Swinging back to the current quarter's report then, Michael Kors announced better than expected Q2 EPS of $1.27 on revenue growth of 9.3% to $1.25 billion on adjusted gross margin growth of 80 basis points to 61.0%. Inventory for the Michael Kors brand at September 29, 2018 was $619.7 million, an 11% decrease as compared to the prior year. Management stated that inventory levels were a bit lean in the quarter and anticipates getting into a better inventory position toward the end of Q3.</p><p>Q2 Michael Kors Retail revenue was approximately flat at $643.9 million on comparable store sales which fell 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, comparable store sales decreased 1.3%. Michael Kors Wholesale revenue declined 1.3% to $457.8 million compared to the prior year. Michael Kors Licensing revenue decreased 6.8% to $35.4 million compared to the prior year.</p><p>Results in Europe were weak in the quarter. Specifically in Europe, Michael Kors' sales declined double digits for the quarter in line with the company's plans to decrease inventory and drive higher full-price sell-through. Europe retail comp store sales declined in the mid-single digits, which was better than expected. Wholesale revenues in Europe declined double digits in the quarter. To put itself in a better position on Europe Michael Kors is inching closer to closing its deal to buy Versace, which the company announced on September 25, and is now slated for a Q4 close.</p><p>After opening 14.9% lower shares of KORS sank to down 17.4% at their worst levels, though now modestly pare those losses. Still, the stock made a fresh 52-week low during the session and has extended its YTD decline to about 21.5% with today's move lower. Technically KORS is forming a death cross today, when the shorter term moving average crosses below the longer term, a chart pattern the stock hasn't seen since October of 2016.</p><p>10:03 ET</p><p>Five9 up sharply on Q3 results; a play on market still in early innings of growth:</p><p>Five9 (FIVN) is trading sharply higher today (+13%) after reporting Q3 results last night. Since you're probably not familiar, Five9 is a provider of cloud software for contact centers. FIVN's Virtual Contact Center (VCC) cloud platform enables clients to seamlessly engage with their customers through voice, video, website, mobile, chat, email, click-to-call, callback, social and messaging.</p><p>FIVN sees a big opportunity as cloud penetration of the contact center market in North America is just 10-15% but it's growing rapidly. Companies typically refresh their contact center systems every 8-10 years, which provides an opportunity for cloud providers to replace legacy on-premise systems when these replacement decisions arise.</p><p>Turning to the Q3 results, non-GAAP EPS jumped 350% YoY to $0.18 from just $0.04 a year ago. The $0.18 was well above prior guidance of $0.13-0.14. Revenue rose 30.3% year/year to $65.3 mln, which was slightly below prior guidance of $65.8-66.8 mln. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 19.6%, a big improvement from 10.3% last year. In terms of guidance for Q4, FIVN expects non-GAAP EPS of $0.13-0.14 and revenue of $65.8-66.8 mln. Both are slightly above market expectations.</p><p>That 30% revenue growth was the fastest for FIVN since it went public in 2014. The strong growth is being driven by its Enterprise business, which makes up 76% of LTM revenue. Its Commercial business, which represents the other 24%, saw growth of 10% YoY. Recurring revenue again accounted for 93% of revenue while the other 7% was from Professional Services.</p><p>Moving upstream to bigger, enterprise customers has been a key focus for FIVN. Enterprise customers tend to be larger deals and have healthy renewal rates. Also, it provides a high degree of recurring and thus predictable revenue for FIVN. Enterprise subscription revenue is FIVN's fastest growing and most profitable part of its business. It seems the company is making good progress in terms of building up the enterprise segment.</p><p>In sum, this was another good quarter for FIVN and it sounds like more growth lies ahead. The bigger picture to remember here is that this market is still in the early days of a massive shift to the cloud. What strikes us is that Q3 feels like an acceleration of growth. We have been following FIVN for years, since its IPO. It always struck us as a small but steady grower. And now it feels like it's stepping on the gas, becoming a large player in this burgeoning market.</p><p>It's probably not a coincidence that FIVN seems to be stepping on the gas, just months after it hired a new CEO. Earlier this year, Rowan Trollope took the reins. He was formerly SVP &amp; General Manager of Cisco's (CSCO) Applications Group. The new CEO seems like a good fit, it's always good to see someone come over from a big tech company like Cisco in this case. It shows that he sees good potential here and it seems he has been instrumental in perhaps taking FIVN to the next level.</p><p>08:50 ET</p><p>Delphi Technologies Tracks Lower Start After Mixed Quarter and Cautious Earnings Guidance:</p><p>Delphi Technologies (DLPH 20.00, -1.67) has surrendered 7.7% in pre-market after reporting mixed quarterly results and issuing disappointing guidance. The pre-market weakness has sent the stock to a fresh low for the year, extending its year-to-date decline to 61.8%. Keep in mind that Delphi Technologies was spun off from Delphi Automotive in December 2017. Prior to the spin-off, Delphi Technologies was known as the Powertrain Systems segment of Delphi Automotive.</p><p>The manufacturer of technology solutions for the automotive industry reported below-consensus third quarter earnings of $0.72 per share on a 3.8% year-over-year decline in revenue to $1.16 billion, which was ahead of estimates.</p><p>Going forward, Delphi expects that earnings for the fiscal year will be between $4.20 per share and $4.30 per share, which is below market expectations. However, the midpoint of the company's revenue guidance for sales between $4.85 billion and $4.90 billion is essentially in-line with market expectations. In addition, the company noted it expects that revenue growth during fiscal 2019 will be between 1.0% and 2.0%.</p><p>Delphi Technologies interim CEO Hari Nair said that the while the company faced a challenging environment in China during the third quarter, the company's Power Electronics technology has seen strong revenue growth so far in 2018.</p><p>Delphi's revenue decline was mostly due to currency headwinds. On an adjusted basis, Powertrain Systems revenue fell 2.0% while Delphi Technologies Aftermarket revenue declined 1.0%. Adjusted revenue growth was recorded in all geographies, except for Asia, where sales declined 13.0%. Sales in Europe, North America, and South America increased 5.0%, 3.0%, and 15.0%, respectively.</p><p>Adjusted operating income margin weakened to 9.3% from 12.2% one year ago due to an unfavorable product mix and costs related with becoming a stand-alone public company. Interest expense grew to $20 million in the third quarter from $1 million one year ago due to payments related to $1.55 billion of debt that was added during 2017 due to the company's separation from Delphi Automotive.</p><p>08:02 ET</p><p>Strong quarter and Special dividend offset by soft fourth quarter outlook for Match:</p><p>Match (MTCH) is trading 8% lower premarket after the company reported strong third quarter results but issued downside guidance for the fourth quarter yesterday afternoon.</p><p>Third quarter revenue grew 29% to $444 million vs. $430-440 million guidance. Average Subscribers increased 23% to 8.1 million as average revenue per user grew 6% to $0.57.</p><p>Strong results continue to be driven by Tinder, which added 344K paid subscribers during the quarter. Match had said subscriber additions would be similar to the second quarter, when the company added 299K subs. Tinder paid subs are up 61% year-over-year to 4.11 million.</p><p>As a result, third quarter EBITDA grew 38% to $165 million versus $160-165 million guidance. The company has exceeded EBITDA guidance seven quarters in a row.</p><p>Despite guiding fiscal 2018 results toward the high end of its prior range, guidance for the fourth quarter was just below estimates. The company cited foreign exchange, indirect (advertising) softness due to GDPR (European data privacy regulation) and lower impressions on the top-line. Meanwhile, the company forecasted marketing spend up 20% due to major marketing campaigns at Tinder, Pairs and the recently acquired Hinge, as well as higher litigation expense.</p><p>Match also announced a $2/share special cash dividend, funded by cash on hand. Free Cash Flow increased 94% to $404 million through the first nine months of the year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company will continue to look for compelling acquisition targets in the online dating space.</p><p>Management will host a call at 8:30 this morning. The Tinder subscriber outlook and any commentary on next year will be important.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-330734891</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNS-8141-DYRK-93SR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3574\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Briefing.com, Inc.

It could be argued that TWLO delivered its best quarter as a publicly traded company, as revenue growth also accelerated to its highest levels since its June 2016 IPO. As a result, the stock is soaring higher today, up more than 30% to new all-time highs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Background</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before diving into its quarterly results, we wanted to provide a little background on the company itself. TWLO owns and operates a platform that develops APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable customers' software developers to add voice communications, text messaging, video, and now email, thanks to its October 15 acquisition of SendGrid, into their software applications.</p><p>Its two largest customers are Uber and Whatsapp, accounting for 6% and 4% of total revenue, respectively. When using Uber, for example, TWLO provides the technology within that app that allows you to communicate with the driver. As another example, when you make a dinner reservation using OpenTable, and you receive a text confirmation saying that your table is ready, that is also powered by TWLO.</p><p>3Q18 Review</p><p>Now, circling back to its Q3 results, TWLO posted EPS of $0.07, beating analysts' expectations by $0.05, with revenue surging by 68% to $168.9 million, easily topping the $151.6 million consensus. But, what's perhaps the most impressive is that revenue growth actually improved from last quarter's 54% mark. In fact, revenue growth has been trending higher over the past few quarters, going from 40.5% in 4Q17, to 47.8% in 1Q18, then 54.1% last quarter, and finally 68.0% this quarter. This is extremely rare for a high-growth tech IPO. Typically when a company goes public, it has already -- or is nearing -- the height of its growth curve.</p><p>Driving the strong growth was a 32% jump in Total Active Customer to 61,153. During the quarter, TWLO announced the general availability of its new \"Flex\" product, which is a contact center application platform. It describes the product this way: \"Flex combines the scalability and reliability of our cloud platform with the ability to programmatically customize every element of the contact center experience.\"</p><p>Demand for Flex was solid as it signed a number of deals in the quarter. Most notably, Uber competitor Lyft - which is already a TWLO customer - added Flex to bolster its customer support capabilities. Additionally, TWLO added high growth cloud software Medallia to their customer base.</p><p>The addition of these two new deals, along with other significant wins in the financial services sector, pushed its dollar-base net expansion rate to a robust 145%, up sharply from 122% in the year ago quarter.</p><p>Another positive was that gross margin came in at 55%, which is above its recent performance over the past several quarters. With the surge in topline growth, and the improved gross margin, TWLO generated Non-GAAP operating income of $4.3 million, compared to an operating loss of ($7.7) million in 3Q17.</p><p>That said, during the earnings call last night, management did comment that its focus right now is not to maximize gross margin, but, rather, it is on growing the business. Therefore, investors should expect some volatility around gross margin. For example, starting in 1Q19, Verizon will be creating a new service which will tack on a $0.0025 for each person-to-person text, for each business with Application to Person messaging services. TWLO estimates that this will negatively impact its gross margin by about 100 basis points on a quarterly basis, when it goes into effect in February.</p><p>Outlook &amp; Conclusion</p><p>Turing to its guidance, TWLO is forecasting Q4 EPS of $0.03-$0.04 vs. the $0.02 consensus, on revenue of $183-$185 million versus the $160.6 million consensus. At the mid-point, this would represent year/year growth of 60%, fairly consistent with its Q3 performance. In addition to the aforementioned SendGrid acquisition, and the successful launch of its Flex product, the company is also expecting artificial intelligence to provide another growth catalyst for the company. TWLO recently announced its first machine learning product, \"Understand\", and at this year's SIGNAL conference, it also launched \"AutoPilot\", the next evolution of Understand, with a natural language understanding engine, a conversational application platform and an omni-channel hub.</p><p>To conclude, TWLO is clearly hitting on all cylinders right now, and it has established itself as one of the premier growth names in the technology space. With a 1-year forward P/S of about 11.5x, the stock certainly isn't cheap. But, the stock also deserves a premium valuation due to its superior growth rates and growth potential.</p><p>All in all, there was very little complain about in regards to TWLO's performance and the underlying momentum in the stock suggests more happy days ahead for TWLO investors.</p><p>10:37 ET</p><p>CNF Finance, a China-based Home Equity Loan Provider, Prices IPO at Low End of Expectations: While the stock market has been in recovery mode over the past week, which has consequently improved underlying conditions for IPOs, China-based CNF Finance (CNF) still had a difficult time garnering a lot of demand for its IPO. Specifically, its 6.5 million ADS IPO priced at $7.50, at the low end of the $7.50-$8.50 expected price range. In all, the deal generated about $49 million in total gross proceeds.</p><p>In addition to some lingering angst about the stock market in general, investor sentiment has been rather sour on Chinese IPOs, with the trade wars and slowing economy there working against them. For instance, on October 19, Niu Technologies (NIU) was forced to decrease its deal size while its IPO also priced at the low end of expectations. Before that, Qutoutiao (QTT) also had to cut back on its deal size and its IPO also priced at the low end of expectations. A few other examples of Chinese IPOs generating weak demand in 111, Inc. (YI), and X Financial (XYF).</p><p>Furthermore, from a company specific standpoint, CNF's financial performance is highly correlated to the economic health and growth in China. As we discuss in more detail below, its most recent financial results reflect a macroeconomic slowdown in China and growing uncertainties about conditions going forward.</p><p>As for the IPO, it was led by Roth Capital Markets and Shenwan Hongyuan Securities. The stock is now open for trading on the NYSE, currently lower by about 2%.</p><p>Company Overview</p><p>CNF is a home equity loan service provider in China. In fact, according to industry research reports, it is the second largest home equity loan service provider among non-traditional financial institutions in China in terms of outstanding loan principal. As of the publication of its IPO prospectus, it had established a national network of 75 branches and sub-branches in over 40 cities in China.</p><p>The company facilitates loans by connecting micro-and small-enterprise (MSEs) owners with its funding partners. MSEs refer to both individual business owners and registered micro-and small-enterprises with annual revenue of less than RMB20 million.</p><p>Its primary targets borrower segment is MSE owners who own real properties in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in China. CNF originated home equity loans for 12,983 and 23,705 borrowers in 2016 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of 82.6%. Furthermore, it believes that its target borrowers are underserved by traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions often impose stringent and inflexible loan application requirements designed for large corporations, making it difficult for MSE owners to meet such requirements.</p><p>The loans it facilitates are primarily funded through a trust lending model with its trust company partners. The trust company partners are well-established with sufficient funding sources and have licenses to engage in lending business nationwide. Also, its trust company partners are regulated by CBIRC and all the trust plans are registered with the CBIRC. This structure provides it with stable funding sources. Under the trust lending model, its trust company partners set up trust plans and acquire funding from their investors.</p><p>CNF says it has a rigorous and robust risk management system with a risk mitigation mechanism that is embedded into the design of its loan products, supported by an integrated online and offline process focusing on risks of both borrowers and collateral and further enhanced by effective post-loan management procedures. Additionally, its home equity loan products are typically installment loans which require monthly payments comprising principal and interests repayments. The company monitors borrowers' credit status, which enables it to take actions quickly if it believes there is a risk of default.</p><p>Financials</p><p>In its IPO prospectus, the company provides some preliminary results for 3Q18. The company's loan origination volume decreased from RMB3.6 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to RMB2.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2018, representing a decrease of approximately 27.7%. CNF's outstanding loan principal amount remained relatively stable at RMB17.7 billion as of September 30, 2018.</p><p>Of some concern, its delinquency ratio and NPL ratio increased from 11.5% and 1.8% as of June 30, 2018 to 12.1% and 1.9% as of September 30, 2018, respectively. Consequentially, the performance of certain financial metrics, such as net income, has also been adversely affected by the lower loan origination volume. Its net income decreased by 2.7% to RMB234.9 million (US$35.5 million) in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a growth rate of 22.6% from RMB196.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 to RMB241.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018.</p><p>In the prospectus, CNF noted that macroeconomic uncertainties had negatively impacted its results. Consequently, the company has been strategically balancing its business growth and loan quality. In particular, it has proactively strengthened risk assessment on loans for its trust company partners, which had resulted in a more selective loan approval process and lower LTV ratio.</p><p>10:19 ET</p><p>Michael Kors sinks to 52-week low after mixed bag quarter, disappointing comp outlook:</p><p>Luxury fashion brand Michael Kors (KORS 49.55, -7.90, -13.8%) cracked fresh 52-week lows today in reaction to the company's underwhelming third quarter and full year comparable sales expectations.</p><p>In short, management's expectation for full year reported comparable store sales down in the low single digits, primarily driven by an unfavorable currency impact, and guidance for third quarter comparable store sales on a reported basis declining in the low single digits weren't up to snuff. Management's full year guidance is a cut from prior expectations for flat comparable store sales.</p><p>Despite the lowered comp outlook for the year Michael Kors modestly upped its profit guidance as the company is now looking for FY2019 earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $4.95-5.05, up from the prior $4.90-5.00 expectation, owing to the better than expected Q2 operating performance. The total revenue outlook remained unchanged at approximately $5.125 billion on slightly higher guidance for operating margin to of about 18.2% vs 18.0% prior.</p><p>For Q3 then, Michael Kors sees worth than expected total revenue of approximately $1.46 billion, including approximately $165 million of incremental revenue from Jimmy Choo. The company expects Q3 retail revenue for Michael Kors to grow in the low single digits. As mentioned, Michael Kors expects comparable store sales on a reported basis to decline in the low single digits, primarily due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact. Wholesale revenue is expected to decrease in the high single digits, and licensing revenue to decline in the mid-teens. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 20.8%. Michael Kors also outlined worse than expected guidance for Q3 EPS in the range of $1.52-1.57, which includes approximately $0.04 to $0.06 of accretion from Jimmy Choo.</p><p>Swinging back to the current quarter's report then, Michael Kors announced better than expected Q2 EPS of $1.27 on revenue growth of 9.3% to $1.25 billion on adjusted gross margin growth of 80 basis points to 61.0%. Inventory for the Michael Kors brand at September 29, 2018 was $619.7 million, an 11% decrease as compared to the prior year. Management stated that inventory levels were a bit lean in the quarter and anticipates getting into a better inventory position toward the end of Q3.</p><p>Q2 Michael Kors Retail revenue was approximately flat at $643.9 million on comparable store sales which fell 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, comparable store sales decreased 1.3%. Michael Kors Wholesale revenue declined 1.3% to $457.8 million compared to the prior year. Michael Kors Licensing revenue decreased 6.8% to $35.4 million compared to the prior year.</p><p>Results in Europe were weak in the quarter. Specifically in Europe, Michael Kors' sales declined double digits for the quarter in line with the company's plans to decrease inventory and drive higher full-price sell-through. Europe retail comp store sales declined in the mid-single digits, which was better than expected. Wholesale revenues in Europe declined double digits in the quarter. To put itself in a better position on Europe Michael Kors is inching closer to closing its deal to buy Versace, which the company announced on September 25, and is now slated for a Q4 close.</p><p>After opening 14.9% lower shares of KORS sank to down 17.4% at their worst levels, though now modestly pare those losses. Still, the stock made a fresh 52-week low during the session and has extended its YTD decline to about 21.5% with today's move lower. Technically KORS is forming a death cross today, when the shorter term moving average crosses below the longer term, a chart pattern the stock hasn't seen since October of 2016.</p><p>10:03 ET</p><p>Five9 up sharply on Q3 results; a play on market still in early innings of growth:</p><p>Five9 (FIVN) is trading sharply higher today (+13%) after reporting Q3 results last night. Since you're probably not familiar, Five9 is a provider of cloud software for contact centers. FIVN's Virtual Contact Center (VCC) cloud platform enables clients to seamlessly engage with their customers through voice, video, website, mobile, chat, email, click-to-call, callback, social and messaging.</p><p>FIVN sees a big opportunity as cloud penetration of the contact center market in North America is just 10-15% but it's growing rapidly. Companies typically refresh their contact center systems every 8-10 years, which provides an opportunity for cloud providers to replace legacy on-premise systems when these replacement decisions arise.</p><p>Turning to the Q3 results, non-GAAP EPS jumped 350% YoY to $0.18 from just $0.04 a year ago. The $0.18 was well above prior guidance of $0.13-0.14. Revenue rose 30.3% year/year to $65.3 mln, which was slightly below prior guidance of $65.8-66.8 mln. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 19.6%, a big improvement from 10.3% last year. In terms of guidance for Q4, FIVN expects non-GAAP EPS of $0.13-0.14 and revenue of $65.8-66.8 mln. Both are slightly above market expectations.</p><p>That 30% revenue growth was the fastest for FIVN since it went public in 2014. The strong growth is being driven by its Enterprise business, which makes up 76% of LTM revenue. Its Commercial business, which represents the other 24%, saw growth of 10% YoY. Recurring revenue again accounted for 93% of revenue while the other 7% was from Professional Services.</p><p>Moving upstream to bigger, enterprise customers has been a key focus for FIVN. Enterprise customers tend to be larger deals and have healthy renewal rates. Also, it provides a high degree of recurring and thus predictable revenue for FIVN. Enterprise subscription revenue is FIVN's fastest growing and most profitable part of its business. It seems the company is making good progress in terms of building up the enterprise segment.</p><p>In sum, this was another good quarter for FIVN and it sounds like more growth lies ahead. The bigger picture to remember here is that this market is still in the early days of a massive shift to the cloud. What strikes us is that Q3 feels like an acceleration of growth. We have been following FIVN for years, since its IPO. It always struck us as a small but steady grower. And now it feels like it's stepping on the gas, becoming a large player in this burgeoning market.</p><p>It's probably not a coincidence that FIVN seems to be stepping on the gas, just months after it hired a new CEO. Earlier this year, Rowan Trollope took the reins. He was formerly SVP &amp; General Manager of Cisco's (CSCO) Applications Group. The new CEO seems like a good fit, it's always good to see someone come over from a big tech company like Cisco in this case. It shows that he sees good potential here and it seems he has been instrumental in perhaps taking FIVN to the next level.</p><p>08:50 ET</p><p>Delphi Technologies Tracks Lower Start After Mixed Quarter and Cautious Earnings Guidance:</p><p>Delphi Technologies (DLPH 20.00, -1.67) has surrendered 7.7% in pre-market after reporting mixed quarterly results and issuing disappointing guidance. The pre-market weakness has sent the stock to a fresh low for the year, extending its year-to-date decline to 61.8%. Keep in mind that Delphi Technologies was spun off from Delphi Automotive in December 2017. Prior to the spin-off, Delphi Technologies was known as the Powertrain Systems segment of Delphi Automotive.</p><p>The manufacturer of technology solutions for the automotive industry reported below-consensus third quarter earnings of $0.72 per share on a 3.8% year-over-year decline in revenue to $1.16 billion, which was ahead of estimates.</p><p>Going forward, Delphi expects that earnings for the fiscal year will be between $4.20 per share and $4.30 per share, which is below market expectations. However, the midpoint of the company's revenue guidance for sales between $4.85 billion and $4.90 billion is essentially in-line with market expectations. In addition, the company noted it expects that revenue growth during fiscal 2019 will be between 1.0% and 2.0%.</p><p>Delphi Technologies interim CEO Hari Nair said that the while the company faced a challenging environment in China during the third quarter, the company's Power Electronics technology has seen strong revenue growth so far in 2018.</p><p>Delphi's revenue decline was mostly due to currency headwinds. On an adjusted basis, Powertrain Systems revenue fell 2.0% while Delphi Technologies Aftermarket revenue declined 1.0%. Adjusted revenue growth was recorded in all geographies, except for Asia, where sales declined 13.0%. Sales in Europe, North America, and South America increased 5.0%, 3.0%, and 15.0%, respectively.</p><p>Adjusted operating income margin weakened to 9.3% from 12.2% one year ago due to an unfavorable product mix and costs related with becoming a stand-alone public company. Interest expense grew to $20 million in the third quarter from $1 million one year ago due to payments related to $1.55 billion of debt that was added during 2017 due to the company's separation from Delphi Automotive.</p><p>08:02 ET</p><p>Strong quarter and Special dividend offset by soft fourth quarter outlook for Match:</p><p>Match (MTCH) is trading 8% lower premarket after the company reported strong third quarter results but issued downside guidance for the fourth quarter yesterday afternoon.</p><p>Third quarter revenue grew 29% to $444 million vs. $430-440 million guidance. Average Subscribers increased 23% to 8.1 million as average revenue per user grew 6% to $0.57.</p><p>Strong results continue to be driven by Tinder, which added 344K paid subscribers during the quarter. Match had said subscriber additions would be similar to the second quarter, when the company added 299K subs. Tinder paid subs are up 61% year-over-year to 4.11 million.</p><p>As a result, third quarter EBITDA grew 38% to $165 million versus $160-165 million guidance. The company has exceeded EBITDA guidance seven quarters in a row.</p><p>Despite guiding fiscal 2018 results toward the high end of its prior range, guidance for the fourth quarter was just below estimates. The company cited foreign exchange, indirect (advertising) softness due to GDPR (European data privacy regulation) and lower impressions on the top-line. Meanwhile, the company forecasted marketing spend up 20% due to major marketing campaigns at Tinder, Pairs and the recently acquired Hinge, as well as higher litigation expense.</p><p>Match also announced a $2/share special cash dividend, funded by cash on hand. Free Cash Flow increased 94% to $404 million through the first nine months of the year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company will continue to look for compelling acquisition targets in the online dating space.</p><p>Management will host a call at 8:30 this morning. The Tinder subscriber outlook and any commentary on next year will be important.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-330734891</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNS-7YP1-DYRK-934G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3574\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Briefing.com, Inc.
